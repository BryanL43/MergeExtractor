Dear
Fellow Stockholders: 

    I
am pleased to be writing to you about the proposed combination of NetZero, Inc. and Juno Online Services, Inc. under our newly formed holding company, United
Online, Inc. This proposed combination will bring together two leaders in the value segment of the Internet access market. We believe this will create one of the largest Internet service
providers, or ISPs, in the nation, based on the number of active subscribers during June 2001. Both companies have built widely recognized consumer brands that we will continue to leverage as we
strive to grow our subscriber base. We believe that the large existing base of free subscribers represents a valuable resource from which United Online can continue to build its pay subscriber base. 

    Importantly,
NetZero and Juno each bring distinct strengths to the relationship that are expected to generate significant synergies, resulting in increased financial strength and many
operating efficiencies. Operating efficiencies are expected to be gained in part through facilities and workforce rationalization, reduction in telecommunications costs, merger of back-end
technologies and consolidation of billing systems, marketing activities and product development. 

    We
believe that combining NetZero's and Juno's businesses will result in a stronger, more efficient and better capitalized company. As a single entity, we expect United Online to be a
major force in the value segment of the Internet access market and to provide greater long-term value for the stockholders of both companies. 

    NetZero's
board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and urges you to submit your proxy in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. I urge you to carefully
read this entire document because it contains important information about the proposed combination. 

    United
Online expects its common stock will be listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "UNTD." United Online has registered up to 40.3 million shares of its
common stock in connection with the combination. If the combination is completed, you will receive 0.2000 of a share of
United Online's common stock for each share of NetZero common stock you own. This exchange ratio is fixed in the merger agreement. 

    Your
vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please vote as soon as possible to make sure your
shares are represented at the special meeting. 

Very
truly yours, 

Mark R. Goldston

Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGERS    

Q:
What will I receive in the mergers?

A:
The
merger agreement fixes the consideration to stockholders of NetZero and Juno in the mergers:


NetZero
common stockholders will receive 0.2000 of a share of United Online common stock for each share of NetZero common stock they own; and


Juno
common stockholders will receive 0.3570 of a share of United Online common stock for each share of Juno common stock they own. 

Changes
in the trading prices of NetZero's common stock and Juno's common stock will have no effect on the number of shares of United Online common stock you will receive in the mergers. However, the
value of the shares of our common stock you receive may go up or down as the market price of NetZero common stock or Juno common stock goes up or down. 

There is no assurance that the trading price of United Online's common stock will have a direct correlation with the trading price of either Juno's or NetZero's common stock. However, assuming that
United Online's stock trades based on NetZero's common stock price as of August 16, 2001 and after giving effect to the exchange ratios in the merger:


each
share of United Online common stock would trade at $3.20,


the
value of a share of NetZero common stock would be $0.64 (0.2000 multiplied by $3.20), compared with $0.64 (the closing price on August 16,
2001), and


the
value of a share of Juno common stock would be $1.14 (0.3570 multiplied by $3.20), compared with $1.03 (the closing price on August 16, 2001).

This
represents a premium of approximately 10% for Juno stockholders. As of the date the merger agreement was signed, the premium to Juno stockholders was approximately 15%.

Q:
What do I need to do now?

A:
After
carefully reading and considering the information contained in this document, please respond by completing, signing and dating your proxy card or voting instructions and
returning it in the enclosed postage paid envelope, or, if available, by submitting your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet, as soon as possible so that your shares may
be represented at your special meeting. 

If
your shares are held in "street name" by your broker, you should follow the directions provided by your broker. Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how you would
like to vote your shares. 

Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates now?

A:
No.
After the mergers are completed, you will receive written instructions from the exchange agent on how to exchange your stock certificates for shares of United Online. Please do
NOT send in your stock certificates with your proxy.

Q:
Where will my shares of United Online common stock be listed?

A:
United
Online expects to have its common stock listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "UNTD."

Q:
What will happen to my stock options or restricted stock?

A:
NetZero.
  When the mergers are completed, each outstanding NetZero employee stock option will be assumed by United
Online and will be converted into an option to purchase that number of shares of United Online common stock equal to the product of 0.2000 multiplied by the number of shares of NetZero common stock
underlying the option. The exercise prices 

iii

will
be adjusted accordingly. In addition, each outstanding restricted share of NetZero common stock will be converted into 0.2000 of a share of United Online common stock. 

Juno.
  When the mergers are completed, each outstanding Juno stock option will be assumed by United Online and will be converted into an
option to purchase that number of shares of United Online common stock equal to the product of 0.3570 multiplied by the number of shares of Juno common stock underlying the option. The exercise prices
will be adjusted accordingly. 

Q:
When do you expect the mergers to be completed?

A:
We
anticipate completing the mergers immediately after both the NetZero stockholders and the Juno stockholders have adopted the merger agreement at their respective meetings which
we anticipate will be held in September 2001.

Q:
Who can help answer my questions?

A:

you have any questions about the mergers or how to submit your proxy, or if you need additional copies of this document or the enclosed proxy card or voting instructions, you
should contact:

Upon completion of the mergers, NetZero and Juno will become our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our business will be the combined businesses currently conducted by NetZero and Juno. You should not

NetZero, Inc.

2555 Townsgate Road

Westlake Village, California 91361

(805) 418-2000

http://www.netzero.com 

    NetZero
is a leading provider of Internet access services. NetZero offers consumers free and pay access to the Internet, e-mail and customizable navigation tools. Its
services are currently available in more than 5,000 cities across the United States and Canada. In addition to offering consumers access to the Internet, NetZero offers mass marketers the ability to
deliver their messages through several online advertising channels to select users based on demographic information, interests and Web sites visited. NetZero also offers advertisers and commerce
partners a variety of additional online advertising products to build their brands and market their products. NetZero's CyberTarget division offers marketers and advertisers mass-scale
online market research and measurement services. NetZero was incorporated in July 1997 and launched its Internet access service in October 1998. You should not consider the information
on NetZero's Web site to be part of this document. 

    Effective October 1, 2001, NetZero intends to reduce the number of hours per month from 40 to 10 that a household can use its free service and eliminating the free service from
markets where telecommunications costs make the offering cost prohibitive.

Juno Online Services, Inc.

1540 Broadway, 27th Floor

New York, New York 10036

(212) 597-9000

http://www.juno.com

    Juno is a leading provider of Internet access to millions of computer users throughout the United States. Juno provides multiple levels of service, including free basic dial-up
access and various billable premium Internet access services. Juno offers both free basic and billable premium services, and it believes it is unique in having converted hundreds of thousands of
individuals from free to paying customers. Juno's strategy of offering several different service levels and its easy-to-use, intuitive software is designed to attract a broad
spectrum of users, including those who are just now beginning to explore the Internet.

    Juno's services are provided nationwide through more than 4,000 local telephone numbers, which Juno leases from several providers. These phone numbers can be reached by the vast
majority of the U.S. population without having to place a long distance telephone call. Juno derives its revenues primarily from the subscription fees it charges for the use of its premium services,
and to a lesser extent from the sale of advertising and from various forms of electronic commerce. You should not consider the information on Juno's Web site to be part of this document.

The Mergers (see page   )  

    To accomplish the combination of NetZero and Juno, NetZero formed a new company, United Online, with two subsidiaries, NZ Acquisition Corp. and JO Acquisition
Corp. At the time the mergers are completed: 


NZ
Acquisition Corp. will be merged into NetZero, and NetZero will be the surviving corporation; and 

JO
Acquisition Corp. will be merged into Juno, and Juno will be the surviving corporation. 

As
a result, NetZero and Juno will each become a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Online. 

    The implied value of the consideration to be issued to Juno's equity holders was approximately $76.8 million, based on the June 7, 2001 closing price of NetZero's common
stock.

Ownership of United Online After the Mergers

    Based on the number of shares outstanding as of August 14, 2001, after the mergers the former stockholders of NetZero common stock would own
approximately 25.2 million shares, or 62.8%, of United Online, and the former stockholders of Juno would own approximately 14.9 million shares, or 37.2%, of United Online.

The Boards of Directors Recommend That You Vote for the Mergers (see page   )  

    To NetZero Stockholders:
  NetZero's board of directors believes that the transaction is fair to NetZero's stockholders
and in their best interests, and has unanimously voted to approve the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that NetZero's stockholders vote FOR the adoption of the merger agreement. 

    To Juno Stockholders:
  Juno's board of directors believes that the transaction is fair to Juno's stockholders and in
their best interests, and has unanimously voted to approve the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that Juno's stockholders vote FOR the adoption of the merger agreement.

The Mergers Are Generally Expected to Be Tax Free (see page   )  

    We have structured the mergers so that NetZero, Juno and their stockholders who exchange their shares for shares of United Online capital stock will not
recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes in connection with the mergers, except for taxes payable because of cash received instead of fractional shares. 

    You
should carefully read the disclosure beginning at page   and consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular tax consequences of the mergers to you. 

The Financial Advisors Have Delivered Opinions as to Fairness from a Financial Point of View (see page   )

    Opinion of NetZero's Financial Advisor:
  In deciding to approve the transaction, the NetZero board of directors
considered the opinion of its financial advisor, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, that, as of the date of its opinion, and subject to and based on the assumptions and considerations
referred to in its opinion, the ratio of the exchange ratio for Juno common stock to the exchange ratio for NetZero common stock pursuant to the merger agreement is fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of shares of NetZero common stock. The full text of this opinion is attached as Annex B to this document. NetZero urges its stockholders to read Morgan Stanley's opinion
carefully in its entirety. Morgan Stanley received a $600,000 fee for acting as NetZero's financial advisor.

    Opinion of Juno's Financial Advisor.
  In deciding to approve the transaction, the Juno board of directors considered the
opinion of its financial advisor, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc., that, as of the date of its opinion, and subject to and based on the assumptions and considerations referred to in its opinion,
the 0.3570 ratio at which shares of Juno common stock convert into shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Juno common
stock. The full text of this opinion is attached as Annex C to this document. Juno urges its stockholders to read Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's opinion carefully in its entirety.

Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown received a $500,000 fee and will be entitled to an additional $350,000 if the mergers are completed for acting as Juno's financial advisor.

NetZero Management Will Manage United Online Following the Mergers (see page   )

    Our officers and directors will be the same persons who are the officers and directors of NetZero immediately before the mergers are completed. However,
NetZero's four founders, Ronald T. Burr, NetZero's former president; Stacy A. Haitsuka, NetZero's former senior vice president of technology; Harold McKenzie, NetZero's former vice president of
software; and Marwan Zebian, NetZero's former vice president of networking and communications, recently resigned from NetZero to found a new, non-competitive company and they will not be a part of
NetZero's or United Online's management following the mergers.

    None of the officers or directors of Juno will be officers or directors of United Online following the mergers. Some members of Juno's senior management, including Charles Ardai,
Juno's president and chief executive officer, and Harshan Bhangdia, Juno's senior vice president and chief financial officer, will no longer be employed by Juno or United Online following the mergers.
However, we anticipate that some other members of Juno's management will continue their employment with Juno following the mergers.

    NetZero's and Juno's directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately 32% and 33% of their respective company's outstanding shares as of July 31, 2001.

Special Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers (see page   )

    Some of the directors and executive officers of NetZero and Juno have interests in the mergers that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of
their company's stockholders.

    NetZero.
  These interests include the potential for positions as our directors or executive officers and the right to
continued indemnification and insurance coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the mergers.

    Juno.
  These interests include the right to severance payments in cash, the right to consulting fees, the right to
acceleration of vesting of stock options and the right to indemnification and insurance coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the mergers. Upon consummation of the mergers, Juno's

president and chief executive officer and Juno's senior vice president and chief financial officer will be terminated and will be entitled to receive severance payments equal to 125% and 75%,
respectively, of their respective base salary and guaranteed bonus amounts and all of their unvested options will vest in full. In addition, they will receive payments equal to 125% and 100%,
respectively, of their respective base salary and guaranteed bonus amounts in exchange for agreements not to compete with Juno's business following the mergers.

Some of NetZero's and Juno's Insiders Signed Voting Agreements (see page   )

    NetZero.
  NetZero entered into voting agreements with David E. Shaw, several entities affiliated with Dr. Shaw,
and several directors and senior officers of Juno, which require these Juno stockholders to vote substantially all their shares of Juno common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.
As of the record date, these stockholders owned shares representing approximately 31% of the voting power of Juno capital stock entitled to vote at the Juno special meeting.

    Juno.
  Juno entered into a voting agreement with three of the executive officers of NetZero and five of the major
stockholders of NetZero, which require these NetZero stockholders to vote substantially all their shares of NetZero common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. As of the record
date, these stockholders owned shares representing approximately 41% of the voting power of NetZero capital stock entitled to vote at the NetZero special meeting.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page   )  

    NetZero and Juno can jointly agree to terminate the merger agreement at any time. Either party may also terminate the merger agreement if: 


the
mergers are not completed on or before November 30, 2001, so long as the failure to complete the mergers is not the result of the failure by
that company to fulfill any of its obligations under the merger agreement; 

government
actions do not permit the completion of the mergers; 

either
company's stockholders do not vote to adopt the merger agreement at a duly held meeting of that company's stockholders; or 

the
other company breaches its representations, warranties or covenants in the merger agreement in a material way. 

    NetZero
may terminate the merger agreement if Juno's board of directors fails to recommend adoption of the merger agreement or effects a change in its recommendation of the merger
agreement, or if Juno fails to call a 

stockholder meeting or solicit proxies in order to approve the mergers. 

    Juno
may terminate the merger agreement if Juno's board of directors decides to accept a superior proposal from a third party so long as Juno has given NetZero three business days
notice and NetZero has not given Juno a non-revocable binding offer that Juno's board determines in good faith to be more favorable than the third party superior proposal and Juno has paid
NetZero the termination fee. 

Termination Fees and Expenses (see page   )  

    The merger agreement provides that, in several circumstances, Juno may be required to pay a $2.5 million termination fee to NetZero. Each party also may
be required to reimburse the other party's expenses, up to $1.0 million. 

"No Solicitation" Provision (see page   )  

    The merger agreement contains detailed provisions prohibiting Juno from seeking an alternative takeover proposal. 

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Completion of the Mergers (see page   )  

    Under U.S. antitrust laws, we may not complete the mergers until we, NetZero and Juno have notified the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the
Federal Trade Commission of the mergers and have filed the necessary report forms, and until a required waiting period has ended. The waiting period under U.S. antitrust laws expired on
July 23, 2001. 

Accounting Treatment (see page   )  

    We intend to account for the mergers under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations. NetZero will be the acquiror for financial reporting
purposes.

UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE INFORMATION    

    We present below per share data regarding the income and book value of NetZero and Juno on both a historical and a per share equivalent unaudited pro forma
basis. We derived the unaudited pro forma consolidated per share information from our unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. You should read the
information below in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes of NetZero and Juno and with the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
document. The NetZero and Juno equivalent pro forma per share data are calculated by multiplying the United Online per share amounts by the respective NetZero and Juno exchange ratios to United
Online's common stock.

RISK FACTORS    

Before you vote for adoption of the merger agreement and as a result of voting make a decision to exchange your shares of NetZero or
Juno common stock for shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this
document, including the section entitled "Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to us or that we believe are now immaterial may also impair our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results
of operations could be materially adversely affected, the value of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.

Risks Associated with the Mergers    

There are many conditions to the completion of the mergers and we cannot assure you that the mergers will be completed.  

    There are many conditions to NetZero's and Juno's obligations to complete the mergers. Many of these conditions, including the receipt of stockholder approval
by NetZero and Juno, the listing of our shares on the Nasdaq National Market and the absence of material adverse changes in NetZero's and Juno's businesses, are beyond our, NetZero's or Juno's
control. Although this document may speak as though the mergers will be consummated, you should realize that those statements anticipate the completion of the mergers on the terms of the merger
agreement. We cannot assure you that the mergers will be completed. 

Fluctuations in market prices may cause the value of the shares of our common stock that you receive to be less than the value of your shares of NetZero stock or Juno stock.  

    Upon completion of the mergers, all shares of NetZero common stock and Juno common stock will be converted into shares of our common stock. The ratios at which
the shares will be converted are fixed, and there will be no adjustment for changes in the market price of either NetZero common stock or Juno common stock. Any change in the price of either NetZero
common stock or Juno common stock
will affect the value Juno stockholders and NetZero stockholders will receive in connection with the mergers. Both NetZero common stock and Juno common stock have historically experienced significant
price volatility, and the value of the shares of our common stock you receive may go up or down as the market price of NetZero common stock or Juno common stock goes up or down. Stock price changes
may result from a variety of factors that are beyond the control of NetZero and Juno, including changes in their businesses, operations and prospects, regulatory considerations and general market and
economic conditions. No party is permitted to "walk away" from the mergers or resolicit the vote of its stockholders solely because of changes in the market price of any party's common stock. 

    The
prices of NetZero common stock and Juno common stock at the closing of the mergers may vary from their respective prices on the date of this document and on the dates of the
special meetings. Because the date the mergers are completed may be later than the dates of the special meetings, the prices of NetZero common stock and Juno common stock on the dates of the special
meetings may not be indicative of their respective prices on the date the mergers are completed. 

We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the mergers.  

    The success of the mergers will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies from combining the businesses of NetZero and Juno. To
realize the anticipated benefits of this 

combination, members of our management team must develop strategies and implement a business plan that, in addition to addressing the risks discussed elsewhere in this document, will:


successfully
integrate each company's organizations, operations, technologies, services and customer bases;


integrate
and retain advertising customers, vendors, personnel and subscribers from both companies;


successfully
manage telecommunications contracts to efficiently benefit Juno's and NetZero's services;


reduce
the costs associated with each company's operations; and


successfully
market both companies' services.

    If we cannot achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the mergers may not be realized. In particular, the anticipated cost and other synergies may not materialize, which
would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and harm the market price of shares of our common stock.

Officers and directors of NetZero and Juno have potential conflicts of interest in recommending that you vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement.  

    A number of executive officers and directors of NetZero and Juno who recommend that you vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement may receive
benefits from the mergers which may make their interests in the mergers different from yours. Specifically:


the
executive officers and directors of NetZero have the potential for continued employment and/or membership on our board,


Mr. Charles
Ardai, Juno's chief executive officer, and Mr. Harshan Bhangdia, Juno's senior vice president and chief financial officer, are
expected to receive guaranteed payments and accelerated vesting of options after completion of the mergers,


non-employee
directors of Juno hold options that will become immediately vested upon a change in control,


Juno
entered into facility leases with entities affiliated with David E. Shaw, chairman of the board of directors of Juno, and


we
will provide Dr. Shaw and affiliates of some of the directors of NetZero with registration rights. 

    These
potential benefits may influence these executive officers and directors of NetZero and Juno in making their recommendation that you vote in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement. 

Costs associated with the mergers.  

    We anticipate incurring substantial costs in connection with the mergers and the integration of Juno's and NetZero's operations. Anticipated costs include
severance pay for employees; accounting, legal and investment banking fees; restructuring fees associated with duplicate facilities, contract amendments or terminations; and a variety of other
expenses associated with the closing of the transaction or the integration of the companies. While costs are estimated to be $20 million to $25 million, there can be no assurance that
actual costs will not exceed estimated amounts. NetZero's and Juno's combined cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, including restricted cash, as of June 30, 2001 were
approximately $177 million. These merger costs will significantly impact our cash resources.

Risks Associated with Our Operations Which Will Not Be Reduced in the Mergers    

We cannot predict our success because our business model is unproven and changing.  

    Juno began offering Internet services in April 1996 and NetZero began offering Internet services in October 1998. Each company has made
significant changes to its business model to address changes in the market as well as other factors. We expect to make additional changes to each company's business model in the future, including
consolidating future billable services under the Juno brand and free services under the NetZero brand, as well as instituting additional limitations on our free service offering. These factors make it
difficult to evaluate or predict our performance. We cannot assure you that our current business model will be successful, that we will not make significant changes to our model or that any changes we
make to our model will be successful.

NetZero and Juno have a history of losses and we expect additional losses; our stock price could fall as a result of future losses and negative cash flow.  

    Both NetZero and Juno have a history of losses and there is no assurance that we will ever become profitable. NetZero has incurred net losses of approximately
$312.4 million from its inception in July 1997 through June 30, 2001, including a net loss of approximately $42.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2001.
Juno has incurred net losses of approximately $291.6 million from its inception in June 1995 through June 30, 2001, including a net loss of approximately $2.6 million in
the three months ended June 30, 2001. We will be continuing the businesses of both NetZero and Juno and expect the net losses of these subsidiaries to continue. Although our strategy is to
increase revenues and maximize

the profitability of both companies, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in doing so, or that we will achieve profitability. We may never be successful in implementing our business
strategies or in addressing the risks and uncertainties facing our company. Even if we do implement these strategies and address these risks successfully, our business may never become cashflow
positive or profitable. Were we to achieve profitability for any particular period, we cannot assure you that we would be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis
thereafter. If we fail to achieve and maintain profitability, the market price for our common stock would suffer.

Our business is subject to fluctuations which may negatively impact the price of our common stock.  

    Juno's and NetZero's revenues, expenses and operating results have varied in the past and ours may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of
factors, including, without limitation, fluctuations in our pay and free user base, changes in our business model and service offerings, changes in the market for Internet advertising, the effect of
material contracts with advertisers and vendors and fluctuations in marketing and telecommunications expenses. In addition, our operating expenses are based on our expectations of our future revenues
and are relatively fixed in the short term. We cannot assure you that the expectations or projections made by either NetZero's management or Juno's management will be achieved by us. For example,
although Juno currently projects that its net loss for the entire second half of 2001 will total less than $2.0 million, we cannot assure you that losses will not be greater. Furthermore, we
may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any revenue shortfall, which may cause our business and financial results to suffer.

    Due
to all of the above factors and the other risks discussed in this section, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of
operations as an indication of future performance. It is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In this
event, the price of our common stock is likely to fall. 

Our market share and revenues will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively with established and new providers of Internet access services.  

    Competition for users of Internet access services is intense. We compete for users with providers of free Internet access services; established online service
and content providers, such as AOL Time Warner, CompuServe and The Microsoft Network; independent national Internet service providers, such as EarthLink and Prodigy; and national
long-distance carriers, such as AT&T WorldNet, Verizon and MCI WorldCom. We also compete with local telephone companies and regional and local commercial Internet service providers.

    We also face competition from companies that provide broadband Internet access. Juno provides broadband services only on a limited scale and is not currently offering such services to
new users. NetZero provides no broadband services. It is uncertain whether we will expand this product offering in the near term, if ever. Our failure to develop and implement a broadband strategy
will adversely impact our ability to compete for new users.

    We expect competition to continue to intensify. Many of our competitors have significantly greater resources and enjoy larger marketing budgets, more advanced features and services
and lower cost structures that may allow them to profitably offer competing services at a lower price. While many of our competitors price their standard services above our standard offering price,
there are other competitors with lower pricing and there is no assurance that we will be price competitive.

    There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete. Our inability to effectively compete could require us to make significant revisions to our strategies and business
model, and would likely result in increased costs, decreased revenues and the loss of users, all of which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial position and results of
operations.

Proposed restrictions on NetZero's free service offerings may result in significant reductions in NetZero's free user base.  

    NetZero intends, effective on October 1, 2001, to implement additional restrictions on its free service, including reducing the number of hours per
month from 40 to 10 that a household can use the free service and eliminating the free service offering from certain areas where telecommunications costs make the offering cost prohibitive. During the
month of June 2001, approximately 30% of NetZero's active users accessed its free service for more than 10 hours although, due to multiple users within many households, a significantly greater number
of users may be impacted by the 10 hour limit. Approximately 8% of NetZero's active users accessed its free service solely from dial-up numbers in areas that will no longer be available to free users
after October 1, 2001. NetZero intends to continue to offer billable services in the areas where it discontinues its free service. As a result of these measures, NetZero anticipates a
significant decline in its free user base and expects a decrease in the number of new free users registering for its service. There is no assurance that these measures will not be modified or that
they will be implemented as planned.

    While
NetZero believes that these measures will result in an increase in pay users, there is no assurance that such an increase will occur or be meaningful. Although these measures
are designed to reduce telecommunications expenses, there is no assurance that the anticipated cost reductions will be realized. These measures may adversely impact NetZero's reputation as a provider
of free services and make it more difficult to recruit new free users. Since a portion of our strategy is to increase our pay user base by converting free users to pay users, decreases in our free
user base may adversely impact this strategy in the long-term. There can be no assurance that these measures will not adversely impact our business. 

If we are unable to grow our pay user base, we may not be able to generate revenues, decrease per-hour telecommunications costs or implement our strategy.  

    Growth in our pay user base will be critical to our future success. Increasing our pay user base involves two components: converting our free service users to
our pay service and gaining new pay users who have not previously used our free service. In each of these cases, we are competing directly with other pay service offerings and there is no assurance we
will achieve success in signing up new pay users. The average cost to acquire a pay subscriber in our industry is significantly higher than we anticipate spending, and there is no assurance that we
will be able to acquire new pay users at a reasonable acquisition cost. If we experience decreases in our pay user base, our business, results of operations and financial position will be adversely
impacted.

    We are relying increasingly on the migration of free users to pay users as a major source of subscribers to our pay services. Since July 1998, Juno has advertised to its free
users encouraging them to upgrade and NetZero initiated a similar campaign in March 2001. There is a risk that repeated exposure to their advertisements may cause their effectiveness to
decline. Furthermore, to the extent that our number of active free subscribers declines, we will have a smaller pool of free subscribers to solicit, further reducing the absolute number of potential
migrations to our pay services. The rate at which users of the free service upgrade to our pay services has from time to time declined and may continue to decline, which would adversely impact our
ability to retain or grow our pay user base.

If we are unable to retain subscribers, our business and financial results will suffer.  

    Our business and financial results are dependent on the number of subscribers to our services. Our number of active subscribers has a significant impact on our
ability to attract advertisers, the number of advertising impressions we have available to sell, and on how many billable service subscribers we can potentially acquire by soliciting users of our free
service. Each month, a significant number of Juno's and NetZero's billable and free service subscribers cancel their service or become inactive and the vast majority of both Juno's and NetZero's
registered users are not actively using their services. This is due to competition, the imposition of limitations on free services, changes in pricing plans and other factors. In addition, there may
be significant overlap between NetZero's and Juno's user base, so the actual combined user base may be less than anticipated.

    We anticipate further significant reductions in our free user base if we implement additional restrictions on our free services. We may also in the future make additional changes to
the terms or prices of our billable services, which may result in additional billable subscriber attrition. If these or other factors result in the loss of a significant number of subscribers, our
business and financial results will suffer. There is no assurance that we will be able to effectively retain subscribers or generate enough new subscribers to make up for lost subscribers.

Federal Trade Commission action could impact our financial results and marketing practices.  

    The FTC has been investigating the advertising, billing and cancellation practices of various Internet-related companies, including Juno. As a result of this
investigation, Juno and the FTC entered into a consent agreement, which was approved by the FTC on June 29, 2001, after a public comment period. The consent agreement provides for specific
disclosures or notices regarding, among other things, the cost of its Internet access services, its cancellation terms, local versus long-distance charges and the possibility of redress payments, as
well as the requirement to provide adequate customer support to process subscriber cancellations. Juno's management currently anticipates that the compensatory payments pursuant to the agreement will
be, and has accrued a liability for, approximately $800,000, although actual compensatory payments may be greater. There can be no certainty as to what impact the FTC order, or any other action that
may be taken by the FTC, will have on our business.

If we fail to generate significant revenues and derive a profit from our pay services, we may not be able to support our operations.

    Our ability to generate significant revenues from our pay services will be critical to our future success. Generating pay revenues includes both increasing our
pay user base as well as maintaining or increasing our pricing. Juno has offered a variety of pricing programs and has, in certain cases, increased the pricing to certain users based on their usage.
Juno's monthly prices have ranged from $4.95 to $29.95. A significant number of users who have experienced price increases have discontinued their service, which adversely impacts revenues.

    Our
ability to offer a value priced pay service will be adversely impacted if subscribers to our pay service use the Internet excessively. We price our standard offering based on the
expectation that users will access the Internet for only a limited number of hours each month. If the average monthly usage for our pay subscribers exceeds our expectations, or if our average hourly
telecommunications cost increases, we may not be able to operate our value priced pay service profitably. We may have to impose hourly limits on our pay services or increase our standard pricing,
either of which could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain users to our pay services or compete effectively. 

If we fail to generate sufficient advertising revenues, we may not be able to support our operations.  

    Advertising revenues are intended to be an important component of our strategy and revenue base going forward. Our revenues from advertising have, from time to
time, decreased from quarter to

quarter due to a variety of factors, including the deterioration of the online advertising market and the decrease in capital available to Internet companies. We have experienced a number of
situations where our advertising arrangements are terminated early, are not renewed, are renewed at significantly lower rates or are repriced during the term of the arrangement. Our success may depend
on our ability to effectively target users based on demographic and other information. We may encounter technical, legal and other limitations on this ability.

    Competition for Internet-based advertising revenues is intense and the demand for advertising space has been declining. These and other factors are causing Internet advertising rates
to decline, and it is possible that rates will continue to decline in the future. Many of our advertising competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger user bases,
significantly greater financial, technical, sales, development and marketing resources and more established relationships with advertisers than we do. We must also compete with television, radio,
cable and print media for a share of advertisers' total advertising budgets. Advertisers may be reluctant to devote a significant portion of their advertising budget to Internet advertising if they
perceive the Internet to be a limited or ineffective advertising medium.

    In light of these factors, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or grow advertising revenues.

If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions into our operations, then we may not realize the benefits associated with such acquisitions and our financial condition
and results of operations may be adversely affected.  

    We may acquire other companies or undertake other business combinations that can complement our current or planned business activities. We are currently
evaluating the possibility of acquiring and integrating additional Internet service providers offering pay services. Acquisitions may not be available at the times or on terms acceptable to us, or at
all. In addition, acquiring a business involves many risks, including: 


disruption
of our ongoing business and diversion of resources and management time;


unforeseen
obligations or liabilities; 


difficulty
assimilating the acquired operations and personnel;


risks
of entering markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience;


potential
impairment of relationships with employees or users as a result of changes in management; and


potential
dilutive issuances of equity, large and immediate write-offs, the incurrence of debt, and amortization of goodwill or other
intangible assets. 

    There
can be no assurance that we will make any further acquisitions, that we will be able to obtain additional financing for such acquisitions, if necessary, or that any acquisitions
will be successful. 

We may not realize the benefits associated with our intangible assets.  

    We also may not realize the benefits associated with our intangible assets, including those associated with acquisitions. For example, as of
December 31, 2000, NetZero had approximately $55.0 million in intangible assets recorded on its balance sheet, which primarily included goodwill and acquired technologies associated with
acquisitions. During the quarter ended March 31, 2001, NetZero determined the carrying value of these assets was impaired using the discounted cash flow method and the market comparison method.
An impairment charge relating to goodwill, intangible assets and other assets totaling approximately $48.6 million was recorded during the quarter, reflecting the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeded their respective fair values. The impairment consisted of approximately $33.5 million for goodwill and approximately $15.1 million for other acquired
intangible assets and other assets. There can be no assurance that we will not experience similar impairment losses in the future. Any such loss could adversely and materially impact our results of
operations and financial condition. 

The provision of full Internet access for free creates substantial risks.  

    We face numerous costs, operational and legal risks, and other uncertainties associated with our provision of free Internet access to consumers. These risks
include risks that our paying subscribers will cancel their subscription and switch to our free service and risks that the number of hours our free service users use, and the costs of providing the
service, will not decrease, and may increase.

    If the number of our subscribers who remain on, or return to, the free service is significant, our business and financial results may suffer. As users of the service spend more time
connected, the costs we incur to provide the service increase. If aggregate hours of connection time associated with our free services increase or do not continue to decline, our business and
financial results may suffer.

We may not be able to grow or retain our user base if we are unsuccessful in maintaining our brands and marketing our services.

    If we are unsuccessful in maintaining and continuing to market the NetZero and Juno brands, we may not be able to grow or retain our user base. Promotion of
our brands will depend on our success in providing high-quality Internet products and services. If our users and advertisers do not perceive our existing products and services as high
quality, or if we introduce new products or services or enter into new business ventures that are not favorably received by our users and advertisers, then we may be unsuccessful in building brand
recognition and brand loyalty in the marketplace.

    We expect that we will reduce our marketing expenditures in the near term. Any marketing activities we do engage in may be insufficient to increase or maintain the size of our
subscriber base and may be insufficient to develop or maintain awareness of our services. Juno and NetZero have relied on a variety of cash intensive subscriber acquisition activities in the past,
including the

distribution of CDs, the acquisition of competitors, fee-based referral agreements and extensive advertising. These activities may be curtailed in the future, although there is no assurance that
subscriber acquisition costs will decrease. If we incur costs in implementing marketing campaigns without generating sufficient new subscribers to our services, or if capital limitations or other
factors prevent us from implementing marketing campaigns, or if marketing campaigns undertaken by competitors cause attrition in our subscriber base, our business and financial results will suffer.

Our revenues would significantly decrease if we lose key marketing and advertising relationships.  

    We have entered into a number of strategic marketing alliances with third parties. The number of terminations or nonrenewals of various types of advertising
contracts by our partners has increased. In particular, Internet companies have scaled back the resources devoted to advertising. In light of the concentration of our advertisers within the Internet
industry, we expect that we will continue to experience a significant number of terminations or nonrenewals in the future.

    A small number of customers have accounted for, and may in the future account for, a significant portion of each of NetZero's and Juno's advertising and commerce revenues. Each of
NetZero and Juno have previously experienced reductions in revenues from material customers. For example, LookSmart, General Motors and Cisco have been material customers of NetZero. The LookSmart
agreement was terminated in January 2001, and the Cisco agreement will terminate effective August 2001. NetZero was not able to replace the LookSmart agreement with a comparable arrangement and does
not expect to replace the Cisco agreement with a comparable arrangement. While the relationship with General Motors Corporation is long-term, they were recently provided reductions in their
advertising obligations and may be provided additional reductions in the future. While we do not currently anticipate such reductions will be material to our business, we can give no assurance that we
will continue to derive the amount of anticipated revenues from General Motors.

    The termination or renegotiation of significant agreements, as well as the timing of orders under such agreements, has caused, and may in the future cause, significant fluctuations in
our quarterly results. Our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected if we are unable either to maintain or renew our significant agreements or
to replace such agreements with similar agreements with new customers.

Our business is dependent on a small number of telecommunications carriers and our inability to maintain agreements at attractive rates with such carriers may negatively impact
our business.  

    Our business substantially depends on the capacity, affordability, reliability and security of our telecommunications networks. Only a small number of
telecommunications providers offer the network services we require. Several vendors have experienced significant financial difficulties and may be unable to perform satisfactorily. Certain of our
telecommunications services are provided pursuant to short-term agreements that the providers can terminate or elect not to renew. In addition, each of our telecommunications carriers
provides network access to some of our competitors, and could choose to grant those competitors preferential network access or pricing. Many of our telecommunications providers compete, or have
announced an intention to compete, with us in the market to provide consumer Internet access. As a result, any or all of our current telecommunications service providers could discontinue providing us
with service at rates acceptable to us, or at all.

    Our margins are highly sensitive to variations in prices for the telecommunications services we purchase. Our business could be harmed if minimum connection charges increase or become
more

prevalent. In addition, the availability and pricing of telecommunications services varies geographically, and we may not be able to obtain new or substitute telecommunications services in certain
geographic areas on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.

Our business will suffer if the scope or quality of service from our telecommunications carriers is inadequate.  

    If
our third-party telecommunications service providers deliver unacceptable service, the quality of our Internet access service would suffer. In this event, we would likely lose
users who are dissatisfied with our service. Since we do not have direct control over our telecommunications carriers' network reliability and the quality of their service, there can be no assurance
that we will be able to provide consistently reliable Internet access for our users. 

    We do not offer Internet access in all areas. Many potential subscribers may be unable to access our services through a point of presence that is within their local calling area.
These subscribers may be particularly reluctant to use our service to access the Web, either through our free service or through a billable service, due to the telecommunications charges that they
would incur. We cannot be sure if or when additional infrastructure developments by our telecommunications providers will establish points of presence that cover these areas at costs acceptable to us.

If we fail to manage our telecommunications or our internal network capacities, our service levels may suffer or we may experience increased per-user costs.  

    We will have to accurately anticipate our future telecommunications capacity needs within lead-time requirements. If we fail to procure sufficient
quantities of telecommunications services, we may be unable to provide our users with acceptable service levels. We also run the risk of purchasing excessive amounts of telecommunications services. In
that event, we would be required to bear the costs of excess telecommunications capacity without commensurate increases in revenues or subscriber usage. NetZero and Juno have recently experienced
decreases in telecommunications usage in excess of the amounts anticipated when entering into certain agreements for telecommunications services. This has resulted in significant excess capacity in
the near term, which may result in increased costs per user on an hourly basis if we are not able to implement the synergies contemplated by the mergers. Our failure to effectively manage
telecommunications costs would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flow.

    In addition, we may from time to time experience increases in our telecommunications usage, which exceed our then-available telecommunications capacity and the capacity of
our internal servers. As a result, users may be unable to register or log on to our service, may experience a general slow-down in their Internet access or may be disconnected from their
sessions. Excessive user demand could also result in system failures of our internal server networks, which would prevent us from generating advertising revenues. Inaccessibility, interruptions or
other limitations on the ability to access our service due to excessive user demand, or any failure of our servers to handle user traffic, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and
our revenues.

We may not successfully develop and market new products in a timely or cost-effective manner; our new products may not be accepted by consumers or advertisers.  

    We may not be able to compete effectively if we are not able to adapt to changes in technology and industry standards, and to develop and introduce new and
enhanced products and service offerings. New products may be dependent on our obtaining needed technology from third parties. We also believe that our ability to compete successfully will also depend
upon the continued compatibility of our services with products offered by various vendors.

    If we are unable to respond in a timely manner to technological advances, we may not be able to compete effectively for users, which could cause our revenues to decrease. We have
expended, and may in the future expend, significant resources developing and implementing new products. Product development involves a number of uncertainties, including unanticipated delays and
expenses. New products may have technological problems or may not be accepted by our users or advertisers. Several of the new products we have offered, or intend to offer, are intended to generate
additional revenues for us. There is no assurance that such products will provide us with any meaningful revenue. In particular, the expansion of a broadband service offering, including a cable
offering, could result in significant expenses without a commensurate increase in revenues.

We may not be able to compete effectively if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights.

    If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights, we may not be able to compete effectively. We principally rely upon patent, copyright, trade secret and
contract laws to protect our proprietary technology. We cannot be certain that we have taken adequate steps to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently
develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies. In addition, since we provide our Internet access software for free, we are extremely susceptible to various
forms of unauthorized use of our software. These actions could adversely affect our brand names. 

    In
addition, both Juno and NetZero have engaged in lawsuits and expended significant resources attempting to enforce their proprietary rights. NetZero filed suits against several
competitors, including Juno, to enforce its rights in a patent covering online advertising through a separate banner window. The suit against Juno will be dismissed upon consummation of the mergers
and the suits against other parties were dismissed without prejudice. Juno filed a suit against NetZero and QUALCOMM Incorporated to enforce its rights in a patent relating to its e-mail technology.
This suit will also be dismissed upon consummation of the mergers. We may attempt to enforce our proprietary rights in the future which could result in significant costs without a corresponding
economic or competitive benefit. 

We may incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources if we are accused of infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.  

    Third parties may assert claims against us for infringement of their proprietary rights and these claims may be successful. In addition, a number of
third-party owners of patents have claimed to hold patents that cover various forms of online transactions or online technology. As with other online service providers, patent claims could be asserted
against us based upon our services or technologies. NetZero
and Juno have had claims asserted against them in the past although they do not believe that any claims to date are material to their businesses. 

    We
could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in the defense of any claims relating to proprietary rights. Parties making these claims could secure a judgment
awarding substantial damages as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to use our products in the United States or abroad. If a third party asserts a
claim relating to proprietary technology or information against us, we may seek licenses to the intellectual property from the third party. We cannot be certain, however, that third parties will
extend licenses to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we fail to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights, it could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate our
business. 

A security breach, virus or inappropriate use by Internet users could disrupt our service.  

    The future success of our business will depend on the security of our network and, in part, on the security of the network infrastructures of our third-party
telecommunications service providers. In addition, the sending of "spam" through our network could result in third parties asserting claims

against us. Unauthorized or inappropriate access to our computer systems, including by current or former employees, could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information, including
credit card information, and that could cause losses to us or our users. Users or third parties may also potentially expose us to liability by "identity theft." Users or others may assert claims of
liability against us as a result of any failure by us to prevent these network malfunctions and security breaches. Although we intend to use industry-standard security measures, such measures have
been circumvented in the past, and we cannot assure you that these measures will not be circumvented in the future. We also cannot assure you that the security measures of our third-party network
providers, providers of billing or customer services or other vendors will be adequate. In addition to potential legal liability as a result of computer viruses or other inappropriate uses or security
breaches, we may have to interrupt, delay, or temporarily cease service to our users, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and could also result in increased user turnover.

If our software or hardware contains errors, or if we encounter difficulties integrating our systems and technologies, our business could be seriously harmed.  

    The software and hardware used to operate and provide our services is complex and may contain undetected errors or failures. We have in the past encountered,
and may in the future encounter, errors in the software or hardware used to operate our business and provide our services. This has resulted in,

and may in the future result in, a number of adverse consequences, which have included or may include:


users
being disconnected from our service or being unable to access our service;


loss
of data or revenue;


injury
to reputation; and


diversion
of development resources. 

    We have experienced some technical and customer support issues associated with our products and software releases. These issues have resulted in users discontinuing our service and
have adversely impacted our revenues. A number of NetZero's and Juno's material technologies and systems, including their software client systems, billing systems, ad-serving technologies and customer
relationship management systems, are based on different platforms or are sourced from different vendors. To the extent we attempt to integrate these technologies and systems, we may experience a
number of difficulties, errors, failures and unanticipated costs. In addition, virtually every aspect of NetZero's internal operations is dependent upon software provided by Oracle and any significant
failure of this software could materially and adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that we will not experience significant problems in the future.

We are dependent on third parties for technical and customer service support and our business may suffer if they are unable to provide these services, cannot expand to meet our
needs, or terminate their relationships with us.  

    Our business and financial results depend, in part, on the availability and quality of live technical and customer service support services. We outsource most
of these functions from ClientLogic Corporation and Convergys Corporation. As a result, we maintain only a small number of internal customer service personnel. We are not equipped to provide the
necessary range of customer service functions in the event that these companies become unable or unwilling to offer these services to us. At times, Juno's subscribers have experienced lengthy waiting
periods to reach representatives trained to provide the technical or customer support they require. Maintaining desired customer support levels may require significantly more support personnel than
are currently available to us, or significantly greater expense than we feel it is appropriate, or than we are able, to incur. If our relationship with

ClientLogic or Convergys terminates and we are unable to enter into a comparable arrangement with a replacement vendor, if our current vendors are unable to provide the quality and quantity of service
required, or if we are unable to develop internally the additional customer service and technical support capacity we expect to need, our business and financial results will suffer.

We are dependent on third party vendors and software to accurately bill subscribers to our various pay services.  

    The operation of our pay services requires the accurate operation of billing system software by us, the provision of services by third party vendors and our
development of policies designed to reduce the incidence of credit card fraud and other forms of uncollectible "chargebacks." We have experienced problems with third party billing vendors in the past.
If we encounter significant difficulties with these vendors or the operation of these systems, or if errors, defects or malfunctions occur in the operation of these systems, this could result in
erroneous overcharges to customers or in the under-collection of revenue, either of which could hurt our business and financial results. 

We cannot predict our future capital needs and we may not be able to secure additional financing.  

    Because we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future, we may need to raise substantial additional funds in the future to fund
our operations. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or not available when required in sufficient amounts or on acceptable
terms, we may not be able to devote sufficient cash resources to continue to provide our services in their current form, acquire additional subscribers, enhance or expand our services, respond to
competitive pressures or take advantage of perceived opportunities, and our business and financial results may suffer, or we could be forced to cease our operations entirely. In light of our
historical and expected losses, we are unlikely to be able to raise significant additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness. If additional funds are raised by our issuing debt, we may be
subject to limitations on our operations.

If we are unable to successfully defend against legal actions against us, we could face substantial liabilities.

    NetZero and Juno are currently parties to pending legal actions against them which are discussed in detail under "NetZero's BusinessLegal
Proceedings" and "Juno's BusinessLegal Proceedings." Although the pending patent lawsuits brought by NetZero and Juno against each other are expected to be dismissed following the
mergers, we are, or may become, party to other suits that could result in significant judgments against us. Defending against these lawsuits may involve significant expense and diversion of
management's attention and resources from other matters. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we may not prevail in these actions. In addition, our ongoing operations may continue to
subject us to significant litigation and costs in the future.

Our business could be shut down or severely impacted if a natural disaster occurs.

    Our computer equipment and the telecommunications infrastructure of our third-party network providers are vulnerable to damage from fire, earthquakes, power
loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events. NetZero has experienced situations where power loss and telecommunications failures have adversely impacted service, although to date such
failures have not been material to its operations. A significant portion of our computer equipment, including critical equipment dedicated to our Internet access services, is located at our
headquarters in Westlake Village and at facilities in Los Angeles and San Jose, California; Sterling, Virginia; Cambridge, Massachusetts; and Jersey City, New Jersey. A natural disaster or
other unanticipated problems at our headquarters or at a network hub, or within a third-party network provider's network, could cause interruptions in the services that we provide. Our systems are not
fully redundant. Furthermore, we do not currently have any business

disruption insurance. Any prolonged disruption of our services due to system failure could result in user turnover and decreased revenues. 

Our ability to operate our business could be seriously harmed if we lose members of our senior management team and other key employees.  

    Our business is largely dependent on the personal efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key personnel, particularly Mark Goldston our
chairman, president and chief executive officer. Any of our officers or employees can terminate his or her employment relationship at any time. The loss of these key employees or our inability to
attract or retain other qualified employees could seriously harm our business and prospects. We do not carry key man life insurance on any of our employees. NetZero's four founders recently resigned
from NetZero to found a new, non-competitive company. Each of the founders agreed to provide NetZero with consulting services through July 1, 2002. NetZero is not seeking candidates to replace
their positions.

We will not be able to grow our business if we are not able to retain or hire additional personnel.  

    Our future success also depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, editorial, merchandising, sales, marketing
and user service personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, particularly in the Internet and high technology industry. As a result, we may be unable to successfully attract, assimilate or
retain qualified personnel. In addition, the mergers may cause many employees to leave the company, many of whom may be integral to our integration efforts. If we cannot retain those employees who are
key to the integration of the businesses of NetZero and Juno, our operations and integration efforts could be adversely affected. 

    Any staff attrition we experience, whether initiated by the departing employees or by us, could place a significant strain on our managerial, operational, financial and other
resources. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and hire adequate replacement staff promptly, or at all. Both Juno and NetZero have engaged in significant staffing reductions and
it is anticipated that additional staffing reductions will take place following the mergers. These reductions may make it more difficult for us to integrate the businesses of NetZero and Juno, manage
existing, or establish new, relationships with advertisers, vendors and other parties, or to integrate, expand and improve our service offerings. Thus, our business and financial results could suffer
as a result of the staff reductions undertaken to date, those expected to be undertaken in connection with the mergers, and from any future staff reductions and attrition that might occur.

Changes in government regulation of the provision of Internet services could decrease our revenues and increase our costs.  

    Changes in the regulatory environment regarding the Internet could decrease our revenues and increase our costs. As a provider of Internet access services, we
are not currently subject to direct regulation by the Federal Communications Commission. However, some telecommunications carriers have sought to have communications over the Internet regulated by the
FCC in the same manner as other more traditional telecommunications services. Local telephone carriers have also petitioned the FCC to regulate Internet service providers in a manner similar to long
distance telephone carriers and to impose access fees on these providers and some developments suggest that they may be successful in obtaining the treatment they seek. In addition, we operate our
services throughout the United States, and regulatory authorities at the state level may seek to regulate aspects of our activities as telecommunications services. As a result, we could become subject
to FCC and state regulation as Internet services and telecommunications services converge.

Changes in, or interpretations of, laws regarding consumer protection could subject us to liability or cause us to change our practices.  

    Consumer protection laws and enforcement actions regarding advertising and user privacy, especially relating to children, are becoming more prevalent. The FTC
has conducted investigations into the privacy practices of companies that collect information about individuals on the Internet and has also investigated a variety of Internet service providers,
including Juno, in connection with marketing and disclosure practices. Various state agencies as well as individuals have also asserted claims against, or instituted inquiries into, Internet service
providers, including Juno, in connection with marketing and disclosure practices. There is no assurance that our services and business practices, or changes to our services and business practices,
will not subject us to claims and liability. The enactment of any additional laws or regulations in this area, increased enforcement activity of existing laws and

regulations, or claims by individuals could significantly impact our costs or the manner in which we conduct business, all of which could cause our business to suffer.

We could be exposed to liability for defamation, negligence and infringement.  

    Because users download and redistribute materials that are cached or replicated by us in connection with our Internet services, claims could be made against us
for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of such materials. While we have attempted to obtain safe harbor protection against
claims of copyright infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, there can be no guarantee that we will prevail in any such claims. We also could be exposed to liability because of
third-party content that may be accessible through our services, including links to Web sites maintained by our users or other third parties, or posted directly to our Web site and subsequently
retrieved by a third party through our services.

Seasonal trends in Internet usage and advertising sales may negatively affect our business.

    Seasonal trends could affect the advertising revenues we generate from operating our Internet services. To the extent that our advertising revenues depend on
the amount of usage by our users, seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage could affect our advertising revenues during these periods of fluctuation. In addition, the rate at which new users sign up
for our services may be lower during certain seasons and holiday periods. Because our operating history is so limited, it is difficult for us to accurately predict these trends and plan accordingly.
Since our operating expenses are based on our expectations of future revenues, it is possible that seasonal fluctuations could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our operating results.

Risks Related to the Market for Our Common Stock    

NetZero's and Juno's stock prices have been highly volatile; our stock price may be highly volatile and may cause limitations on the trading market for our stock.  

    The market price of NetZero's and Juno's common stock has fluctuated in the past and the market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be highly
volatile, with extreme price and volume fluctuations. The Nasdaq National Market, where most publicly held Internet companies are traded, has experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations.
These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance, and for this or other reasons we could continue to suffer
significant declines in the market price of our common stock. 

NetZero's common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market.

    NetZero received a Nasdaq staff determination on June 27, 2001 that it has not maintained compliance with Nasdaq's requirements for continued listing
because its closing bid price remained below $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days. NetZero's common stock is, therefore, subject to delisting from the Nasdaq National Market. A hearing to appeal the
determination was conducted before a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel on August 17, 2001, however the panel has not yet notified NetZero of its decision. NetZero is currently in compliance
with all other continued listing requirements. There can be no assurance, however, that the panel will grant NetZero's request for continued listing. If NetZero's common stock loses its Nasdaq
National Market status, it would most likely trade on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board maintained by Nasdaq, which is viewed by most investors as a less desirable and less liquid marketplace. In
this case NetZero's trading prices may not be quoted in newspapers, you may need to rely on your broker for all price information and there will likely be fewer shares of NetZero's stock traded
because of the "penny stock" rules applicable to brokers. This outcome would be likely to harm the price of NetZero's trading common stock.

If United Online's common stock is not approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market, the mergers could be delayed.

    We have been informed by Nasdaq that we will be treated as a successor to NetZero for purposes of listing our common stock on the Nasdaq National Market. If,
prior to closing the mergers, NetZero's common stock were to be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, we would consequently be required to submit for approval a new listing application for our
shares. Approval of a new listing application cannot be assured, and could result in a delay of the mergers. Additionally, there is a risk that, based on current trading prices, we would not be able
to satisfy the Nasdaq National Market's minimum initial listing price of $5.00 per share for newly listed companies. If that were to occur, we expect that we would ask the boards of directors of
NetZero and Juno to amend the merger agreement to adjust proportionately the exchange ratios to the extent necessary to achieve a listing price for our shares greater than $5.00 per share, even though
this might result in a substantial reduction in the number of shares of our common stock that would be outstanding following the completion of the mergers. Furthermore, if the merger agreement were
amended to change the exchange ratios, NetZero and Juno might be required to delay their stockholder meetings, and reset the record dates for those meetings.

Future sales of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.  

    Upon completion of the mergers all of the approximately 40.3 million shares in the offering will be registered under the Securities Act and available
for immediate resale, subject to volume and manner of sale limitations applicable to "affiliates" under Rule 145. Assuming that all executive officers and directors of both NetZero and Juno are
deemed affiliates, and based on the number of shares outstanding and held by them as of August 14, 2001, the record date for the special meetings, approximately
6.5 million shares, or 16% of the estimated 40.3 million shares to be registered, would not be freely transferable. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of
sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market, or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in
the future at a price that we think is appropriate, or at all.

We may issue common stock resulting in dilution to our stockholders, and the dilutive effect of these issuances would increase to the extent that our stock price declines.  

    Juno has entered into a number of relationships in which it may use its common stock to compensate third parties for services performed for Juno, including
subscriber referral services, and we may enter into additional such relationships in the future. If the price of our common stock should

decline, our electing to pay with common stock would entail issuing a relatively larger number of shares, increasing the dilutive effect on our stockholders, and potentially impairing our ability to
execute financing transactions. Additionally, the third parties to whom we issue common stock will generally have registration rights that require us to register these shares of common stock for
resale in the public markets. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of these shares in the market, or the perception that such sales could occur. If we raise
additional funds, acquire assets, or obtain goods or services through the issuance of equity securities, stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interest and the newly
issued securities may have rights superior to those of our common stock. The dilutive effect of these issuances will be increased to the extent our share price declines.

Our directors will have the ability to exercise significant influence over us.  

    Upon completion of the mergers, our executive officers, directors, and persons and entities affiliated with our executive officers or directors, are expected
to beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 20% of our outstanding common stock. As a result of this concentration of ownership, our executive officers and directors will be able to exercise
significant influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could
also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in

control of us which may adversely impact stockholders by preventing them from realizing a premium price for their stock in connection with a sale of the company.

We have anti-takeover provisions which may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us.

    Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so
might be beneficial to our stockholders because of a premium price offered by a potential acquiror. 

We do not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future and, as a result, you will need to sell your shares in order to realize a near term return on your investment.  

    Neither NetZero nor Juno has declared or paid any cash dividends on its capital stock since inception. We intend to retain any future earnings to finance the
operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders will need to sell shares of common stock in order to
realize a return on their investment, if any.

Purpose of the Special Meetings  

    The special meetings are being held so that stockholders of each of NetZero and Juno may consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
Adoption of the merger agreement will also constitute approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. 

Stockholder Record Date for the Special Meetings  

    NetZero.
  NetZero's board of directors has fixed the close of business on August 14, 2001 as the record date for
determining which NetZero stockholders are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. On the record date, there were 125,820,328 shares of NetZero common stock outstanding, held by
approximately 649 holders of record.

    Juno.
  Juno's board of directors has fixed the close of business on August 14, 2001 as the record date for
determining which Juno stockholders are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Juno special meeting. On the record date, there were 41,796,640 shares of Juno common stock outstanding, held by
approximately 474 holders of record.

Vote Required for Adoption of the Merger Agreement  

    NetZero.
  A majority of the outstanding shares of NetZero common stock must be represented, either in person or by
proxy, to constitute a quorum at the NetZero special meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of NetZero's common stock outstanding as of the record date is required to
adopt the merger agreement. At the NetZero special meeting, each share of NetZero common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters properly submitted to the NetZero stockholders. 

    Juno has entered into voting agreements with three executive officers of NetZero and five major stockholders of NetZero which require these NetZero stockholders to vote their shares
of NetZero common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. As of the record date, these stockholders owned shares representing approximately 41% of the voting power of NetZero capital
stock entitled to vote at the NetZero special meeting.

    The directors and executive officers of NetZero owned approximately 32% of the outstanding shares of NetZero common stock as of the record date, and each of them has indicated their
intention to vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement or has entered into a voting agreement with Juno as described above.

    Juno.
  A majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the Juno special meeting must be represented, either in person or
by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the Juno special meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Juno's common stock outstanding as of the record date is required to
adopt the merger agreement. At the Juno special meeting, each share of Juno common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters properly submitted to the Juno stockholders. 

    NetZero has entered into voting agreements with all five of its directors and three senior officers of Juno, and several entities affiliated with Dr. Shaw, which require these
Juno stockholders to vote their shares of Juno common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. As of the record date, these stockholders owned, or had voting power over, shares
representing approximately 31% of the Juno capital stock entitled to vote at the Juno special meeting.

Proxies  

    All shares of NetZero common stock represented by properly executed proxy cards or voting instructions received before or at the NetZero special meeting and
all shares of Juno common stock represented by properly executed proxy cards or voting instructions received before or at the Juno special meeting will, unless the proxies or voting instructions are
revoked, be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxy cards or voting instructions. If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy card or voting instruction,
the shares will be voted FOR the adoption of the merger agreement. You are urged to mark the box on the proxy card to indicate how to vote your shares. 

    If
a properly executed proxy card or voting instruction is returned and the stockholder has abstained from voting on adoption of the merger agreement, the NetZero common stock or Juno
common stock represented by the proxy or voting instruction will be considered present at the special meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, but will not be considered to have been voted on the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. 

    If
your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must instruct them on how to vote your shares. If an executed proxy card is returned by a broker or bank holding
shares which indicates that the broker or bank does not have discretionary authority to vote on adoption of the
merger agreement, the shares will be considered present at the meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, but will not be considered to have been voted on the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement. Your broker or bank will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by following the information provided to you by your broker. 

    Adoption
of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of NetZero's and Juno's common stock outstanding on the record date, as applicable.
Abstentions, failures to vote and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against adoption of the merger agreement. 

    The
special meeting of NetZero or Juno may be adjourned or postponed, including by their respective chairmen, in order to permit further solicitation of proxies. Unless you check the
withhold discretionary authority box on your proxy card or voting instruction, your proxies will have the power to vote to postpone or adjourn your special meeting even if you voted against the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. 

    You
may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted by: 


notifying
in writing


the
Secretary of NetZero, Inc. at 2555 Townsgate Road, Westlake Village, California 91361 if you are a NetZero stockholder, or 


the
Secretary of Juno Online Services, Inc. at 1540 Broadway, 27th Floor, New York, New York 10036 if you are a Juno stockholder;


granting
a subsequently dated proxy; or


appearing
in person and voting at the special meeting if you are a holder of record. 

    Your
attendance at the special meeting will not in and of itself revoke your proxy. 

Appraisal Rights  

    Under Delaware law, because the NetZero common stock and the Juno common stock remain listed on the Nasdaq National Market as of their respective record dates,
you are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the mergers. Both NetZero common stock and Juno common stock were listed on the Nasdaq National Market on August 14, 2001, the record
date for determining which NetZero and Juno stockholders are entitled to vote at the special meetings.

Solicitation of Proxies  

    NetZero and Juno will equally share the expenses incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of this document. Juno has retained MacKenzie Partners,
at an estimated cost of $5,000 plus reimbursement of expenses, to assist in the solicitation of proxies. NetZero, Juno and Juno's proxy solicitor will also request banks, brokers and other
intermediaries holding shares of NetZero or Juno common stock beneficially owned by others to send this document to, and obtain proxies from, the beneficial owners and will, upon request, reimburse
the holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, telegram and other electronic means, advertisements and personal solicitation
by the directors, officers or employees of NetZero and Juno. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or employees for those solicitation efforts. 

    You
should not send in any stock certificates with your proxy card. A transmittal letter with instructions for the surrender of stock certificates will be mailed to you as soon as
practicable after completion of the mergers. 

THE MERGERS    

Background of the Mergers  

    NetZero's senior management team followed developments in Juno's business since December 1999 when Juno began offering free Internet access services. Juno was
the only other public company with significant capital that was offering a free service similar to NetZero's service. In May 2000, NetZero's senior management team reached a consensus that an overture
towards Juno was appropriate based on equity market conditions, similarity of product offerings and potential synergies.

    In
May 2000, Mark Goldston, NetZero's chief executive officer, telephoned Charles Ardai, Juno's president and chief executive officer, and David E. Shaw, the chairman of Juno's
board of directors, to discuss the merits of a potential combination of NetZero and Juno. Through July 2000, NetZero and Juno held several informal telephonic discussions to consider the
possibility of a business combination, but no proposals resulted from those discussions. 

    In
August 2000, representatives of Juno and NetZero met at the offices of Goldman Sachs in New York to continue the discussions regarding a potential combination. In late
August 2000, Mr. Ardai and Richard Eaton, Juno's former chief financial officer and treasurer, met with Mr. Goldston, Jon Fetveit, NetZero's vice president, strategy and
development, Ronald Burr, NetZero's president, and Charles Hilliard, NetZero's chief financial officer. The discussions between the parties continued by telephone and in September 2000, NetZero
advised Juno that NetZero was not prepared to enter into a business combination at that time. 

    During
the fall of 2000, the parties remained in occasional contact to determine whether there might be interest in a combination. In January 2001, Toby Bryce, Juno's former
senior vice president of business development, met with Messrs. Hilliard and Fetveit in California to discuss the pending lawsuits between the parties and to discuss the possibility of a
business combination or strategic relationship between the parties. 

    In
January 2001, NetZero launched the NetZero Professional service, which is currently called the Extended Access Pass its first pay Internet access service. In
March 2001, NetZero launched the
NetZero Platinum service, NetZero's first monthly recurring billable subscription Internet access service. 

    In
April 2001, Mr. Goldston telephoned Dr. Shaw to once again initiate discussions concerning a possible business combination. Dr. Shaw and
Mr. Goldston agreed that their respective teams would have telephone discussions during the week of April 23, 2001, to assess the possibility of a transaction. During the week of
April 23, 2001, representatives of NetZero and Juno had conversations and began to analyze the merits of combining the two companies. 

    On
May 2, 2001, Messrs. Hilliard and Fetveit met with Mr. Ardai and Harshan Bhangdia, Juno's senior vice president and chief financial officer, at Juno's offices
in New York to continue discussions. 

    On
May 8, 2001, NetZero proposed a business combination between NetZero and Juno in the form of an all stock transaction. The proposed combination would be structured as a
merger of a subsidiary of NetZero with and into Juno, in which Juno stockholders would receive 35% of the combined company. 

    Over
the following week, NetZero and Juno discussed elements of the proposal, and the parties worked toward reaching an agreement on selected material terms. Among other terms, the
parties discussed an ownership percentage of approximately 38.5% for Juno stockholders. 

    On
May 16, 2001, NetZero and Juno entered into a three-week exclusivity agreement. 

    On
May 21, 2001 representatives of NetZero, Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP, counsel to NetZero, Morgan Stanley, financial advisor to NetZero, Juno and Simpson
Thacher & Bartlett, special 

counsel to Juno, met at the offices of Morgan Stanley in New York to discuss the proposed transaction. At this time, the parties agreed that the transaction would be structured to provide for the
establishment of a new holding company, of which both NetZero and Juno would become subsidiaries. The holding company structure was proposed to allow both the Juno and the NetZero brands and services
to continue to exist while creating a new corporate identity. Following that meeting, representatives of NetZero continued their due diligence effort and, during the evening of May 21, 2001,
Brobeck delivered a first draft of the merger agreement and related documents. 

    On
May 24 and May 25, 2001, representatives of Juno and Simpson Thacher conducted due diligence with respect to NetZero in Westlake Village, California. 

    Over
the following days, due diligence continued and the parties negotiated the terms of the merger agreement and related documents. 

    On
June 4, 2001, Juno's board of directors held a meeting at Simpson Thacher's offices. Negotiation of the merger agreement continued after that meeting and on June 5,
2001. 

    During
the afternoon of June 5, 2001, NetZero's board of directors met telephonically and received presentations from NetZero's senior management team, representatives of
Morgan Stanley and representatives of Brobeck. After deliberation, NetZero's board of directors adopted resolutions with respect to the proposed transaction. See "Recommendation of NetZero's Board of
Directors." 

    During
the evening of June 5, 2001, Juno's board of directors met and received presentations from Juno's senior management, representatives of Simpson Thacher and
representatives of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. At that meeting, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown rendered its oral opinion to the Juno board of directors as to the fairness to Juno stockholders from a
financial point of view of the exchange ratio of shares of our common stock for each share of Juno common stock. After deliberation, Juno's board of directors adopted resolutions with respect to the
proposed transactions. See "Recommendation of Juno's Board of Directors." 

    Negotiation
of the merger agreement and related documents continued on June 6, 2001 and June 7, 2001. On the afternoon of June 7, 2001, Juno's board of directors held a
meeting at which representatives of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown reaffirmed its opinion as to the fairness of the exchange ratio for Juno common stock, from a financial point of view, to Juno's
stockholders, and Juno's board of directors reaffirmed its earlier approval of the proposed transaction. 

    After
the closing of the Nasdaq National Market on June 7, 2001, the parties executed and delivered the merger agreement and issued a press release announcing the proposed
transaction. 

NetZero's Reasons for the Mergers  

    From time to time beginning May 2000, NetZero's management team informally updated members of NetZero's board of directors with respect to of the status
of discussions with Juno and the reasons that NetZero's management team believed the combination had the potential to deliver value to NetZero's stockholders. At a meeting on June 5, 2001,
NetZero's board of directors received presentations from members of NetZero's management team, Morgan Stanley and Brobeck. NetZero's management team highlighted its belief in the transaction as well
as some of the risks associated with the mergers, including many of the issues described under "Risk Factors." NetZero's board of directors made a business judgment concerning the potential of the
combined company and the following are the
material reasons that NetZero's board recommends that NetZero's stockholders vote, at the NetZero special meeting, in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. 

    Accelerate Growth in Pay Internet Access Business.
  Beginning in early 2001, NetZero began supplementing its revenues by
offering pay Internet access services. Until early 2001, NetZero had no experience in the pay Internet access services business. Juno had been offering pay services since 1998 

and had acquired a great deal of expertise in managing pay services. In addition, Juno had developed a significant pay subscriber base. The proposed transaction presented NetZero's board of directors
with the opportunity to accelerate NetZero's growth and expertise in the pay Internet access business. NetZero's board of directors was aware of the costs, time and uncertainty associated with
building a similar base of pay subscribers and management experience with pay subscribers and determined that the opportunity was in NetZero's best interests. 

    Opportunity to Spread Telecommunications and Networking Costs over a Larger Base.
  NetZero secured favorable pricing and
protected itself against near term increases in telecommunication costs by negotiating telecommunications agreements of up to three years of duration with a number of vendors. Some of these agreements
require NetZero to purchase a fixed amount of telecommunications capacity, regardless of whether that capacity is used by subscribers. Juno generally has short-term agreements with telecommunications
providers which do not require fixed capacity commitments and are priced at levels per unit in excess of NetZero's costs, assuming full utilization of NetZero's purchased capacity. The mergers
represent an opportunity to spread the costs of NetZero's telecommunications capacity and infrastructure over a larger number of subscribers. 

    Marketing to the Value Segment of the Internet.
  Most of the largest Internet service providers, including AOL Time
Warner, Earthlink, and The Microsoft Network, offer standard monthly pricing ranging from $19.95 to $23.90. Both Juno and NetZero had previously focused on building their businesses to be supported by
advertising revenues. NetZero believes that, because of this focus, both its and Juno's infrastructure have a much lower cost basis than the typical Internet service provider. In addition, the offer
of free Internet access services has proven to be an effective consumer offering, and Juno has demonstrated that many free users can be converted to pay users at a $9.95 value price point. NetZero
believes there are a significant number of consumers interested in value priced Internet access as an alternative to the standard industry pricing. NetZero's board of directors determined that the
combined company could more efficiently offer these services while containing marketing and operating costs than either party could do on a stand-alone basis. 

    Attractive Consolidated Advertising Base.
  NetZero believes that the Internet access market will continue to be
attractive to advertisers. Our ability to deliver a large subscriber base of users, based on NetZero's and Juno's active subscriber counts in March 2001, will potentially be more attractive to
online advertisers than what NetZero or Juno would be able to deliver as stand-alone companies. 

    Potential Cost Savings.
  NetZero believes that our cost base will be lower than the sum of NetZero's and Juno's cost
bases as stand-alone entities. NetZero's management believes reductions in telecommunication expenses, headcount, elimination of duplicate purchasing of services, reduction of marketing expenses,
consolidation of facilities and other cost reductions may be achieved by us. NetZero's board of directors also recognized that there would be near term costs associated with implementing these
reductions. 

    Confidence in NetZero's Management Team.
  NetZero's board of directors was aware of the risks associated with the
mergers, including those set forth under "Risk Factors." NetZero's board of directors also considered the challenges of integrating the two organizations. NetZero's board of directors believes that
NetZero's management team will be successful in realizing the synergies referred to in Morgan Stanley's presentation. 

    Morgan Stanley's Opinion.
  NetZero's board of directors received a presentation from representatives of Morgan Stanley
on June 5, 2001. NetZero's board of directors considered that presentation as well as Morgan Stanley's opinion as of that date, and subject to the assumptions and considerations in its opinion,
that the ratio of the exchange ratio for shares of Juno common stock to the exchange ratio for shares of NetZero common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair to 

the holders of shares of NetZero common stock from a financial point of view. Please read Annex B carefully in its entirety and see "Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated." 

    Due Diligence Review of Juno.
  NetZero's board of directors received presentations from NetZero's management on
June 5, 2001 concerning the results of NetZero's investigation of Juno's business, finances and legal affairs. NetZero's board considered the results of that investigation and risks identified
by members of NetZero's management team. 

    Terms of the Merger Agreement and Related Transactions.
  On June 5, 2001, NetZero's board of directors received a
presentation from representatives of Brobeck concerning the terms of the merger agreement, the negotiations with Juno and legal issues related to the proposed transaction. Members of NetZero's
management also informed the NetZero board of directors about the terms of the agreements with related parties of Juno and the severance and retention bonus provisions proposed for Juno's directors,
officers and employees. For more information, see "Interests of Juno Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers." 

    Indications of Support.
  NetZero's board of directors noted that NetZero's senior management team supported the proposed
combination. NetZero's board of directors also noted that holders of 40.5% of
NetZero's outstanding shares of common stock were willing to enter into agreements to vote for the adoption of the merger agreement. 

    Specific Negative Factors Considered.
  NetZero's board of directors considered many potentially negative aspects of the
proposed transactions. Several of these aspects were identified in NetZero's management's presentation, including, uncertainties concerning integration of the businesses, the potential loss of
subscribers, the effect of the Federal Trade Commission proposed order with respect to Juno, the potential termination of Juno's outsourced services agreements and others. Each of these risks is
highlighted in the "Risk Factors" section of this document. Morgan Stanley's presentation was based, in part, on management's financial model which may contain optimistic assumptions. Representatives
of Brobeck highlighted costs associated with the mergers, risks identified in connection with Juno's representations and warranties in the merger agreement and the inadequacy of the compensation to
NetZero if Juno terminated the merger agreement because it received a superior proposal. Among the costs identified were severance payments to Juno's officers and Juno's existing arrangements with
affiliates of Dr. Shaw. Among the risks identified were litigation against Juno, the rights of third party vendors to cancel contracts with Juno without penalty and the number of Juno employees
with "out of the money" stock options.

    General Industry Risks.
  NetZero's board of directors is knowledgeable and familiar with NetZero's industry.
Accordingly, they were also aware of many of the risks highlighted in "Risk Factors."

    This
list is not exhaustive but includes the material factors considered by NetZero's board of directors. Individual members of NetZero's board may have considered other factors not
included in this list. NetZero's board of directors did not attempt to assign relative weight to these factors but rather made the decision to approve the merger agreement after considering the
totality of the available information. 

Recommendation of NetZero's Board Of Directors  

    After careful consideration, the NetZero board of directors, on June 5, 2001, unanimously determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the
mergers are fair to, and in the best interest of, NetZero and its stockholders and approved the merger agreement and the mergers. In reaching its decision, the NetZero board of directors consulted
with its management team and advisors and independently considered the proposed merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. 
The NetZero board of
directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of NetZero vote "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement.

    In considering the recommendation of the NetZero board of directors with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware, however, that directors and executive officers of
NetZero may have interests in the mergers that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of NetZero stockholders. Please see "Interests of NetZero Directors and Executive Officers in
the Mergers." 

Juno's Reasons for the Mergers  

    At multiple meetings in June 2001, Juno's board of directors received presentations from members of Juno's management team, Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown Inc., and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett highlighting the potential benefits of the transaction as well as some of the risks associated with the mergers, including many of the issues
described under "Risk Factors." 
The following are material reasons that Juno's board approved the mergers and that it recommends that you vote FOR the adoption of the merger
agreement.

    Significantly Greater Cash Resources.
  As of March 31, 2001, NetZero had cash, cash equivalents short term
investments and restricted cash of $163.0 million and unencumbered cash (defined as cash and cash equivalents in excess of payables and indebtedness) estimated at $125 million. At the
same date, Juno had cash and cash equivalents of $46.8 million and unencumbered cash of approximately $20 million. A combination with NetZero would provide Juno with access to
significantly increased cash resources at a time when alternate sources of funding are either unavailable entirely or available only on unattractive terms and/or in insufficient quantity. Juno's board
believes that the mergers will reduce the risk of Juno's either exhausting its cash resources or suffering significant erosion in its subscriber base due to the expense-reduction measures necessary
for the preservation of such resources. 

    Opportunity to Enhance Billable Subscriber Base.
  Juno has been marketing billable services to its free subscriber base
since 1998. Repeated exposure to such marketing messages over time may reduce their effectiveness. NetZero's subscriber base of almost 4 million active users in March 2001 represents a
largely untapped and potentially valuable pool of subscribers to whom Juno's billable services can be marketed. 

    Potential Cost Synergies.
  By combining operations, Juno and NetZero will have the opportunity to achieve significant
cost savings over time through the reduction of duplicative facilities and personnel, and through the coordination of marketing expenses and other costs. Additionally, with a larger combined
subscriber base, it should be possible to achieve economies of scale in areas such as the purchasing of telecommunications services and the provision of technical support and customer service to
subscribers. 

    Optimization of Telecommunications Commitments and Expenses.
  Telecommunications expense represents Juno's and NetZero's
largest expense. NetZero has purchased more telecommunications capacity than it is currently utilizing, while Juno currently has telecommunications traffic in excess of Juno's own capacity
commitments. Juno believes that by running a portion of its excess traffic over NetZero's excess capacity, it can generate cost savings for both companies. Furthermore, by carefully comparing
the companies' telecommunications pricing on a city-by-city basis, United Online should be able to take advantage of the most favorable telecommunications terms enjoyed by each
company. 

    Potential Advertising Revenue Synergies.
  Juno believes that as a larger company with a significantly greater subscriber
base, United Online should be able to compete more effectively for advertising revenues in an industry where scale is an important competitive factor. Based on the companies' combined active
subscriber count in March 2001, United Online's subscriber base would exceed seven million subscribers, roughly double the size of either Juno's or NetZero's subscriber base as stand-alone
companies. Additionally, by combining with NetZero, Juno will gain access to existing advertising relationships that NetZero has formed, as well as to sales staff and related resources in excess of
those Juno possesses independently. 

    Intellectual Property Resources.
  Juno and NetZero have developed highly complementary intellectual property, and Juno's
management believes both companies stand to gain from a combination that allows them to use their technology resources collaboratively for the development and operation of enhanced services for both
consumers and advertisers. 

    Greater Market Visibility.
  Juno believes that, by virtue of its greater size and market share, United Online will enjoy
greater visibility than Juno would be able to achieve independently, not only among consumers but also in the investment community. This increased visibility may attract greater levels of investment
research and should enhance trading liquidity. 

    Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's Opinion.
  Juno's board of directors received a presentation from representatives of Deutsche
Banc Alex. Brown on June 5, 2001. Juno's board of directors considered that presentation as well as Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's opinion that, as of the date of the opinion, and subject to and
based on the assumptions and considerations referred to in the opinion, the 0.3570 ratio to exchange shares of Juno common stock for shares of United Online stock was fair to the holders of
Juno common stock from a financial point of view. Please read Annex C carefully in its entirety and see "Opinion of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc." 

    This
list is not exhaustive but includes certain of the material factors considered by Juno's board of directors. Individual members of Juno's board may have considered other factors
not included in this list. 

    In
view of the variety of material factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the mergers, the Juno board of directors did not quantify or assign relative weights to the
specific factors considered
in reaching its recommendation. Instead, the Juno board made its recommendation based on the totality of the information presented and considered by it. 

    Juno's
board of directors also took into consideration potential costs and risks associated with the mergers and the combined company, and concluded that the potential benefits of the
mergers outweighed these factors. These factors include the risk that the potential benefits sought in the mergers might not be fully realized and the risk that the investment community and the
consumer marketplace might respond negatively to the proposed transaction. There can be no assurance that any of the expected results, efficiencies, opportunities or other benefits described in this
section will be achieved as a result of the mergers. For information concerning these and additional risks associated with the mergers, please see "Risk Factors." 

    The
board also considered the substantial costs expected to be incurred in connection with the mergers, including the costs of integrating the companies' businesses and transaction
expenses resulting from the mergers. 

Recommendation of Juno's Board of Directors  

    After careful consideration, the Juno board of directors, on June 5, 2001, unanimously determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the mergers
were fair to, and in the best interest of, Juno and its stockholders and approved the merger agreement and the mergers. In reaching its decision, the Juno board of directors consulted with its
management team and advisors and independently considered the proposed merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. On June 7, 2001, the Juno board of directors
reaffirmed its earlier determination that the terms of the mergers were fair to, and in the best interest of, Juno and its stockholders. The Juno board of directors unanimously recommends that the
stockholders of Juno vote "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement. 

    In
considering the recommendation of the Juno board of directors with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that directors and executive officers of Juno may have
interests in the 

mergers that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of Juno stockholders. Please see "Interests of Juno Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers." 

Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated  

    NetZero retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with a financial fairness opinion in connection with the mergers. At the meeting of NetZero's board of directors
on June 5, 2001, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of June 5, 2001, and subject to and based on the considerations in its opinion, the
ratio of the exchange ratio for shares of Juno common stock to the exchange ratio for shares of NetZero common stock pursuant to the merger agreement is fair from a financial point of view to the
holders of NetZero common stock. Morgan Stanley has no obligation to update its opinion. 

    The
full text of Morgan Stanley's opinion, dated June 5, 2001, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
limitations on the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley is attached as Annex B to this document. We urge you to read this opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley's opinion is directed to
the board of directors of NetZero, addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view of the exchange ratio for shares of Juno common stock to the exchange ratio for shares of NetZero common
stock pursuant to the merger agreement, and does not address any other aspect of the mergers or constitute a recommendation to any NetZero stockholder as to how to vote at the NetZero special meeting.
This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. 

    In
connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley specifically identified the following actions as part of the process of arriving at its opinion: 


reviewed
publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of NetZero and Juno, respectively;


reviewed
internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning Juno and NetZero, respectively;

    Morgan
Stanley assumed and relied upon without independent verification the accuracy and completeness of the information supplied or otherwise made available to it by Juno and NetZero
for the purposes of its opinion. With respect to the financial forecasts, including information relating to strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the mergers, Morgan Stanley
assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the future financial performance of each of Juno and NetZero. Morgan Stanley
relied upon the assessment by the management of each of Juno and NetZero of their ability to retain key employees of Juno and NetZero, respectively. Morgan Stanley also relied upon, without
independent verification, the assessment by the management of each of Juno and NetZero of Juno's and NetZero's technologies and products, the timing and risks associated with, Juno's and NetZero's
integration and the validity of, and risks associated with, Juno's and NetZero's existing products and technologies. Morgan Stanley relied upon, without independent verification, the terms disclosed
to Morgan Stanley by management of Juno and NetZero with respect to the resolution of Juno's litigation with Freewwweb, and assumed that the dispute would be resolved in accordance with the terms
outlined by Juno's management. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the mergers would be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement, including, among other things,
that the mergers would be treated as tax-free reorganizations and/or exchanges under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Morgan Stanley has not made any independent valuation or appraisal
of the assets or liabilities of Juno or NetZero, nor has Morgan Stanley been furnished with any appraisals. Morgan Stanley's opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other
conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Morgan Stanley as of June 5, 2001. 

    The
following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the preparation of its written opinion. These
summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the
text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. 

    Historical Share Price Performance.
  Morgan Stanley reviewed the price performance and trading volumes of the common
stock of each of NetZero and Juno from June 1, 2000 through June 4, 2001. The table below shows the twelve-month high and low closing prices during that period, compared with a closing
price on June 4, 2001 of $0.82 per share for the NetZero common stock and $1.62 per share for the Juno common stock:

    Morgan
Stanley then compared the price performance of the NetZero common stock and the Juno common stock from January 3, 2000 through June 4, 2001 with that of the
Morgan Stanley Internet Index and a group of selected Internet service providers. 

    The
group of selected Internet service providers included EarthLink Inc., Excite@Home and Prodigy Communications. Morgan Stanley selected EarthLink Inc., Excite@Home and
Prodigy Communications because they are publicly traded companies with operations that, for purposes of this analysis, may be considered similar to those of NetZero and Juno. None of the companies
utilized in this analysis as a comparison is identical to NetZero or Juno.

    Comparable Companies Analysis.
  Morgan Stanley compared selected historical and projected financial and operating data
from publicly available research analyst estimates of NetZero and Juno with the corresponding data and stock market performance data available from publicly available sources for
EarthLink Inc., Excite@Home and Prodigy Communications. 

    Morgan
Stanley calculated trading statistics for each member of the comparable companies including: 


The
multiple of aggregate value to revenue for the last twelve months ending March 31, 2001


The
multiple of aggregate value to 2000 revenue


The
multiple of aggregate value to forecasted 2001 revenue


The
multiple of the aggregate value to pay subscribers as of the first quarter of 2001

    The
implied ratios for Juno were derived from the exchange ratio for Juno common stock in the merger agreement. 

    No
company utilized in the comparable company analysis is identical to NetZero or Juno. In selecting and evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made certain judgments and
assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Mathematical analysis, like determining the average or median, of 

financial ratios of the comparable companies is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data. 

    Multiples Paid in Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis.
  Morgan Stanley reviewed ten recent selected business
combinations and analyzed announced deal values to subscriber multiples. Morgan Stanley selected these transactions because they involved companies engaged in industries that are similar or related to
those in which NetZero and Juno operate. This analysis compares the ratio of acquisition
consideration to pay subscribers, a metric selected by Morgan Stanley in its discretion, for the ten precedent combinations to the mergers. 

    These
transactions are: the LineOne/Tiscali S.p.A. transaction, the surfEU.com Ltd./Tiscali S.p.A. transaction, the Planet Inkerkom/Tiscali S.p.A. transaction, the Liberty
Surf/Tiscali S.p.A. transaction, the AddCom AG/Tiscali S.p.A. transaction, the Freeserve plc/Groupe Wanadoo SA transaction, the Korea Thrunet Co., Ltd./SoftBank Corporation transaction, the
Mageos/Telecom Italia S.p.A. transaction, AOL/NTT Docomo, Inc. transaction and World Online International N.V./Tiscali S.p.A. transaction.

    No
company or transaction utilized in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to NetZero or Juno or the mergers. In evaluating the transactions in this analysis, Morgan
Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of
NetZero or Juno, such as the impact of competition on the business of NetZero, Juno, or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial
condition and prospects of NetZero, Juno
or the industry or in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value of the transactions to which they are being compared.
Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, or the high or the low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using precedent transactions data. 

    Relative Contribution Analysis.
  Morgan Stanley compared pro forma contribution of each of NetZero and Juno, based on
active subscriber, pay subscriber and revenue projections provided to Morgan Stanley by the management of NetZero and Juno, to the resultant combined company 

assuming completion of the mergers. This analysis indicated the following contribution for NetZero to the combined company on a pro forma basis:

    Morgan
Stanley compared these results with the pro forma ownership by NetZero stockholders of approximately 61.5% of the common stock of the combined company. 

    Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis.
  Morgan Stanley reviewed the implied historical exchange ratios for the shares of
common stock of each of NetZero and Juno determined by dividing the price per share of Juno common stock by the price per share of NetZero common stock over the twelve-month period from June 1,
2000 through June 4, 2001. Morgan Stanley performed this analysis to compare the
exchange ratios in the mergers with those represented by historical exchange ratios prevailing in the open market. 

    This
analysis indicated the following average historical exchange ratios prevailing in the open market: 

Period Ending Day of June 4, 2001

Exchange Ratio

Last one week average

1.660x

Last one month average

1.631x

Last six months average

1.655x

Last twelve months average

1.612x

    Morgan
Stanley compared these results with the ratio of the exchange ratio for shares of Juno common stock to the exchange ratio for shares of NetZero common stock in the mergers of
1.785x, which represents a premium for shares of Juno common stock as compared to the historical exchange ratios prevailing in the open market. 

    Pro Forma Merger Analysis.
  Morgan Stanley analyzed the pro forma effect of the mergers on each of NetZero's and Juno's
projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2002, based on projections provided to Morgan Stanley by the management of Juno
and NetZero. The analysis indicated that the mergers would increase the EBITDA of the combined company as compared to each company on a stand-alone basis. 

    In
connection with the review of the mergers by NetZero's board of directors, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its
opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. You should note that this summary description
describes each analysis separately, one after another; however, Morgan Stanley considered the results of the analyses performed as a whole. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the
results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it. Morgan Stanley believes that the summary provided and the analyses
described above must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of these analyses, without considering all of them, 

would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and
factors and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions, so that the range of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should therefore
not be taken to be Morgan Stanley's view of the actual value of NetZero or Juno. 

    In
performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made many assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of NetZero or Juno. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley's analysis are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by these estimates. The analyses performed were prepared solely as a part of Morgan Stanley's analysis of the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders of
common stock of NetZero of the ratio of the fraction of a share of our common stock into which each share of Juno common stock will be converted to the fraction of a share of our common stock into
which each share of NetZero common stock will be converted pursuant to the merger agreement and were conducted in connection with the delivery by Morgan Stanley of its opinion dated June 5,
2001 to NetZero's board of directors. Morgan Stanley's analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of common stock of NetZero or Juno or our common stock
following the mergers might actually trade. The ratio of the exchange ratio for shares of Juno common stock to the exchange ratio for shares of NetZero common stock pursuant to the merger agreement
was determined through arm's length negotiations between NetZero and Juno and was approved by NetZero's board of directors. Morgan Stanley did not recommend to NetZero any specific ratio or that any
given ratio constituted the only appropriate ratio in connection with the mergers. 

    NetZero's
board of directors selected Morgan Stanley to act as NetZero's financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley's qualifications, expertise and reputation. Morgan Stanley is an
internationally recognized investment banking and advisory firm. Morgan Stanley, as part of its investment banking and financial advisory business, is continuously engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of business, Morgan Stanley may from time to time trade in the securities or indebtedness of NetZero and Juno for its
own account, the accounts of investment funds and other clients under the management of Morgan Stanley and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position in these securities or indebtedness. 

    NetZero
paid Morgan Stanley a $600,000 financial advisory fee upon delivery of its financial opinion. NetZero has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses incurred in
performing its services and to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its
affiliates against liabilities and expenses, including liabilities under federal securities laws, related to or arising out of Morgan Stanley's engagement and any related transactions. 

Opinion of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc.  

    Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown acted as financial advisor to Juno in connection with the mergers. At the June 5, 2001 meeting of Juno's board of directors,
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown delivered its oral opinion to Juno's board of directors to the effect that, based upon and subject to the assumptions made, matters considered and limits of the review
undertaken by Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, the exchange ratio of 0.3570 of a share of our common stock to be received in connection with the mergers by Juno common stockholders for each share of Juno
common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Juno common stock. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown noted that the exchange ratio for Juno common stock in the mergers was equivalent to a
ratio of 1.7850 shares of NetZero common stock to each share of Juno common stock. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's oral opinion was subsequently confirmed in writing to Juno's board of directors on
June 7, 2001. 

    Deutsche
Banc Alex. Brown's opinion is directed to the board of directors of Juno to assist it in connection with its consideration of the proposed mergers and relates only to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to Juno common stockholders of the exchange ratio of 0.3570 shares of our common stock for each share of Juno common stock. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's
opinion does not relate to any other aspect of the mergers, is not an opinion as to the fairness of the mergers to NetZero or its stockholders and does not constitute a recommendation to Juno, NetZero
or their respective stockholders as to the mergers or as to how Juno or NetZero stockholders should vote with respect to the merger agreement. 

    The
full text of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's written opinion, dated June 7, 2001, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, matters considered and limits on
the review undertaken by Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex C to this document and we incorporate it by reference. Juno stockholders are urged to read the
opinion carefully and in its entirety. The summary of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's opinion set forth in this document is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. 

    In
connection with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's role as financial advisor to the Juno board of directors, and in arriving at its opinion, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown specifically
identified the following actions as part of the process of arriving at its opinion: 


reviewed
certain publicly available financial and other information concerning NetZero and Juno and certain internal analyses and other information
furnished to it by NetZero and Juno;


discussed
with the members of the senior management of NetZero and Juno the businesses and prospects of their respective companies and the joint prospects
of a combined company;


reviewed
the reported prices and trading activity for NetZero common stock and Juno common stock;


compared
certain financial and stock market information for NetZero and Juno with similar information for certain other companies whose securities are
publicly traded;


reviewed
the financial terms of certain recent business combinations which it deemed comparable in whole or in part;


reviewed
the terms of the merger agreement and certain related documents; and


performed
such other studies and analyses and considered such other factors as it deemed appropriate. 

    In
preparing its opinion, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown did not assume responsibility for the independent verification of, and did not independently verify, any information, whether
publicly available or furnished to it, concerning NetZero or Juno, including, without limitation, any financial information, forecasts or projections, considered in connection with the rendering of
its opinion. Accordingly, for purposes of its opinion, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all information it reviewed. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown did not
conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or assets, and did not prepare or obtain any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities of NetZero or Juno. With
respect to the financial forecasts and projections, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown was advised by the management of each of Juno and NetZero that only financial projections or forecasts for the years 2001
and 2002 were available for both companies. In rendering its opinion, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown expresses no view as to the reasonableness of those forecasts and projections, including the synergies,
or the assumptions on which they are based. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's written opinion was based upon economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown as of, June 5, 2001 and Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown undertook no obligation to update its opinion to reflect any developments occurring after that date. 

    For purposes of rendering its opinion, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown has assumed that, in all respects material to its analyses, the representations and warranties of the parties to the
merger agreement contained in the merger agreement are true and correct, each party to the merger agreement will perform all of the covenants and agreements to be performed by it under the merger
agreement and all conditions to the obligations of each of the parties to the merger agreement to consummate the mergers will be satisfied without any waiver. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown has also
assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required in connection with the consummation of the mergers will be obtained and that in connection with obtaining
any necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents, or any amendments, modifications or waivers to any agreements, instruments or orders to which either Juno or NetZero is a party
or is subject or by which it is bound, no limitations, restrictions or conditions will be imposed or amendments, modifications or waivers made that would have a material adverse effect on Juno or
NetZero or materially reduce the contemplated benefits of the mergers. In addition, Juno informed Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, and accordingly for the purpose of rendering its opinion Deutsche Banc
Alex. Brown has assumed, that the mergers will be tax-free to each of Juno and NetZero and their respective stockholders. 

    Set
forth below is a summary of all material financial analyses performed by Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown in connection with its opinion and reviewed with the Juno board of directors at
its meeting on June 5, 2001. 

    Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis.
  Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown compared the exchange ratio of 0.3570 of a share of our
common shares for each share of Juno common stock (which is equivalent to a ratio of 1.7850 shares of NetZero common stock to each share of Juno common stock) to the ratio of the closing market prices
of NetZero common stock and Juno common stock on June 5, 2001. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown also compared this ratio to selected average historical ratios of the closing market prices of Juno
common stock to NetZero common stock for several periods set forth below:

    Pro Forma Financial Effects Analysis.
  Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyzed pro forma effects of the mergers without
taking into account potential after-tax cost savings, operating efficiencies, revenue effects and financial synergies NetZero and Juno could achieve if the mergers were completed. The
analysis was based on the estimates of each company's management. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown observed that, on a standalone basis, Juno had approximately $11.41 of cash per active user and $4.88 of
unencumbered cash per active user as of March 31, 2001. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown also observed that, on a pro forma basis as of March 31, 2001, the pro forma combined company would have
a cash balance of $210.1 million, approximately 8 million active users and $26.26 of cash per active user. Finally, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown observed that, on a pro forma basis as of
March 31, 2001, the pro forma combined company would have an unencumbered cash balance of $145.0 million, resulting in $18.13 of unencumbered cash per active user. Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown used cash in excess of payables and indebtedness as of March 31, 2001 to calculate the unencumbered cash balance. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown noted that the amount of cash and unencumbered
cash per active user on a pro 

forma basis is significantly higher than the amount of cash and unencumbered cash per active user for Juno on a standalone basis. 

    Relative Contribution Analysis.
  Based on financial projections prepared by Juno and NetZero management, Deutsche Banc
Alex. Brown compared the pro forma contribution of both NetZero and Juno to our company, giving effect to the completion of the mergers. This analysis showed that on a pro forma basis (excluding the
effects of any synergies that may be realized as a result of the mergers and of non-recurring expenses relating to the mergers), the relative contribution of Juno and NetZero would be:

    Premium Analysis.
  Based on data from Securities Data Corporation, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown also reviewed the premiums
paid in selected stock-for-stock transactions, both across all industry sectors and in the technology sector, since January 1, 2000, where the entire equity interest in
the target company was acquired and where the market capitalization of the target company was within a range from $50 million to $200 million. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown defined the
technology sector as the high-technology sector, excluding biotechnology and medical technology. The premiums were based upon Juno share price of $1.59 at close of business on
June 5, 2001 and assumed announcement date of June 6, 2001. The review indicated the following premiums:

    All
premiums for the selected transactions were calculated based on public information available at the time of announcement of such transactions, without taking into account
differing market and other conditions existing at the time the transactions occurred. Because the reasons for, and circumstances surrounding, each of the transactions in the sample set were so
diverse, and due to the inherent differences between the operations and financial conditions of Juno and NetZero, on the one hand, and the companies involved in the selected transactions, on the other
hand, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown believes the analysis of premiums paid in selected stock-for-stock transactions is not simply mathematical. Rather, it involves complex
considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected in 

Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's written opinion, concerning differences in the financial and operating characteristics of the companies, prevailing market conditions and other factors that could affect
the public trading value of the companies. 

    Analysis of Selected Publicly Traded Companies.
  Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown compared certain financial information and
commonly used valuation measurements relating to NetZero and Juno with the corresponding information and measurements for EarthLink, Inc., Prodigy Communications Corporation and Internet
America, Inc. None of the companies utilized as a comparison is identical to NetZero or Juno. Accordingly, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown believes the analysis of publicly traded comparable
companies is not simply mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected in Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's written opinion, concerning differences in
financial and operating characteristics of the comparable companies and other factors that could affect the public trading value of the comparable companies. Furthermore, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown
cautions that given the high volatility of the share prices of each of NetZero and Juno, combined with the absence of a set of truly comparable companies due to the unique business characteristics of
each of NetZero and Juno, the results of the comparable companies valuation analysis are less indicative than they would ordinarily be. 

    Financial
information and valuation measurements reviewed by Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown included, among other things: 


common
equity market valuation as of June 5, 2001;


operating
performance;


ratios
of modified enterprise value, defined as equity market capitalization adjusted for debt and capital lease obligations and excluding cash on balance
sheet, to latest twelve months, or LTM, revenues and estimated 2001 and 2002 revenues; and


implied
cash value per share based on estimates of unencumbered cash (defined as cash and cash equivalents in excess of payables and indebtedness) as of
March 31, 2001. 

    To
calculate the trading multiples for the selected peer group companies, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown used publicly available information concerning the selected peer group companies'
LTM revenues and estimated 2001 and 2002 revenues. Multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, and earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, for the
selected peer group companies were not meaningful due to continued projected operating losses. 

    In
the following table, which sets forth the trading multiples calculated by Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, "NA" indicates multiples for which there were no published analyst forecasts:

    Analysis of Selected Precedent Transactions.
  Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown reviewed the financial terms, to the extent
publicly available, of eleven proposed, pending or completed acquisition transactions since January 1998 involving companies in the Internet service provider sector. All multiples for the
selected precedent transactions were based on public information available at the time 

of announcement of such transactions, without taking into account differing market and other conditions existing at the time the transactions occurred. Because the reasons for, and circumstances
surrounding, each of the selected precedent transactions analyzed were so diverse, and due to the inherent differences between the operations and financial conditions of Juno and NetZero, on the one
hand, and the companies involved in the selected precedent transactions, on the other hand, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown believes that a selected precedent transactions analysis is not simply
mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected in Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's written opinion, concerning differences between the characteristics of
these transactions and the mergers that could affect the value of the subject companies and businesses of NetZero and Juno. Furthermore, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown cautions that, given the high
volatility of the share prices of each of NetZero and Juno, the wide range of valuations for technology/Internet-related equities during
the period surveyed and the unique business characteristics of each of NetZero and Juno, the results of the selected precedent transactions analysis are less indicative than they would ordinarily be.

    Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown observed that the selected precedent transactions did not include target companies that offered free Internet access, other than FreeWWWeb, which was in
bankruptcy proceedings. Furthermore, valuations in the equity marketplace for Internet-related companies, including each of NetZero and Juno, declined substantially in the period between July 2000,
the date of the announcement of the last transaction in the selected precedent transactions, and June 2001, when Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown prepared its analysis for Juno's board of directors.
Accordingly, Deutsche

Banc Alex. Brown does not believe that the revenue multiples derived from the selected precedent transactions allowed for meaningful comparisons.

    In addition, the selected enterprise value per subscriber multiples were deemed by Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown to be not relevant given the fundamentally different composition of the
subscriber bases of each of Juno and NetZero (which included a substantial amount of "free" subscribers), as distinguished from the subscriber bases of companies involved in the selected precedent
transactions.

    Miscellaneous.
  The foregoing summary describes analyses and factors that Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown deemed material in
its presentation to the board of directors of Juno, but is not a comprehensive description of all analyses performed and factors considered by Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown in connection with preparing
its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving the application of subjective business judgment in determining the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that considering any portion of
the analyses and of the factors considered without considering all analyses and factors could create a misleading view of the process underlying the opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination,
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown did not assign specific weights to any particular analyses. 

    In
conducting its analyses and arriving at its opinions, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown utilized a variety of generally accepted valuation methods. The analyses were prepared solely for
the purpose of enabling Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown to provide its opinion to Juno's board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of Juno common stock of the
exchange ratio of Juno common stock for shares of our common stock in the mergers and do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may
be sold, which are inherently subject to uncertainty. In connection with its analyses, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown made, and was provided by Juno management and NetZero management with, numerous
assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Juno's or NetZero's control. Analyses based on estimates or
forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual past or future values or results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by the analyses. Because such
analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of Juno, NetZero or their respective advisors, neither Juno nor Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown
nor any other person assumes responsibility if future results or actual values are materially different from these forecasts or assumptions. 

    The
terms of the merger agreement were determined through negotiations between Juno and NetZero and were approved by Juno's board of directors. Although Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown
provided advice to Juno's board of directors during the course of these negotiations, the decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of Juno's board of directors. As described above,
the opinion and presentation of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown to Juno's board of directors was only one of a number of
factors taken into consideration by Juno's board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's opinion was provided to Juno's board of directors
to assist it in connection with its consideration of the mergers and does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Juno common stock or NetZero common stock as to how to vote with respect to
the mergers. 

    Juno
selected Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown as financial advisor in connection with the mergers based on Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's qualifications, expertise, reputation and experience
in mergers and acquisitions. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown is a registered broker-dealer and member of the New York Stock Exchange. Juno retained Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown pursuant to a letter agreement
dated May 31, 2001. As compensation for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's services in connection with the mergers, Juno has agreed to pay Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown a cash fee of $500,000 which is
payable upon delivery of its opinion, and has agreed to pay an additional cash fee of $350,000 if the mergers are consummated. Regardless of whether the mergers are consummated, Juno has agreed to
reimburse Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown for all reasonable fees and disbursements of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's 

counsel (up to a total of $40,000) and all of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the mergers or
otherwise arising out of the retention of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown under the letter agreement. Juno has also agreed to indemnify Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and its related persons to the full extent
lawful against liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement or the mergers. 

    Deutsche
Banc Alex. Brown is an internationally recognized investment banking firm experienced in providing advice in connection with mergers and acquisitions and related
transactions. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and its affiliates may have, from time to time, provided investment banking, and other financial services to Juno and NetZero or their affiliates for which they
have received or may receive compensation, including Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's predecessor having acted as financial advisor to Juno in 2000 in connection with Juno's exploration of strategic
alternatives. In the ordinary course of business, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and its affiliates may actively trade in the securities and other instruments and obligations of Juno and NetZero for their
own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. Accordingly, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and its affiliates may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities, instruments and
obligations. 

Interests of NetZero Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers  

    In considering the recommendation of the board of directors of NetZero to vote for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, stockholders of NetZero should
be aware that members of the NetZero board of directors and members of NetZero's management team have agreements or arrangements that provide them with interests in the mergers that differ from those
of NetZero stockholders. The NetZero board of directors was aware of these agreements and arrangements during its deliberations of
the merits of the mergers and in determining to recommend to the stockholders of NetZero that they vote for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. 

    Governance Structure and Management Positions.
  Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, upon completion of the
mergers, the officers and directors of NetZero immediately prior to the completion of the mergers will be our officers and directors. 

    NetZero Employee Stock Options and Restricted Shares.
  Once the mergers are completed, we will assume in full each
NetZero stock option pursuant to the merger agreement. This means that each NetZero employee stock option outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the mergers will be converted into an
option to acquire that number of shares of our common stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share, equal to the product of 0.2000 multiplied by the number of shares of NetZero common stock that
would have been obtained before the mergers upon exercise of the option, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. In addition, each outstanding restricted share of NetZero common stock will be converted
into 0.2000 of a share of our common stock. 

    Indemnification and Insurance.
  The merger agreement provides that, upon completion of the mergers, we will indemnify
and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors, officers and employees of NetZero and its subsidiaries, in all of their capacities, for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the completion of the mergers: 


to
the same extent they were indemnified or had the right to advancement of expenses as of June 7, 2001, which is the date of the merger agreement,
pursuant to NetZero's restated certificate of incorporation, restated bylaws and indemnification agreements with any directors, officers and employees of NetZero and its subsidiaries; and


to
the fullest extent permitted by law. 

    The
merger agreement also provides that, upon completion of the mergers, that 


our
charter documents will include provisions regarding the elimination of liability for directors and officers no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions of NetZero's charter documents before the mergers; and


we
will maintain, for a period of six years, the current, or similarly advantageous, policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by NetZero, with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the completion of the mergers up to a cost of $3,000,000 for such insurance. 

Interests of Juno Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers  

    In considering the recommendation of the board of directors of Juno to vote for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, stockholders of Juno should be
aware that members of the Juno board of directors and members of Juno's management team have agreements or arrangements that provide them with interests in the mergers that may differ from those of
Juno stockholders. The Juno board of directors was aware of these agreements and arrangements during its deliberations of the merits of the mergers and in determining to recommend to the stockholders
of Juno that they vote for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. 

    Termination Protection Agreements for Executive Officers.
  Each of Charles Ardai and Harshan Bhangdia have entered into
Termination Protection Agreements with Juno and it is anticipated that each of them will be terminated upon consummation of the mergers. Pursuant to these agreements, as amended, upon consummation of
the mergers, the employment of Messrs. Ardai and Bhangdia will be terminated without cause and (a) Mr. Ardai will receive a severance payment equal to 125% of the sum of his base
salary and guaranteed bonus and (b) Mr. Bhangdia will receive a severance payment equal to 75% of the sum of his base salary and guaranteed bonus. Additionally, any outstanding and
unvested options of these executive officers will become fully vested. All payments made pursuant to these agreements will be reduced by any cash payments actually made to these employees under the
WARN Act. Furthermore, pursuant to these agreements, Mr. Ardai, in exchange for a payment equal to 125% of the sum of his base salary and guaranteed bonus, has agreed not to compete with Juno's
business for a period of one year, and Mr. Bhangdia, in exchange for a payment equal to 100% of the sum of his base salary and guaranteed bonus, has agreed not to compete with Juno's business
for a period of six months, in each case following the consummation of the mergers. 

    Additionally,
Mr. Ardai and Mr. Bhangdia have agreed to provide services, as may be requested by United Online, during the 60 day period following consummation of
the mergers, for which they would be compensated at a weekly rate calculated based on their current annual base salary and guaranteed bonus. 

    Directors Stock Option Acceleration.
  Under Juno's 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, outstanding options granted to
non-employee directors automatically accelerate and become immediately exercisable in full upon consummation of the mergers. 

    Indemnification and Insurance.
  The merger agreement provides that, upon completion of the mergers, we will indemnify
and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present
directors, officers and employees of Juno and its subsidiaries in all of their capacities, for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the completion of the mergers: 


to
the same extent they were indemnified or had the right to advancement of expenses as of June 7, 2001, which is the date of the merger agreement,
pursuant to Juno's restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws and indemnification agreements with any directors, officers and employees of Juno and its subsidiaries; and


to
the fullest extent permitted by law, in each case for acts or omissions. 

    The
merger agreement also provides that, upon completion of the mergers, that 


our
charter documents must include provisions regarding the elimination of liability for directors and officers no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions of Juno's charter documents before the mergers; and


we
purchase as of the time the mergers are completed, a prepaid, non-cancelable, six year, "runoff" tail policy to be effective for six years
following the completion of the mergers with the current coverage of Juno's policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance for a cost no greater than
$3,000,000, or, if less, the greatest amount of coverage available for $3,000,000. 

    Leases.
  As required by the merger agreement, Juno entered into sublease agreements with D.E. Shaw & Co., L.P.,
an entity affiliated with Dr. Shaw, for office space currently occupied by Juno at 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York. Juno currently subleases approximately 46,000 square feet at
this location. Rent payments are equal to $52 per square foot. Juno has exercised its right to terminate these sublease agreements effective as of January 31, 2002 and has made $165,900 in
termination payments to D.E. Shaw & Co., L.P. In addition, Juno subleases approximately 26,000 square feet at 1540 Broadway, New York, New York. Rent payments are currently equal to $38 per square
foot. Historically, Juno had used this space as a permitted occupant under a lease between D.E. Shaw & Co., L.P., as lessee, and Bertelsmann Property, Inc., and had agreed to assume the
performance of D.E. Shaw & Co., L.P.'s payment obligations under that lease. In connection with the mergers, Juno entered into a formal sublease agreement in July 2001 that memorializes its
obligations to sublease the space from D.E. Shaw & Co., L.P. through March 20, 2003 and clarifies that United Online and NetZero may occupy the space after consummation of the mergers.

Completion and Effectiveness of the Mergers  

    The mergers will be completed when all of the conditions to completion of the mergers are satisfied or waived, including the adoption of the merger agreement
by the stockholders of each of NetZero and Juno. The mergers will become effective upon the filing of certificates of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. 

    We
are working toward completing the mergers as quickly as possible. We anticipate completing the mergers in September 2001 immediately after the stockholders of NetZero and
Juno adopt the merger agreement at their respective special meetings. 

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers  

    The following summary discusses the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers to U.S. holders of NetZero common stock and Juno common stock. 

    For
purposes of this discussion, a U.S. holder means: 


a
citizen or resident of the United States;


a
corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States or any of its political subdivisions;


a
trust, if a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. fiduciaries have the authority
to control all substantial decisions of the trust; or


an
estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source. 

    This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions currently in effect, all of which are
subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. The discussion assumes that NetZero stockholders hold their NetZero common stock and will hold their shares of our common stock, and that Juno
stockholders hold their Juno common stock and will hold their shares of our common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code. Further, the
discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular stockholder in light of his, her or its personal investment circumstances or to
stockholders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including: 


insurance
companies;


tax-exempt
organizations;


dealers
in securities or foreign currency;


banks
or trusts;


persons
that hold their NetZero common stock or Juno common stock as part of a straddle, a hedge against currency risk or a constructive sale or conversion
transaction;


persons
that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;


investors
in pass-through entities;


certain
expatriates;


stockholders
who acquired their NetZero common stock or Juno common stock through the exercise of options or otherwise as compensation or through a
tax-qualified retirement plan; or


holders
of options granted under any NetZero or Juno benefit plan. 

    This
summary does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or are contingent on, individual circumstances. Moreover, this summary does not address any non-income
tax or any foreign, state or local tax consequences of the mergers. This summary does not address the tax consequences of any transaction other than the mergers. Accordingly, you are strongly urged to
consult with your tax advisor to determine the particular federal, state, local or foreign income or other tax consequences of the mergers to you. 

    Neither
we, NetZero nor Juno will request a ruling from the United States Internal Revenue Service with respect to any of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers and,
as a result, we can not assure you that the Internal Revenue Service will not disagree with or challenge any of the conclusions described below. 

    It
is a condition to completion of the mergers that Brobeck deliver its opinion to NetZero and Simpson Thacher deliver its opinion to Juno to the effect that, on the basis of the
facts, representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion the merger of NZ Acquisition Corp. into NetZero and the merger of JO Acquisition Corp. into Juno will each constitute an exchange
and/or a reorganization within the meaning of Section 351 or Section 368(a), respectively, of the Internal Revenue Code. 

    As
a result the following tax consequences will apply: 


no
gain or loss will be recognized by us, NetZero, Juno, NZ Acquisition Corp. or JO Acquisition Corp. as a result of the mergers; 


no
gain or loss will be recognized by:


U.S.
holders of NetZero common stock on the exchange of their NetZero common stock for shares of our common stock, except with respect to cash received by
U.S. holders of NetZero common stock in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock; or


U.S.
holders of Juno common stock on the exchange of their Juno common stock for shares of our common stock, except with respect to cash received by U.S.
holders of Juno common stock in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock; 


the
aggregate adjusted basis of the shares of our common stock received in connection with the mergers by:


a
U.S. holder of NetZero common stock will be equal to the aggregate adjusted basis of the U.S. holder's NetZero common stock exchanged for those shares of
our common stock reduced by any amount allocable to the fractional share interests in our common stock for which cash is received; and


a
U.S. holder of Juno common stock will be equal to the aggregate adjusted basis of the U.S. holder's Juno common stock exchanged for those shares of our
common stock reduced by any amount allocable to the fractional share interests in our common stock for which cash is received; and 


the
holding period of the shares of our common stock received in connection with the mergers by:


a
U.S. holder of NetZero common stock will include the holding period of the U.S. holder's NetZero common stock exchanged for those shares of our common
stock; and


a
U.S. holder of Juno common stock will include the holding period of the U.S. holder's Juno common stock exchanged for those shares of our common stock. 

    Any
change in currently applicable law, which may or may not be retroactive, or failure of any factual representations or assumptions to be true, correct and complete in all material
respects, could affect the continuing validity of the Brobeck tax opinion and the Simpson Thacher tax opinion. 

    Cash Instead of Fractional Shares.
  The receipt of cash instead of a fractional share of our common stock by a U.S.
holder of NetZero common stock or Juno common stock will result in taxable gain or loss to that U.S. holder for U.S. federal income tax purposes based upon the difference between the amount of cash
received by that U.S. holder and the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in the fractional share. The gain or loss will constitute capital gain or loss and will constitute long-term capital
gain or loss if the U.S. holder's holding period is greater than twelve months as of the date the mergers are completed. For non-corporate U.S. holders, this long-term capital
gain generally will be taxed at a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20%. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. 

    Backup Withholding.
  Payments to certain non-corporate U.S. holders may be subject to backup withholding on
cash payments received in connection with the mergers (including cash paid instead of fractional shares of our common stock). Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a U.S. holder who: 


furnishes
a correct taxpayer identification and certifies as to not being subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 or a substitute
or successor form; or


is
otherwise exempt from backup withholding. 

    If
a U.S. holder does not provide a correct taxpayer identification number, the U.S. holder may be subject to penalties imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. Any amount paid as
backup withholding 

does not constitute an additional tax and will be creditable against such U.S. holder's U.S. federal income tax liability. U.S. holders should consult with their own tax advisors as to their
qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining the exemption. 

    A
U.S. holder may avoid backup withholding by completing IRS Form W-9 or a substitute or successor form and submitting it to the paying agent for the transaction
when submitting such U.S. holder's stock certificate. 

Reporting Requirements
. A U.S. holder of NetZero common stock or Juno common stock receiving shares of our common stock as a result of
the mergers may be required to retain records related to their NetZero common stock and Juno common stock, as applicable, and file with their federal income tax return, a statement setting forth facts
relating to the mergers. 

Accounting Treatment of the Transaction  

    We intend to account for the transaction under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations. 

Regulatory Matters  

    Antitrust Considerations.
  The mergers are subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, which prevents specified transactions from being completed until required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and
the Federal Trade Commission and specified waiting periods are terminated or expire. We have filed the required information and materials to notify the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission of the mergers, and the thirty day waiting period expired on July 23, 2001. 

    The
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission may challenge the mergers on antitrust grounds, either before or after expiration of the waiting
period. Accordingly, at any time before or after the completion of the mergers, either the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission could take action under the
antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, or other persons could take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the mergers. Additionally, at any
time before or after the completion of the mergers, notwithstanding that the applicable waiting period expired or was terminated, any state could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems
necessary or desirable in the public interest. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the mergers will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail. 

Restrictions on Sales of Shares by Affiliates of NetZero and Juno  

    The shares of our common stock to be issued in connection with the mergers will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and will be freely transferable
under the Securities Act, except for shares of our common stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of either NetZero or Juno at the time of the special meetings. Persons who may
be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under the common control of either NetZero or Juno and may include executive officers, directors and
significant stockholders of NetZero and Juno. 

    Affiliates
may not sell their shares of our common stock acquired in connection with the mergers except pursuant to: 


an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of those shares;


an
exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or


any
other applicable exemption under the Securities Act. 

    Our
registration statement on Form S-4, of which this document forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of our common stock to be received by Juno's or our
affiliates in connection with the mergers. 

Nasdaq National Market Listing of United Online Common Stock to be Issued in the Mergers  

    We agreed in the merger agreement to use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of our common stock to be issued in connection with the
mergers to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of issuance, before the completion of the mergers.

Trading and Deregistration of NetZero and Juno Common Stock after the Mergers  

    When the mergers are completed, NetZero common stock and Juno common stock will no longer be traded on the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

THE MERGER AGREEMENT    

    The following summary of the merger agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, which we incorporate by
reference and urge you to read carefully in its entirety. 

The Mergers  

    To accomplish the combination of NetZero's and Juno's businesses, we formed a new company, United Online, with two subsidiaries, NZ Acquisition Corp. and JO
Acquisition Corp. At the time the mergers are completed: 


NZ
Acquisition Corp. will be merged into NetZero, and NetZero will be the surviving corporation.


JO
Acquisition Corp. will be merged into Juno, and Juno will be the surviving corporation.


As
a result, NetZero and Juno will each become a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. 

Effective Time  

    Once all the conditions to the mergers contained in the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived, we will complete the mergers. The mergers will become
effective when each of the certificates of merger are filed with the Delaware Secretary of State. 

Conversion and Exchange of NetZero and Juno Stock  

    When the mergers are completed, NetZero common stockholders will receive 0.2000 of a share of our common stock for each share they own, and Juno common
stockholders will receive 0.3570 of a share of our common stock for each share they own. No fractional shares of our common stock will be issued in connection with the mergers. 

    When
the mergers are completed, our exchange agent will mail to you a letter of transmittal and instructions for surrendering your NetZero or Juno stock certificates in exchange for
statements indicating book-entry ownership of our common stock. If you make a special request, we will issue you stock certificates. When you deliver your stock certificates to the
exchange agent along with a properly executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, your stock certificates will be cancelled and you will receive statements indicating
book-entry ownership of our common stock, or, if requested, stock certificates representing the number of full shares of our common stock to which you are entitled under the merger
agreement. You will receive payment in cash, without interest, in lieu of any fractional shares of our common stock which would have been otherwise issuable to you as a result of the mergers. 

    You
should not submit your NetZero or Juno stock certificates for exchange until you receive the transmittal instructions and a form of letter of transmittal from the exchange agent. 

    You
are not entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on our common stock until the mergers are completed and you have surrendered your NetZero or Juno stock
certificates in exchange for certificates for shares of our common stock. 

    We
will only issue shares or a check in lieu of a fractional share in a name other than the name in which a surrendered NetZero or Juno stock certificate is registered if you present
the exchange agent with all documents required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership and show that you paid any applicable stock transfer taxes. 

Treatment of NetZero and Juno Stock Options and Other Rights  

    NetZero.
  We will assume each NetZero option. Thus, upon completion of the mergers, each outstanding NetZero stock
option will be converted into an option to purchase the number of shares of our common stock that is equal to the product of 0.2000 multiplied by the number of shares of NetZero common stock subject
to that option, rounded down to the nearest whole share. The exercise price per share will be equal to the exercise price per share of NetZero common stock subject to the option before the conversion
divided by 0.2000, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. In addition, each outstanding right to receive a restricted share of NetZero common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.2000
restricted shares of our common stock. Furthermore, we will assume the outstanding offering period under NetZero's employee stock purchase plan and the purchase rights under the plan will be converted
into rights to purchase shares of our common stock, with the number of shares rounded down to the nearest whole share and the purchase price rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The other terms of
the NetZero options and restricted shares referred to above will continue to apply. 

    Juno.
  Similarly we will assume each Juno option. Thus, upon completion of the mergers, each outstanding Juno stock
option will be converted into an option to purchase the number of shares of our common stock that is equal to the product of 0.3570 multiplied by the number of shares of Juno common stock subject to
that option, rounded down to the nearest whole share. The exercise price per share will be equal to the exercise price per share of Juno common stock subject to the option before the conversion
divided by 0.3570, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. In addition, we will assume the outstanding offering period under Juno's employee stock purchase plan and the purchase rights under the plan
shall be converted into rights to purchase shares of our common stock, with the number of shares rounded down to the nearest whole share and the purchase price rounded up to the nearest whole cent.
The other terms of the Juno options referred to above will continue to apply. 

    Registration.
  We will file a registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of our common stock
subject to each NetZero and Juno option and restricted shares and will maintain the effectiveness of that registration statement for as long as any of the options or restricted shares remain
outstanding.

 Interim Conduct of NetZero Pending the Mergers  

    NetZero agreed that, during the period before completion of the mergers, neither it nor its subsidiaries will: 


amend
its certificate of incorporation or bylaws;


declare
or pay dividends;


split,
combine or reclassify any shares of its stock or redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of its stock;


transfer,

satisfaction of any of the conditions to the mergers; or


enter
into any agreement that would accomplish, recommend, propose or announce an intention to do any of the foregoing. 

 No Solicitation of Alternate Transactions  

    The merger agreement contains detailed provisions prohibiting Juno from seeking an alternative transaction. Under these "no solicitation" provisions, Juno has
agreed that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries, officers and directors, will, directly or indirectly: 


solicit,
initiate, knowingly encourage or induce the making, submission or announcement of any takeover proposal with respect to Juno;


participate
in any discussions or negotiations with any person regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or take any other
action that would reasonably be expected to facilitate any inquiry or proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any takeover proposal with respect to Juno;


authorize,
approve or recommend any takeover proposal with respect to Juno; or 


enter
into any letter of intent or similar document accepting or providing for any takeover proposal with respect to Juno. 

    However,
the merger agreement does not prevent Juno, or its board of directors from: 


complying
with Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with regard to a tender or exchange offer not arising out of a violation of the
non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement; or


before
the adoption of the merger agreement by Juno's stockholders, from furnishing information regarding Juno or entering into negotiations or discussions
with, or entering into an agreement relating to a takeover proposal with, any person in response to a takeover proposal with respect to Juno made, submitted or announced (and not withdrawn) to the
extent that


the
takeover proposal is not attributable to a material breach of the merger agreement;


the
board of directors of Juno concludes in good faith, consistent with advice of outside legal counsel, that failure to take such actions would likely
constitute a breach of the fiduciary obligations of the board of directors of Juno to Juno's stockholders;


the
board of directors of Juno concludes, in good faith, consistent with the advice of Juno's financial advisor, that such Juno takeover proposal is
reasonably likely to lead to a superior takeover proposal;


prior
to furnishing any information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, the person making that proposal, Juno gives NetZero written
notice of the identity of the person making the proposal, the terms and conditions of the takeover proposal and Juno's intention to furnish information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations
with, the person making the takeover proposal;


Juno
receives from the person making the takeover proposal an executed confidentiality agreement which will not in any way restrict Juno from complying
with its disclosure obligations under the merger agreement and which will contain customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral information furnished to that person
by or on behalf of Juno and other terms no less favorable to Juno than those set forth in the confidentiality agreement between NetZero and Juno; and


contemporaneously
with furnishing any information to the person making the takeover proposal with respect to Juno, Juno furnishes the same information to
NetZero. 

    For
purposes of the merger agreement, a takeover proposal means any offer or proposal for a merger or other business combination involving Juno after which the stockholders of Juno
immediately prior to such merger or business combination would own less than 80% of the voting securities of the surviving corporation or the parent of the surviving corporation, or the acquisition of
20% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Juno, or the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of Juno. 

    Juno
has agreed that: 


it
will promptly keep NetZero informed of the status and terms of any proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations covered by the "no solicitation"
provisions of the merger agreement;


it
will immediately cease and terminate any activities, exchanges of information, discussions or negotiations existing as of June 7, 2001, the date
of the merger agreement, with any parties conducted before that date with respect to any acquisition proposal;


it
will inform its directors, officers, and financial, legal, accounting and other advisors retained or involved in the mergers of the obligations of the
"no solicitation" provisions of the merger agreement; and 


it
will request that each person who has executed such a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement in connection with the mergers return to
Juno or otherwise dispose of the confidential information. 

 Compliance with FTC Consent Agreement  

    Juno covenants and agrees to fully comply with all the terms of its consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission dated May 15, 2001. 

 Notification  

    Juno and NetZero each have agreed to give prompt notice to the other party of: 


the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event of which would reasonably be expected to cause any of its representations or warranties to be
untrue in any material respect; and


its
material failure to comply with or satisfy any of covenant, condition or agreement in the merger agreement. 

Additional Agreements  

    The merger agreement also provides for additional agreements and covenants which we urge you to read carefully. Specifically, the merger agreement provides
that the parties use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions and do all things necessary, proper and advisable under the merger agreement and applicable laws to complete the mergers as
soon as practicable after the date of the merger agreement. The merger agreement also contains covenants relating to the cooperation between NetZero and Juno in the preparation of this document and
additional agreements between them relating to, among other things, access to information, mutual notice of specified matters, public announcements, affiliate agreements and securities, tax and other
governmental regulations. 

    The
parties have further agreed to the following: 

 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance  

    We will indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors, officers and employees of NetZero and Juno, and
their subsidiaries, in all of their capacities, for acts or omissions occurring prior to the completion of the mergers: 


to
the same extent they were indemnified or had the right to advancement of expenses as of June 7, 2001, which is the date of the merger agreement,
pursuant to Juno's restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws and indemnification agreements with any directors, officers and employees of Juno and its subsidiaries; and


to
the fullest extent permitted by law, in each case for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the completion of the mergers. 

    We
will also maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance for six years following the completion of the mergers with coverage no less
advantageous than the current policies of NetZero and Juno, for a cost of up to $3,000,000. 

 Juno Benefit Matters  

    We will grant Juno's employees credit for service with Juno up to the time of the completion of the mergers for purposes of benefit plans, waive any
limitations on pre-existing conditions and apply expenses incurred before the completion of the mergers to applicable deductible, co-insurance and maximum
out-of-pocket provisions. 

 Severance Agreements  

    We will honor the severance arrangements between Juno and its executive officers and directors. For more information, see "Interests of Juno Directors and
Executive Officers in the Mergers." 

 Name  

    If, within 30 days of the date of the merger agreement, NetZero determines that it will not use the name "United Online, Inc." because it would
violate the rights of a third party or otherwise be inadvisable or impractical from a trademark law perspective, it will notify Juno and Juno and NetZero will engage in good faith discussions to
select an alternate name. 

    With
limited exceptions, within 90 days of the completion of the mergers, we, NetZero and Juno will stop using the name "NetZero" to advertise, promote or offer pay Internet
access services. 

 Juno 401(k) Plan  

    Immediately before the completion of the mergers, Juno will terminate its 401(k) plan. 

 Juno's Transfer of Shares of India Subsidiary  

    Before completion of the mergers, an affiliate of Juno will transfer all the shares of Juno Online Services Development Private Limited not owned by it to
NetZero. 

 Leases  

    As required by the merger agreement, Juno entered into sublease agreements with D.E. Shaw & Co., L.P. for office space currently occupied
by Juno at 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York. Juno currently subleases approximately 46,000 square feet at this location. Subsequently, Juno exercised its

right to terminate these sublease agreements effective as of January 31, 2002 and has made $165,900 in termination payments to D.E. Shaw & Co., L.P. In addition, Juno subleases approximately
26,000 square feet at 1540 Broadway, New York, New York.

Termination  

    The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the completion of the mergers, whether before or after the stockholder approvals have been
obtained: 


by
mutual written consent of NetZero and Juno;


by
either NetZero or Juno if:


the
mergers are not completed on or before November 30, 2001, except that this right to terminate the merger agreement will not be available to any
party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under the merger agreement has been the cause of, or has resulted in, the failure of the mergers to be completed such date;


any
governmental entity shall have:


issued
an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the mergers, and the order, decree,
ruling or other action becomes final and nonappealable; or


failed
to issue an order, decree or ruling or to take any other action, and the denial of a request to issue the order, decree, ruling or take any other
action becomes final and nonappealable, which action is necessary to complete the mergers, except that this right to terminate the merger agreement will not be available to any party whose failure to
comply with the provisions of the merger agreement relating to the use of commercially reasonable efforts to complete the mergers is the cause of such action or inaction; 


the
approval of either party's stockholders to adopt the merger agreement is not obtained;


the
other party materially breaches its obligations under the merger agreement because of a failure to call a special meeting of its stockholders to vote
on the adoption of the merger agreement or a failure to mail this document to its stockholders; or


the
other party breaches or fails to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in the merger agreement in
such a way as to render those conditions incapable of being satisfied on or before November 30, 2001. 


by
NetZero if Juno's board of directors fails to recommend that Juno's stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement or effects a
change in its recommendation of adoption of the merger agreement, whether or not permitted by the terms of the merger agreement, or if Juno's board
failed to call the stockholder meeting or failed to prepare and mail the proxy statements to the stockholders; or


by
Juno if Juno notifies NetZero that it intends to accept a superior proposal and NetZero does not timely respond with a more favorable proposal, and Juno
pays NetZero a termination fee. 

    Effect of Termination.
  If the merger agreement is terminated by either party, the merger agreement will become void and
NetZero and Juno will have no liability under the merger agreement, assuming no willful material breach of the merger agreement has occurred. However, if the merger agreement is terminated, the
following provisions will survive termination: the confidentiality agreement, the agreement to file the requisite press releases, the provisions of the merger agreement related to termination fees and
expenses and the general contract provisions. 

    Termination Fee and/or Payment of Expenses Upon Termination.
  The merger agreement requires each party to pay a
termination fee or expenses to the other party depending on the circumstances surrounding the termination. Specifically, if the agreement is terminated because: 


Juno's
board of directors failed to recommend that Juno's stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement or effected a change in its
recommendation of the adoption 

of
the merger agreement, or Juno accepts a superior proposal, Juno must pay to NetZero a termination fee of $2,500,000 plus expenses up to $1,000,000 incurred by NetZero and its subsidiaries with
respect to the mergers. 


Juno
failed to obtain the required vote at a stockholders meeting to approve the mergers, then within two business days of termination, Juno will pay to
NetZero expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement by NetZero and its subsidiaries up to $1,000,000. However, if prior to the termination any person communicated to Juno an alternate
proposal for a business combination and within nine months of the termination Juno entered into a definitive agreement for an alternate proposal, then Juno will pay NetZero the termination fee of
$2,500,000, less the expenses previously paid.


NetZero's
board of directors failed to obtain the required vote of its stockholders to approve the mergers, then NetZero will pay to Juno expenses incurred
by Juno, not to exceed $1,000,000. 

Expenses  

    Notwithstanding the provisions above regarding termination fees and expenses, whether or not the mergers are completed, all expenses and fees incurred in
connection with the merger agreement and the mergers will be paid by the party incurring the expenses or fees, except: 


if
the mergers are completed, the surviving corporation of each merger will pay any property or transfer taxes imposed in connection with the mergers; and


all
expenses and fees incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and registration statement will
be shared equally by Juno and NetZero. 

Amendment, Extension and Waiver  

    The merger agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any
time before or after the approval of the mergers by the stockholders of NetZero and Juno has been obtained. All amendments to the merger agreement must be in writing signed by each party. After the
agreement has been approved by the stockholders of the respective companies, no amendment which under applicable law requires further approval of the stockholders may be made without such further
approval. 

Our Organizational Documents and Management Team  

    We agreed to cause our certificate of incorporation and bylaws to be in the form described under the section "Description of United Online Capital Stock" at
the time the mergers are completed. NetZero, Juno and we agreed that NetZero's directors and officers would become our directors and executive officers when the mergers are completed. 

RELATED AGREEMENTS    

Voting Agreements  

    The following summary of the voting agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the voting agreements, forms of which are
exhibits to the registration statement we filed with the SEC. We urge you to carefully read the full text of the voting agreements. 

    In connection with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, NetZero entered into voting agreements with David E. Shaw, several entities affiliated with Dr. Shaw,
Charles E. Ardai, Harshan Bhangdia, Richard D. Buchband and Louis K. Salkind which require those Juno stockholders to vote substantially all of their shares of Juno common stock in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement. As of the record date for the Juno special meeting, these stockholders owned shares of Juno common stock representing approximately 31% of the total voting power of
the outstanding shares of Juno capital stock.

    In addition, Juno entered into voting agreements with Qualcomm, entities affiliated with Clearstone Venture Management I, LLC, Draper Fisher Jurvetson Management Company
V LLC, Mark R. Goldston, Charles S. Hilliard, and Frederic A. Randall, Jr. which require those NetZero stockholders to vote substantially all their shares of NetZero common stock in
favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. As of the record date for the NetZero special meeting, these stockholders owned shares of NetZero common stock representing approximately 41% of the
total voting power of the outstanding shares of NetZero capital stock.

    The
voting agreements entered into between NetZero and the Juno stockholders prohibit the Juno stockholders, or their employees or affiliates, from soliciting or participating in
discussions or negotiations with another party with respect to an alternate transaction, with limited exceptions. 

    These
voting agreements terminate on the earliest of the (a) closing date of the mergers, (b) the termination of the merger agreement or (c) November 30,
2001. 

Agreements with David E. Shaw  

    David E. Shaw agreed, in his affiliate agreement with us, that he would not dispose of any shares of our common stock that he beneficially owns for a period of
ninety days following completion of the mergers. Dr. Shaw has also agreed that, for the period until one year from the date of the mergers, he would limit his public sale of shares of our
common stock that he beneficially owns, as required by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, to the extent he may be considered an "affiliate" of United Online, as defined under that Rule. Among
other limitations, Rule 144 imposes on affiliates volume limitations that permit no more than the greater of (i) one percent of our outstanding shares or (ii) our average weekly
trading volume for the preceding four weeks, to be sold in the public markets within any rolling three-month period. Additionally, Dr. Shaw has agreed that, even if not considered an
"affiliate," he would adhere to volume restrictions that would, for the period beginning three months after the date of the mergers until one year from the date of the mergers, permit him aggregate
sales into the public marketplace during that nine-month period in an amount no greater than the aggregate amount that could have been sold publicly by an "affiliate" during such period
under the volume restrictions of Rule 144 (notwithstanding any holding period requirement). 

    Affiliates
of David E. Shaw agreed to amend their existing registration rights agreement with Juno to provide holders of registration rights granted by NetZero with rights on a parity
with the rights currently held by affiliates of Dr. Shaw. We will assume that registration rights agreement in connection with the mergers.

Significant Financial Trends  

    NetZero's original business strategy was to create an Internet service funded by advertising, marketing and commerce arrangements, rather than Internet access
fees. However, during the quarter ended September 30, 2000 there was a slowdown in the online advertising market which has placed additional stress on this business strategy. This slowdown has
continued throughout the current period and it is not known when, or if, online advertising rates will stabilize or increase. During the December 2000 quarter, the combination of the acquisition of
FreeInternet.com and the failure of a number of competitors resulted in a significant increase in NetZero's user base, resulting in increased cost of revenues and gross loss as telecommunications
expenses increased to accommodate the expanded user base. 

    There has been a decline in advertising and commerce revenues over four sequential quarters in the year ended June 30, 2001, and it is expected that this trend will continue
into the September 2001 quarter. In the quarter ended March 31, 2001, NetZero initiated steps to address declining advertising revenues and increasing gross loss by introducing billable
services and restrictions on the number of free hours per household per month. As a result of this shift in strategy, the percentage of revenue derived from billable services has grown from 0.4% and
0.7% of total revenue in the quarters ended September 30, 2000 and December 31, 2000, respectively, to 14% and 36% in the quarter ended March 31, 2001 and June 30, 2001,
respectively. NetZero expects this trend to continue for at least the next quarter as total billable subscribers increase.

    In the three sequential quarters in the period ended March 31, 2001, there has been an increase in gross loss as a result of the growth in the free user base noted above and
NetZero's inability to monetize those users. With the introduction of billable services and usage limitations on free services, this trend reversed in the quarter ending June 30, 2001. In the
future, NetZero plans to further reduce the number of free hours per household per month which is intended to positively impact gross margin.

    In the three sequential quarters in the period ended March 31, 2001, NetZero's net loss has increased as a result of declining revenues and increased cost of sales. This trend
reversed in the quarter ended June 30, 2001 due to an increase in the number of billable users and a decrease in telecommunications costs associated with the free service. In addition, NetZero expects
to reduce operating expenses following the completion of major advertising commitments in the quarter ended June 30, 2001 and other planned operating cost reductions in the remainder of
calendar 2001.

NETZERO'S MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements based on NetZero's current expectations, estimates and projections about
NetZero's operations, industry, financial condition and liquidity. Words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "believes," "may," "will" or similar expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are
forward-looking statements. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, NetZero's actual
results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. The section entitled "Risk Factors" set forth in this document
discusses some of the important risk factors that may affect NetZero's business, results of operations and financial condition. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any
forward-looking statements, other than as required by law.

Overview  

    NetZero is a leading provider of Internet access services and online targeted marketing solutions. NetZero offers consumers access to the Internet,
e-mail and customizable navigation tools. NetZero's services are currently available in more than 5,000 cities across the United States and Canada. In addition to offering consumers access
to the Internet, NetZero offers mass marketers targeting capabilities through numerous online advertising channels. NetZero also offers advertisers and commerce partners a variety of additional
services to build their brands and market their products, including referring its users to partners' Web sites, enabling customer registrations and facilitating electronic commerce transactions.
NetZero's CyberTarget division offers marketers and advertisers mass-scale, online market research and measurement services. 

    NetZero
incorporated in July 1997 and launched its free Internet access service in October 1998. During that period, it had no revenues and its operating activities
related primarily to the development of its proprietary zCast software. Since October 1998, NetZero has focused on building its Internet access business and the NetZero brand. 

    In January 2001, NetZero began limiting its free Internet service to a maximum of 40 hours per household per calendar month. Households desiring to exceed the
40 hour limitation are currently offered the opportunity to sign up for an Extended Access Pass, a plan that provides households the option to pay a fee, currently set at $9.95, to allow them
access to the service for the remainder of the calendar month. If these households elect not to pay a fee when they reach the 40 hour limit during a

given month they will be denied access to service for the remainder of the month, but their account will not be terminated and they can begin accessing the service for free at the beginning of the
next month. NetZero intends to decrease the monthly limit per household to 10 hours in October 2001 and to eliminate its free service in certain areas with higher telecommunications costs. The
implementation of these measures may be altered or modified.

    In March 2001, NetZero launched a new service called NetZero Platinum. The NetZero Platinum service offers Internet service for a monthly fee, currently $9.95, that is in most
respects the same as NetZero's standard free service except that an hourly limitation does not apply and the service features a small toolbar without the advertising banners currently included in the
ZeroPort on the free service. There can be no assurance that these new products and services will meet with commercial success.

    Through
June 30, 2001, approximately 8.8 million users registered for its Internet access services, of which approximately 3.4 million used the service in the month of
June. Approximately 210,000 of these users were subscribers of one of its pay Internet access services as of June 30, 2001. 

    In
December 1999, NetZero acquired AimTV, which has developed a patent-pending technology to run broadcast quality television commercials over narrowband Internet connections
resulting in the launch of NZTV in May 2000. NetZero paid total consideration of $23.7 million to acquire AimTV. In 

August 2000, NetZero acquired Simpli.com, which has developed proprietary technologies to enhance its banner targeting and personalization capabilities. In September 2000, it acquired
RocketCash, which has developed a secure, flexible-currency-shopping technology enabling consumers to make purchases on the Internet with or without a credit card. NetZero paid total consideration of
$23.5 million and $30.2 million to acquire Simpli.com and RocketCash, respectively. In November 2000, it acquired certain tangible and intangible assets of one of its competitors,
Freei, a free Internet access provider, for approximately $4.7 million. The assets acquired primarily included the domain names "Freeinternet.com," "Freeinet.com" and "Freei.net", certain
proprietary rights, certain fixed assets, and the rights to market the NetZero service to Freei users. All of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. During
the quarter ended March 31, 2001, NetZero determined that the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with these acquisitions was impaired. As a result, NetZero
recorded an impairment charge totaling $48.6 million. On August 1, 2001 NetZero sold substantially all of the assets of RocketCash for approximately $2.4 million. Subsequent to
the sale, all other operations of RocketCash are being discontinued. The sale of RocketCash's assets did not result in the recognition of a significant gain or loss.

Revenues  

    NetZero generates revenues through advertising and commerce transactions, fees for its Internet access services, sales of CDs incorporating its Internet access
software, and through the sale or license of its data. Its advertising and commerce related revenues consist of fees from the placement of media, direct marketing agreements, referring its users to
partners' Web sites, enabling customer registrations for partners, and facilitating electronic commerce transactions. NetZero's fees for Internet access services consist of monthly fees for users who
elect to exceed the monthly limit on the number of free hours of Internet access NetZero offers and monthly subscription fees from its users who choose to receive service without the banner
advertising window in the ZeroPort. NetZero generates revenues from the license or sale of its data through its CyberTarget division by offering marketers, advertisers and market research companies
mass-scale, online market research and measurement services. In the quarter ended June 30, 2001 NetZero experienced a significant shift in its revenue mix. In the quarter ended
June 30, 2001, billable services revenue accounted for 36% of total revenues compared to less than 1% of total revenues in the quarter ended June 30, 2000. NetZero expects billable
services to continue to increase as a percentage of total revenues in the future. NetZero began offering CyberTarget services in the December 2000 quarter. To date, these services have not made
a significant contribution to revenues.

    Advertising and Commerce Revenues.
  For the year ended June 30, 2001, NetZero recognized $50.6 million in
advertising and commerce revenues compared to $54.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2000. NetZero sells both targeted and non-targeted advertising on its service. In
general, it receives higher advertising rates for targeted advertisements and sponsorships than for non-targeted advertisements. However, NetZero has limited experience in selling and
managing these types of arrangements and there can be no assurance that it will successfully sell all of the various advertising services it offers or intends to offer or that such arrangements will
generate significant revenues or higher advertising rates. To date, NetZero has sold targeted advertising based upon Web sites visited, key word searches, and users' demographic and geographic
information. In addition, the growth in NetZero's user base has resulted, and may result in the future, in situations where advertising inventory capacity has increased faster than its ability to sell
such inventory at desired rates. NetZero has in the past relied, and intends to rely in the future, on third parties to sell a portion of its banner advertisements, although NetZero does not believe
any third party sales relationships are material to its business. The failure of NetZero to sell inventory at reasonable rates may materially and adversely affect operating results. In addition,
success with performance-based fee arrangements may depend on NetZero's ability to effectively target users. NetZero is still in the early stages of that process and may encounter technical and other
limitations on its ability to successfully target users, including limitations

associated with privacy concerns. There can be no assurance that it will adequately perform under these arrangements or that it will be able to replace such arrangements on comparable terms, if at
all. The failure to generate significant relationships with advertisers or the failure to replace significant contracts when they expire could adversely affect NetZero's revenues, results of
operations and financial position. 

    NetZero has recently implemented limitations on the number of hours a household can access its free services and it intends to implement additional limitations in the future. NetZero
also intends to limit

the availability of its free services in areas with higher telecommunications cost. While experience has demonstrated that limiting hours reduces telecommunications costs, NetZero also believes that
it adversely impacts its ability to maintain or increase its free user base. Decreases in NetZero's free user base and in the number of hours users are permitted to access its free service result in a
reduction of its volume of advertising inventory, which may adversely affect its advertising revenues.

    Banner
advertising and sponsorship revenues are recognized in the periods in which the advertisement or sponsorship placement is displayed, based upon the lesser of impressions
delivered over the total number of guaranteed impressions or ratably over the period in which the advertisement is displayed, provided that no significant obligations on its part remain, fees are
fixed and determinable, and collection of the related receivable is probable. NetZero's obligations typically include the guarantee of a minimum number of impressions or the satisfaction of other
performance criteria. A guaranteed minimum number of impressions are generally required to be delivered over the term of the commitment. Revenues from performance-based arrangements, including
click-throughs, are recognized as the related performance criteria are met. Referral revenues are recognized in the periods in which the referrals are made to advertisers' or sponsors' Web sites,
provided that no significant obligations on NetZero's part remain, fees are fixed and determinable, and collection of the related receivable is probable. 

    NetZero
generally invoices customers at the end of its performance, such as at the completion of an advertising campaign or service sponsorship. In addition, certain customers are
invoiced for sponsorships and other commitments on a quarterly basis. Recently there has been a reduction in the growth of online advertising and currently a number of its customers hold back a
significant amount of their advertising dollars spent with NetZero until the last month of a quarter. Such practices may result in extended average days sales outstanding at the end of a fiscal
quarter. 

    NetZero's
advertising revenues are subject to the effects of seasonality. Advertisers typically purchase impressions on a forward basis. If purchasing patterns or timing of purchasing
by advertisers were to change, its financial position and results of operations could be materially affected. 

    Advertising
on the Internet, particularly the products and services NetZero offers, is a relatively new and changing industry, and there is no assurance that the products and services
NetZero offers now, or in the future, will meet with commercial acceptance. Internet advertising rates have been declining rapidly, and it is possible that rates will continue to decline in the
future. Many of the purchasers of Internet advertising have been companies with Internet-based business models. Certain of these companies have come under financial pressure and have not been able to
access the capital markets to fund their operations. This trend has impacted NetZero's ability to generate revenues and could continue to do so in the future. This trend could also result in increased
allowances for doubtful accounts. 

    Due to market forces and other factors, NetZero's revenues and results of operations may fluctuate from period to period. NetZero has experienced four consecutive quarters of
decreased revenues and there can be no assurance that NetZero will not experience decreased revenues in sequential quarters in future periods.

    NetZero
does not currently anticipate that inflation will have a material impact on its results of operations. 

    NetZero has entered into barter transactions on an extremely limited basis and, for the periods presented, barter revenue accounts for less than 1% of its total net revenue. 

    Billable Services Revenue.
  For the year ended June 30, 2001, NetZero recognized $6.7 million in billable
services revenue compared to $0.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2000. NetZero began limiting usage of its free Internet access in January 2001 and simultaneously launched
the extended Access Pass, a plan which provides households the option to pay a fee, currently set at $9.95, to allow them to access the service for the remainder of the calendar month. In
March 2001 NetZero launched a new billable service called NetZero Platinum. The NetZero Platinum service offers Internet service for a monthly fee, at a standard rate of $9.95, and provides
users with unlimited Internet access each month and features a thin toolbar without advertising banners currently included in the ZeroPort on its free service. NetZero has a very limited history with
billable services.

    Billable services revenues are recognized in the period in which the fees are fixed and determinable and the related products or services are provided to the user. Billable services
revenue primarily consists of subscription fees that NetZero receives from users of its fee-based access services. NetZero generally requires that its subscribers pre-pay for
their services, which results in the deferral of certain revenues into the period in which the access services are provided. Billable services also consists of fees charged to active users in
connection with providing live technical support. NetZero has a very limited history with respect to its various billable services and there can be no assurances that it will be able to generate
significant revenues from these services. NetZero's standard pricing plan is currently $9.95 per month, or $49.95 for six months, although NetZero occasionally offers discounted promotional pricing
plans or modified plans in conjunction with third parties. NetZero continually evaluates the desirability and effectiveness of its plans, and may in the future make changes to its pricing plans or
offer different discounted promotions. Future changes in NetZero's plans and promotional discounts may adversely impact the number of billable service subscriptions and the amount of revenues NetZero
receives for such subscriptions.

Cost of Revenues  

    Cost of revenues consists of telecommunications costs, depreciation of network equipment, credit card processing fees, bill processing and billing support
costs, customer support costs, occupancy costs, and personnel and related expenses of the network department. NetZero has expended significant funds on its network infrastructure, and, while it will
expend additional funds on capital expenditures in the

future, NetZero currently anticipates that capital expenditures will decrease from historical levels. Capital expenditures may fluctuate based on the number of users, user growth and usage patterns,
as well as needs associated with acquired businesses and new products. Telecommunications costs for network access are expensed as incurred. NetZero's failure to accurately forecast users' needs could
result in significant over-capacity, which would adversely impact its results of operations. Due to limitations NetZero has imposed on the number of hours users may access its free
service, NetZero may have significant over-capacity in future periods. Conversely, under-forecasting usage could adversely impact the ability of users to receive adequate service and
adversely impact its reputation and its ability to maintain or increase its user base. NetZero has limited history in forecasting its user requirements, and there can be no assurance that it will be
able to accurately forecast such requirements in the future.

Operating Expenses  

    Sales and Marketing.
  Sales and marketing expenses include advertising and promotion expenses, salaries, sales
commissions, employee benefits, travel and related expenses for its in-house sales force, fees paid to third-party advertising sales agents and sales support functions. In the past,
NetZero has expended significant amounts on sales and marketing, including a national branding campaign comprised of television, radio, print and outdoor advertising, sponsorships and a variety of
other promotions and, due to the timing of these promotions, amounts expended have varied significantly 

from period to period. NetZero has in place significant marketing obligations, some of which expired in June 2001. While NetZero intends to significantly reduce its marketing expenses, it has
little experience marketing pay services and there can be no assurance NetZero will be able to decrease its marketing expenses as currently anticipated. Marketing costs associated with increasing
brand awareness and user base are expensed in the period incurred. 

    Product Development.
  Product development costs include expenses for the development of new or improved technologies and
products, including salaries and related expenses for the software engineering department, as well as costs for contracted services, facilities and equipment. NetZero is currently evaluating its
product development programs and may reduce its expenses in the near term. However, there can be no assurance NetZero will be able to decrease its product development expenses as currently
anticipated. 

    General and Administrative.
  General and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits and expenses for
executive, finance, legal, human resources and internal customer support personnel. In addition, general and administrative expenses include fees for professional services, third-party customer
support, bad debt expense and occupancy costs. 

    Amortization of Intangible Assets.
  Amortization of intangible assets includes amortization of goodwill, purchased
technologies and other identifiable intangible assets associated with NetZero's various acquisitions. During the quarter ended March 31, 2001, NetZero determined that the carrying value of
goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with several acquisitions was impaired. Specific events and changes in circumstances that precipitated the impairment included the following: 


A
significant and sustained decline in advertising and commerce revenues generated by NetZero's free Internet access service. 

NetZero's
determination that advertising and commerce revenues for Internet-based companies were unlikely to recover in the near future or reach the levels
initially projected.


NetZero's
assessment of the effectiveness and the resulting impact on operating results of certain acquired assets (Simpli.com, RocketCash and Freei)
following their integration into NetZero's free Internet access service in the second quarter of fiscal 2001.


The
loss of certain key customers and the renegotiation of certain existing advertising agreements. 

The
development of revised projections for NetZero's free Internet access business, reflecting revised assumptions related to advertising and commerce
revenue which prompted a shift in NetZero's business model from a free Internet access model to a billable Internet access model. 

    Market
and other indicators that suggested that an impairment charge might by required include: 


Reduced
levels of venture capital funding activity for Internet-based consumer businesses, which have historically represented a significant concentration
of NetZero's advertising and commerce customers. 

Significant
declines in the fair market value for NetZero's common stock. 

Significant
declines in market value for other Internet related businesses. 

    These
events have and are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on NetZero's results of operations and liquidity as NetZero implements its alternative strategy of developing
its billable Internet access service. 

    Asset
impairment tests were performed at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The tests were performed by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, plus a terminal value for future cash flows, to the carrying amount of the goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from purchase business combinations.
Based on the results of these tests, it was determined that goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets initially 

recorded in connection with the acquisitions of AimTV, Simpli.com, RocketCash and Freei were impaired. 

    Impairment
related to the Simpli.com, AimTV and Freei goodwill and identifiable intangible assets was measured based on revised cash flow projections for NetZero's free Internet
access business model. Significant assumptions related to the cash flow projections utilized to assess impairment include the following: 


NetZero
will implement a revised business strategy focused on attracting and monetizing billable customers. As a result, the number of active free
customers acquired by NetZero will be significantly less than previous projections. 

NetZero
will continue to limit the amount of time per month available to free users. 

NetZero
will focus its operating and financial resources on acquiring billable users and no longer expend significant resources promoting and enhancing its
free Internet access service.


The
average advertising and commerce revenue per free user will not, in the foreseeable future, rebound to historic levels or to levels reflected in
previous projections as a result of the change in NetZero's business model and continued weakness in online advertising.

    Impairment related to RocketCash was determined based on the fact that NetZero intended to discontinue the operations of this business.

    NetZero determined the fair value of the impaired assets using the discounted cash flow method and considered data provided by the market comparison method to verify the results of
the discounted cash flow method. The results of the market comparison method served, in general, as supporting evidence for the conclusions derived from the discounted cash flow analysis, which
indicated a substantial decrease in the fair value of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets associated with NetZero's free Internet access service. The market data indicated a substantial
and sustained decrease in market valuations for publicly traded Internet access companies. Market data related to private company transactions indicated a substantial decrease in both the average
transaction price and the number of transactions completed. Further, market data indicated an increase in the number of Internet companies that have recently ceased operations. In aggregate, the
market data demonstrated substantially decreased valuations and liquidity and increased risk associated with Internet companies and related technologies.

    An
impairment charge totaling $48.6 million was recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2001, reflecting the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets
exceeded their respective fair values. The impairment charge consisted of $33.5 million for goodwill and $15.1 million for other acquired intangible assets. No impairment charge was
recorded during fiscal 2000. 

    As of June 30, 2001, NetZero had approximately $1.5 million in remaining intangible assets on its balance sheet, primarily related to costs incurred to acquire and
develop patents and trademarks. Decreases in the fair value of these assets, or assets acquired as a result of future acquisitions, could result in its recording impairment losses with respect to some
or all such assets. Any such loss could adversely and materially impact its results of operations and financial position.

Stock-Based Charges  

    In connection with the grant of stock options and restricted stock to employees, the imposition of restrictions on shares of stock held by founders, the
issuance of restricted shares of stock in connection with the recent acquisitions and the issuance of warrants in connection with various marketing programs, NetZero recorded deferred stock-based
charges, which are being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable shares.

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2001 Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2000

Revenues

    Advertising and Commerce.
  Advertising and commerce revenues for the year ended June 30, 2001 were
$50.6 million, which represented a decrease of $4.3 million, or 8%, from $54.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2000. The decrease in revenues is attributable to
softness in the on-line advertising market, a related decrease in advertising rates and the termination of the AdSmart and LookSmart agreements, partially offset by increased revenues from
our agreements with General Motors and Cisco.

    For the year ended June 30, 2001, these agreements in total represented approximately 50% of total advertising and commerce revenues, compared to 47% for the year ended
June 30, 2000.

    The AdSmart and the LookSmart agreements were terminated in February 2000 and January 2001, respectively. Adsmart was a third party advertising reseller and LookSmart
provided search and other functionality on NetZero's start page. While NetZero has entered into agreements with other third parties to provide these services, the revenues generated from these third
parties are significantly less than we received under our agreements with Adsmart and LookSmart. The Cisco agreement terminates on August 31, 2001 and it is currently anticipated that this
agreement will not be replaced. The General Motors agreement ends in December 2003. NetZero currently anticipates that the General Motors agreement will not be renewed on similar terms.

    Billable Services.
  Billable services revenues for the year ended June 30, 2001 were $6.7 million, which
represented an increase of $6.1 million from $0.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2000. The increase in revenues was due to the launch of the NetZero Platinum and the Extended
Access Pass billable Internet service plans during the quarter ended March 31, 2001.

Cost of Revenues

    Cost of revenues for the year ended June 30, 2001 was $86.4 million, which represented an increase of $22.5 million, or 35%, from
$63.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2000. The 35% increase in cost of revenues is wholly attributable to increased telecommunications costs. The increase in telecommunications
costs is a result of an increase in monthly active users, which increased approximately 70% from June 30, 2000 to June 30, 2001, partially offset by a reduction in the average cost of
telecommunications per user hour from less than $0.20 per hour for the year ended June 30, 2000 to less than $0.15 per hour for the year ended June 30, 2001.

Operating Expenses

    Sales and Marketing.
  Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended June 30, 2001 were $62.2 million,
which represented an increase of $10.8 million, or 21%, from $51.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2000. The increase in sales and marketing expense was a result of a
$3.4 million increase in stock-based charges, a $1.9 million increase in marketing and promotion expenses, and a $900,000 increase in salary and personnel related expenses. In addition,
sales and marketing expenses included $4.2 million of expenses related to RocketCash, which was acquired in September 2000. Salary and personnel related costs increased as a result of
the implementation of NetZero's strategy of developing an internal sales force. Sales and marketing included $5.4 million of stock-based charges for the year ended June 30, 2001 compared
to $2.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2000. Stock-based charges increased due to a significant RocketCash marketing promotion in fiscal 2001.

    Product Development.
  Product development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2001 were $27.5 million,
which represented an increase of $17.5 million, or 175%, from $10.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2000. The increase in product development expense was a result of a
$6.0 million increase in stock-based charges, a $3.8 million increase in depreciation related to software and equipment used in product development and testing, a $3.0 million
increase in salary and personnel

related expenses, and a $1.0 million increase in equipment repair and maintenance expenses. In addition, product development expenses included $3.7 million of expenses related to
Simpli.com and RocketCash, which were acquired in August 2000 and September 2000, respectively. Depreciation and repair and maintenance expenses increased as a result of the purchase of
additional equipment in connection with product development and testing activities. Salary and personnel related expenses increased as a result of the hiring of additional product development
personnel by NetZero. Product development expenses included $6.3 million of stock-based charges for the year ended June 30, 2001 compared to $300,000 for the year ended June 30,
2000. Stock-based charges increased as a result of the

issuance of restricted shares and the assumption of stock options in connection with the acquisitions of Simpli.com and RocketCash.

    General and Administrative.
  General and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2001 were
$30.7 million, which represented an increase of $8.0 million, or 35%, from $22.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2000. The increase in general and administrative
expenses was the result of a $3.6 million increase in stock-based charges, a $3.2 million increase in salary and personnel related expenses, a $1.1 million increase in occupancy
and facility related expenses and a $0.8 million increase in depreciation of equipment related to general and administrative activities. In addition, general and administrative expenses
included $1.9 million of general and administrative expenses related to Simpli.com and RocketCash, which were acquired in August 2000 and September 2000, respectively. These
increases were partially offset by decreases of $1.2 million and $700,000 for customer support costs and bad debt expense, respectively. Salary and personnel related expenses increased as a
result of the hiring of additional general and administrative personnel by NetZero. Occupancy and facility related expenses increased as a result of the opening of additional regional offices in
connection with development of an internal sales force. General and administrative expenses included $7.2 million of stock-based charges for the year ended June 30, 2001 compared to
$3.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2000. Stock-based charges increased as a result of restricted stock awards issued to employees and the issuance of restricted stock and
assumption of stock options in connection with the acquisitions of Simpli.com, RocketCash and AimTV.

    Amortization of Intangible Assets.
  Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended June 30, 2001 was
$16.8 million compared to $5.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2000. The $11.3 million increase was the result of the acquisitions of Simpli.com in August 2000,
RocketCash in September 2000, and certain assets of Freei in November 2000.

    Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
  During the quarter ended March 31, 2001, NetZero determined that
the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with several acquisitions was impaired. An impairment charge totaling $48.6 million was recorded during the quarter
ended March 31, 2001, reflecting the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeded their respective fair values. The impairment charge consisted of $33.5 million for
goodwill and $15.1 million for other acquired intangible assets. No impairment charge was recorded during fiscal 2000.

Interest Income and Interest Expense

    NetZero's interest income consists of earnings on its cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Interest expense
consists of interest expense on capital leases and notes payable. Net interest income for the year ended June 30, 2001 was $9.3 million, which represented an increase of
$2.5 million from $6.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2000. The increase was due to higher average cash and short-term investment balances.

Income Taxes

    As a result of operating losses and its inability to recognize a benefit from its deferred tax assets, NetZero has not recorded a benefit for income taxes for
the years ended June 30, 2001 and 2000.

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2000 Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1999

Revenues  

    Revenues for the year ended June 30, 2000 were $55.5 million, which represented an increase of $50.9 million, or 1,098%, from
$4.6 million for the year ended June 30, 1999. The increase was attributable to increased revenue from sales of targeted and non-targeted banner advertisements primarily
through NetZero's in-house sales force and third parties, growth in the amount of start page revenue from NetZero's agreement with LookSmart as a result of the increased number of users,
and increased sponsorships on The ZeroPort. Approximately $15.7 million and $1.3 million, or 28% and 27%, of its total revenues for the years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999,
respectively, were generated from its agreement with LookSmart.

Cost of Revenues  

    Cost of revenues for the year ended June 30, 2000 was $63.9 million, which represented an increase of $51.4 million, or 412%, from
$12.5 million for the year ended June 30, 1999. The increase in cost of revenues was the result of a $51.8 million increase in telecommunications expense, a $5.7 million
increase in overhead costs associated with operating the network and a $6.4 million increase in depreciation of equipment used in the network. Telecommunications expense increased as a result
of a 233% increase in NetZero's active user base from June 30, 1999 to June 30, 2000. Depreciation and overhead costs associated with operating network equipment increased as a result of
the purchase of additional network equipment, the hiring of additional network personnel and an increase in the user base. During the year ended June 30, 2000, NetZero's cost of
telecommunications services purchased averaged less than $0.25 per user hour.

Operating Expenses  

    Sales and Marketing.
  Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended June 30, 2000 were $51.4 million,
which represented an increase of $49.7 million, or 2,945%, from $1.7 million for the year ended June 30, 1999. The increase in sales and marketing expense was a result of a
$39.4 million increase in marketing and promotion expenses, a $6.2 million increase in salary and personnel related expenses, and a $2.0 million increase in stock-based charges.
The increase in marketing and promotion expenses was a result of increased levels of advertising and other marketing activities associated with NetZero's initial major nationwide consumer branding
campaign (including the start of NetZero's exclusive sponsorship of the half-time show of televised National Basketball Association games on NBC). The increase in salary and personnel
related expense was a result of the hiring of additional sales force and marketing personnel. 

    Product Development.
  Product development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2000 were $10.0 million,
which represented an increase of $9.0 million, or 884%, from $1.0 million for the year ended June 30, 1999. The increase in product development expense is a result of a
$5.8 million increase in salary and personnel related expenses, a $1.3 million increase in depreciation of equipment used in connection with product development and testing activities,
an increase of $0.6 million in consulting fees and a $0.6 million increase in equipment maintenance expenses. The increase in salary and personnel related expenses is a result of hiring
additional software engineers. The increase in depreciation of equipment is a result of the purchase of additional equipment for product development and testing. 

    General and Administrative.
  General and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2000 were
$22.8 million, which represented an increase of $17.9 million, or 369%, from $4.9 million for the year ended June 30, 1999. The increase in general and administrative
expenses was a result of a $4.7 million increase in salary and personnel related expenses, a $3.1 million increase in customer support costs, a $2.5 million increase in
stock-based charges, a $2.2 million increase in facilities 

expenses, a $1.7 million increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts, a $1.3 million increase in consulting and professional fees, and a $1.0 million increase in
non-income taxes and licenses. The increase in salary and personnel related expenses is a result of hiring additional administrative personnel. The increase in stock-based charges was due
to the amortization of deferred stock-based compensation in connection with stock option grants and restricted founders' shares. The increase in all other expenses was due to the growth in the
business and required infrastructure. 

    Amortization of Intangible Assets.
  Amortization of intangible assets amounted to $5.5 million for the year ended
June 30, 2000 as a result of its acquisition of AimTV in December 1999. The intangible assets acquired are being amortized over a period of two to three years. 

Interest Income and Interest Expense  

    Interest income consists of earnings on its cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Interest expense consists
primarily of interest expense on capital leases and notes payable. Net interest income for the year ended June 30, 2000 was $6.8 million, which represented an increase of
$6.7 million from net interest income of $0.1 million for the year ended June 30, 1999. The increase was a result of income earned on cash balances from the proceeds of NetZero's
initial public offering and the investment by Qualcomm, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on capital leases and notes payable. 

Income Taxes  

    As a result of operating losses and the inability to recognize a benefit for its deferred tax assets, no income tax provision has been recorded for years ended
June 30, 2000 or June 30, 1999.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

    From inception of the business to June 30, 2001, NetZero's operations have been financed primarily through the sale of equity securities, cash generated
from sales of its products and services and, to a lesser extent, equipment lease financing. At June 30, 2001, it had approximately $119.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments and approximately $15.8 million in restricted cash.

    For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, net cash used for operating activities was $98.2 million consisting primarily of operating losses and increases in restricted
cash, deferred revenues and other assets, partially offset by an impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets, depreciation and amortization, stock-based charges, decreases in accounts
receivable and increases in accounts payable. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 net cash used for operating activities was $83.5 million and consisted of operating losses, deposits
to guarantee future obligations and increases in accounts receivable and other assets, partially offset by depreciation, amortization, stock-based charges and an increase in accounts payable and
accrued expenses.

    For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, net cash used for investing activities was $35.4 million of which $21.9 million represented the net increase in
short-term investments and the balance was for acquisitions and capital expenditures. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000, cash used for investing activities of
$58.1 million consisted of capital expenditures of $20.8 million and $36.4 million for the net increase in short-term investments.

    Net cash used for financing activities was $7.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 and related to payments on capital lease and notes payable obligations.
In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 cash provided by financing activities was $319.1 million and was principally attributable to the proceeds from NetZero's initial public offering
and private placement.

    NetZero's business model of offering free Internet access is predicated on receiving revenues for advertisements. However, declines in Internet advertising rates have resulted in
declining revenues and increasing gross losses over the last three sequential quarters. NetZero has limited visibility as to when, or if, online advertising rates will stabilize or increase, and they
may continue to decrease. NetZero has taken steps to address its declining revenues and increasing gross loss by introducing, in the March 2001 quarter, billable services and restrictions on
the number of free hours per household per month. In addition, it intends to implement limitations on its operating expenses, particularly with regard to its marketing expenses. NetZero has
substantially built out its network infrastructure and, in the near term, does not foresee the need for the same level of capital expenditures it has experienced in the past. In order to succeed,
NetZero must increase its revenues while controlling its telecommunications costs, its operating expenses and its capital expenditures. Many factors will impact its ability to grow revenues including,
but not limited to, the number of users who sign up for billable services, the growth or reduction in its user base, the Internet advertising market and NetZero's ability to sell its existing products
and develop new revenue generating products. Billable services are new products for NetZero. NetZero cannot assure you that its existing users or new users will sign up for these plans. In addition,
as a result of limiting the number of free hours per month, NetZero may lose a significant number of users. There can be no assurance that it will be able to effectively manage its business to
decrease its losses.

    NetZero
has invested significantly in its network infrastructure, software licenses, furniture, fixtures and equipment and it may need to make further investments in the future. The
actual amount of capital expenditures will depend on the rate of growth or reduction in its user base, which is difficult to predict and could change dramatically over time. Technological advances may
also require it to make capital expenditures to develop or acquire new equipment or technology. NetZero intends to use cash to fund its future operating losses and a combination of cash and lease
financing to fund its capital expenditures in a manner which minimizes its cost of capital. However, NetZero cannot assure you that lease financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all, and
if it is not available, NetZero would be required to use a greater portion of cash to fund its capital expenditures. 

    NetZero
currently anticipates that its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund its operating activities, capital expenditures
and other obligations for at least the next 12 months. However, NetZero may need to raise additional capital for a variety of reasons including, without limitation, in order to fund its
operations, expand its marketing activities, develop new or enhance existing services or products to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary services, businesses or technologies.
If, in the future, NetZero is not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations, it may need to raise additional capital through public or private financings, strategic relationships
or other arrangements. This additional funding, if needed, might not be available
to NetZero on acceptable terms, or at all. NetZero's failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial
condition. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage of stock owned by the then-current stockholders would be reduced. Furthermore, such
equity securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to holders of NetZero common stock. 

    NetZero
received a notice from the Nasdaq National Market that its common stock failed to maintain the required minimum bid price of $1.00 over a period of 30 consecutive trading
days. On June 27, 2001, NetZero received a Nasdaq staff determination that its common stock was subject to delisting from the Nasdaq National Market because it has not maintained compliance
with the minimum bid requirement for continued listing. NetZero has scheduled a hearing before a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel on August 17, 2001 to appeal the staff determination and to
make its request for continued listing on the Nasdaq National Market. NetZero's listing status will not change until a final determination has been issued by the panel following such hearing. NetZero
is currently in 

compliance with all other continued listing requirements. There can be no assurance, however, that the panel will grant NetZero's request for continued listing. If NetZero common stock were delisted
from the Nasdaq National Market, the ability of any potential or future investors to achieve liquidity from its common stock would be severely limited and such delisting will inhibit, if not preclude,
NetZero's ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, if at all. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

    In June 1998, The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133 "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." The statement requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments
at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the planned use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Because NetZero does not currently hold any
derivative instruments and does not engage in hedging activities, the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 133 did not have a material impact on financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. NetZero was required to implement SFAS No. 133 in the first quarter of fiscal 2001. 

    In December 1999, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101, "Revenue Recognition," which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of
revenue in financial statements filed with the SEC. SAB 101 outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition
policies. In June 2000, the SEC issued SAB 101B, which requires implementation of SAB 101 by NetZero no later than June 30, 2001. The SEC issued additional guidance in the form of its
Frequently Asked Questions and Answers document in October 2000. The adoption of SAB 101 did not have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations.

    In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 establishes new standards for
accounting and reporting requirements for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and prohibits the use of the pooling-of-interests method for combinations initiated after
June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment-only approach. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, goodwill will be tested at the
reporting unit annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. Amortization of goodwill, including goodwill recorded in past business combinations, will
cease. The adoption date for NetZero was July 1, 2001 and is expected to have a material effect on the accounting for goodwill associated with future business combinations, including the
pending mergers contemplated in this registration statement.

Future results of operations may vary due to certain factors  

    NetZero's operating results may fluctuate substantially in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of its control, including
those discussed elsewhere in this document. While NetZero currently intends to limit operating expenses, it may increase operating expenses and capital expenditures for a variety of reasons including,
without limitation, the growth in its user base, the expansion of its sales and marketing efforts, the promotion of the NetZero brand, the enhancement of the features and functionality of its
services, the development of new services and products, the integration of acquired companies, the upgrading of the internal network infrastructure, pursuit of new distribution channels and the hiring
of new personnel. Expenditures in each of these categories may vary significantly from period to period. While some expenses are fixed in the short-term, total operating expenses are
principally determined on the basis of anticipated revenues. There are risks associated with the timing and achievement of revenue targets due to a variety of factors, and there can be no assurance
that revenues will increase commensurately with expenses. NetZero believes that 

expenses will significantly exceed revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result of these and other factors, operating results may vary substantially from quarter to quarter. 

    In
addition, seasonal trends could affect revenues generated. To the extent that revenues depend on the amount of usage by users, any seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage could
affect revenues during such periods of fluctuation. NetZero anticipates that the summer and year-end vacation and holiday periods will impact user traffic levels. Moreover, the rate at
which new users sign up for NetZero service may be related to gifts or purchases of personal computers, which typically increase during the fourth calendar quarter because of the holiday season and
may decline during other periods. As a result, new user registration may be subject to seasonality. However, because NetZero's operating history is limited, it is difficult to accurately predict these
trends and plan accordingly. Since operating expenses are based on expectations of future revenues, it is possible that seasonal fluctuations could materially and adversely affect its business,
results of operations and financial condition. 

    In
addition to seasonality, there are several other factors that may cause the quarter-to-quarter revenues to fluctuate significantly, including changes in
advertising rates, fluctuations in user count, termination of material contracts, such as the LookSmart agreement, and the effect of short-term contracts which provide significant revenues
in one quarter, but do not provide significant revenues in subsequent quarters. These and other factors may cause significant fluctuations in its quarter-over-quarter revenues. 

    NetZero has previously experienced reductions in revenues from material customers and may experience additional reductions in the future. For the fiscal years ended June 30,
2001 and 2000, LookSmart accounted for 22% and 29% of its advertising and commerce revenues, respectively. The agreement with LookSmart was terminated on January 19, 2001. LookSmart provided
search functionality on its start page and on the ZeroPort, and was provided with the right to advertise third party services on NetZero's start page. After the termination of the LookSmart agreement,
NetZero experienced a significant decline in revenues derived from search functionality on its start page and its does not anticipate generating the amount of revenue from the start page that it
historically experienced. In addition, NetZero derived approximately 27% and 7% of its advertising and commerce revenues for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2001 and 2000, from its agreements
with General Motors Corporation and Cisco Systems, Inc., respectively. While NetZero has a long-term relationship with General Motors, they were recently provided reductions in
their advertising obligations. While NetZero does not currently anticipate such reductions will be material to its business, it can give no assurance that it will continue to derive the amount of
anticipated revenues from General Motors. In addition, NetZero's agreement with Cisco terminates on August 31, 2001 and will not be replaced. The termination or renegotiation of significant
agreements, as well as the timing of orders under such agreements, may cause significant fluctuations in the quarterly results. NetZero's business, results of operations and financial condition will
be materially and adversely affected if it is unable either to maintain or renew its significant agreements or to replace such agreements with similar agreements with new customers.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk  

    NetZero currently does not hold any derivative instruments and does not engage in hedging activities. Also, NetZero is not currently party to any transactions
denominated in a foreign currency. Thus, NetZero's exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations is minimal.

JUNO'S MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of Juno should be read in conjunction with the condensed
consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this document as well as its audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. This discussion
contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Juno's actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of
various factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under "Risk Factors" elsewhere in this document.

Overview  

    Juno is a leading provider of Internet access to millions of computer users throughout the United States. Juno provides multiple levels of service, including
free basic dial-up access and various billable premium Internet access services. Juno's revenues are derived primarily from the subscription fees it charges for the use of its premium services, and to
a lesser extent from the sale of advertising and from various forms of electronic commerce.

    Juno launched its basic service in April 1996. Initially, this service provided only basic dial-up e-mail services. In July 1998, Juno introduced
its first premium services, which offered features ranging from enhanced e-mail services to full access to the World Wide Web, and for which it charged subscription fees. In 1999 and 2000,
Juno announced a number of expansions of its services:


Juno's

basic service
 now provides full Internet access for free in addition to e-mail.


Juno Web
 provides competitively priced premium Internet access, supplementing the features of the basic
service with priority access to Juno's network and the reduction of some forms of on-screen advertising, as well as free live technical support and customer service for selected pricing
plans.


Juno Express
SM
 is an experimental broadband service, currently provided to a small number of
subscribers in selected markets, which is designed to offer high-speed access to the Internet through a variety of technologies.

    In December 1999, in connection with the expansion of Juno's free basic service to include full Web access, Juno upgraded all subscribers using its enhanced e-mail
service, Juno Gold, to Juno Web at no additional cost.

    In the month of June 2001, Juno had 3.3 million active subscribers, including 884,000 billable service subscribers. See " Selected Subscriber Data"
after the "Results of Operations" section for a presentation of subscriber data over the last nine fiscal quarters. Juno's base of active subscribers encompasses all registered subscriber accounts
that connected at least once during the month, together with all subscribers to a billable service, in each case regardless of the type of activity or activities engaged in by such subscribers.

    Juno classifies its revenues as follows:

(1)
Billable
services revenues, consisting of:

(a)
subscription
fees that it receives from subscribers to its premium services;

(b)
technical
support fees received when subscribers to its free basic service and subscribers to selected Juno Web pricing plans call a 900 number for live assistance from a support
technician, as well as fees for other billable services; and

(c)
fees
charged, at various times, for shipping and handling associated with mailing copies of the Juno software upon request to prospective Juno subscribers, and for
short-term consulting engagements.

(2)
Advertising
and transaction fees, consisting of revenues earned from advertisers and strategic marketing partners for displaying advertisements to, and facilitating electronic
commerce with, Juno's subscribers. These advertisements are displayed within the main Juno software while a Juno subscriber reads or writes e-mail and on Juno's Web portal site, and during
2000 and a portion of 2001 were also displayed on the persistent advertising and navigation banner shown to its free subscribers at all times while they use the Web.

(3)
Direct
product sales, consisting of revenues generated from the sale of products directly by Juno to its subscribers and the associated shipping and handling fees. Juno began
phasing out its direct product sales activities during 1999, and completed this process in August 2000.

    Juno currently offers its billable premium services under a number of pricing plans. The original list price for Juno Web was a flat rate of $19.95 per month, but since the launch of
the service, Juno has offered a number of promotions, such as a free month of service or a discounted rate for an initial or prepaid period, as well as a wide range of discounted flat-rate
plans. Currently, the most common pricing plan for Juno Web is a flat fee of $9.95 per month following a free initial month. During the first half of 2001, Juno began experimenting with reducing its
use of discounted pricing plans both in connection with offers extended to some of its existing subscribers and through selected external marketing channels. Juno intends to continue testing a variety
of pricing plans in the future to determine their impact on profitability, subscriber acquisition, and conversion and retention rates.

    Juno believes its strategy of reducing its use of discounted pricing plans was one of the factors that contributed to the increase Juno experienced of approximately 6.5% in average
monthly subscription fee revenue per billable subscriber during the second quarter of 2001 as compared with the first quarter. Juno believes these measures also caused a certain amount of subscriber
attrition, but, as projected, any revenue lost due to the decline in its billable subscriber count was counterbalanced by the higher revenues collected from the subscribers that remained and the cost
savings associated with the elimination of the usage hours of those subscribers that left the service. In part because of attrition among heavier users of our service, we experienced a decline in
average hours of Web usage per subscriber to between 18 and 19 hours per month in the second quarter, down from between 21 and 22 hours per month in the first quarter, and a corresponding decline in
related telecommunications expenses. Due in part to this increase in per-subscriber revenue and decrease in per-subscriber costs, billable services margin improved to 48.5% during the second quarter
of 2001, up from 33.0% in the first quarter. Billable services revenues increased to $24.8 million in the second quarter, up from $22.9 million in the first quarter. Juno expects
billable service revenues and related margin to decline modestly over the second half of 2001 as Juno continues managing its services in a manner consistent with its goal of maximizing both
per-subscriber and overall profitability, a strategy that is expected to cause declines in both Juno's active and billable subscriber count over time.

    In addition to Juno's dial-up premium services, Juno has also developed a broadband service, Juno Express
SM
, which is currently provided on an experimental basis to a
small number of subscribers in selected markets across the country. Juno has not undertaken any substantial amount of marketing for Juno Express to date, and, as of June 30, 2001, only a
negligible number of subscribersroughly 3,000, not all of whom had completed the installation and set-up process by such datehad signed up for broadband service through Juno
Express. Juno does not expect broadband services to represent a material portion of its subscriber base or revenues for the foreseeable future. Juno is not currently accepting any new subscriptions to
Juno Express, and it recently stopped providing the wireless version of this service when Juno's third-party wireless access vendor, Metricom, deactivated its service in August 2001. Juno currently
believes that it is likely that Juno will also discontinue the DSL version of

Juno Express, at least in its present form, in the near future. Juno has tested a cable version of Juno Express and has entered into an agreement with AOL Time Warner to utilize their cable network to
offer such services, but there are numerous operational and other issues that could impact whether Juno will be able to offer these services over AOL Time Warner's cable systems in the near term, or
at all. Furthermore, the agreement with AOL Time Warner is subject to approval by the Federal Trade Commission, and will terminate automatically if FTC approval has not been obtained within a
specified period of time. As of the date hereof, FTC approval has not been obtained.

    The expansion of Juno's free basic service to include full Web access in December 1999 caused the costs associated with operating its free basic service to increase
significantly on a quarter-over-quarter basis in each of the first three quarters of 2000 due to significantly increased telecommunications connection time per subscriber per
month. These costs, which are reflected in the Operations, free service line of its statement of operations, improved somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2000 and improved substantially further in the
first and second quarters of 2001, following the adoption of measures designed to encourage heavier users of the free service to modify their usage patterns or upgrade to a billable service.

    When Juno expanded its free service to include full Web access, the company also introduced a persistent advertising and navigation banner that is displayed to its free subscribers at
all times while they use the Web. Juno's long-term strategy contemplated generating sufficient additional revenues from this persistent advertising banner and from other advertising
inventory it controls to cover the costs associated with Juno's service expansion. However, Juno has not yet been able to generate sufficient additional revenues to cover these increased costs.
Furthermore, in December 2000, NetZero commenced legal action against Juno asserting that elements of the technology Juno uses in connection with Juno's persistent advertising and navigation
banner infringe on a United States patent issued to NetZero earlier that month. For most of the first quarter of 2001, Juno was prevented from displaying advertisements for third parties in this
persistent advertising banner due to a temporary restraining order issued in connection with this dispute. However, in April 2001, the court lifted this temporary restraining order and Juno resumed
displaying third-party advertisements in the persistent advertising banner. It is expected that, upon completion of the mergers, this legal action will be dismissed and, at the request of the parties,
the court has stayed further proceedings in this matter in anticipation of the consummation of the mergers. Please see "Juno's BusinessLegal Proceedings" for more detailed information.

    Advertising and transaction fee revenues totaled $4.6 million in the second quarter of 2001, down from $5.8 million in the first quarter. This decrease in advertising
revenues can be attributed in large part to the widely reported decline in the market for Internet advertising, and Juno expects advertising revenues to decline by a roughly comparable amount in the
third quarter. However, the dollar value of Juno's backlog of advertising contractsthat is, commitments by advertisers to run advertising over its serviceremained flat
quarter-over-quarter at about $7 million as of June 30, 2001.

    The combination of operations, free service expenses and the portion of cost of revenues that is associated with the free service averaged approximately $0.62 per active free
subscriber per month in the second quarter. This is an improvement of 23.4% compared with the cost of $0.81 per month reported for the preceding quarter, due in large part to the measures Juno
implemented to address resource consumption by heavier users of the free service as well as a reduction in its

telecommunications rates. The spread between this per-subscriber cost of $0.62 and our per-subscriber revenues, which totaled approximately $0.43 per month in the second quarter, improved by 36.7%
quarter-over-quarter, to $0.19 in the second quarter, down from $0.30 in the first quarter. Juno currently expects revenues associated with the free basic service to continue to be exceeded for some
time by the sum of the expenses reported on the operations, free service line and the portion of the cost of revenues line associated with the free service. Juno's business may suffer if the market
for Internet-based advertising erodes further or fails to recover or if Juno is unable to sustain the

reductions in per-subscriber cost it has achieved over the past several quarters. Please see "Risk Factors that May Affect Future ResultsOur revenues would significantly decrease if we
lose key marketing and advertising relationships."

    During the second quarter of 2001, approximately 84% of Juno's revenues came from billable services, while the remaining 16% came from advertising and transaction fees. Juno currently
expects its mix of revenues to shift further toward billable services in the third quarter of 2001.

    Juno's
competitors for billable services revenues and advertising and transaction fees revenues include companies that have substantially greater market presence, and financial,
technical, distribution, marketing, and other resources than Juno has. This competitive environment could have a variety of harmful effects on Juno, including, among other things, necessitating
advertising rate reductions or price reductions for Juno's billable services, or placing Juno at a competitive disadvantage if, as Juno currently believes is likely, the company does not maintain or
increase its spending in areas such as marketing and product development. 

    As of June 30, 2001, Juno held a total of $42.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. Juno believes that changes in the market environment over the past year have
increased the value of corporate cash reserves as well as the relative importance of bringing expenses more in line with revenues and reducing reliance on external sources of capital. In the second
quarter of 2001, Juno reduced its net loss by 73.2% compared with the first quarter of 2001, and by 94.0% compared with the second quarter of 2000. Juno currently projects that its net loss for the
entire second half of 2001 will total less than $2.0 million.

    Juno is subject to industry trends that affect Internet access providers generally, including seasonality and subscriber cancellations. Juno believes Internet access providers may
incur higher expenses during the last and first calendar quarters, corresponding to heavier usage during the fall and winter, and may experience relatively lighter usage and relatively fewer account
registrations during the summer. Juno believes some subscriber acquisition methods also tend to be most effective during the first and last calendar quarters of each year, and if Juno were to pursue
such subscriber acquisition activities at some point in the future, Juno may take these types of seasonal effects into consideration in scheduling such marketing campaigns. Although Juno has relied
heavily on direct mail in the past, for the past year Juno has suspended substantially all use of direct mail and does not currently plan to use either this

channel or other cash-intensive marketing channels for subscriber acquisition in the near term. The results of operations of Internet access providers, including those of Juno, are
significantly affected by subscriber cancellations. The failure to retain subscribers to its billable premium services, or an increase in the rate of cancellations of those services, may cause its
business and financial results to suffer. Advertising revenues also depend in part on the size of its overall active subscriber base. Any further reduction in its overall active subscriber base due to
subscriber attrition or to a reduction in the rate at which new users sign up for its service would reduce further the amount of ad inventory it has available to sell and may also have the effect of
reducing its advertising revenue.

    Juno's
principal expenses consist of telecommunications, customer service, personnel and related costs, and marketing. Juno has elected to obtain a number of services principally from
third-party providers. Services obtained from such providers include telecommunications services, customer service and technical support, and services related to the sale of certain advertising
inventory and the delivery of the associated advertisements. Juno's business and financial results would be harmed were Juno no longer able to obtain these services at competitive rates. 

    Juno has incurred net losses of $291.6 million from its inception on June 30, 1995 through June 30, 2001. Juno has relied primarily on sales of equity securities,
totaling $300 million through June 30, 2001, to fund its operations. Included in this amount are $81.1 million of net proceeds from Juno's February 2000
follow-on offering of common stock, $77.3 million of net proceeds from Juno's May 1999 initial public offering of common stock, $61.9 million of net proceeds from
Juno's

March 1999 private placement of Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock, which automatically converted into shares of common stock upon the closing of the initial public
offering, and $225,000 of net proceeds from sales of Juno's common stock under its "equity line" facility, which Juno secured in October 2000. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this
section for additional information about this facility.

Results of Operations  

Six Months Ended June 30, 2001 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2000

 Revenues

    Total revenues increased $4.5 million, to $58.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $53.6 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2000, an increase of 8.3%. This increase was due to a $12.5 million improvement in billable service revenues, partially offset by a $6.7 million reduction in
advertising and transaction fees and a decline of $1.3 million in direct product sales revenues.

    Billable Services.
  Billable service revenues increased $12.5 million, to $47.7 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2001 from $35.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000, an increase of 39.3%. This increase was due to a greater number of billable service subscribers and
higher average monthly revenue per subscriber in the six months ended June 30, 2001, as compared with the year-ago period. For more information regarding Juno's billable service subscribers,
see "Selected Subscriber Data" later in this section.

    Advertising and Transaction Fees.
  Advertising and transaction fee revenues decreased $6.7 million, to
$10.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $17.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000, a decrease of 39.3%. This decrease was due largely to the
decline in the market for Internet advertising. Barter transactions accounted for approximately 1.7% and 1.9% of total revenues and 9.3% and 6.0% of advertising and transaction fees for the six months
ended June 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Direct Product Sales.

    Juno stopped conducting direct product sales activities in August 2000 and has not sold any merchandise or recorded any revenue related to such sales
since then. Direct product sales totaled $1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000.

 Cost of Revenues

    Total cost of revenues increased approximately $1.4 million, to $31.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from
$29.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000, an increase of 4.6%. This increase was due to a $3.5 million increase in costs associated with providing billable services to
a substantially larger number of billable subscribers, partially offset by decreases of $0.9 million in costs associated with advertising and transaction fees and of $1.3 million in
costs associated with direct product sales.

    Billable Services.
  Cost of revenues related to billable services consists primarily of the costs of providing billable
premium services, including telecommunications, customer service, operator-assisted technical support, credit card fees, and personnel and related overhead costs. In addition, during the six months
ended June 30, 2001, cost of revenues related to billable services included the costs of mailing copies of the Juno software upon request to prospective Juno subscribers, who had to pay for
delivery of the disks at that time, a practice Juno had discontinued for most of 2000.

    Cost of revenues related to billable services increased $3.5 million, to $28.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $24.6 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2000, an increase of

14.2%. This increase was due to the increased cost of providing Juno's billable premium services to a substantially larger number of subscribers as compared to the year-ago period, including
$2.8 million of increased telecommunications costs, $0.4 million of increased credit card fees and $0.4 million of increased personnel and related costs, partially offset by a
reduction in customer service costs. Costs related to the provision of Juno's billable premium services, principally telecommunications, customer service, and technical support expenses, accounted for
86.0% of the total costs of revenues related to billable services during the six months ended June 30, 2001. These expenses accounted for 88.4% of the equivalent costs of revenues during the
six months ended June 30, 2000. Cost of billable service revenues as a percentage of billable service revenues improved to 58.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from 69.9% for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. This percentage improvement was due primarily to customer service and telecommunications costs, which as a percentage of billable service revenues decreased by 5.6%
and 5.4%, respectively. The decrease in customer service costs both as a percentage of billable service revenues and in absolute dollars resulted from a 22.3% drop in customer service call volume,
which was achieved partially through the expanded use of Juno's automated e-mail-based customer service system. The improvement in telecommunications costs as a percentage of billable service revenues
was largely attributable to reduced average telecommunications rates and decreased hours of usage per subscriber.

    Advertising and Transaction Fees.
  Cost of revenues for advertising and transaction fees consists primarily of the
transmission costs associated with downloading advertisements to the hard drives of subscribers' computers for later display, the personnel and related costs associated with the creation and
distribution of these advertisements, and the costs associated with reporting the results of ad campaigns to advertisers.

    Cost of revenues for advertising and transaction fees decreased $0.9 million, to $3.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $4.0 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2000, a decrease of 21.8%. This decrease was due to the decline in advertising and transaction fee revenues associated with continued weakness in the market for
Internet advertising. Cost of revenues related to advertising and transaction fees as a percentage of advertising and transaction fees increased to 30.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2001
from 23.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2000. This deterioration is due to a decrease in economies of scale resulting from a reduction in average deal sizes in the six months ended
June 30, 2001 as compared to the year-ago period.

    Direct Product Sales.
  Cost of revenues for direct product sales consists primarily of the costs of merchandise sold
directly by Juno to its subscribers and the associated shipping and handling costs. 

    Juno stopped conducting direct product sales activities in August 2000 and has not incurred any costs since then. The cost of revenues for direct product sales was
$1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000.

Operating Expenses  

    Operations, Free Service.
  Operations, free service expenses represent the costs associated with providing Juno's free
basic service. Costs consist principally of telecommunications costs, expenses associated with providing customer service, depreciation of network equipment, and personnel and related overhead costs. 

    Expenses associated with operations, free service decreased approximately $5.4 million to $10.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from
$15.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000, a decrease of 34.5%. This decrease was primarily due to a $5.1 million reduction in telecommunications costs driven primarily
by measures Juno implemented to encourage heavier users of its free service to modify their usage patterns or upgrade to a billable service. These measures have caused a decrease in Juno's active free
subscriber count and in the average number of hours that each remaining active free service subscriber used the Web.

    Subscriber Acquisition.
  Subscriber acquisition costs include all costs incurred to acquire subscribers to either Juno's
free basic service or its billable premium services. These costs have historically included the cost of direct mail campaigns, advertising through conventional and computer-based media, telemarketing,
the production of advertisements to be displayed over the Juno services and transmission of such advertisements to its subscribers, disk duplication and fulfillment, and bounties paid to acquire
subscribers, including fees paid under stock-based subscriber referral agreements where payment is made primarily or entirely through the issuance of shares of common stock, among other marketing
activities. These costs also include various subscriber retention activities, as well as personnel and related overhead costs.

    Subscriber acquisition costs decreased $72.3 million, to $10.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $82.9 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2000, a decrease of 87.2%. This decrease was primarily due to Juno not repeating in the six months ended June 30, 2001 the extensive direct mail campaigns undertaken during the
same period in the prior year, as well as Juno suspending other marketing activities such as most television, radio, outdoor and other advertising campaigns. These reductions in marketing activities
contributed $67.5 million to the improvement. The remaining improvement resulted primarily from reductions in customer service costs associated with the initial sign-up of new subscribers and
the retention of existing subscribers, as well as reductions in subscriber referral payments and in personnel and related costs. These three factors were responsible for decreases of
$1.7 million, $1.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively. As a percentage of revenues, subscriber acquisition costs decreased to 18.3% in the six months ended June 30,
2001 from 154.6% in the six months ended June 30, 2000.

    Sales and Marketing.
  Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the personnel and related overhead costs of the
following departments: advertising sales and business development; direct product sales; and product marketing. Also included are costs associated with trade advertising intended to support Juno's
advertising sales effort, corporate branding activities unrelated to subscriber acquisition, and public relations, as well as advertising production, advertising transmission, customer service and
fulfillment costs associated with Juno's direct product sales activities. 

    Sales and marketing costs decreased $2.2 million, to $7.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $9.2 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2000, a decrease of 23.8%. This decrease was due primarily to a reduction of $1.1 million in personnel and related costs and of $0.9 million in expenditures for trade
advertising. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing costs improved to 12.1% in the six months ended June 30, 2001 from 17.2% in the six months ended June 30, 2000.

    Product Development.
  Product development includes research and development expenses and other product development
costs. These costs consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs. 

    Product development costs decreased approximately $1.0 million, to $4.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $5.6 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2000, a decrease of 18.8%. This decrease was due to a decline in personnel costs in both Juno's domestic and India offices.

    General and Administrative.
  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead
costs associated with executive, finance, legal, recruiting, human resources and facilities functions, as well as various professional expenses. 

    General and administrative costs increased $2.1 million, to $6.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $4.3 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2000, an increase of 49.4%. This increase was due to legal fees of $1.7 million associated with Juno's defense of various claims brought against it by third parties, and
provisions of $0.9 million for uncollectible receivables, partially offset by a reduction in personnel and related costs. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative costs increased
to approximately 11.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from 8.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2000.

    Merger costs.
  Merger costs consist of expenses Juno incurred in connection with the mergers.

Other income (expense)

    Interest Income, Net.
  Interest income, net decreased $2.3 million to $1.1 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2001, from $3.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000, a decrease of 67.4%. This decrease was due primarily to interest income earned on lower average cash
balances in the six months ended June 30, 2001 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2000. Interest income, net includes interest expense of $32,000 and $91,000 for the six months
ended June 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

    Other expense.
  Other expense equaled $0.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001. This amount
relates to the impairment in value of an equity position Juno holds in a company. Juno did not incur any costs associated with this operating expense line during the same period in the prior year.

Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1999    

Revenues  

    Total revenues increased $62.0 million, to $114.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $52.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 119%. This increase was due to increases in billable services of $39.4 million and in advertising and transaction fees of $26.0 million,
partially offset by a decrease in direct product sales of $3.4 million. 

    Billable Services.
  Billable services revenues increased $39.4 million, to $73.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2000 from $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 114%. This increase was due primarily to a greater number of billable service
subscribers in the year ended December 31, 2000, as compared with the much smaller number in the year ago period, partially offset by lower average monthly revenue per subscriber. 

    Advertising and Transaction Fees.
  Advertising and transaction fees increased $26.0 million, to
$38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 206%. This increase was due to the increase in
Web-enabled subscribers associated with the expansion of Juno's free basic service to include full Web access. Juno believes this expansion made its subscriber base and ad inventory more
attractive to some categories of advertisers, particularly those interested in attracting traffic to their own Web sites, and may account in part for its year-over-year
increase in sales. Barter transactions accounted for approximately 2.8% and 1.5% of total revenues and 8.2% and 6.2% of advertising and transaction fees for the years ended December 31, 2000
and 1999, respectively. 

    Direct Product Sales.
  Direct product sales decreased $3.4 million, to $1.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000 from $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, a decrease of 70.4%. This decline reflects Juno's strategic decision to cease its direct product sales
activities and focus instead on other forms of electronic commerce. Specifically, Juno decided to concentrate on forming strategic marketing alliances and developing other uses for its advertising
inventory that it believes should generate revenues with higher margins than direct product sales. Juno stopped conducting direct product sales activities in August 2000. 

Cost of Revenues  

    Total cost of revenues increased $24.7 million, to $58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $33.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 73.0%. This increase was due primarily to increases in costs associated with billable services of $24.1 million and in advertising 

and transaction fees of $3.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with direct product sales of $2.8 million. 

    Billable Services.
  Cost of revenues related to billable services increased approximately $24.1 million, to
$49.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 96.5%. This increase was due primarily to the
costs of providing Juno's billable subscription services to a substantially larger number of subscribers as compared with the number of subscribers in the year-ago period. Costs related to
the provision of these billable subscription services, principally telecommunications, customer service, and technical support expenses, accounted for 92.9% of the total costs of revenues related to
billable services during the year ended December 31, 2000 and accounted for $22.8 million of the increase. These expenses accounted for 91.0% of the total costs of revenues during the
year ended December 31, 1999. Cost of billable services revenues as a percentage of billable services revenues improved to 66.3% for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 72.2% for the
year ended December 31, 1999. This percentage improvement was due primarily to decreases in customer service costs, decreases in personnel and related overhead costs, and the elimination of
costs associated with a consulting contract in 2000 that existed in 1999. These three factors were responsible for decreases as a percentage of billable services revenues equal to 7.1%, 1.6% and 1.0%,
respectively. Partially offsetting these improvements were increases in telecommunications costs which, as a percentage of billable services revenues, increased by 4.4% over this period. Increased
hours of usage were responsible for the rise in telecommunications costs as a percentage of billable services revenues. 

    Advertising and Transaction Fees.
  Cost of revenues for advertising and transaction fees increased $3.4 million,
to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 73.6%. This increase was due to the increase in
advertising and transaction fee revenue associated with the increase in Web-enabled subscribers due to the expansion of Juno's free basic service to include full Web access. Cost of
revenues related to advertising and transaction fees as a percentage of advertising and transaction fees improved to 21.0% for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 36.9% for the year ended
December 31, 1999. Decreased telecommunications rates, and faster average connection speeds contributed 6.7% to the percentage improvement. Economies of scale achieved as a result of an
increase in average deal sizes, and enhancements in Juno's production and distribution methods provided the remainder of the percentage improvement. 

    Direct Product Sales.
  The cost of revenues for direct product sales decreased approximately $2.8 million, to
$1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $4.2 million for the year ended December 31,
1999, a decrease of 67.8%. This decrease corresponds to the decrease in merchandise sold. The cost of revenues for direct product sales as a percentage of direct product sales revenues increased to
94.7% for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 87.1% for the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase was due to a greater decline in the average retail price of merchandise sold
relative to the declines in the costs of such merchandise as well as additional promotional pricing in response to increasing competition in the computer hardware retail market, which category
represented the majority of its merchandise sold. Juno stopped conducting direct product sales activities in August 2000. 

Operating Expenses  

    Operations, Free Service.
  Expenses associated with operations, free service increased $31.6 million, to
$38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 472%. This increase was due primarily to
additional telecommunications costs incurred as a result of the expansion of Juno's free service to include full Internet access and accounted for $30.4 million of the increase. 

    Subscriber Acquisition.
  Subscriber acquisition costs increased $68.8 million, to $116.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2000 from $47.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 144%. This increase is due primarily to $47.4 million in costs related
to extensive direct mail campaigns as well as other marketing activities including television, radio, outdoor and other advertising campaigns. To a lesser extent, the increase reflects costs
aggregating $9.1 million incurred in connection with two stock-based subscriber referral agreements as well as inbound telemarketing costs amounting to $5.1 million incurred in
connection with subscriber acquisition and retention activities. As a percentage of revenues, subscriber acquisition costs increased to 102.1% in the year ended December 31, 2000 from 91.6% in
the year ended December 31, 1999. 

    Sales and Marketing.
  Sales and marketing costs increased $6.5 million, to $18.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2000 from $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 56.7%. This increase is due primarily to an increase in personnel and related costs
of $6.5 million, including sales commissions, as well as trade advertising costs of $130,000, partially offset by a reduction in telecommunications costs of $0.2 million. As a percentage
of revenues, sales and marketing costs improved to 15.9% in the year ended December 31, 2000 from 22.2% in the year ended December 31, 1999. This improvement was due primarily to an
increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to the year-ago period. 

    Product Development.
  These costs consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs as well as, for periods
prior to May 1999, the costs associated with research and development and other product development activities performed for us on a contract basis by a related party in Hyderabad, India. In
May 1999, Juno hired as employees substantially all of the individuals who provided services to us under this related-party arrangement. 

    Product
development costs increased approximately $3.1 million, to $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $7.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999, an increase of 42.2%. This increase is due primarily to additional personnel and related costs of $2.6 million in both Juno's domestic and India offices related to the
development of the Juno Express premium service and of a new release of its client-side software, version 5.0. These costs were partially offset by the lower costs of $100,000 associated
with operating Juno's India-based research and development efforts as a majority-owned subsidiary rather than obtaining these services on a contract basis. To date, Juno has not capitalized any
expenses related to any software development activities. 

    General and Administrative.
  General and administrative costs increased $4.7 million, to $9.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 2000 from $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 102%. This increase is due primarily to a rise in expenses associated with
additional personnel and related overhead costs of $3.4 million, uncollectible receivables of $0.8 million, insurance costs of $0.4 million, and professional service fees of
$100,000. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative costs improved to approximately 8.2% for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 8.9% for the year ended December 31,
1999. 

    Interest Income, Net.
  Interest income, net increased $1.8 million to $5.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000, from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 48.2%. This increase is due primarily to a rise in interest income of $1.6 million
earned on higher average cash balances in the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1999. Interest income, net includes interest expense of $158,000 and
$345,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 

Year Ended December 31, 1999 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1998    

Revenues  

    Total revenues increased $30.3 million, to $52.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $21.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 1998, an increase of 140%. This increase was due to increases in billable services of $27.9 million and in advertising and transaction fees of $6.2 million, partially
offset by a decrease in direct product sales of $3.8 million. 

    Billable Services.
  Billable services revenues increased $27.9 million, to $34.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 1999 from $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of 420%. This increase was due primarily to the additional number of subscribers to its
billable premium services in the year ended December 31, 1999, as compared with the much smaller number in the year ended December 31, 1998. Juno's billable premium services were
introduced in July 1998. Revenues associated with these services contributed $32.5 million of revenues in the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to $3.6 million in the
year ended December 31, 1998, representing an increase of 797%. 

    Advertising and Transaction Fees.
  Advertising and transaction fees increased $6.2 million, to
$12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of 96.2%. This increase was due to larger average
deal sizes associated with the shift in its emphasis towards strategic marketing alliances, partially offset by declines in the number of and the aggregate revenue generated from shorter term ad sales
contracts. Barter transactions accounted for approximately 1.5% and 0.6% of total revenues and 6.2% and 1.9% of advertising and transaction fees for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. 

    Direct Product Sales.
  Direct product sales decreased $3.8 million, to $4.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999 from $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, a decrease of 44.2%. This decline reflects Juno's strategic decision in 1998 to narrow the range of its
direct product sales activities and of the types of products offered to its subscribers. Instead, Juno decided to concentrate on forming strategic marketing alliances and developing other uses for its
advertising inventory that it believed would be likely to generate revenues with higher margins than direct product sales. 

Cost of Revenues  

    Total cost of revenues increased $16.8 million, to $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $17.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of 99.3%. This increase was due primarily to increases in costs of $19.3 million associated with higher revenues from billable services and
advertising and transaction fees of $1.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with direct product sales revenues of $3.5 million. 

    Billable Services.
  Cost of revenues related to billable services increased approximately $19.3 million, to
$25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $5.6 million for the year ended December 31,
1998, an increase of 345%. This increase was due primarily to the costs of providing Juno's billable premium services to a substantially larger number of subscribers in the year ended
December 31, 1999, as compared with the year ended December 31, 1998. Costs related to the provision of these billable premium services, principally customer service, technical support
and telecommunications expenses, accounted for 80.0% of the total costs of revenues related to billable services during the year ended December 31, 1999 and accounted for $17.0 million
of the increase. Cost of billable services revenues as a percentage of billable services revenues improved to 72.2% for the year ended December 31, 1999 from 84.4% for the year ended
December 31, 1998. This percentage improvement was due primarily to decreases in customer service costs, in costs associated with consulting contracts and costs associated with sending
requested Juno disks to potential subscribers. These three factors were responsible for decreases as a percentage of billable services revenues equal 

to 22.3%, 7.2%, and 4.0%, respectively. Partially offsetting these improvements were telecommunications costs and personnel and related costs which as a percentage of billable services revenues,
increased by 18.1% and 1.6%. Increased hours of usage were responsible for the increase in telecommunications costs as a percentage of billable services revenues. 

    Advertising and Transaction Fees.
  Cost of revenues for advertising and transaction fees increased $1.0 million,
to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of 25.5%. This increase was due to the impact of
additional strategic marketing alliances. Cost of revenues related to advertising and transaction fees as a percentage of advertising and transaction fees improved to 36.9% for the year ended
December 31, 1999 from 57.7% for the year ended December 31, 1998. Decreased telecommunications rates and faster average connection speeds contributed 13.7% to the percentage
improvement. Economies of scale achieved as a result of an increase in average deal sizes, and enhancements in Juno's production and distribution methods, provided the remainder of the percentage
improvement. 

    Direct Product Sales.
  Cost of revenues for direct product sales decreased approximately $3.5 million, to
$4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, a decrease of 45.2%. This decrease corresponds to the decrease in
merchandise sold. The cost of revenues for direct product sales as a percentage of direct product sales revenues improved to 87.1% for the year ended December 31, 1999 from 88.7% for the year
ended December 31, 1998. Cost savings as a percentage of direct product sales associated with outsourcing various functions rather than performing them internally contributed 3.2% to the
percentage improvement, partially offset by a greater decline in the average retail price of merchandise sold relative to the declines in the costs of such merchandise, and additional promotional
pricing in response to increasing competition in the market for computer hardware sales. 

Operating Expenses  

    Operations, Free Service.
  Expenses associated with operations, free service decreased $2.7 million, to
$6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, a decrease of 28.6%. This decrease was primarily due to a
$2.3 million decline in telecommunications costs caused by a drop in telecommunications rates and increasing connection speeds resulting from the use of faster modems by a portion of its
subscriber base. The results were not materially impacted by the expansion of Juno's basic service to provide full Internet access for free, since this expansion occurred on December 20, 1999. 

    Subscriber Acquisition.
  Subscriber acquisition costs increased approximately $42.3 million, to
$47.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. This increase is due primarily to costs aggregating
$37.9 million related to Juno's 1999 external marketing campaign which launched in the second quarter of 1999, including direct mail programs, television and radio commercials, outdoor
advertising and various other advertising expenditures. This increase is also due to inbound telemarketing costs of $2.5 million incurred in connection with subscriber acquisition and retention
activities and to ad production and transmission costs of $0.6 million associated with soliciting basic service subscribers to upgrade to Juno's billable services. As a percentage of revenues,
subscriber acquisition costs increased to 91.6% in the year ended December 31, 1999 from 24.6% in the year ended December 31, 1998. Costs related to Juno's 1999 external marketing
campaign contributed 63.5% to the percentage increase. 

    Sales and Marketing.
  Sales and marketing costs were $11.6 million for the years ended December 31, 1999
and 1998. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 1999 include increased trade advertising costs of $1.4 million as compared to the year ended December 31,
1998. This increase was partially offset by cost reductions of $0.8 million associated with Juno's decision to scale back various direct product sales activities. Sales and marketing costs for
the year ended 

December 31, 1998 include one-time costs of $0.6 million associated with this decision. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing costs improved to 22.2% in the year
ended December 31, 1999 from 53.4% in the year ended December 31, 1998. This improvement was due to an increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999. 

    Product Development.
  Product development costs decreased $0.1 million, to $7.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999 from $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, a decrease of 1.5%. This decrease is primarily due to lower costs associated with operating Juno's
India-based research and development efforts as a majority-owned subsidiary, rather than obtaining these services on a contract basis, partially offset by additional personnel and related costs in
both its domestic and India offices. Product development costs in the year ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 related to the continued development of Juno's billable premium services and of
various pieces of software. 

    General and Administrative.
  General and administrative costs increased approximately $1.9 million, to
$4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of 67.2%. This increase is primarily due to increased
insurance costs for directors' and officers' liability insurance of $0.5 million, professional service fees of $0.6 million and additional personnel and related overhead costs of
$0.8 million. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative costs decreased to 8.9% for the year ended December 31, 1999 from 12.7% for the year ended December 31, 1998.
This decrease was due to the increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to the year ended December 31, 1998. 

    Interest Income, Net.
  Interest income, net increased approximately $3.7 million, to $3.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 1999 from $44,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998. This increase is primarily due to a rise in interest income of $3.5 million earned on higher
average cash balances in the year ended December 31, 1999 resulting from Juno's initial public offering in May 1999 and from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock in
March 1999. Interest income, net includes interest expense of $345,000 and $537,000 for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

    Since its formation, Juno has financed its operations primarily from funds generated by the sale of equity securities. Sales of equity securities include
$81.1 million of net proceeds from Juno's February 2000 follow-on offering of common stock, $77.3 million of net proceeds from Juno's May 1999 initial public
offering of common stock, $61.9 million of net proceeds from Juno's March 1999 private placement of redeemable convertible preferred stock, which converted into common stock upon the
completion of its initial public offering, and $225,000 of net proceeds from sales of Juno's common stock under its "equity line" facility, which Juno secured in October 2000. Juno has incurred
significant losses since inception, totaling $291.6 million through June 30, 2001. As of June 30, 2001, Juno had $42.0 million in cash and cash equivalents.

    Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2001 decreased $67.6 million to $13.7 million, down from $81.3 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. This decrease was primarily the result of a decline in subscriber acquisition expenses, which represented approximately 107% of the overall decrease in the net loss,
and a decrease in the balance of accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in the balance of prepaid expenses and other current assets and by a decrease in the balance of accounts payable
and accrued expenses associated with subscriber acquisition liabilities and deferred revenue. The decline in subscriber acquisition expenses was attributable to Juno's decision to substantially
curtail subscriber acquisition activities in order to help bring its operating expenses more in line with its revenues. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted from a decline in advertising and
transaction fee revenues, as well as increased collection efforts during the six months ended June 30, 2001 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2000. Accounts receivable
includes the portion of advertising and transaction fees and billable subscriber fees that have been billed in advance of the performance of all or a portion of the related services and that have not
been collected. The portions of accounts receivable related to these fees as of June 30, 2001 and 2000and the

corresponding equal amounts that remained in its deferred revenue liability account balances at such dateswere approximately $4.2 million and $6.7 million, respectively.

    Net cash provided by and used in investing activities was $111,000, and $6.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Cash provided from
returns of security deposits more than offset the cash expended on the purchase of fixed assets during the six months ended June 30, 2001. The principal use of cash during the six months ended
June 30, 2000 was for the purchase of fixed assets. As a result of its outsourcing arrangements for telecommunications services and customer service, Juno has substantially reduced the level of
capital expenditures that would otherwise have been necessary to develop its product offerings. In the event that these outsourcing arrangements were no longer available to Juno, significant capital
expenditures would be required and its business and financial results could suffer. Expenditures associated with the purchase of telecommunications capacity, the provision of customer service, and
subscriber acquisition and retention activities are expected to continue to represent a material use of Juno's cash resources.

    Net cash used in and provided by financing activities was $0.2 million and $81.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Financing
activities for the six months ended June 30, 2000 primarily included $81.1 million in net proceeds Juno received from its February 2000 follow-on offering of common
stock.

    In
October 2000, Juno entered into a common stock investment agreement with a private investment fund, The Kingston Limited Partnership, providing for the future issuance and
purchase of shares of its common stock. This agreement and a related registration rights agreement constitute what is commonly referred to as an "equity line" facility. The equity line facility
permits Juno to sell, subject to various restrictions, up to $7.5 million of common stock in each of up to 20 drawdown periods of 22 trading days each over the course of a period of up to two
years, provided that Juno cannot sell more than $125 million worth of shares in total under the facility and may in practice only be able to sell a 

much lower amount. The total number of shares that may be issued under the facility depends on a number of factors, including the market price and trading volume of its common stock during each
drawdown period Juno chooses to initiate. Any stock issued to Kingston under this facility will generally be purchased at a price equal to 94 percent of the volume-weighted average trading
price of Juno's common stock on a given purchase day. Additionally, Kingston will generally not be obligated to purchase shares from Juno on any day when the purchase price of Juno's common stock
would be less than $1.50 per share. Since Kingston's purchase price will generally be 94% of Juno's volume-weighted average trading price during a given purchase day, Kingston generally will have no
obligation to purchase shares on a given day to the extent that the volume-weighted average trading price of Juno's shares during such day is less than $1.60 per share. Prior to the reduction of this
minimum price condition from $2.50 per share to $1.50 per share in March 2001, Kingston agreed to waive the $2.50 minimum price condition with respect to one drawdown period, and Kingston may
agree from time to time to waive the minimum purchase price in effect in the future to allow Juno to sell common stock to Kingston at prices lower than $1.50 per share. Kingston does not have an
obligation to permit such sales, and may grant or deny such waivers in its sole discretion. Even if Kingston does grant such a

waiver in a particular case and, at Juno's request, accepts a new minimum purchase price lower than $1.50 per share for a given drawdown period, there can be no assurance that Juno will meet such new
minimum trading price condition to Juno's ability to draw down funds for all or any portion of such drawdown period. Juno will control the timing and frequency of any sales, subject to the facility's
various restrictions, and has no obligation to draw down any minimum amount or number of times. The facility may be terminated by Kingston since Juno has not sold shares to the fund since March 2001
and the common stock investment agreement gives Kingston the right to terminate the facility if Juno does not sell shares under the facility for a period of four consecutive months. Juno has sold
317,400 shares and raised net proceeds of $225,000 under this facility.

    Juno filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 28, 2000 to register the resale by the fund of up to 10,000,000
shares of the common stock that may be issued to it under the equity line facility. The common stock investment agreement provides that the equity line will not be available to Juno unless a
registration statement is effective to permit the fund to resell the shares purchased by it. At the date of this document, no effective registration statement is available to Kingston for that
purpose.

    As of June 30, 2001, Juno held a total of $42.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. Juno believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to
meet its anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months. As noted earlier, Juno currently projects that its net loss for the second half of 2001 will total less than $2 million.

    In
2000, Juno entered into several transactions in which Juno's payment for services rendered may be settled, in whole or in part, through the issuance of its common stock. 

    On
June 29, 2000, Juno entered into a subscriber referral agreement with SmartWorld Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries SmartWorld Technologies, LLC and Freewwweb,
LLC. Under the terms of the Freewwweb Agreement, Freewwweb began to refer Freewwweb's subscribers to Juno's Internet access services on July 19, 2000 and is entitled to receive consideration
from Juno for each former Freewwweb subscriber that became a new subscriber to Juno's services and subsequently met certain qualification criteria. Under the terms of the Freewwweb Agreement, such
consideration will include cash and may include, at Juno's option, shares of Juno's common stock. The number of shares of Juno's common stock will be based on the closing sale price of Juno's common
stock on the dates of issuance. In accordance with the Freewwweb Agreement, Juno has ceased accepting additional Freewwweb subscribers. Juno has not yet issued any shares of its common stock to
Freewwweb or Freewwweb's affiliates under this agreement. Please see "Juno's BusinessLegal Proceedings" for additional information concerning this transaction. 

    On September 18, 2000, Juno entered into a distribution agreement with Babbage's Etc. LLC. Under the terms of this agreement, Babbage's agreed to distribute Juno's software and
will receive periodic compensation from Juno for each new subscriber generated by such distribution that subsequently meets certain qualification criteria. The compensation received by Babbage's will
include shares of Juno's common stock or, at Juno's option, cash. The number of shares of Juno's common stock issuable to Babbage's will be based on the closing sale price of Juno's common stock on
the dates of issuance. Juno has not yet issued any shares of its common stock to Babbage's under this agreement. 

    Juno
may find additional opportunities to issue its equity securities as consideration for subscriber acquisition, telecommunications, or other significant operating costs in the
future. Juno may also seek to sell additional equity or debt securities. If non-cash methods for payment of operating costs are used or additional funds are raised by Juno issuing equity
securities, stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interest and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of Juno's common stock. If additional funds
are raised by its issuing debt, Juno may be subject to limitations on its operations. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

    In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."
SFAS No. 141 establishes new standards for accounting and reporting requirements for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and prohibits the use of the pooling-of-interests method
for combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment-only approach. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142,
goodwill will be tested at the reporting unit annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. Amortization of goodwill, including goodwill recorded in
past business combinations, will cease. The adoption date for Juno will be January 1, 2002 and it is not expected to have a material effect on Juno's financial position, result of operations,
or cash flows.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk  

    Juno's results of operations, financial position, and cash flows are not materially affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the
U.S. dollar. Juno does not use derivative financial instruments to limit its foreign currency risk exposure. 

NETZERO'S BUSINESS    

General  

    NetZero is a leading provider of Internet access services and online targeted marketing solutions. NetZero offers consumers free and pay access to the
Internet, e-mail and customizable navigation tools that provide "speed dial" to key sites on the Internet. Its services are currently available in more than 5,000 cities across the United
States and Canada. In addition to offering consumers access to the Internet, NetZero offers marketers targeting capabilities through numerous online advertising channels. NetZero also offers
advertisers and commerce partners a variety of additional services to build their brands and market their products, including referring its users to partners' Web sites, enabling customer
registrations and facilitating electronic commerce transactions. NetZero's CyberTarget division offers marketers and advertisers mass-scale, online market research and measurement
services. The company was incorporated in July 1997 and launched its Internet access service in October 1998. 

    From
October 1998 through December 2000, NetZero offered a free and unlimited Internet access service which was supported by advertising and commerce. However, several
factors, including declines in Internet advertising rates, have resulted in NetZero amending its strategy to include billable services and to restrict the number of free hours it offers per household
per month. Through June 30, 2001 approximately 8.8 million users registered for NetZero's Internet access services, of which approximately 3.4 million accessed its services in the
month of June 2001. Approximately 210,000 of these users were subscribers of NetZero's pay services as of June 30, 2001. 

    In
January 2001, NetZero began limiting its free Internet service to a maximum of 40 hours per household per calendar month. Households desiring to exceed the
40 hour limitation are currently offered the opportunity to sign up for the Extended Access Pass, a plan that provides households the option to pay a fee, currently set at $9.95, to allow them
access to the NetZero service for the remainder of the calendar month. If these households elect not to pay a fee when they reach the 40 hour limit during a given month they will be denied
access to the service for the remainder of the month, but their account will not be terminated and they can begin accessing the service for free at the beginning of the next month. 

    In
March 2001, NetZero launched a new service called NetZero Platinum. The NetZero Platinum service offers users Internet service for a monthly fee, currently $9.95. In most
respects, NetZero
Platinum is the same as NetZero's standard free service except that the 40 hour limitation does not apply, the user accesses a modified start-page and the service features a small
toolbar without the advertising banners currently included in the ZeroPort on the free service. 

    Effective October 1, 2001, NetZero intends to implement additional restrictions on its free service, including reducing the number of hours per month from 40 to 10 that a
household can use the free service and eliminating the free service offering from certain areas where telecommunications costs make the offering cost prohibitive. During the month of June 2001,
approximately 30% of NetZero's active users accessed its free service for more than 10 hours although, due to multiple users within many households, it is likely that a significantly greater number of
users may be impacted by the 10 hour limit. Approximately 8% of NetZero's active users accessed its free service solely from dial-up numbers in areas that will no longer be available to free users
after October 1, 2001. NetZero intends to continue to offer billable services in the areas where it discontinues its free service. As a result of these measures, NetZero anticipates a
significant decline in its active free user base. There is no assurance that these measures will not be modified or that they will be implemented as planned.

Industry Background  

    There are over 7,000 Internet service providers in the United States, varying widely in geographic coverage, user focus and the nature and quality of services
provided to users. With the exception of several large providers, the vast majority of Internet service providers do not offer branded nationwide 

coverage. A number of Internet service providers supplement their basic access with services such as electronic commerce and telecommunications. Most Internet service providers charge users monthly
access fees and fees for additional services, such as hosting users' Web sites. Pay services can cost as much as $280 per year for dial-up Internet access. Telecommunications costs
associated with providing dial-up Internet access have declined in recent years with the emergence of wholesale providers that resell capacity to Internet service providers. These
providers have built networks on a large scale and are able to spread the cost of their networks over multiple Internet service providers. NetZero believes that while users are generally focused on
speed and reliability as they evaluate Internet access services, they are also increasingly focusing on cost, particularly as their other computing costs decline and since the rest of their online
experience is generally free. 

    Many
Internet service providers supplement their billable service revenues through sales of online advertising. NetZero was the first company to offer free, unlimited Internet access
on a nationwide basis supported primarily by advertising. A number of a companies followed suit by offering either free Internet access or Internet access that is priced significantly lower than the
fees charged by some of the larger providers. However, online advertising rates have declined significantly, and NetZero does not believe that an unlimited, free Internet access service can be
profitable on a standalone basis in the current environment. In fiscal 2001 the majority of companies who offered free Internet access have
either ceased to offer free Internet access or have ceased operations as a result of their failure to generate positive cash flow or raise additional funding through the capital markets. 

    Due
to factors including the decline in online advertising rates, NetZero has shifted its strategy away from offering an unlimited free access service to offering a limited free
access service and value priced pay services. While NetZero continues to focus on developing and offering a variety of products to advertisers and marketers to support its limited free service
offering, the uncertainty in the advertising market will require NetZero to continue to evaluate the scope of services that can be offered to users free of charge. In the near term, NetZero intends to
focus on marketing its pay services to existing free users as well as to potential users serviced by other Internet services providers or users who are purchasing Internet services for the first time. 

Sources of Revenue  

    NetZero generates revenues through billable services, media fees, direct marketing agreements, referring its users to partners' Web sites, enabling customer
registrations for partners and facilitating electronic commerce transactions. NetZero also generates revenues through sales of market research data generated by its service. NetZero implements these
revenue arrangements through a number of products and services, primarily including the following: 

Billable Services Revenues  

    In January 2001, NetZero began limiting its free Internet access to 40 hours per month per household and offering users who reach their limit the
Extended Access Pass for $9.95, which currently provides unlimited Internet access for the remainder of the month. This is designed to either reduce telecommunications expense associated with heavy
users or, alternatively, generate additional revenues to mitigate such expense. Also, in March 2001, NetZero introduced the NetZero Platinum service at $9.95 per month, which provides users
with unlimited Internet access each month and features a thin toolbar without the advertising banners currently included in the ZeroPort on the free service. In addition, billable services includes
fees charged to prospective users related to the cost of producing, shipping and handling copies of the NetZero software on CDs. 

Advertising and Commerce Revenues  

    The Start Page.
  NetZero designates the first Web site viewed by its users during an Internet access session. This page
for the vast majority of users used to be My Z Start and has recently been 

replaced by Best of the Net, a Web site designed by NetZero that displays sponsored links to a variety of information, services and products, including search, news, sports, music, weather, stocks and
shopping. NetZero generates revenues from the Best of the Net start page by users clicking on links and being referred to sponsors' Web sites. For the nine months ended March 31, 2001, NetZero
derived approximately 25% of its revenue from its start page agreement with LookSmart which provided search functionality on both the Start Page and the ZeroPort. The agreement with LookSmart was
terminated in January 2001 and has not been replaced with a comparable agreement. As a result, revenues from the Start Page will be significantly lower in the future. 

    The ZeroPort.
  A primary element of NetZero's free service is the ZeroPort displayed on users' screens throughout their
Internet access sessions. The ZeroPort is a small window displayed on its users' computer screens while they are online that is always visible regardless of where they navigate. Users can dock the
ZeroPort at the top or bottom of their screen but they cannot close it. NetZero generates revenues through the ZeroPort by displaying and/or users clicking on banner advertisements which can be
targeted based on users' profiles and online behavior; buttons, icons and drop-down menus which are linked to advertisers' and sponsors' Web sites or functionality offerings, including
search; a ticker which, when enabled by the user, delivers information through the ZeroPort which is linked directly to sponsors' Web sites; and displaying a sponsor's media message with no resulting
link to a Web site. 

    NZTV.
  In December 1999, NetZero acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of AimTV in exchange for approximately
975,000 shares of NetZero common stock and options to purchase common stock of NetZero. AimTV has developed patent-pending technology that allows NetZero to display video and other forms of animated
advertisements in a small window on the computer screens of certain NetZero users while they make dial-up connection to access the Internet. NetZero has named this product NZTV. Users can click on the
NZTV advertisement during the connection process and be referred to advertisers' Web sites once the Internet session has begun. NetZero generates revenues from displaying NZTV advertisements to its
users and by users clicking on such advertisements and being referred to sponsors' Web sites. 

    Targeted E-Mail.
  All of its registered users are given a NetZero e-mail address as part of its
Internet access service. Also, when registering for its service, certain users provide NetZero with their pre-existing e-mail address. During the registration process for its
service, users can designate certain subjects for which they have a particular interest, such as sports, health, news and finance. Users can elect to receive e-mail messages regarding
promotions or targeted information on these subjects. NetZero generates revenues by delivering e-mail messages on behalf of advertisers targeted to each subject of interest and by users
clicking on such messages and being referred to sponsors' Web sites. The advertising messages are delivered to users who have elected to receive such information, regardless whether the message is
delivered to a NetZero e-mail address or alternate address provided. 

    CyberTarget.
  A fundamental component of its zCast technology is NetZero's ability to capture detailed data regarding
its users' online behavior, including Web sites visited, advertisements clicked on, and other activities. NetZero believes that this data, especially when combined with the demographic data it
receives when users register with NetZero, serves as a valuable tool for NetZero's partners to improve the effectiveness of their online service offerings. Through NetZero's CyberTarget division, it
generates revenues through the sale of market research data to third parties. CyberTarget's services are performed within the guidelines of NetZero's privacy policy which dictates that no personal
identifying information may be shared with third parties without the express consent of the NetZero user. 

Sales and Business Development  

    NetZero sells its advertising products and services primarily through its own direct sales force and, to a lesser extent, through third parties. From time to
time, NetZero has relied on third party sales 

forces to resell a significant portion of its advertising inventory. While NetZero intends to still use third parties for the resale of a portion of its inventory, NetZero does not believe any third
party sales relationships are material to its business. In addition, the limitations imposed on NetZero's free service have resulted, and are likely to result in the future, in a decrease in the
amount of advertising inventory available for sale and potentially a decrease in advertising revenue. NetZero's sales and business development department is comprised of sales and business
development, management, account executives, telemarketers, sales planning and traffic management and, at March 31, 2001, NetZero had 53 in-house sales staff. As a result of the
weakness in the online advertising market NetZero has closed its Dallas, Boston, Atlanta, Washington D.C. and Miami offices. Its remaining sales offices are in New York, Chicago, San Francisco,
Seattle and Los Angeles. 

Marketing and User Acquisition  

    During the first three quarters of calendar 2000, competition for free Internet access users was intense. However, due to the failure of a number of NetZero's
free access competitors commencing in the fourth quarter of calendar 2000, NetZero experienced a significant increase in registered and active users through January 2001. Due in part to the
costs associated with servicing this user base, during January 2001 NetZero imposed restrictions on the number of users that could access the free service, instituted limitations on monthly
usage and shifted the focus of its marketing from its free to its pay services. As a result or these and other factors, NetZero has experienced declines in its active free user base and expects to
experience additional declines, expecially if it imposes additional limitations on its free service. 

    NetZero's
marketing department consists of marketing management, media, creative services, Web development, strategic alliances and billable services personnel which, at
March 31, 2001, consisted of 23 people. Since its initial public offering in September 1999, NetZero has expended significant resources in building its brand and increasing its free user
base. Its brand awareness has grown substantially through its sponsorship of the half-time show of televised National Basketball Association games on
NBC and through other television, radio, print and online media. NetZero anticipates that, following the June 2001 quarter, it will significantly reduce its marketing expenditures. While
NetZero's free user acquisition efforts will continue to include brand-building marketing efforts through television, radio, print and online media advertising, NetZero anticipates it will focus its
user acquisition and marketing efforts primarily on pay services. A large component of these pay subscriber acquisition efforts is expected to be a variety of programs designed to up sell NetZero's
free users to pay services. To date, NetZero has engaged in direct mailing and distribution of compact discs containing its software and has also established download links on numerous Web sites from
which a potential user can download its software. It has undertaken significant co-branding initiatives where it co-sponsors the distribution of compact discs to the sponsors'
user base. The service provided through such discs contains branding of both NetZero and the sponsor. NetZero anticipates reviewing the effectiveness of these types of campaigns to increase its pay
user base, and to implement these and a variety of other initiatives designed to increase its pay user base. However, NetZero has limited experience in marketing pay services and its competitors spend
funds significantly in excess of what NetZero intends to spend going forward. There can be no assurance that NetZero will be able to reduce its marketing expenditures or successfully grow its pay user
base. 

User Support  

    NetZero's user support service strategy is to build programs designed to increase user satisfaction and retention in a cost-effective manner. NetZero's user
support service is a combination of internal personnel and selective outsourcing of certain aspects of its user service to vendors that provide NetZero with greater efficiency and scalability for
future growth. 

    NetZero provides online and offline "self-help" services that provide a variety of support options to its users, including its SPEEDY Assistant offline software which is
loaded onto the user's computer when the service is initially installed from the compact disc and can also be downloaded from its Web site. This offline tool assists users in loading and operating its
software, provides answers to common questions and helps users set up their e-mail account through step-by-step instructions. NetZero also provides comprehensive
help, tutorials, advisories, answers to frequently asked questions and tips via its Web site and automated e-mail response system. Over 65% of all customer support inquiries utilize
NetZero's automated support options. In addition, NetZero provides traditional e-mail support where NetZero personnel respond generally with a one day turnaround. NetZero offers a
fee-based support option with toll-free telephone access and minimum wait time on a per-incident basis. NetZero's user support service organization continually
monitors different quantitative measurements such as average wait time, first call resolution rate and abandon rate. All user contacts are logged and categorized to enable NetZero to quickly recognize
and act on trends. An internal quality assurance team monitors the work of both telephone and e-mail agents and provides feedback to its agents to improve their skills, increase their
productivity, and guarantee consistency throughout the user support group. 

Technology  

    NetZero has developed or acquired a variety of technologies designed to enhance the functionality of its service for the user and to provide a platform for the
creation of products and services tailored to the needs of advertisers and commerce partners. The foundation of its service is a proprietary software system called zCast that enables NetZero to track
its users' navigational activities and to deliver highly targeted advertising. The zCast client is a JAVA application that runs on a user's personal computer and that currently operates on the Windows
95, Windows 98, Windows ME and Windows NT 4.x operating systems. zCast has the following major components: 

    The zCast Client Software.
  The zCast Client application is the software product that includes The ZeroPort, which is
installed on users' personal computers and is constantly visible while a connection to NetZero's service is maintained. The zCast Client performs multiple tasks, including: 


establishing
a connection to the NetZero service;


capturing
demographic information;


authenticating
a user via a user ID and password;


tracking
Web sites visited;


managing
the display of advertising banners;


targeting
advertising based on Web sites visited and on keyword search;


logging
the number of times an ad was shown and the number of times an ad was clicked on;


monitoring
the quality of the online session including dial-up and network errors;


providing
a mechanism for customer feedback; and


controlling
the download of various materials, including new software versions. 

    Sun Microsystems continues to upgrade its JAVA language and implementing new versions of JAVA may require additional memory and resources to implement. NetZero's software uses the
JAVA language extensively and we will have to modify our resources accordingly to accommodate new versions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to make such modifications, or any other
modifications which may be required to adapt to new or changing standards, in a cost-effective and timely manner, or at all.

    The zCast Server Network.
  Powered by JAVA, the zCast server network is a group of software applications running on
multiple servers that manage and collect important data relating to each user's online session. The system is designed to be scalable to handle large amounts of data. The servers consist of
application server software which interacts with the ZeroPort to send and receive information such as authentication, playlists of advertisements and impression and click counts; database servers
which store session information, user information and ad display and click counts; and ad servers which manage the ad inventory and determine which ads users will view during their online session. All
of the above components run on Sun Microsystems servers and many run on VA Linux servers. The system is designed for scalability and to handle large amounts of data and are connected to disk arrays
which provides NetZero with the ability to quickly scale and improve overall system performance. 

    Other Technologies.
  Many of its technologies are designed to enhance user experience, to provide the ability to offer
additional revenue streams or to increase operating efficiencies. For example, NZTV involves the display of full-motion video advertisements during the log-on process. The
advertisement is downloaded to the user's computer while the user is online without adversely impacting the user's online experience. The advertisement is updated based on playlists. Another example
is its Autodialer technology which is designed to automatically ensure the user accesses its network through a dial-in number which minimizes costs and enhances connectivity. NetZero
intends to continue to develop and acquire additional technologies with the goal of enhancing the value of our service for both users and advertisers. 

Communications Network  

    To use NetZero's services, users initiate telephone connections between their personal computers and computer hardware in local or regional telecommunications
facilities known as points of presence (also referred to as POPs). NetZero contracts for the use of points of presence around the country from various wholesale providers, including Genuity and Level
3 Communications. These providers also carry its data between their points of presence and its central computers in Los Angeles, California. Through its network providers, NetZero is able to offer
local dial-up phone numbers in over 5,000 cities across the United States and Canada. Thus, its users typically bear no expenses for communication beyond the cost, if any, of an ordinary
local or regional phone call. NetZero's service provides full point-to-point protocol access to the Internet, and supports the v.90 standard for 56 kbps connections and
Integrated Services Digital Network, or ISDN, in certain areas. NetZero continuously monitors network service levels around the country and works with its partners to help maintain high levels of
network availability and throughput for its users. 

    Many
of these technologies are also employed in NetZero's Platinum pay service. The Platinum service provides the same facilities to users as NetZero's free service except that it has
a small tool bar without the banner ads included in the ZeroPort and relieves certain usage constraints. Billing for the pay service is performed online under contract with Convergys and Chase
Merchant Services via encrypted links. 

    NetZero's
agreements with wholesale telecommunications providers are generally structured in one of two ways. NetZero has usage agreements under which it is charged for the aggregate
number of hours that its users are connected to a provider's network. NetZero also has capacity agreements under which it is charged for a fixed amount of a wholesaler's telecommunications capacity in
specific locations whether or not the capacity is fully utilized. NetZero's contract with Genuity is a usage agreement that expires in August 2002 and includes a minimum purchase commitment
which extends throughout the term of the agreement. NetZero's contract with Level 3 Communications is a capacity agreement under which it has committed to minimum telecommunications capacity through
March 2003. 

    NetZero's zCast servers reside at three facilities, one provided by Level 3 Communications in Los Angeles, California, another by AboveNet Communications in San Jose, California and a
third by Exodus in Sterling, Virginia. NetZero's data center, located in its corporate offices in Westlake Village, California, houses its e-mail servers and its data warehouse that is
equipped with battery and generator power backup systems to prevent outages from interruption of utility power to the building. 

Competition  

    Competition for Users.
  Competition for Internet users continues to intensify. NetZero believes that the primary
competitive factors determining success in the market for Internet users include a reputation for reliability of service, effective customer support, pricing, easy-to-use
software, geographic coverage and scope of services. Other important factors include the timing and introduction of new products and services as well as general economic trends. While NetZero believes
that it competes favorably with respect to most of these factors, numerous of its competitors have an advantage over NetZero with respect to specific factors. NetZero currently competes with
established online service and content providers, such as America Online and The Microsoft Network; independent national Internet service providers such as EarthLink and Prodigy; providers of branded
free and pay Internet services such as Juno Online Services, Inc. as well as retailers, such as Kmart's Bluelight Internet Service which provides Internet access, on a private label or
co-branded basis and numerous regional and local commercial Internet service providers. Several of these providers offer significantly greater customer support and scope of services than
NetZero currently offers, although generally at a higher price. In addition, several of these competitors have far greater marketing, financial, technical and personnel resources than NetZero and
there is no assurance that NetZero will be able to compete effectively for pay users. NetZero also competes against other companies that offer Internet access services or products, such as personal
computers, bundled with, or as promotions for, access services. 

    NetZero
believes that increased competition has, from time to time, impacted NetZero's growth and may impact its growth in the future, resulting in increased user turnover and
additional sales and marketing expenses that increase user acquisition cost. Increased user turnover could also result in decreased advertising revenue. Since NetZero relies primarily on advertising
revenues to offset some of the costs of free services, NetZero may not be able to cover these increased costs, and NetZero may not have the resources to compete successfully. The ability of NetZero's
competitors to acquire other Internet providers or to enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures could also put it at a significant competitive disadvantage. 

    NetZero's
competitors may be able to charge less for Internet services than it does for billable services, which may put pressure on NetZero to reduce or eliminate, or prevent it from
raising, the fees it charges for billable services. NetZero may choose to lower or eliminate the fees it currently charges for
billable services in order to remain competitive with other industry participants. Any decrease in such prices could result in a reduction in its billable services revenue and would harm the
profitability of such services. 

    In
addition, telecommunications companies with far greater resources, and brand awareness offer their own Internet access services to users. Since these companies have their own
telecommunications network infrastructure, they may have lower communications costs than NetZero does. These potential cost advantages may significantly increase competitive pressures on NetZero. For
example, AT&T WorldNet offers an Internet access service priced at $4.95 per month combined with an advertising banner window, and also markets its Internet access service with its long distance
service at a discounted rate. In addition, each of NetZero's telecommunications providers supplies network access to one or more of its competitors, and could choose to sell those competitors
preferential network access, potentially limiting its users' ability to access the Internet. If NetZero's telecommunications service providers were to decrease the levels of service provided to it, or
if they were to terminate their relationships with NetZero for competitive or other reasons, and NetZero was not able to develop 

alternate sources of supply, NetZero would not be able to provide Internet access to some or all of its customers, which could ultimately result in a significant loss of users and revenues or in
NetZero ceasing operations entirely. 

    NetZero
also faces competition from companies that provide broadband connections to users' homes, including local and long-distance telephone companies, cable television
companies, electric utility companies, and wireless communications companies. These companies may use broadband technologies to include Internet access or business services such as hosting a user's
individual Web site in their basic bundle of services or may offer Internet access or business services for little or no additional charge. Broadband technologies enable users to access the Internet
at much faster speeds than the dial-up service NetZero currently offers. While the market for such broadband technologies is still emerging, NetZero believes it will continue to grow and
pose an increasingly significant source of competition. 

    Competition for Advertising Customers.
  NetZero believes that the primary competitive factors determining success in the
market for advertising customers include: 


the
size and demographic profile of a user base;


the
ability to target users based on specific demographic criteria;


pricing;
and


geographic
coverage. 

    While
NetZero believes that it competes favorably with respect to these factors, numerous of its competitors may have an advantage over NetZero with respect to specific factors.
NetZero competes for revenues with major Internet service providers, content providers, large Web publishers, Web search engine and portal companies, Internet advertising providers, content
aggregation companies, and various other companies that facilitate Internet advertising. Many of these companies have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger user bases and
significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than NetZero does. This may allow them to respond more quickly than NetZero to new or emerging technologies and changes in
advertiser requirements. It may also allow them to devote greater resources than NetZero to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services. These competitors may also engage in
more extensive research and development, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential
employees, strategic partners, advertisers and Web publishers. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third
parties to increase the ability of their products or services to address the needs of its prospective advertising and sponsorship customers. Competition combined with a slowing of the growth of online
advertising has resulted in, and may continue to result in, price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share. NetZero also competes with television, radio, cable and print media for a
share of advertisers' total advertising budgets. 

Governmental Regulation  

    Overview.
  The law relating to NetZero's business and operations is evolving and is still in flux. In addition, a number
of legislative and regulatory proposals under consideration by federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities may lead to the repeal, modification, or introduction of laws or regulations
which do or could affect its business including, but not limited to, regulatory fees, online content, user privacy, taxation, parental consent for access by minors, access charges and regulatory fees,
liability for third-party activities, bulk e-mail or "spam," encryption standards, online sales of goods and services, domain name registration and use, copyright infringement, and other
intellectual property issues, and distribution of compensation between or among telecommunications carriers. 

    Regulation of Content and Access.
  A variety of restrictions on content and access, primarily as they relate to
children, have been enacted or proposed. The Children's Online Protection Act of 1998 prohibits and imposes criminal penalties and civil liability on anyone engaged in the business of selling or
transferring, by means of the World Wide Web, material that is harmful to minors, unless access to this
material is blocked to persons under 17 years of age. In addition, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 enacted by Congress imposes fines on any entity that knowingly permits any
telecommunications facility under such entity's control to be used to make obscene or indecent material available to minors via an interactive computer service. Numerous states have adopted or are
currently considering similar types of legislation. In addition, laws have been proposed which would require Internet service providers to supply, at cost, filtering technologies to limit or block the
ability of minors to access unsuitable materials on the Internet. Because of these content restrictions and potential liability to NetZero for materials carried on or disseminated through its systems,
NetZero may be required to implement measures to reduce its exposure to liability. 

    User Privacy Issues.
  Internet user privacy has become an issue both in the United States and abroad. Some commentators,
privacy advocates and government bodies have recommended or taken actions to limit the use of personal profiles or other personal information by those collecting such information, particularly as it
relates to children. For example, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 requires, among other things, that online operators obtain verifiable parental consent for the collection, use,
or disclosure of personal information from children. 

    Internet Taxation.
  The tax treatment of activities on or relating to the Internet is currently unsettled. A number of
proposals have been made at the federal, state and local levels and by foreign governments that could impose taxes on the online sale of goods and services and other Internet activities. The Internet
Tax Freedom Act was signed into law in 1998, placing a three-year moratorium on new state and local taxes on Internet commerce. There is no assurance that this moratorium will be extended,
nor can there be any assurance that future laws imposing taxes or other regulations on commerce over the Internet would not substantially impair the growth of Internet commerce and as a result could
make it cost-prohibitive to operate its business. 

    Telecommunications Regulation.
  Neither the Federal Communications Commission nor any other governmental agency directly
regulates Internet service providers like NetZero, other than through regulations generally applicable to businesses. In a report to Congress adopted on April 10, 1998, the FCC reaffirmed that
Internet service providers should be classified as unregulated "information service providers," rather than regulated "telecommunications providers" under the terms of the Telecommunications Act of
1996. This finding is important because it means that regulations that apply to telephone companies and other common carriers do not apply to NetZero. NetZero also is not required to contribute a
percentage of its gross revenues to support "universal service" subsidies for local telephone services and other public policy objectives, such as enhanced communications systems for schools,
libraries, and some health care providers. The FCC action may discourage states from regulating Internet service providers as telecommunications carriers or imposing similar subsidy obligations. 

    Nevertheless,
Internet-related regulatory policies are continuing to develop, and it is possible that NetZero could be exposed to regulation in the future. For example, in the 1998
report to Congress, the FCC stated its intention to consider whether to regulate voice and fax telephony services provided over the Internet as a "telecommunications" service even though Internet
access itself would not be regulated. 

    NetZero
could also be affected by any change in the ability of its users to reach its network through a dial-up telephone call without any additional charges. The FCC has
recently ruled that Internet service providers are enhanced service providers and are thus exempt from the access charges that apply to traditional telecommunications companies. Local telephone
companies assess charges on 

long distance companies for the use of the local telephone network to originate and terminate long distance calls, generally on a per-minute basis. NetZero could be adversely affected by
any regulatory change that would result in the imposition of access charges on Internet service providers because this would substantially increase the cost of using the Internet. NetZero could also
be adversely affected by other regulatory changes involving carrier compensation. Certain of the telecommunications service providers from whom NetZero purchases telecommunications services were
entitled to receive payments known as "reciprocal compensation" from local exchange carriers with respect to their provision of Internet access services. However, in April 2001 the FCC
inaugurated a rulemaking proceeding that the agency said would probably result in the elimination of reciprocal compensation for Internet traffic, a change which would decrease revenues for some, if
not many, of NetZero's telecommunicationsits providers. In the meantime, the FCC simultaneously established a 36-month transition period which would cap the amount of reciprocal
compensation that could be paid to a telephone company. As a result, some, if not many, of NetZero's telecommunications providers will be receiving less compensation from local exchange carriers and
might increase the cost of their services to NetZero. Since the largest component of its operating costs is comprised of payments to those telecommunications providers, any increase in such costs
would have a material adverse effect on NetZero's gross margins. 

    State
public utility commissions generally have declined to regulate enhanced or information services. Some states, however, have continued to regulate particular aspects of enhanced
services in limited circumstances, such as where they are provided by incumbent local exchange carriers that operate telecommunications networks. Moreover, the public service commissions of some
states continue to review potential regulation of these services. NetZero cannot assure you that state regulatory authorities will not seek to regulate aspects of these activities as
telecommunications services. 

    The Workforce Investment Act of 1998.
  The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 amended Section 508 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to require that all Web sites operated by a federal agency be modified to make them accessible to individuals with disabilities. There are proposals to extend this
requirement to all Web sites, which, if enacted, could increase NetZero's costs and make its service less attractive to those who are not disabled. 

Intellectual Property  

    NetZero's success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on its technologies and trademarks, which it protects through a combination of patent,
copyright, trade secret and trademark
law. NetZero has filed numerous patent applications relating to a variety of NetZero's business methods and technologies. 

    NetZero
generally enters into confidentiality or license agreements with its employees, consultants and corporate partners, and generally controls access to and distribution of its
technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite its efforts to protect its proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure, parties may attempt to disclose, obtain or use
NetZero's solutions or technologies. NetZero cannot be certain that the steps it has taken will prevent misappropriation of its solutions or technologies, particularly in foreign countries where the
laws or law enforcement may not protect its proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. NetZero has licensed, and may license in the future, elements of its trademarks, trade dress and
similar proprietary right to third parties. While NetZero attempts to ensure that the quality of its brand is maintained by such business partners, such partners may take actions that could materially
and adversely affect the value of its proprietary rights or reputation. 

    NetZero's
zCast technology collects and utilizes data derived from its user activity. This data is used for ad targeting and measuring ad performance. Although NetZero believes that
it has the right 

to use this data, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert claims against NetZero for using this information. In addition, others may claim rights to the same information. NetZero
cannot be certain that any of its proprietary rights will be viable or of value in the future since the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in Internet-related
industries is uncertain and still evolving. In particular, there can be no assurance that any of its patent, copyright or trademark applications, now pending or to be filed in the future, will be
approved. Even if they are approved, such patents, trademarks or copyrights may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated. NetZero could spend significant funds procuring and attempting to
enforce its proprietary rights, and there can be no assurance that such rights will be upheld or will provide NetZero with any significant advantages. If its trademark registrations are not approved
because third parties own such trademarks, its use of the trademarks will be restricted unless NetZero enters into arrangements with such third parties. These arrangements may not be available on
commercially reasonable terms. 

    Furthermore,
third parties may assert infringement claims against NetZero. From time to time NetZero has been subject to claims in the ordinary course of its business, including
claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties by NetZero or its users. Any such claims could subject NetZero to significant
liability for damages and could result in the invalidation of its proprietary rights. In addition, even if NetZero were to win any such litigation, such litigation could be time-consuming
and expensive to defend, and could result in the diversion of its time and attention, any of which could materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.
Any claims or litigation may also result in limitations on its ability to use such trademarks, patents and other intellectual property unless NetZero enters into arrangement with such third parties,
which may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms. 

    Governmental agencies and their designees generally regulate the acquisition and maintenance of domain names. The regulation of domain names in the United States and in foreign
countries is subject to change in the near future. As a result, NetZero may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names in the countries in which it conducts, or plans to conduct, business.
For example, neither NetZero nor United Online own the domain name www.unitedonline.com. Furthermore, the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and
similar proprietary rights is unclear. Therefore, we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, dilute or otherwise decrease the value of
our trademarks and other proprietary rights.

    NetZero
currently licenses from Oracle the software it uses to run its accounting, billing, finance, and data storage functions. The license agreement requires NetZero to pay annual
support and license fees to Oracle. The agreement terminates in April 2004. 

Privacy Policy  

    NetZero
believes that issues relating to the privacy of Internet users and the use of personal information about these users are critically important as the Internet and its
commercial use grow. NetZero has adopted and disclosed to its users a detailed policy outlining the permissible uses of information about users and the extent to which such information may be shared
with others. NetZero's users must acknowledge and agree to this policy when registering to use its service. NetZero does do not sell or license to third parties any personally identifiable information
about users unless they specifically authorize NetZero to do so. However, NetZero uses information about users to improve the effectiveness of advertising by its advertising customers. 

Employees  

    As of June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2000, NetZero employed 366 and 283 people, respectively. None of these employees are subject to any collective
bargaining agreement and relationships with employees are considered to be good. 

Facilities  

    NetZero's corporate headquarters are located in two facilities in Westlake Village, California. The facilities are 49,000 and 19,000 square feet and the leases
expire in May 2009 and December 2006, respectively. NetZero also leases space for its sales and marketing efforts in San Francisco, Chicago, Seattle and New York. 

Legal Proceedings  

    In December 2001, NetZero sued Juno for patent infringement and filed a motion for a temporary restraining order restricting Juno from displaying banner
advertisements on its service. In January 2001, the temporary restraining order was granted and NetZero posted a bond in the amount of $5.0 million. In April 2001, the temporary
restraining order was lifted and Juno subsequently informed NetZero that it intended to seek recourse against the bond to recover damages incurred during the time the temporary restraining order was
in place. NetZero believes its initial patent claims are meritorious, although the matter will not be decided until a trial on the merits, which may not occur until calendar 2002. If NetZero succeeds
on the merits, it does not believe Juno will be entitled to damages as a result of the temporary restraining order. Even if Juno were to succeed in its damage claim, NetZero does not believe that any
payments to be made by NetZero in connection therewith would be material to its financial position. However, there can be no assurance of the outcome of this matter. The court has stayed further
proceedings in anticipation of the mergers at the parties' request. It is expected that upon completion of the mergers, the legal actions described in this paragraph will be dismissed by the parties. 

    In
April 2001, NetZero and certain of its officers and directors were served with a complaint
(1)
 alleging violations of the federal securities laws. A number of
other complaints
(2)
 have since been filed containing similar allegations, but only two other complaints had been served as of June 30, 2001
(3)
. These complaints were
brought as purported shareholder class actions under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933.

2001); 
Peterson v. NetZero, Inc. et al
., United States District Court for the Southern District of New York Case No. 01 CV 3948 (filed May 9, 2001). 

    The
complaints generally allege that the prospectus through which NetZero conducted its initial public offering in September 1999 was materially false and misleading because it
failed to disclose, among other things, that (a) the underwriters of NetZero's initial public offering had solicited and received excessive and undisclosed commissions from certain investors in
exchange for which the underwriters allocated to those investors material portions of the restricted number of NetZero shares issued in connection with initial public offering; and (b) the
underwriters had entered into agreements with customers whereby they agreed to allocate NetZero shares to those customers in the initial public offering in exchange for which the customers agreed to
purchase additional NetZero shares in the aftermarket at pre-determined prices. The defendant underwriters include Goldman, Sachs and Co., as the lead underwriter in the offering, as well
as Banc Boston Robertson Stephens Inc. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. The complaints generally seek unspecified monetary and rescissionary damages. 

    The complaints listed herein are the only complaints in this matter that NetZero is aware of that have been filed as of June 30, 2001. There may be additional complaints
containing similar allegations that have been filed that NetZero is not aware of and there may be similar complaints filed in the future. NetZero anticipates that the complaints listed below that have
not yet been served on NetZero will be served in the near future. As of June 30, 2001, NetZero had not yet answered any of the complaints, and discovery had not yet commenced. NetZero believes
that the allegations are without merit and intends to defend the actions vigorously. 

    The
pending lawsuits involve complex questions of fact and law and likely will require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to defend. Although
NetZero believes the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, the results
of litigation are inherently uncertain, and an adverse outcome is at least reasonably possible. NetZero is unable to estimate the range of possible loss from outstanding litigation, and no amounts
have been provided for such matters in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

    NetZero
is also involved in other legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount, and ultimate
liability, if any, with respect to
these actions will not materially affect the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of NetZero.

JUNO'S BUSINESS    

    Juno is a leading provider of Internet access to millions of computer users throughout the United States. Juno provides multiple levels of service, including
free basic dial-up access and various billable premium Internet access services. Unlike most other Internet access providers, Juno offers both free basic and billable premium services, and Juno
believes it is unique in having converted hundreds of thousands of individuals from free to paying customers. Juno's strategy of offering several different service levels and its
easy-to-use, intuitive software are designed to attract a broad spectrum of users, including those who are just now beginning to explore the Internet. Based on its total of
3.3 million active subscribers during the month of June 2001, Juno is one of the nation's largest Internet access providers. Approximately 884,000 of these active subscribers were
subscribed to Juno's billable premium services as of June 2001.

    Juno's
services are provided nationwide through more than 4,000 local telephone numbers, which it leases from several providers. These phone numbers can be reached by the vast
majority of the U.S. population without having to place a long distance telephone call. Juno derives its revenues primarily from the subscription fees it charges for the use of its premium services,
and to a lesser extent from the sale of advertising and from various forms of electronic commerce. 

    Juno has been a pioneer in providing Internet services since April 1996, when Juno launched its basic service, which was the first on the Internet to provide free
e-mail. In July 1998, Juno introduced its first premium services, which offered features ranging from enhanced e-mail services to full access to the World Wide Web, and
for which Juno charged subscription fees. In 1999 and 2000, Juno announced a number of expansions of its services:


Juno's

Basic Service 
now provides full Internet access for free in addition to e-mail.


Juno Web 
provides competitively priced premium Internet access, supplementing the features of the basic
service with priority access to Juno's network and the reduction of some forms of on-screen advertising, as well as free live technical support and customer service for selected pricing
plans.


Juno Express 
is an experimental broadband service, currently provided to a small number of subscribers in
selected markets, which is designed to offer high-speed access to the Internet through a variety of technologies.

    In
operating its services, Juno has capitalized on the size of its existing user base, advantages Juno believes its technology confers on its cost structure, and its advertising sales
and electronic commerce activities. Juno's technology has been designed to maximize hours of consumer contact and potential advertising revenues while minimizing the number of hours each user actually
spends connected by telephone to its central computers or to the Web, a key component of its costs. Juno believes its subscribers spend significantly less time connected to the Internet each month
than those of its largest competitors, in part because of technology it has developed that enables subscribers to read and write e-mail offline rather than while connected. Importantly,
this technology allows Juno to continue displaying highly targetable interactive advertisements throughout this offline time. 

    As of June 30, 2001, more than 400 firms had advertised on Juno. In many cases, Juno derives revenues not only from advertising fees but also from conducting electronic
commerce in collaboration with its marketing partners. Juno has entered into a number of major strategic marketing alliances, some of which involved multi-million-dollar guaranteed minimum payments to
Juno, such as its multi-year relationship with Qwest Communications. Juno's advertising and strategic marketing activities benefit from its ability to target advertising to selected
segments of the Juno subscriber base on the basis of a wide variety of information obtained from a detailed electronic questionnaire that must be completed in order to sign up for Juno's basic
service.

    In addition to its advertising and strategic marketing relationships, Juno derives revenue from relationships with providers of Web-based content and functionality. All
Juno users begin each Web session on its portal site, www.juno.com, which contains tools, information, and product offers supplied by a wide range of strategic partners.

Juno's Services  

    Juno's services and software have been designed with special attention to the needs of consumers who are only now taking their first steps onto the Internet.
The needs and preferences of new Internet users often differ significantly from those of early Internet users and computer hobbyists, who tend to be more technically sophisticated. Juno has expended
significant effort to make its services easy to use. Juno's fundamental design goal has been to create software and Web-based functionality that novice users can understand at a glance,
but which will continue to satisfy subscribers once they have gained more experience. In addition to the basic functions of using the Internet, such as connecting to the Web and sending and receiving
e-mail, Juno also offers easy-to-use tools for accessing of variety of Web-based functionality, in-depth online customer service resources,
a full-function address book and folders for e-mail management, and access to a wide range of content and community features, all within a simple and visually attractive
point-and-click environment. 

    Each
time Juno subscribers begin a Web session, the first Web pages they see provide them with a broad set of tools and information to help them understand, navigate, and use the Web.
Most of the content, directory functionality, and Internet search functions associated with this Web site are currently provided by third parties. Such parties often compensate Juno through either
guaranteed or performance-based payments for promoting their content or features to the Juno subscriber base. 

    Over
time, Juno hopes to continue expanding the set of features it offers its users, and to use such features not only to generate revenue and enhance its services generally, but also
to maintain differentiation between its free basic service and its billable premium services. Subscribers who are not yet ready to use or pay for premium features can begin their use of the Internet
with its free basic service, then migrate to its premium services once they are ready to do so. 

    Free Basic Service.
  Juno's basic service provides subscribers with full access, including access to both
e-mail and the World Wide Web. Juno's subscribers pay Juno no fees of any sort for the use of its basic service. Users of the free basic service do, however, pay a fee of $1.95 per minute
if they wish to get live technical support by phone.

    Juno
displays advertisements to users of the free basic service in a variety of locations, including within the main Juno software, on the Web pages comprising Juno's portal site, and
on a persistent advertising banner displayed while free service subscribers use the Web. 

    After
receiving a copy of its software, a new subscriber follows simple, clearly worded on-screen instructions to install Juno on his or her computer, and to select an
e-mail address and password. In addition, in order to create an account, each subscriber to its free basic service must complete the Member Profile survey, providing information that can
be used for the selective targeting of advertising. Subscribers using a version of its software older than version Juno 4.0, must upgrade to version 4.0 or higher before they can use its basic service
to connect to the Web. 

    Juno Web.
  Juno's premium dial-up Internet access service, Juno Web, augments the basic service by reducing
some forms of on-screen advertising and by providing a number of premium features such as priority access to Juno's network. Subscribers to selected Juno Web pricing plans also receive
access to live technical support by phone at no charge, and are not required to complete the Member Profile.

    Juno Web's original list price of $19.95 per month is lower than the standard $23.90 price point offered by America Online or the standard $21.95 price point offered by The Microsoft
Network. In addition, since launching the service in 1998, Juno has made use of a variety of promotional offers that

include periods of discounted, free or prepaid access as well as pricing plans that offer Juno Web, sometimes with a reduced premium feature set, for flat monthly rates as low $4.95 and flat annual
rates as low as $23.40. Juno has recently reduced the use of discounted price plans for its pay services by offering higher-priced plans both through selected external marketing channels and to some
of its existing pay subscribers. At June 30, 2001, most of its billable subscribers were subscribed to a promotional plan offering its service at the flat rate of $9.95 per month. Juno intends
to continue experimenting with a variety of pricing plans in the future to determine their impact on profitability, subscriber acquisition, conversion and retention rates. 

    Juno Express.
  Juno Express is an experimental broadband service currently provided to a small number of subscribers in
selected markets, which is designed to offer high-speed access to the Internet through a variety of technologies. Juno Express provides users all the features of Juno Web plus the benefits of
broadband, including the ability to run high-bandwidth multimedia applications that include video and audio content as well as the availability of a dedicated, continuous connection to the
Internet. Juno will decide to what extent it will roll out its broadband services as the market for such services evolves, as consumer demand for various competing broadband offerings can be assessed,
and as the economics of offering broadband services improves, if it does.

    Juno has tested a cable version of Juno Express and recently entered into an agreement with AOL Time Warner to utilize their cable network to offer broadband services. While the
agreement provides United Online with the ability to enter the cable broadband market, the agreement anticipates expending significant resources in pursuing this line of business. The costs associated
with offering these services could be significant, and there is no assurance that any reasonable return can be realized from Juno's investment in this offering. In addition, the roll out of these
services is dependent on AOL Time Warner's roll out, and there is no assurance that they will be offered in a significant manner in the near term, if at all. Juno's agreement with AOL Time Warner may
be terminated if specified operational, regulatory or performance conditions are not met. Additionally, Juno's agreement with AOL Time Warner will terminate automatically if the FTC has not approved
it within a specified period of time. As of the date of this document, the FTC has not approved the agreement, and Juno cannot assure you that FTC approval will be obtained or, even if obtained, that
Juno will perform under the agreement to the satisfaction of the FTC or AOL Time Warner.

    Juno is not currently accepting any new subscriptions to Juno Express, and recently stopped providing the wireless version of this service when its third-party wireless access vendor,
Metricom, deactivated its service in August 2001. Juno currently believes that it is likely to discontinue the DSL version of Juno Express, at least in its present form, in the near future. If we do
not offer broadband services or, alternatively, if offering these services turns out to be unprofitable for us, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Juno's Strategy  

    Juno's principal objective is to maintain its position as a leading provider of consumer Internet-related services while driving its business toward
profitability, developing potentially valuable new strategic alliances and continuing its program of ongoing product innovation. In particular, Juno plans to: 

    Reduce the Costs Associated With Providing Free Service.
  Internal statistics collected toward the end of 2000 showed
that approximately 5% of Juno's active free subscriber base was responsible for more than half the total hours its free service was used to access the Web. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2000, Juno
began implementing measures designed in part to encourage heavier users of the free service to modify their usage patterns, upgrade to its billable premium services,
