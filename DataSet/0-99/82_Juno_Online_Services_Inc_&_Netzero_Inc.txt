Dear
Fellow Stockholders: 

    I
am pleased to be writing to you about the proposed combination of NetZero, Inc. and Juno Online Services, Inc. under our newly formed holding company, United
Online, Inc. This proposed combination will bring together two leaders in the value segment of the Internet access market. We believe this will create the second largest Internet service
provider, or ISP, in the nation based on active subscribers in March 2001. Together, the two companies had more than 7 million active subscribers in March 2001, including
approximately 1 million paying subscribers. Both companies have built widely recognized consumer brands that we will continue to leverage as we strive to grow our subscriber base. We believe
that the large existing base of free subscribers represents a valuable resource from which United Online can continue to build its pay subscriber base. 

    Importantly,
NetZero and Juno each bring distinct strengths to the relationship that are expected to generate significant synergies, resulting in increased financial strength and many
operating efficiencies. Operating efficiencies are expected to be gained in part through facilities and workforce rationalization, reduction in telecommunications costs, merger of back-end
technologies and consolidation of billing systems, marketing activities and product development. 

    We
believe that combining NetZero's and Juno's businesses will result in a stronger, more efficient and better capitalized company. As a single entity, we expect United Online to be a
major force in the value segment of the Internet access market and to provide greater long-term value for the stockholders of both companies. 

    NetZero's
board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and urges you to submit your proxy in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. I urge you to carefully
read this entire document because it contains important information about the proposed combination. 

    United
Online will apply to have its common stock listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "UNTD." United Online has registered up to 40.3 million shares of its
common stock in
connection with the combination. If the combination is completed, you will receive 0.2000 of a share of United Online's common stock for each share of NetZero common stock you own. This exchange ratio
is fixed in the merger agreement. 

    Your
vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please vote as soon as possible to make sure your
shares are represented at the special meeting. 

Very
truly yours, 

Mark R. Goldston

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGERS    

Q:
Why are NetZero and Juno proposing the mergers?

A:
We
are proposing the mergers because we believe that combining our two companies will enable us to build a stronger, more competitive and efficient enterprise than either company
would be on a stand-alone basis. By combining the two companies, United Online is positioned to capitalize on strengths of both companies while realizing a variety of cost benefits, particularly those
associated with telecommunications expense. After the mergers, NetZero and Juno will be wholly owned subsidiaries of United Online.

Q:
What will I receive in the mergers?

A:
Stockholders
of NetZero and Juno will receive the following in the mergers:


NetZero
common stockholders will receive 0.2000 of a share of United Online common stock for each share of NetZero common stock they own; and


Juno
common stockholders will receive 0.3570 of a share of United Online common stock for each share of Juno common stock they own. 

Q:
What stockholder approvals are needed?

A:
For
NetZero, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of NetZero's common stock is required to adopt the merger agreement. Each holder of NetZero
common stock is entitled to one vote per share. As of the record date, stockholders of NetZero owning approximately  %
of NetZero's outstanding shares, who are parties to voting agreements with Juno, agreed to vote all of their shares of NetZero common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. 

For
Juno, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Juno's common stock is required to adopt the merger agreement. Each holder of Juno common stock is entitled to
one vote per share. As of the record date, stockholders of Juno owning approximately  % of Juno's outstanding shares, who are parties to voting agreements with NetZero, agreed to vote
all of their shares of Juno common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. 

Q:
What do I need to do now?

A:
After
carefully reading and considering the information contained in this document, please respond by completing, signing and dating your proxy card or voting instructions and
returning it in the enclosed postage paid envelope, or, if available, by submitting your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet, as soon as possible so that your shares may
be represented at your special meeting. 

If
your shares are held in "street name" by your broker, you should follow the directions provided by your broker. Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how you would
like to vote your shares. 

Q:
What if I don't vote?

A:
       If
you fail to respond, it will have the same effect as a vote against the adoption of the merger agreement.


If
you respond and do not indicate how you want to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote to adopt the merger agreement.


If
you respond and abstain from voting, your proxy will have the same effect as a vote against the adoption of the merger agreement. 

Q:
Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy?

A:
Yes.
You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at one of the 

iii

special
meetings. You can do this in one of three ways: 


First,
you can revoke your proxy.


Second,
you can submit a new proxy. 

    If
you choose either of these two methods, you must submit your notice of revocation or your new proxy to the secretary of NetZero or Juno, as appropriate, before the special meeting.
If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you should contact your brokerage firm or bank to change your vote. 


Third,
if you are a holder of record, you can attend the special meeting and vote in person. If you submit your proxy or voting instructions electronically
through the Internet or by telephone, you can change your vote by submitting a proxy at a later date, using the same procedures, in which case your later submitted proxy will be recorded and your
earlier proxy revoked. 

Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates now?

A:
No.
After the mergers are completed, you will receive written instructions from the exchange agent on how to exchange your stock certificates for shares of United Online. Please do
NOT send in your stock certificates with your proxy.

Q:
Where will my shares of United Online common stock be listed?

A:
United
Online intends to apply to have its common stock listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "UNTD."

Q:
Will I receive dividends on my United Online shares?

A:
United
Online does not currently intend to pay dividends on its common stock.

Q:
When do you expect the mergers to be completed?

A:
We
are working to complete the mergers as quickly as possible. We anticipate completing the mergers immediately after both the NetZero stockholders and the Juno stockholders have
adopted the merger agreement.

Q:
Who can help answer my questions?

A:

you have any questions about the mergers or how to submit your proxy, or if you need additional copies of this document or the enclosed proxy card or voting instructions, you

The Mergers (see page   )  

    To accomplish the combination of NetZero and Juno, NetZero formed a new company, United Online, with two subsidiaries, NZ Acquisition Corp. and JO Acquisition
Corp. At the time the mergers are completed: 


NZ
Acquisition Corp. will be merged into NetZero, and NetZero will be the surviving corporation; and


JO
Acquisition Corp. will be merged into Juno, and Juno will be the surviving corporation.


As
a result, NetZero and Juno will each become a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Online. 

    Upon
completion of the mergers, stockholders of NetZero and Juno will receive the following: 


NetZero
common stockholders will receive 0.2000 of a share of our common stock for each share of NetZero common stock they own; and


Juno
common stockholders will receive 0.3570 of a share of our common stock for each share of Juno common stock they own. 

    These
exchange ratios are fixed in the merger agreement. 

Recommendation of the Boards of Directors (see page   )  

    To NetZero Stockholders:
  NetZero's board of directors believes that the transaction is fair to NetZero's stockholders
and in their best interests, and has unanimously voted to approve the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that NetZero's stockholders vote FOR the adoption of the merger agreement. 

    To Juno Stockholders:
  Juno's board of directors believes that the transaction is fair to Juno's stockholders and in
their best interests, and has unanimously voted to approve the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that Juno's stockholders vote FOR the adoption of the merger agreement. 

Opinions of Financial Advisors (see page   )  

    Opinion of NetZero's Financial Advisor:
  In deciding to approve the transaction, the NetZero board of directors
considered the opinion of its financial advisor, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, that, as of the date of its opinion, and subject to and based on the assumptions and considerations
referred to in its opinion, the ratio of the exchange ratio for Juno common stock to the exchange ratio for NetZero common stock pursuant to the merger agreement is fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of shares of NetZero common stock. The full text of this opinion is attached as Annex B to this document. NetZero urges its stockholders to read Morgan Stanley's opinion
carefully in its entirety. 

    Opinion of Juno's Financial Advisor.
  In deciding to approve the transaction, the Juno board of directors considered the
opinion of its financial advisor, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc., that, as of the date of its opinion, and subject to and based on the assumptions and considerations referred to in its opinion,
the 0.3570 ratio at which shares of Juno common stock convert into shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Juno common
stock. The full text of this opinion is attached as Annex C to this document. Juno urges its stockholders to read Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's opinion carefully in its entirety.

you are entitled to receive this document and to vote in connection 

with the mergers. On that date, there were            shares of NetZero common stock outstanding, approximately            of
which, or  percent, were owned by
NetZero's directors and executive officers. You can cast one vote for each share of NetZero common stock you own. The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of NetZero is required
for the mergers to go forward. 

    Juno.

entitled to receive this document and to vote in connection with the mergers. On that date, there were            shares of Juno common stock outstanding,
approximately            of
which, or   percent, were owned by Juno directors and executive officers. You can cast one vote for each share of Juno common stock you own. The affirmative vote of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Juno is required for the mergers to go forward. 

Voting Agreements (see page   )  

    NetZero.
  NetZero entered into voting agreements with David E. Shaw, several entities affiliated with Dr. Shaw,
and several directors and senior officers of Juno, which require these Juno stockholders to vote substantially all their shares of Juno common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.
As of the record date, these stockholders owned shares representing approximately  % of the voting power of Juno capital stock entitled to vote at the Juno special meeting. 

    Juno.
  Juno entered into a voting agreement with three of the executive officers of NetZero and five of the major
stockholders of NetZero, which require these NetZero stockholders to vote substantially all their shares of NetZero common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. As of the record
date, these stockholders owned shares representing approximately  % of the voting power of NetZero capital stock entitled to vote at the NetZero special meeting. 

Appraisal Rights (see page   )  

    Under Delaware law, so long as the NetZero common stock and the Juno common stock remain listed on the Nasdaq National Market as of their respective record
dates, you are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the mergers. 

    NetZero
received a notice from Nasdaq that NetZero was not in compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements because the trading price of NetZero's common stock was below $1.00 for 30
consecutive trading days. If the NetZero common stock does not remain listed on the Nasdaq National Market, then holders of NetZero common stock will be entitled to appraisal rights under Delaware
law. Juno does not have to close the transaction if the holders of more than five percent of the NetZero common stock exercise their appraisal rights. 

    NetZero
stockholders should carefully read the disclosure beginning on page   and in Annex D. The exercise of appraisal rights is a complicated legal act
and you should not rely solely on the disclosure in this document to inform you how to perfect your rights. 

Management of United Online Following the Mergers (see page   )  

    Our officers and directors will initially be the same persons who are the officers and directors of NetZero immediately before the mergers are completed. 

Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers (see page   )  

    Some of the directors and executive officers of NetZero and Juno have interests in the mergers that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of
their company's stockholders. 

    NetZero.
  These interests include the potential for positions as our directors or executive officers and the right to
continued indemnification and insurance coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the mergers. 

    Juno.
  These interests include the right to severance payments in cash, the right to 

consulting fees, the right to acceleration of vesting of stock options and the right to indemnification and insurance coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the mergers. 

Treatment of Stock Options and Restricted Stock (see page   )  

    NetZero.
  When the mergers are completed, each outstanding NetZero employee stock option will be assumed by us and will
be converted into an option to purchase that number of shares of our common stock equal to the product of 0.2000 multiplied by the number of shares of NetZero common stock underlying the option. The
exercise prices will be adjusted accordingly. In addition, each outstanding restricted share of NetZero common stock will be converted into 0.2000 of a share of our common stock. 

    Juno.
  When the mergers are completed, each outstanding Juno stock option will be assumed by us and will be converted
into an option to purchase that number of shares of our common stock equal to the product of 0.3570 multiplied by the number of shares of Juno common stock underlying the option. The exercise prices
will be adjusted accordingly. 

Exchange of Stock Certificates for United Online Stock Certificates (see page   )  

    When the mergers are completed, our exchange agent will mail to you a letter of transmittal and instructions for surrendering your NetZero or Juno stock
certificates in exchange for statements indicating book entry ownership of our common stock. If you make a special request, we will issue you stock certificates. 

    When
you deliver your stock certificates to the exchange agent along with a properly executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, your stock certificates will be
cancelled and you will receive statements indicating book entry ownership of our common stock or, if specially requested, stock certificates representing the number of full shares of our common stock
to which you are entitled under the merger agreement. You will receive payment in cash, without interest, in lieu of any fractional shares of our common stock which would have been otherwise issuable
to you as a result of the mergers. 

    You
should not submit your NetZero or Juno stock certificates for exchange until the mergers are completed and you receive the transmittal instructions and a form of letter of
transmittal from the exchange agent. 

    We
will only issue a stock certificate or a check in lieu of a fractional share in a name other than the name in which a surrendered NetZero or Juno stock certificate is registered if
you present the exchange agent with all documents required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership and show that you paid any applicable stock transfer taxes. 

Tax Consequences (see page   )  

    We have structured the mergers so that NetZero, Juno and their stockholders who exchange their shares for shares of United Online capital stock will not
recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes in connection with the mergers, except for taxes payable because of cash received instead of fractional shares. 

    You
should carefully read the disclosure beginning at page   and consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular tax consequences of the mergers to you. 

Overview of the Merger Agreement (see page   )  

    Conditions to the Completion of the Mergers.
  NetZero's and Juno's obligation to complete the mergers is subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, including those listed below: 


the
merger agreement must be adopted by a majority of both the NetZero and Juno stockholders;


no
statute, rule, regulation, order or injunction preventing the completion of the mergers may be in effect;


the
applicable waiting period under U.S. antitrust laws must have expired or been terminated; 


the
registration statement of which this document is a part must have become effective;


the
shares of our common stock to be issued in connection with the mergers must have been approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market;


NetZero
and Juno must have complied with their respective obligations in the merger agreement;


NetZero's
and Juno's respective representations and warranties in the merger agreement must be true and correct when made and, except for representations
and warranties that speak only as of a specified date, at the effective time of the mergers;


NetZero
and Juno must each receive an opinion of its respective tax counsel to the effect that its merger will qualify as a tax-free
reorganization;


No
material adverse effect will have occurred with respect to either NetZero or Juno;


Juno
will have entered into agreements to provide for a six month continuation of the existing lease and corporate services arrangements with respect to
Juno's operations in India;


the
voting agreements, the affiliate agreements and the non-competition agreements, must be in full force and effect; and


the
holders of no more than 5% of the outstanding stock of NetZero shall have exercised their appraisal rights, if available. 

Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page   )  

    NetZero and Juno can jointly agree to terminate the merger agreement at any time. Either party may also terminate the merger agreement if: 


the
mergers are not completed on or before November 30, 2001, so long as the failure to complete the mergers is not the result of the failure by
that company to fulfill any of its obligations under the merger agreement;


government
actions do not permit the completion of the mergers;


either
company's stockholders do not vote to adopt the merger agreement at a duly held meeting of that company's stockholders; or


the
other company breaches its representations, warranties or covenants in the merger agreement in a material way. 

    NetZero
may terminate the merger agreement if Juno's board of directors fails to recommend adoption of the merger agreement or effects a change in its recommendation of the merger
agreement, or if Juno fails to call a stockholder meeting or solicit proxies in order to approve the mergers. 

    Juno
may terminate the merger agreement if Juno's board of directors decides to accept a superior proposal from a third party so long as Juno has given NetZero three business days
notice and NetZero has not given Juno a non-revocable binding offer that Juno's board determines in good faith to be more favorable than the third party superior proposal and Juno has paid
NetZero the termination fee. 

Termination Fees and Expenses (see page   )  

    The merger agreement provides that in several circumstances, Juno may be required to pay a $2.5 million termination fee to NetZero. Each party also may
be required to reimburse the other party's expenses, up to $1.0 million. 

"No Solicitation" Provision (see page   )  

    The merger agreement contains detailed provisions prohibiting Juno from seeking an alternative takeover proposal. 

Regulatory Matters (see page   )  

    Under U.S. antitrust laws, we may not complete the mergers until we, NetZero and Juno have notified the Antitrust Division of the 

Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission of the mergers and have filed the necessary report forms, and until a required waiting period has ended. We, NetZero and Juno have filed the
required information and materials to notify the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission of the mergers. The waiting period under U.S. antitrust laws will expire on
July   , 2001, unless the government extends that date or grants us early termination of the waiting period. 

Accounting Treatment (see page   )  

    We intend to account for the mergers under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations. NetZero will be the acquiror for financial reporting
purposes. 

Completion and Effectiveness of the Mergers (see page   )  

    We will complete the mergers when all of the conditions to completion of the mergers are satisfied or waived in accordance with the merger agreement. The
mergers will become effective when we file certificates of merger with the State of Delaware, which we expect to file immediately after the stockholders of NetZero and Juno have adopted the merger
agreement at their respective meetings.

We
consider earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, adjusted for certain additional non-cash items ("Adjusted EBITDA") to be an important metric
when evaluating our performance, comparing our operations to those
of our competitors and as an indicator of our ability to manage our financial resources. However, adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating or net loss when evaluating
our performance or to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, in each case determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, our definition of
EBITDA adjusted for certain additional non-cash items, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE INFORMATION    

    We present below per share data regarding the income and book value of NetZero and Juno on both a historical and a per share equivalent unaudited pro forma
basis. We derived the unaudited pro forma consolidated per share information from our unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. You should read the
information below in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes of NetZero and Juno and with the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
document. The NetZero and Juno equivalent pro forma per share data are calculated by multiplying the United Online per share amounts by the respective NetZero and Juno exchange ratios to United
Online's common stock.

RISK FACTORS    

Before you vote for adoption of the merger agreement and as a result of voting make a decision to exchange your shares of NetZero or
Juno common stock for shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this
document, including the section entitled "Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to us or that we believe are now immaterial may also impair our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results
of operations could be materially adversely affected, the value of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.

Risks Associated with the Mergers    

There are many conditions to the completion of the mergers and we cannot assure you that the mergers will be completed.  

    There are many conditions to NetZero's and Juno's obligations to complete the mergers. Many of these conditions are beyond our, NetZero's or Juno's control.
Although this document may speak as though the mergers will be consummated, you should realize that those statements anticipate the completion of the mergers on the terms of the merger agreement. We
cannot assure you that the mergers will be completed. 

Fluctuations in market prices may cause the value of the shares of our common stock that you receive to be less than the value of your shares of NetZero stock or Juno stock.  

    Upon completion of the mergers, all shares of NetZero common stock and Juno common stock will be converted into shares of our common stock. The ratios at which
the shares will be converted are fixed, and there will be no adjustment for changes in the market price of either NetZero common stock or Juno common stock. Any change in the price of either NetZero
common stock or Juno common stock will affect the value Juno stockholders and NetZero stockholders will receive in connection with the mergers. Both NetZero common stock and Juno common stock have
historically experienced significant
price volatility, and the value of the shares of our common stock you receive may go up or down as the market price of NetZero common stock or Juno common stock goes up or down. Stock price changes
may result from a variety of factors that are beyond the control of NetZero and Juno, including changes in their businesses, operations and prospects, regulatory considerations and general market and
economic conditions. No party is permitted to "walk away" from the mergers or resolicit the vote of its stockholders solely because of changes in the market price of any party's common stock. 

    The
prices of NetZero common stock and Juno common stock at the closing of the mergers may vary from their respective prices on the date of this document and on the dates of the
special meetings. Because the date the mergers are completed may be later than the dates of the special meetings, the prices of NetZero common stock and Juno common stock on the dates of the special
meetings may not be indicative of their respective prices on the date the mergers are completed. 

We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the mergers.  

    The success of the mergers will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies from combining the businesses of NetZero and Juno. To
realize the anticipated benefits of this combination, members of our management team must develop strategies and implement a business plan that will: 


successfully
integrate each company's organizations, operations, technologies, policies, procedures, product lines and services and customer bases; 

integrate
and retain advertising customers, vendors and subscribers from both companies; 


successfully
manage telecommunications contracts to efficiently benefit Juno's and NetZero's services; 

reduce
the costs associated with each company's operations; 

successfully
market both companies' services; 

assimilate
the personnel of both companies and maintain or increase employee morale in light of management changes and other operational disruptions; 

successfully
retain and attract key employees, including operating management and key technical personnel, during a period of transition and in light of
the competitive employment market; and 

while
integrating the combined company's operations, maintain adequate focus on the core businesses in order to take advantage of competitive opportunities
and to respond to competitive challenges. 

    If
members of our management team are not able to develop strategies and implement a business plan that achieves these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the mergers may not be
realized. In particular, the anticipated cost and other synergies may not materialize, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and harm the market price of
shares of our common stock. 

Officers and directors of NetZero and Juno have potential conflicts of interest in recommending that you vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement.  

    A number of officers and directors of NetZero and Juno who recommend that you vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement may receive benefits from
the mergers which may make their interests in the mergers different from yours. Specifically, the executive officers and directors of NetZero have the potential for continued employment and/or
membership on our board as they will be our executive officers and directors following completion of the mergers. In addition, Mr. Charles Ardai, Juno's chief executive officer, and
Mr. Harshan Bhangdia, Juno's senior vice president and chief financial officer, are entitled to receive guaranteed payments and accelerated vesting of options if they are terminated under
certain circumstances in connection with or after completion of the mergers. We expect that Messrs. Ardai and Bhangdia will be terminated without cause when the mergers are completed. In
addition, non-employee directors of Juno hold options that will become immediately vested upon a change in control. In addition, Juno will enter into facility leases with entities affiliated with
David E. Shaw, chairman of the board of directors of Juno, and we will provide Dr. Shaw and affiliates of certain directors of NetZero with registration rights. These potential benefits
may influence these executive officers and directors of NetZero and Juno in making their recommendation that you vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. 

Both NetZero and Juno have a history of losses; we expect to incur losses in the future and may never achieve profitability.  

    Both NetZero and Juno have a history of losses and there is no assurance that we will ever become profitable. Juno has incurred net losses of approximately
$289.1 million from its inception in June 1995 through March 31, 2001, including a net loss of approximately $9.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2001.
NetZero has incurred net losses of approximately $270.2 million from its inception in
July 1997 through March 31, 2001, including a net loss of approximately $91.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2001. We will be continuing the businesses of both
NetZero and Juno and thus expect the net losses of these subsidiaries to continue. Although our strategy is to maximize the profitability of both companies, we cannot assure you that we will be
successful in doing so, or that we will achieve profitability. We may never be successful in implementing our business strategies or in addressing the risks and uncertainties facing our company. Even
if we do implement these strategies and address these risks successfully, our business may never become cashflow positive 

or profitable. Were we to achieve profitability for any particular period, we cannot assure you that we would be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis thereafter. 

Costs associated with the mergers.  

    We anticipate incurring substantial costs in connection with the mergers and the integration of Juno's and NetZero's operations. Anticipated costs include
severance pay for employees; accounting, legal and investment banking fees; restructuring fees associated with duplicate facilities, contract amendments or terminations; and a variety of other
expenses associated with the closing of the transaction or the integration of the companies. While costs are estimated to be $20 million to $25 million, there can be no assurance that
actual costs will not exceed estimated amounts. These merger costs will significantly impact our cash resources. 

Risks Associated with Our Operations Which Will Not Be Reduced in the Mergers    

We cannot predict our success because our business model is unproven and changing.  

    Juno began offering Internet services in April 1996 and NetZero began offering Internet services in October 1998. Each company has made
significant changes to its business model to address changes in the market as well as other factors. We expect to make additional changes to each company's business model in the future, including
consolidating future billable services under the Juno brand and free services under the NetZero brand, as well as instituting additional limitations on our free service offering. These limited
operating histories, as well as changes in our business model, makes it difficult to evaluate or predict our performance. As a company in the rapidly evolving market for Internet services, we face
numerous risks and uncertainties. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in
executing our business strategy, our business and financial results will suffer. Some of these risks relate to our ability to: 


attract
and retain subscribers, particularly to the extent that we limit marketing activities; 

anticipate
and adapt to the changing market for Internet services; 

generate
revenues sufficient to cover our operating expenses; 

effectively
price our services so that we can operate profitably; 

preserve
or raise the capital necessary to fund our operations to the extent that they are not profitable; 

control
the cost of providing our free service by implementing measures designed to discourage excessive use of such service, and to do so without causing
undesirable levels of subscriber attrition; 

maintain
and develop strategic relationships with business partners to advertise on our services, particularly in light of ongoing weakness in the market
for Internet advertising; 

achieve
and maintain attractive rates for telecommunications services; 

respond
to actions taken by our competitors and the entry of new competitors into our markets; 

effectively
market our services in light of the significant marketing resources of our competitors; 

develop
and deploy successive versions of our software; 

operate
computer systems and related infrastructure adequate to effectively provide our services; 

provide
technical and customer support to our subscribers in a cost-effective manner; 

manage
the billing systems used to invoice subscribers; and 

attract,
retain and motivate qualified personnel. 

Our stock price could fall as a result of future losses and negative cash flow.  

    We have a significant accumulated deficit. We expect to continue to experience losses and negative cash flow. Our ability to achieve profitability or positive
cash flow depends upon a number of factors, 

including our ability to increase revenue and reduce per-user costs. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or grow our revenues or that we will obtain sufficient revenues
to achieve profitability or positive cash flow. If we do achieve profitability, we cannot be certain that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If we
fail to do so, the market price for our common stock could suffer. 

Our business is subject to fluctuations which may negatively impact the price of our common stock.  

    Juno's and NetZero's revenues, expenses and operating results have varied in the past and ours may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of
factors, including, without limitation: 


patterns
of subscriber acquisition and retention, and seasonal trends relating to subscriber usage of our services; 

the
extent to which our reduction in marketing activity affects our ability to acquire and retain subscribers; 

fluctuations
in marketing and promotional activities; 

our
ability to attract and retain new free users, particularly if we market our pay services more heavily than our free services; 

the
availability and effectiveness of any revenue sharing arrangements or other strategic alliances; 

changes
in the market for Internet advertising and our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our advertisers; 

seasonal
trends relating to Internet advertising spending; 

capital
expenditures related to upgrading our computer systems and related infrastructure; 

our
ability to protect our systems from any telecommunications failures, power loss or software-related system failures; 

our
ability to integrate operations and technologies from any subsequent acquisitions or other business combinations or relationships into which we enter; 

the
extent to which we experience increased competition in the market for Internet access services; 

changes
in operating expenses including, in particular, telecommunications expenses and the cost of providing various types of technical and
non-technical customer support to our subscribers; and 

economic
conditions specific to the Internet, as well as general economic and market conditions. 

    Since
we expect to be heavily dependent on revenues from our pay services in the foreseeable future, our revenues are likely to be particularly affected by our ability to recruit new
subscribers to our pay services, particularly by encouraging users of our free service to upgrade to our pay services, and our ability to retain subscribers to our pay services. In addition, our
operating expenses are based on our expectations of our future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term. We may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any revenue shortfall,
which may cause our business and financial results to suffer. 

    Due
to all of the above factors and the other risks discussed in this section, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of
operations as an indication of future performance. It is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In this
event, the price of our common stock is likely to fall. 

Our market share and revenues will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively for users with established and new providers of Internet access services.  

 Competitors  

    Competition for users of Internet access services is intense. We expect to compete for users with the following types of companies that provide access
services: 


established
online service and content providers, such as AOL Time Warner, CompuServe and The Microsoft Network; 

independent
national Internet service providers, such as EarthLink and Prodigy; 

companies
that provide free Internet access under their own brands as well as companies that provide free Internet access co-branded with, or
under the brands of, third parties; 

national
long-distance carriers, such as AT&T WorldNet, Verizon and MCI WorldCom; 

local
telephone companies and regional Bell operating companies, such as Pacific Bell; 

numerous
regional and local commercial Internet service providers; 

computer
hardware and software and other technology companies, such as IBM and Microsoft; 

cable
operators and online cable services, such as Excite@Home and Road Runner; 

companies
providing Internet access bundled with personal computers such as PeoplePC, Dell and Gateway; 

companies
providing Internet access services using other broadband technologies, including digital subscriber line technology, or DSL; 

retail
companies such as K-Mart, Costco and WalMart; and 

nonprofit
or educational Internet service providers. 

    We
expect that competition for users will continue to intensify. While there has recently been a period of decreased competition for users of free Internet access services due to the
failure of numerous free Internet access providers, there can be no assurance there will not be additional competition from new competitors. In addition, because we will focus our resources primarily
on pay services and may impose additional limitations on our free services, we believe that we will experience more direct competition from companies who charge for their Internet service, including
those who charge on a discounted basis. Companies that offer pay Internet access services, including AOL Time Warner and The Microsoft Network, have significantly greater resources than we do and
spend significantly greater resources marketing to users. While our pay services are, in general, priced below the standard pricing of several of our competitors, several companies have announced
similarly priced offerings which may make it more difficult for us to compete. For example, AT&T WorldNet offers a $4.95 per month service and AOL Time Warner's CompuServe recently announced a $9.95
per month offering in combination with WalMart. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively for users of pay services. We believe that additional competitors for Internet users,
including major computer manufacturers, retail companies, and software, media and telecommunications companies, will continue to enter the Internet access market. Existing competitors have taken, and
may continue to take, steps such as reducing their subscriber fees, offering promotions for access services, or bundling free access services with other product offerings. For example, both The
Microsoft Network, CompuServe and EarthLink have partnered with personal computer makers and consumer electronics retailers to offer consumers rebates on computer equipment when the consumer signs up
for their Internet access services. 

    We
believe that increased competition has, from time to time, impacted our growth and may impact our growth in the future, resulting in increased user turnover and additional sales
and marketing expenses that increase user acquisition cost. Increased competition could also result in decreased advertising revenue. Since we rely primarily on advertising revenues to offset some of
the costs of our free services and do not charge the vast majority of our users membership fees, we may 

not be able to cover these increased costs, and we may not have the resources to compete successfully. The ability of our competitors to acquire other Internet providers or to enter into strategic
alliances or joint ventures could also put us at a significant competitive disadvantage. 

    Our
competitors may be able to charge less for Internet services than we do for our pay services, or offer services for free that we provide only for a fee, which may put pressure on
us to reduce or eliminate, or prevent us from raising, the fees we charge for our pay services. We may choose, for competitive or other reasons, to lower or eliminate the fees we currently charge for
our pay services, or enhance the features available to users of our free service, in order to remain competitive with other industry participants. Any decrease in such prices could result in a
reduction in our billable services revenue and would harm the profitability of our pay services. 

    Recently,
however, Juno has begun to increase the prices it charges some subscribers to its billable premium services in an effort to increase its billable services revenue and
improve the profitability of such services. We may choose to implement additional price increases in the future. Such price increases can be expected to result in subscriber attrition, possibly to an
extent sufficient to cause overall revenues from our billable services to decline, and this outcome could cause our business and financial results to suffer. 

 Telecommunications Services  

    In addition, telecommunications companies with far greater resources, distribution channels and brand awareness offer, or have announced that they will offer,
their own Internet access services to users. Since these companies have their own telecommunications network infrastructure, they may have lower communications costs than we do. These potential
advantages may reduce the overall cost of Internet access for such companies and may significantly increase competitive pressures on us. For example, AT&T WorldNet offers an Internet access service
priced at $4.95 per month combined with an advertising banner window, and also announced a program where it bundles its Internet access service with its long distance service at a discounted rate. In
addition, each of our telecommunications providers supplies network access to one or more of our competitors, and could choose to grant those competitors preferential network access, potentially
limiting our users' ability to access the Internet. If our telecommunications service providers were to decrease the levels of service or access provided to us, or if they were to terminate their
relationships with us for competitive or other reasons, and we were not able to develop alternate sources of supply, we would not be able to provide Internet access
to our customers, which could ultimately result in a significant loss of users and revenues or in our ceasing operations entirely. 

 Broadband Providers  

    We also face competition from companies that provide broadband Internet access, including local and long-distance telephone companies, cable
television companies, electric utility companies, wireless communications companies and other Internet service providers. Most of our subscribers use our services via dial-up modems, which
are generally limited to access speeds of up to 56 kbps. Broadband technologies enable users to transmit and receive print, video, voice and data in digital form at significantly faster access speeds.
Juno currently provides broadband services only on a limited scale and NetZero provides no broadband services. The expansion of this product offering could require substantial time and expense. We
cannot be certain that we will succeed in adapting our Internet access service business to compete effectively with these technologies. 

    Juno
recently entered into an agreement with AOL Time Warner to utilize their cable network to offer broadband services. While the agreement provides us with the ability to enter the
cable broadband market, the agreement anticipates that we will expend significant resources in pursuing this line of business. The costs associated with offering these services could be significant,
and we cannot be sure that we will realize any reasonable return from our investment in this offering. In addition, the roll out of our services is dependent on AOL Time Warner's roll out, and there
is no assurance that we will 

offer these services in a significant manner in the near term, if at all. Our failure to successfully offer these services could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

    In
addition to competing directly in the Internet access market, both cable and telephone companies are also aligning themselves with Internet service providers who would receive
preferential or exclusive use of broadband local connections to users. If broadband Internet access becomes the preferred mode by which users access the Internet and we are unable to gain access to
broadband networks on reasonable terms, our ability to compete could be materially and adversely affected. 

    There
is no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining or furthering our current strategy to deliver broadband services. Several of the back-end providers of the
broadband services we offer have experienced severe financial difficulties, and we are currently not offering these services to new subscribers. Pursuing our broadband strategy could result in greater
operating costs, which could adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. 

    If
consumers adopt alternative forms of Internet access that provide a continuous connection to the Internet rather than relying on a series of separate dial-up connections, then we
may have to modify the means by which we deliver our Internet services. In this event, we would incur significant costs. If other companies are able to prevent us from delivering our Internet services
through the wire, cable and wireless connections that they own, if we are unable to adapt to the challenges posed by broadband technologies or if we incur significant costs without generating
sufficient revenues, our business and financial results may suffer. 

If we are unable to grow our user base, we may not be able to generate revenues, decrease per-hour telecommunications costs or implement our strategy.  

    Growth in our pay user base will be critical to our future success. Increasing our pay user base involves two components: converting our free service users to
our pay service and gaining new pay users who have not previously used our free service. In each of these cases, we are competing directly with other pay service offerings and, due to the resources of
our competitors and other factors, there is no assurance we will achieve success in signing up and retaining new pay users. If we experience decreases in our pay user base, our ability to generate
revenues, decrease per-hour telecommunication costs and to implement our strategy will be adversely impacted. 

    The
portion of our strategy of increasing our pay service base by converting free users to pay users is dependent on our having a growing free user base. In the past, NetZero has
experienced such rapid growth in its free user base that it has instituted measures to limit the number of new free users on its service. Due to a variety of restrictions and revenue generating
initiatives NetZero imposes on its free service offering, NetZero has recently experienced a decline in its number of active free users. This decline may continue into the future. If we implement
additional limitations, restrictions or requirements on our free access services, we may experience further significant declines in the number of existing free users as well as new free users
accessing our service. This may significantly and adversely impact our ability to grow. Unless we are able to convert a significant number of free users to pay users, our revenues will be adversely
impacted. 

    We
hope to generate new users through various marketing channels, such as television, radio and print media advertising, direct marketing campaigns, and bundling,
co-branding and retail distribution arrangements. If these marketing channels prove more costly or less effective than anticipated, it could adversely impact our ability to grow our pay
user base. 

    Even
if we are successful in acquiring a significant number of pay users, we do not know if these users will continue to use our service. We would be unable to grow our user base if a
significant number of our users stopped using our service. There are a variety of reasons why users would discontinue using our service, including: 


free
users may object to the restrictions and limitations we impose on our free service and decide to terminate their account with us in favor of a
competing service; 


free
users may decide they do not like the always-present nature of the ZeroPort and the Juno Guide or the presence of advertising on our service; 

pay
users may object to a variety of factors associated with our services, including the price we charge (which, with respect to Juno's pay services, may
be based on a particular user's usage pattern), the limited support we provide, the existence of a thin toolbar on the NetZero service, and (with respect to the NetZero pay services) that we do not
provide the same service for all users in a particular household; 

users
may not like having their online activities tracked; 

reliability
issues, which we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future, may cause user dissatisfaction; and 

our
limited user support may frustrate users who have difficulty using our service. 

    There
is no assurance that we will be able to retain or grow our existing user base. 

Federal Trade Commission action could impact our financial results and marketing practices.  

    The FTC has been investigating the advertising, billing and cancellation practices of various Internet-related companies, including Juno. At the FTC's request,
Juno provided marketing-related and customer service-related information concerning its services. On the basis of these submissions, the FTC staff has claimed, among other things, that Juno's
disclosure practices about the possibility of users incurring telephone charges were insufficient, and that Juno's cancellation policies for subscribers to its pay services were unduly restrictive. On
the basis of its discussions with the FTC staff, Juno began implementing modifications to the disclosure it makes about telecommunications charges that users might incur and to its pay services
cancellation practices. 

    On
May 15, 2001, the FTC announced a consent agreement with Juno concerning the advertising of Juno's Internet access services. The consent agreement, which was issued for
public comment, remains subject to a public comment period and final approval by the FTC. Under the terms of the consent agreement, Juno would be barred from making misrepresentations about the cost
of its Internet access services, and would be required to disclose the cancellation terms for these services in a clear and conspicuous manner, provide adequate customer support to process
subscribers' requests to cancel, and to make prominent disclosure that subscribers may incur long distance telephone charges while using Internet access services. The proposed settlement would also
require Juno to give notice to certain subscribers who cancelled the service and identified the unavailability of local access numbers, or the incurrence of long distance charges, as a reason or who
participated in specified rebate programs. Under the terms of the consent agreement, Juno would provide an opportunity for such subscribers to apply for refunds for long distance telephone charges
they incurred to use Juno's services for up to two months following their subscription. Subject to the final outcome after the public comment period, it is anticipated Juno will be required, under a
consent order or otherwise, to make compensatory payments and, potentially, to further revise its advertising and marketing materials, and to make further modifications to its business practices. As a
result, our business and financial results could suffer. There can be no certainty as to the impact of any actions by the FTC on our business. 

If we fail to generate significant revenues from our pay services, we may not be able to support our operations.  

    Our ability to generate significant revenues from our pay services will be critical to our future success. Generating pay revenues includes both increasing our
pay user base as well as maintaining or increasing our pricing. Juno has offered a variety of pricing programs, and has in certain cases increased the pricing, to certain users based on their usage.
Juno's monthly prices have ranged from $4.95 to $29.95. A significant number of users who have experienced price increases have discontinued their service, which adversely impacts revenues. In
addition, a key component of signing up pay users is through the conversion of free users to pay services. Our failure to convert free users to pay services 

could also adversely impact our pay service revenues. The failure to generate significant revenues from pay users would adversely impact our ability to support our operations. 

Our ability to derive a profit from our pay services will be dependent on our subscribers' usage habits.  

    Our ability to offer a value priced pay service will be adversely impacted if subscribers to our pay service use the Internet excessively. We price our
standard offering based on the expectation that users will access the Internet for only a limited number of hours each month. If the average monthly usage for our pay subscribers exceeds our
expectations, or if our average hourly telecommunications cost increases, we may not be able to operate our value priced pay service profitably. We may have to
impose hourly limits on our pay services or increase our standard pricing, either of which could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain users to our pay services or compete effectively. 

If we fail to generate sufficient advertising revenues, we may not be able to support our operations.  

    In the long term, our strategy is to generate a majority of our revenues from pay services. However, advertising revenues are intended to be a key component of
our strategy and revenue base going forward, and will be critical to our success. If we fail to generate sufficient advertising revenues, we may not be able to support our operations. To date,
advertising revenues have not been sufficient to support our operations. Our operating costs have continued to increase from quarter to quarter while our revenues from advertising have, from time to
time, decreased from quarter to quarter. We generate revenues from a variety of different advertising arrangements including sales of targeted and untargeted banner advertising, sponsorships,
performance-based arrangements and referrals to third party Web sites. We have limited experience marketing and pricing these types of arrangements, and have limited experience with respect to the
performance of such arrangements. As such, we do not know if we are appropriately pricing, marketing or structuring these arrangements, or whether we will perform under these arrangements to the
satisfaction of the other parties. Our failure to appropriately price, market or structure these arrangements could impact our ability to enter into and perform under these arrangements, or to renew
these arrangements on similar or acceptable terms. Due to a variety of factors, including the deterioration of the online advertising market and the decrease in capital available to Internet
companies, we have experienced a number of situations where arrangements are terminated early, are not renewed, are renewed at significantly lower rates or are repriced during the term of the
arrangement. These factors may significantly impact our ability to enter into new arrangements with third parties, to enforce our existing arrangements and to maintain or grow our revenues. In
addition, the success of some of these arrangements may depend on our ability to effectively target users based on demographic and other information. We may encounter technical and other limitations
on this ability, including problems associated with the accuracy of the information provided by our users, which we do not corroborate. In light of these factors, there can be no assurance that we
will be able to attract sufficient advertising revenues to support our operations. 

    Many
of the purchasers of Internet advertising have been companies with Internet-based business models. Many of these companies have come under financial pressure and have not been
able to access the capital markets to fund their operations. This trend has adversely impacted our revenues and could impact our ability to generate revenues in the future and result in increased
reserves for doubtful accounts. 

    In
addition, competition for Internet-based advertising revenues is intense and the demand for advertising space has been declining. These and other factors are causing Internet
advertising rates to decline, and it is possible that rates will continue to decline in the future. Also, our growth in users has resulted in, and in the future may result in, our advertising
inventory growing faster than our ability to sell the inventory at reasonable rates. 

    Many
of our advertising competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger user bases, significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing
resources and more established relationships with advertisers than we do. These advantages may allow such competitors to 

respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in advertiser requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources than we can to develop, promote and sell
their products and services. Such competitors may also engage in more extensive research and development, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing
policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential employees, strategic partners, advertisers and Internet publishers. In addition, current and potential competitors have established
or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products or services to address the needs of our prospective customers. We must also
compete with television, radio, cable and print media for a share of advertisers' total advertising budgets. Advertisers may be reluctant to devote a significant portion of their advertising budget to
Internet advertising if they perceive the Internet to be a limited or ineffective advertising medium. Our market share and revenues would suffer if we were not able to compete effectively for users
with established and new providers of Internet access services. 

If we are unable to retain subscribers, our business and financial results will suffer.  

    Our business and financial results are dependent on, among other things, the number of subscribers to our services. Our number of active subscribers has a
significant impact on our ability to attract advertisers, the number of advertising impressions we have available to sell, and on how many pay service subscribers we can potentially acquire by
soliciting users of our free service. Each month, a significant number of our pay service subscribers choose to cancel the service. In addition, each month a significant number of our free service
subscribers become inactive. It is easy for Internet users to switch to competing providers, and we believe that intense competition has caused, and may continue to cause, many of our subscribers to
switch to other services. In addition, new subscribers may decide to use our services only out of curiosity, or to take advantage of free or low-cost introductory offers, and may later
discontinue using our services. 

    NetZero
and Juno have taken measures to discourage heavy usage by their free subscribers, which has caused, and may continue to cause, significant subscriber attrition. In early 2001,
NetZero limited the number of hours its free users could use the service each month to 40 hours per household per month. Since implementing that change, there has been a decrease in NetZero's
free user base. We may further reduce the number of hours users may access our free service without charge or take other measures to limit the usage of our free service. In addition, Juno limits the
availability of its free service by prioritizing access based on usage levels and other factors. Such prioritization mechanisms currently make it more difficult for heavier users of Juno's free
service to establish and maintain a Web connection, particularly during those hours when overall usage tends to be highest. 

    We
expect to continue taking measures to reduce the costs associated with our free service. As a result of these measures, we expect to experience at least some degree, and possibly a
substantial amount, of incremental subscriber attrition. We are unable to predict the amount of such attrition we might experience overall, or the extent to which it might involve subscribers other
than those heavier users to whom we currently target these measures. In the event the decrease in the size of our subscriber base is significant, and particularly to the extent such attrition were to
involve subscribers other than the targeted groups, such measures could cause our business and financial results to suffer. Furthermore, Juno has reduced the use of discounted pricing plans for its
pay services, by offering higher-priced plans both through selected external marketing channels and to some of its existing pay subscribers. We believe these pricing changes will cause attrition from
Juno's pay services in excess of that which we would expect in the absence of such changes. If these or other changes result in the loss of a significant number of subscribers, our business and
financial results will suffer. 

    In
the past, we have experienced lengthy periods during which subscriber attrition caused the total number of subscribers using our services in a given month to remain relatively
static or decrease despite our addition of a substantial number of new users to our services. In recent quarters, Juno has significantly reduced its levels of expenditure for subscriber acquisition
and retention, and we expect to 

further reduce our expenditures for such activities in the future. Although the many factors affecting subscriber acquisition and retention make it difficult to accurately predict the future size of
our subscriber base, we currently expect that our active free subscriber count will decline and that our active pay subscriber count may decline, in coming quarters, due to the factors described
above, among others. If the decline in the size of our active or pay subscriber base were significant, our business and financial results will suffer. 

If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions into our operations, then we may not realize the benefits associated with such acquisitions and our financial condition
and results of operations may be adversely affected.  

    We may acquire other companies or undertake other business combinations that can complement our current or planned business activities. We are currently
evaluating the possibility of acquiring and integrating additional Internet service providers offering pay services. Acquisitions may not be available at the times or on terms acceptable to us, or at
all. In addition, acquiring a business involves many risks, including: 


disruption
of our ongoing business and diversion of resources and management time; 

unforeseen
obligations or liabilities; 

difficulty
assimilating the acquired operations and personnel; 

risks
of entering markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience; 

potential
impairment of relationships with employees or users as a result of changes in management; and 

potential
dilutive issuances of equity, large and immediate write-offs, the incurrence of debt, and amortization of goodwill or other
intangible assets. 

    There
can be no assurance that we will make any further acquisitions, that we will be able to obtain additional financing for such acquisitions, if necessary, or that any acquisitions
will be successful. 

    In
addition, we also may not realize the benefits associated with the intangible assets we acquired. For example, as of December 31, 2000, NetZero had approximately
$55.0 million in intangible assets recorded on its balance sheet, which primarily included goodwill and acquired technologies associated with acquisitions. During the quarter ended
March 31, 2001, NetZero determined the carrying value of these assets was impaired using the discounted cash flow method and the market comparison method. An impairment charge relating to
goodwill, intangible assets and other assets totaling approximately $48.6 million was recorded during the quarter, reflecting the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeded
their respective fair values. The impairment consisted of approximately $33.5 million for goodwill and approximately $15.1 million for other acquired intangible assets and other assets.
There can be no assurance that we will not experience similar impairment losses in the future. Any such loss could adversely and materially impact our results of operations and financial condition. 

The provision of full Internet access for free creates substantial risks.  

    We face numerous costs, operational and legal risks, and other uncertainties associated with our provision of free Internet access to consumers, including the
following: 


risks
that our paying subscribers will cancel their subscription and switch to our free service;


risks
that the number of hours our free service users use, and the costs of providing the service, will not decrease, and may increase; and


risks
that we may be unable to generate significant revenues from the sale of advertising. 

    If
the number of our subscribers who remain on, or return to, the free service is significant, our business and financial results may suffer. As users of the service spend more time
connected, the costs we incur to provide the service increase. Both NetZero and Juno recently began implementing measures designed to address disproportionate resource consumption by relatively heavy
users of their free service, but there can be no assurance that these or any future measures will be successful in reducing either average connection time per subscriber or aggregate connection time
for all users of the service on an ongoing basis. If aggregate hours of connection time associated with our free services increase or do not continue to decline, our business and financial results may
suffer. 

Our ability to cause our free service subscribers to upgrade to our pay services is uncertain. If the number of subscribers upgrading to our pay services falls short of our
goals, our business and financial results will suffer.  

    Our business strategy contemplates that some of the subscribers to our free service will decide over time to upgrade to our pay services. We are relying
increasingly on this migration as a major source of subscribers to our pay services. Since July 1998, Juno has advertised to its free users encouraging them to upgrade and NetZero initiated a
similar campaign in March 2001. There is a risk that repeated exposure to their advertisements may cause their effectiveness to decline. Furthermore, to the extent that our number of active
free subscribers declines, we will have a smaller pool of free subscribers to solicit, further reducing the absolute number of potential migrations to our pay services. As a result, advertisements
promoting our pay services to our free subscribers may prove insufficient to generate a
material number of new subscriptions to our pay services. The rate at which users of the free service upgrade to our pay services may decline, and for this and other reasons, our overall pay
subscribers count is likely to decline. If our marketing techniques fail to generate an adequate conversion rate from free to pay services, if the acquisition cost for subscribers acquired directly or
indirectly into our pay services is greater than expected, if diminished capital resources require us to curtail even further our use of external marketing channels, or if technical limitations make
the conversion process more difficult or time-consuming than anticipated, our business and financial results will suffer. 

Our advertising revenues will suffer if we are unable to demonstrate that our subscribers are actively using our service or that the active subscriber bases of NetZero and Juno
services do not overlap significantly.  

    If we are not able to demonstrate to our advertisers that our registered users are actively using our service, advertisers may choose not to advertise with us
and our advertising revenues could be materially and adversely affected. Approximately 8.6 million users had registered for NetZero's service through March 31, 2001, of which
approximately 3.9 million had used NetZero's service during the month of March. Approximately 15.9 million users had registered for Juno's service through March 31, 2001, of which
approximately 4.1 million had used Juno's service during the month of March. We believe that a number of our users have Internet access accounts with both NetZero and Juno in addition to
accounts with our competitors. If there is significant actual or perceived overlap between NetZero's registered users and Juno's registered users, advertisers may not be willing to advertise as 

much on each service, or may only be willing to advertise on one service or the other. In addition, to the extent our users are not using either Juno or NetZero as their primary Internet service
provider, advertisers may be less likely to advertise on our service. Also, some new users use the Internet only as a novelty and do not become consistent users of Internet services and, therefore,
may be less likely to continue using our services. 

We may not be able to grow or retain our user base if we are unsuccessful in maintaining and continuing to market our brands.  

    If we are unsuccessful in maintaining and continuing to market the NetZero and Juno brands, we may not be able to grow or retain our user base. We believe that
maintaining these brands is critical to retain and expand our user base. Promotion of our brands will depend on our success in providing high-quality Internet products and services.
However, such success will depend, in part, on the services, products and efforts of third parties, over which we have little or no control. For instance, if our third party telecommunications service
providers fail to provide quality service, our users' ability to access the Internet may be interrupted, which may adversely affect our brands. If our users and advertisers do not perceive our
existing products and services as high quality, or if we introduce new products or services or enter into new business ventures that are not favorably received by our users and advertisers, then we
may be unsuccessful in building brand recognition and brand loyalty in the marketplace. In addition,
we may also need to devote substantial resources to maintain brand loyalty among our users and to promote and maintain the NetZero brand and the Juno brand in a very competitive market. If we incur
excessive expenses in promoting and maintaining our brand, our financial results could be adversely affected. If, on the other hand, we choose not to incur significant expense to promote and maintain
our brand and our brand suffers as a consequence, our business and financial results could also be harmed. 

Our marketing resources may be insufficient to generate new subscribers or awareness of our services.  

    We expect that we will reduce our marketing expenditures in the future. Any marketing activities we do engage in may be insufficient to increase or maintain
the size of our subscriber base and may be insufficient to develop or maintain awareness of our services. Juno and NetZero have relied on a variety of cash intensive subscriber acquisition activities
in the past, including the distribution of CDs, the acquisition of competitors and fee-based referral agreements. These activities may be curtailed in the future, although there is no assurance that
subscriber acquisition costs will decrease. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and have undertaken significant advertising campaigns. We cannot predict the timing, the
type, or the extent of future advertising activities by our competitors. It is possible that marketing campaigns undertaken by our competitors will have an adverse effect on our ability to retain or
acquire subscribers. If we incur costs in implementing marketing campaigns without generating sufficient new subscribers to our services, or if capital limitations or other factors prevent us from
implementing marketing campaigns, or if marketing campaigns undertaken by competitors cause attrition in our subscriber base, our business and financial results may suffer. 

Our revenues would significantly decrease if we lose key marketing and advertising relationships.  

    We have strategic marketing alliances with a number of third parties, and most of our strategic marketing partners have the right to terminate their agreements
with us on short notice. The number of terminations of various types of advertising contracts by our partners increased over the course of 2000 and during the first quarter of calendar 2001. In light
of the concentration of our advertisers within the Internet industry, we expect that we will continue to experience a significant number of terminations during the remainder of 2001, which could cause
our business and financial results to suffer, especially if such terminations are coupled with a refusal to pay amounts owed to us at the time of termination. If any of our strategic marketing
agreements are terminated, we cannot assure you that 

we will be able to replace the terminated agreements with equally beneficial arrangements. We also expect that we will not be able to renew all of our current agreements when they expire and that, to
the extent we are able to renew some or all, that we may not be able to do so on favorable terms. We also do not know whether we will be successful in entering into additional strategic marketing
alliances, or that any additional relationships, if entered into, will be on terms favorable to us. 

    Our
advertising and commerce revenues may be dependent on a small number of advertisers or strategic partners and we may be susceptible to reductions in revenues from material
advertisers or strategic partners. A small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of each of NetZero's and Juno's advertising and commerce revenues, and each of NetZero and Juno
have previously experienced reductions in revenues from material customers. For example, 35% and 14% of NetZero's revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2000 and March 31, 2001,
respectively, were attributable to NetZero's start page agreement with LookSmart, which was terminated on January 19, 2001. LookSmart provided search functionality on the NetZero start
page and on the ZeroPort, and was provided with the right to advertise third party services on the NetZero start page. After the termination of the LookSmart agreement, NetZero experienced a
significant decline in revenues derived from search functionality on the NetZero start page and we do not anticipate generating the amount of revenue from the NetZero start page in the
future that NetZero historically experienced. In addition, NetZero derived approximately 20% and 11% of its revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 from agreements NetZero has with
General Motors and Cisco, respectively. While the relationship with General Motors Corporation is long-term, they were recently provided reductions in their advertising obligations. While we do not
currently anticipate such reductions will be material to our business, we can give no assurance that we will continue to derive the amount of anticipated revenues from General Motors. In addition,
NetZero's agreement with Cisco is terminable by Cisco commencing June 30, 2001 and we can give no assurance that we will continue to generate significant revenues from Cisco beyond such date.
Furthermore, approximately 16% of Juno's advertising and commerce revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 were attributable to Juno's agreement with LookSmart. Juno and LookSmart are
currently renegotiating their agreement and we can give no assurance that we will continue to generate significant revenues from LookSmart. The termination or renegotiations of significant agreements,
as well as the timing of orders under such agreements, may cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly results. Our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and
adversely affected if we are unable either to maintain or renew our significant agreements or to replace such agreements with similar agreements with new customers. 

    We
also derive a large portion of our advertising revenue from strategic marketing and advertising relationships with other Internet companies. At the current time, we believe that
some of these companies may be having difficulty generating operating cash flow or raising capital, or are anticipating such difficulties, and are electing to scale back the resources they devote to
advertising, including on our services. Other companies in the Internet industry have depleted their available capital, and have ceased operations or filed for bankruptcy protection or may be expected
to do so. Difficulties such as these have affected and may continue to affect the total amount of advertising inventory we sell, as well as our ability to collect revenues or advances against revenues
from our existing partners or advertisers as such amounts become due. An increasing number of our strategic marketing partners and advertisers, including some with agreements providing for minimum
guaranteed payments, have either already defaulted on periodic payments due to us, or informed us that they will not meet their obligations. If the current environment for Internet advertising does
not improve, our business and financial results may suffer. 

Our business and reputation are dependent on telecommunications carriers and changes to their prices and service may negatively impact our business.  

    Our business substantially depends on the capacity, affordability, reliability and security of our telecommunications networks. Only a small number of
telecommunications providers offer the network services we require. There has been significant consolidation in the telecommunications industry, and there is a significant risk that further
consolidation could make us reliant on an even smaller number of providers. In addition, several vendors have experienced significant financial difficulties and there is no assurance that such vendors
will continue to perform consistent with our expectations or contractual rights. Certain of our telecommunications services are provided pursuant to short-term agreements that the
providers can terminate or elect not to renew. In particular, Juno's agreement with WorldCom, which provides Juno with a significant portion of its telecommunications capacity, expired on
May 30, 2001, although under the agreement Worldcom will continue to provide services through September 30, 2001. While a new agreement is currently being negotiated, there can be no
assurance that a new agreement will be finalized on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, each of our telecommunications carriers provides network access to some of our competitors, and could
choose to grant those competitors preferential network access, potentially limiting our members' ability to access the Internet or connect to our central computers. Furthermore, the majority of our
telecommunications providers compete, or have announced an intention to compete, with us in the market to provide consumer Internet access. As a result, any or all of our current telecommunications
service providers could decide not to provide us with service at rates acceptable to us, or at all, in which event, we may not be able to provide Internet access to our users. 

    Our
margins are highly sensitive to variations in prices for the telecommunications services we purchase. Our business could be harmed if minimum connection charges increase or become
more prevalent. In addition, the availability and pricing of telecommunications services varies geographically, and we may not be able to obtain new or substitute telecommunications services in
certain geographic areas on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Legislation has been proposed from time to time that would increase the cost of doing business of many of our telecommunications
providers. Any increase in their costs could result in increased prices to us. There can be no assurance that our telecommunications providers will continue to provide their services on commercially
acceptable price terms, or that alternative services will be available on similar terms. 

    If
our third-party telecommunications service providers deliver unacceptable service, the quality of our Internet access service would suffer. In this event, we would likely lose
users who are dissatisfied with our service. Since we do not have direct control over our telecommunications carriers' network reliability and the quality of their service, there can be no assurance
that we will be able to provide consistently reliable Internet access for our users. 

    A
minority of our subscriber base may be unable to access our services through a point of presence that is within their local calling area. These users may be particularly reluctant
to use our service to access the Web, either through our free service or through a billable service, due to the telecommunications charges that they would incur during an extended connection. The
inability of some of our subscribers to access our service with a local call in some areas of the country could harm our business. We cannot be sure if or when additional infrastructure developments
by our telecommunications providers will establish points of presence that cover these areas. 

    In
addition, we may from time to time experience increases in our telecommunications usage, which exceed our then-available telecommunications capacity and the capacity of
our internal servers. As a result, users may be unable to register or log on to our service, may experience a general slow-down in their Internet access or may be disconnected from their
sessions. Excessive user demand could also result in system failures of our internal server networks, which would prevent us from generating advertising revenues. Inaccessibility, interruptions or
other limitations on the ability to access 

our service due to excessive user demand, or any failure of our servers to handle user traffic, would have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our revenues. 

If we fail to manage our telecommunications capacity, our service levels may suffer or we may experience increased per-user costs.  

    We will have to accurately anticipate our future telecommunications capacity needs within lead-time requirements. If we fail to procure sufficient
quantities of telecommunications products and services, we may be unable to provide our current and future users with acceptable service levels. We also run the risk of purchasing excessive amounts of
telecommunications products and services based on incorrect projections regarding usage. In that event, we would be required to bear the costs of excess telecommunications capacity without
commensurate increases in revenues or subscriber usage. NetZero and Juno have recently experienced decreases in telecommunications usage in excess of the amounts anticipated when entering into certain
agreements for telecommunications services. This has resulted in significant excess capacity in the near term, which may result in increased costs per user on an hourly basis if we are not able to
implement the synergies contemplated by the mergers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage these and other aspects of our business. Our failure to do so would likely
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flow. 

We may not successfully develop and market new products in a timely or cost-effective manner; our new products may not be accepted by consumers or advertisers.  

    We may not be able to compete effectively if we are not able to adapt to changes in technology and industry standards, and to develop and introduce new and
enhanced products and service offerings. We believe that our ability to compete successfully will also depend upon the continued compatibility of our services with products offered by various vendors.
Although we intend to support emerging standards in the market for Internet access, we may not be able to conform our technology and equipment to support these new standards in a timely fashion. For
instance, Sun Microsystems continues to upgrade its JAVA language and implementing new versions of JAVA may require additional memory and resources to implement. NetZero's software uses the JAVA
language extensively and we will have to modify our resources accordingly to accommodate new versions. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to make such modifications, or any other modifications which may be required to adapt to new or changing standards, in a cost-effective and timely manner, or
at all. 

    If
we are unable to respond in a timely manner to technological advances, we may not be able to compete effectively for users, which could cause our revenues to decrease. We have
expended, and may in the future expend, significant resources developing and implementing new products. Product development involves a number of uncertainties, including unanticipated delays and
expenses. New products may have technological problems or may not be accepted by our users or advertisers. There is no assurance that new products will be introduced in a timely or
cost-effective manner or result in user satisfaction or increased revenues. Several of the new products we have offered, or intend to offer, such as NetZero Platinum, Surf Safari and
NetZero's new start page are intended to generate additional revenues for us. There is no assurance that such products will provide us with any meaningful revenue. Furthermore, in
February 2001, Juno announced the Juno Virtual Supercomputer Project, designed to make unused processing power existing on the computers of Juno's subscribers available to third parties as an
alternative to conventional supercomputing resources. As designed, the project would involve dividing computationally intensive problems into a large number of smaller computational tasks, and
distributing those smaller tasks to the computers of Juno subscribers for such computers to process while the computers were not otherwise being used by the subscribers. We do not intend to continue
this project following the consummation of the mergers. 

We may not be able to develop new product or service offerings if we are unable to obtain needed technology.  

    We rely upon third parties to help us develop technologies that enhance our current product and service offerings. If our relationships with these third
parties are impaired or terminated, then we would have to find other developers on a timely basis or develop technology completely on our own. We cannot predict whether we will be able to obtain the
third-party technology necessary for continued development and introduction of new and enhanced products and services. 

Consumers may decide not to use our service if our technology and services become obsolete.  

    Others may develop services or technologies that render our services or technology noncompetitive or obsolete. For instance, a number of companies are offering
broadband and other high speed Internet access services, which allow users to access the Internet at much faster speeds than the access services we currently provide. Our ability to remain
technologically competitive may require substantial expenditures and lead-time. 

We may not be able to compete effectively if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights.  

    If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights, we may not be able to compete effectively. We principally rely upon patent, copyright, trade secret and
contract laws to protect our proprietary technology. We cannot be certain that we have taken adequate steps to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently
develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies. In addition, since we provide our Internet access software for free, we are extremely susceptible to various
forms of unauthorized use of our software. These actions could adversely affect our brand names. 

    In
addition, we have recently filed lawsuits alleging that they are violating our proprietary rights. There is no assurance that we will prevail in any of these claims. Our attempts
to enforce our proprietary rights could result in significant costs without a corresponding economic or competitive benefit. 

We may incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources if we are accused of infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.  

    Third parties may assert claims against us for infringement of their proprietary rights and these claims may be successful. In addition, a number of
third-party owners of patents have claimed to hold patents that cover various forms of online transactions or online technology. As with other online service providers, patent claims could be asserted
against us based upon our services or technologies. 

    We
could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in the defense of any claims relating to proprietary rights. Parties making these claims could secure a judgment
awarding substantial damages as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to use our products in the United States or abroad. If a third party asserts a
claim relating to proprietary technology or information against us, we may seek licenses to the intellectual property from the third party. We cannot be certain, however, that third parties will
extend licenses to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we fail to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights, it could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate our
business. 

A security breach, virus or inappropriate use by Internet users could disrupt our service.  

    The future success of our business will depend on the security of our network and, in part, on the security of the network infrastructures of our third-party
telecommunications service providers, over which we have no control. Computer viruses or problems caused by our users or other third parties, 

such as the sending of excessive volumes of unsolicited bulk e-mail or spam, could lead to interruptions, delays, or cessation in service to our users. In addition, the sending of "spam"
through our network could result in third parties asserting claims against us. There can be no assurance that we would prevail in such claims and our failure to do so could result in large judgments
against us. Users or other third parties could also potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems or our users' computer systems by their inappropriate
use of the Internet, including breaking into our computer network, which could cause losses to us, or our users. Users or third parties may also potentially expose us to liability by "identity theft."
Unauthorized access by current and former employees or others could also potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems and those of our users. We
expect that our users will increasingly use the Internet for commercial transactions in the future. Any network malfunction or security breach could cause these transactions to be delayed, not
completed at all, or completed with compromised security. Users or others may assert claims of liability against us as a result of any failure by us to prevent these network malfunctions and security
breaches, and may deter others from using our services, which could cause our business prospects to suffer. Although we intend to use industry-standard security measures, such measures have been
circumvented in the past, and we cannot assure you that these measures will not be circumvented in the future. We also cannot assure you that the security measures of our third-party network providers
will be adequate. In addition, to alleviate problems caused by computer viruses or other inappropriate uses or security breaches, we may have to interrupt, delay, or temporarily cease service to our
users, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and could also result in increased user turnover. 

Our revenues could be adversely affected if programs to disable our banner advertising or our other banner technology become prevalent.  

    Various software programs have been developed that specifically target our banner advertising to disable our ability to deliver advertisements to a user. For
example, there are programs which attempt to blank out, or block, banner advertisements or completely delete the banner window from users' computer screens. To date, such programs have not interrupted
either company's operations or caused them to fail to meet the terms of our advertising agreements; but there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future. Widespread adoption of this
type of software would seriously damage our ability to operate our business and generate revenues. 

If our software or hardware contains errors, or if we encounter difficulties integrating our systems and technologies, our business could be seriously harmed.  

    The software and hardware used to operate and provide our services is complex and, accordingly, may contain undetected errors or failures. We have in the past
encountered, and may in the future encounter, errors in the software or hardware used to operate and provide our services. This has resulted in, and may in the future result in, a number of adverse
consequences, which have included or may include: 


users
being disconnected from our service or being unable to access our service;


loss
of data or revenue;


injury
to reputation; and


diversion
of development resources. 

    We
have experienced some technical and customer support issues associated with our products and software releases. These issues have resulted in users discontinuing our service and
have adversely impacted our revenues. In addition, certain of NetZero's new services require us to bill the user, and NetZero has limited experience in implementing billing services. A number of
NetZero's and Juno's 

material technologies and systems, including their software client systems, billing systems, ad-serving technologies and customer relationship management systems, are based on different platforms or
are sourced from different vendors. To the extent we attempt to integrate these technologies and systems, we may experience a number of difficulties, errors, failures and unanticipated costs. We
cannot assure you that we will not experience significant problems in the future. 

We are dependent on third parties for technical and customer service support and our business may suffer if they are unable to provide these services, cannot expand to meet our
needs, or terminate their relationships with us.  

    Our business and financial results depend, in part, on the availability and quality of live technical and customer service support services. Although many
Internet service providers have developed internal customer service operations designed to meet these needs, we have elected to outsource most of these functions. For Juno services, we currently
purchase almost all of our technical and live customer service support from ClientLogic Corporation. For NetZero services, we currently purchase almost all of our technical and live customer service
support from Convergys Corporation. As a result, we maintain only a small number of internal customer service personnel. We are not equipped to provide the necessary range of customer service
functions in the event that these companies become unable or unwilling to offer these services to us. 

    We
believe the availability of call-in technical support and customer service will be especially important to acquire and retain subscribers to our pay services. NetZero
and Juno have been dependent on Convergys and ClientLogic to provide these functions. At times, Juno's subscribers have experienced lengthy waiting periods to reach representatives trained to provide
the technical or customer support they require. We believe that failure to provide consistent customer support and to maintain consumer-acceptable hold times could have an adverse effect on our
subscriber acquisition and retention efforts in the future. However, maintaining desired customer support levels may require significantly more support personnel than are currently available to us, or
significantly greater expense than we feel it is appropriate, or than we are able, to incur. Additionally, if we elect to offer customer service features that we do not currently support, or to
enhance the overall quality of our customer support for competitive reasons, we may require even greater resources. If our relationship with ClientLogic or Convergys terminates and we are unable to
enter into a comparable arrangement with a replacement vendor, if our current vendors are unable to provide enough personnel to provide the quality and quantity of service we desire, if system
failures, outages or other technical problems make it difficult for our subscribers to reach customer service representatives, or if we are unable to obtain externally or develop internally the
additional customer service and technical support capacity we expect to need, our business and financial results may suffer. 

We will not be able to support increased numbers of users if we are unable to enhance our internal network infrastructure.  

    Our internal network infrastructure is composed of a complex system of application, database, advertisement and e-mail servers. Service
interruptions originating within our internal network have occurred in the past and may occur in the future, especially when usage exceeds capacity. We will need to invest substantial financial,
operational and management resources to enhance our systems, particularly our database servers and storage capabilities, to handle a large number of users. We cannot be certain that we will be able to
accomplish this on a timely basis and at a commercially reasonable cost, or at all. If we fail to do so, we will be unable to grow, and may be unable to effectively operate, our business. 

We may experience loss of data, disruption of operations, or erroneous overcharges or undercharges to advertising customers if the Oracle software we use to run our operations
fails to operate correctly.  

    Virtually every aspect of NetZero's operations, including finance, billing of vendors, accounting, storage and retrieval of user data, and advertisement
tracking, uses or interfaces with a centralized software system provided by Oracle. We have only limited experience with the operation of this system. Difficulty with the operation of, or errors,
defects or malfunctions in the operation of, this system could result in loss of data, erroneous overcharges or undercharges to advertising customers or disruption of operations. 

We are dependent on third party software to accurately bill subscribers to our various pay services.  

    The operation of our pay services requires the accurate operation of billing system software as well as our development of policies designed to reduce the
incidence of credit card fraud and other forms of uncollectible "chargebacks." If we encounter difficulty with the operation of these systems, or if errors, defects or malfunctions occur in the
operation of these systems, this could result in erroneous overcharges to customers or in the under-collection of revenue, either of which could hurt our business and financial results. 

We cannot predict our future capital needs and we may not be able to secure additional financing.  

    Because we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future, we may need to raise substantial additional funds in the future to fund
our operations, including our telecommunications and other service provision costs, subscriber acquisition costs, costs of enhancing or expanding the range of Internet services we offer and costs
associated with responding to competitive pressures or perceived opportunities. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or
not available when required in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, we may not be able to devote sufficient cash resources to continue to provide our services in their current form, acquire
additional subscribers, enhance or expand our services, respond to competitive pressures or take advantage of perceived opportunities, and our business and financial results may suffer, or we could be
forced to cease our operations entirely. In light of our historical and expected losses, we are unlikely to be able to raise significant additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness. If
additional funds are raised by our issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on our operations. 

If we are unable to successfully defend against pending legal actions against us, we could face substantial liabilities.  

    We are currently a party to pending legal actions against us which are discussed in detail under "NetZero's BusinessLegal Proceedings" and "Juno's
BusinessLegal Proceedings," the outcomes of which are uncertain and could result in significant judgments against us. Defending against these lawsuits may involve significant expense and
diversion of management's attention and resources from other matters. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we may not prevail in these actions. In addition, our ongoing operations may
continue to subject us to significant litigation and costs in the future. 

Our business could be shut down or severely impacted if a natural disaster occurs.  

    Our operations and services depend on the extent to which our computer equipment and the telecommunications infrastructure of our third-party network providers
are protected against damage from fire, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events. A significant portion of our computer equipment, including critical equipment
dedicated to our Internet access services, is located at our headquarters in Westlake Village and at facilities in Los Angeles and 

San Jose, California; Sterling, Virginia; Cambridge, Massachusetts; and Jersey City, New Jersey. Despite precautions taken by us and our third-party network providers, over which we have no
control, a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our headquarters or at a network hub, or within a third-party network provider's network, could cause interruptions in the services that
we provide. For example, if an earthquake damages equipment at our network operations center, we may have no means of replacing this equipment on a timely basis or at all and our service would be shut
down. We do not currently maintain fully redundant or back-up Internet services, backbone facilities or other fully redundant computing and telecommunications facilities. Furthermore, we
do not currently have any business disruption insurance. Any prolonged disruption of our services due to system failure could result in user turnover and decreased revenues. 

Our ability to operate our business could be seriously harmed if we lose members of our senior management team and other key employees.  

    Our business is largely dependent on the personal efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key personnel. Any of our officers or employees can
terminate his or her employment relationship at any time. The loss of these key employees or our inability to attract or retain other qualified employees could seriously harm our business and
prospects. We do not carry key man life insurance on any of our employees. 

We will not be able to grow our business if we are not able to retain or hire additional personnel.  

    Our future success also depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, editorial, merchandising, sales, marketing
and user service personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, particularly in the Internet and high technology industry. As a result, we may be unable to successfully attract, assimilate or
retain qualified personnel. In addition, the mergers may cause many employees to leave the company, many of whom may be integral to our integration efforts. If we cannot retain those employees who are
key to the integration of the businesses of NetZero and Juno, our operations and integration efforts could be adversely affected. 

    Any
staff attrition we experience, whether initiated by the departing employees or by us, could place a significant strain on our managerial, operational, financial and other
resources. To the extent that we do not initiate or seek any staff attrition that occurs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and hire adequate replacement staff promptly, or at
all. In January and April 2001, in addition to conducting some performance-related terminations, Juno eliminated a number of positions in response to a change in business needs, such as
the significant reduction in Juno's marketing activities. In light of the significant parallels of the businesses of NetZero and Juno, we plan to evaluate headcount redundancies and expect to make
staff reductions following such evaluation. If the size of our staff is significantly reduced, either by our choice or otherwise, we could face significant management, operational, financial and other
constraints. For example, it may become more difficult for us to integrate the businesses of NetZero and Juno, manage existing, or establish new, relationships with advertisers, vendors and other
parties, or to expand and improve our service offerings. It may become more difficult for us to implement changes to our business plan or to respond promptly to opportunities in the marketplace. It
may become more difficult for us to devote personnel resources necessary to maintain or improve existing systems, including our financial and managerial controls, billing systems, reporting systems
and procedures. Thus, our business and financial results could suffer as a result of the staff reductions undertaken to date in 2001, those expected to be undertaken in connection with the mergers,
and from any future staff reductions and attrition that might occur. 

Risks Related to the Internet Industry    

We could be exposed to significant legal liability if new case law is decided, or new government regulation is enacted, regarding the Internet and Internet service providers.  

    The law relating to our business and operations is evolving and in a state of flux. The modification, repeal or adoption of laws or regulations may decrease
the growth in the use of the Internet, affect telecommunications costs or increase the likelihood or scope of competition from regional telephone companies. These results could decrease the demand for
our services or increase our cost of doing business, each of which would cause our operating margins and revenues to fall. In particular, the following risks could occur: 


increased
telecommunication costs;


slowed
growth of the Internet industry;


restrictions
on our ability to collect and use personal data from our subscribers;


prohibition
and restriction of Internet content and availability;


liability
for defamation or negligence based on content retrieved or transmitted through our services;


liability
for errors on third-party content accessed through our services;


additional
claims for copyright/trademark infringement;


inability
to protect our own intellectual property;


increased
cost or inability to obtain adequate insurance; and


increased
litigation costs. 

    All
of these could increase our costs directly or impede the growth of the Internet in general or Internet usage of our subscribers, thus limiting our ability to generate revenue to
support our operations. 

Changes in government regulation could decrease our revenues and increase our costs.  

    Changes in the regulatory environment could decrease our revenues and increase our costs. As a provider of Internet access services, we are not currently
subject to direct regulation by the Federal Communications Commission. However, some telecommunications carriers have sought to have communications over the Internet regulated by the FCC in the same
manner as other more traditional telecommunications services. Local telephone carriers have also petitioned the FCC to regulate Internet service providers in a manner similar to long distance
telephone carriers and to impose access fees on these providers and some developments suggest that they may be successful in obtaining the treatment they seek. In addition, we operate our services
throughout the United States, and regulatory authorities at the state level may seek to regulate aspects of our activities as telecommunications services. As a
result, we could become subject to FCC and state regulation as Internet services and telecommunications services converge. 

    We
remain subject to numerous additional laws and regulations that could affect our business. Because of the Internet's popularity and increasing use, new laws and regulations with
respect to the Internet are becoming more prevalent. These laws and regulations have covered, or may cover in the future, issues such as: 


user
privacy;


children's
privacy;


pricing
and disclosure of pricing terms;


intellectual
property;


federal,
state and local taxation;


advertising;


distribution;
and


characteristics
and quality of products and services. 

    Legislation
in these areas could slow the growth in use of the Internet generally and decrease the acceptance of the Internet as a communications and commercial medium. 

    It
may take years to determine how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation apply to the Internet. Any new legislation or regulation
regarding the Internet, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet, could harm us. Additionally, we have a
number of subscribers who are located in Canada. Laws and regulations relating to the Internet, or to doing business in Canada, or similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions should we choose
to continue to expand elsewhere outside of the United States, could have an adverse effect on our business. 

    The
growth of the Internet, coupled with publicity regarding Internet fraud, may also lead to the enactment of more stringent consumer protection laws. For example, numerous bills
have been presented to Congress and various state legislatures designed to address the prevalence of unsolicited commercial bulk e-mail on the Internet. These laws may impose additional
burdens on our business. Additionally, because we rely on the collection and use of personal data from our subscribers for targeting advertising and other communications to our subscribers, we may be
harmed by any laws or regulations that restrict our ability to collect or use this data. The FTC has conducted investigations into the privacy practices of companies that collect information about
individuals on the Internet and has also investigated a variety of Internet service providers, including Juno, in connection with marketing and disclosure practices. Various state agencies as well as
individuals have also asserted claims against, or instituted inquiries into, Internet service providers, including Juno, in connection with marketing and disclosure practices. The enactment of any
additional laws or regulations in this area, increased enforcement activity of existing laws and regulations, or claims by individuals could significantly impact our costs or the manner in which we
conduct business, all of which could cause our business to suffer. 

Regulation of content and access could limit our ability to generate revenues and expose us to liability.  

    Prohibition and restriction of Internet content and access could reduce or dampen the growth of Internet use, decrease the acceptance of the Internet as a
communications and commercial medium and expose us to liability. A variety of restrictions on content and access, primarily as they relate to children, have been enacted or proposed, including laws
which would require Internet service providers to supply, at cost, filtering technologies to limit or block the ability of minors to access unsuitable materials on the Internet. Because of these
content restrictions and potential liability to us for materials carried on or disseminated through our systems, we may be required to implement measures 

to reduce our exposure to liability. These measures may require the expenditure of substantial resources or the discontinuation of our product or service offerings that subject us to this liability.
Further, we could incur substantial costs in defending against any of these claims and we may be required to pay large judgments or settlements or alter our business practices. In addition, our
liability insurance may not cover potential claims relating to the Internet services we provide or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liabilities that may be imposed on us. 

We could be exposed to liability associated with changes in our services or the services of third parties.  

    Our service involves the provision of Internet access services as well as a variety of other products and services. We and our sponsors have, from time to
time, implemented, and may in the future implement, changes to such services. This may involve the termination of services or changes to terms and conditions of services. There can be no assurance
that users, advertisers, sponsors or other third parties, including governmental agencies, will not assert claims against us for implementing such changes, or that any such claims would be resolved in
our favor. 

We could be exposed to liability for defamation, negligence and infringement.  

    Because users download and redistribute materials that are cached or replicated by us in connection with our Internet services, claims could be made against us
for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of such materials. While we have attempted to obtain safe harbor protection against
claims of copyright infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, there can be no guarantee that we will prevail in any such claims. We also could be exposed to liability because of
third-party content that may be accessible through our services, including links to Web sites maintained by our users or other third parties, or posted directly to our Web site and subsequently
retrieved by a third party through our services. It is also possible that if any third-party content provided through our services contains errors, third parties who access such material could make
claims against us for losses incurred in reliance on such information. These types of claims have been brought successfully against other online service providers. Furthermore, copyright and trademark
laws are evolving and it is uncertain how broadly the rights provided under these laws will be applied to online environments. It is impossible for us to determine who the potential rights holders may
be with respect to all materials available through our services. 

Our ability to sell targeted advertising may be limited if new laws relating to user privacy are enacted.  

    Our ability to sell targeted advertising partly depends on our ability to use personal information collected from our users. We cannot assure you that our
current information collection procedures and disclosure policies will be found to be in compliance with existing or future laws or regulations. Our failure to comply with existing laws, or the
adoption of new laws or regulations that require us to change the way we conduct our business, could make it cost-prohibitive to operate our business, and prevent us from pursuing our
business strategies including the sale of targeted advertising. 

Our operating margins and costs would be adversely affected if our business becomes subject to taxation.  

    The tax treatment of activities on or relating to the Internet is currently unsettled. A number of proposals have been made at the federal, state and local
levels and by foreign governments that could impose taxes on the online sale of goods and services and other Internet activities. The Internet Tax Freedom Act was signed into law in 1998, placing a
three-year moratorium on new state and local taxes on Internet commerce. However, there is no assurance that this moratorium will be continued and there can be no assurance that future
laws imposing taxes or other regulations on commerce over the 

Internet would not substantially impair the growth of Internet commerce and, as a result, negatively impact our operating margins or make it cost-prohibitive to operate our business. 

Seasonal trends in Internet usage and advertising sales may negatively affect our business.  

    Seasonal trends could affect the advertising revenues we generate from operating our Internet services. To the extent that our advertising revenues depend on
the amount of usage by our users, seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage could affect our advertising revenues during these periods of fluctuation. In addition, the rate at which new users sign up
for our services may be lower during certain seasons and holiday periods. Because our operating history is so limited, it is difficult for us to accurately predict these trends and plan accordingly.
Since our operating expenses are based on our expectations of future revenues, it is possible that seasonal fluctuations could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our operating results. 

If Internet usage does not continue to grow, we may not be able to grow our business and increase our revenues.  

    If Internet usage does not continue to grow, we may not be able to grow our business and increase our revenues. Substantially all of our revenues are dependent
on the continued use and expansion of the Internet. Use of the Internet has grown dramatically, but we cannot assure you that usage of the Internet will continue to expand. A decrease in the demand
for Internet services or a reduction in the currently anticipated growth for such services could cause our user base and our advertising revenues to decrease. 

Our brand and business could be adversely affected if we are not able to protect our domain names or acquire other relevant domain names.  

    Governmental agencies and their designees generally regulate the acquisition and maintenance of domain names. The regulation of domain names in the United
States and in foreign countries is subject to change in the near future. As a result, we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names in the countries in which we conduct, or plan to
conduct, business. We do not own the domain name www.unitedonline.com. Furthermore, the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary
rights is unclear. Therefore, we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, dilute or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and
other proprietary rights. 

Risks Related to the Market for Our Common Stock    

NetZero's and Juno's stock prices have been highly volatile; our stock price may be highly volatile and may cause limitations on the trading market for our stock.  

    The market price of NetZero's and Juno's common stock has fluctuated in the past and the market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be highly
volatile, with extreme price and volume fluctuations. The Nasdaq National Market, where most publicly held Internet companies are traded, has experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations.
These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance, and for this or other reasons we could continue to suffer
significant declines in the market price of our common stock. 

    In
the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the objects of securities class action litigation. NetZero is currently involved
in a securities class action lawsuit, which is discussed in detail under "NetZero's BusinessLegal Proceedings." While we believe that the current securities class action lawsuit is
without merit, this suit, along with any additional 

securities class action litigation to which we might become subject, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources. 

    We
have applied to have our common stock listed on the Nasdaq National Market. We must satisfy a number of requirements to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq National Market,
including maintaining a minimum bid price for our common stock of $1.00 per share. A company fails to satisfy this requirement if its closing bid price remains below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive
business days. From time to time NetZero's and Juno's common stock has had a closing bid price below $1.00 per share. There can be no assurance that our bid price will comply with the requirements of
the Nasdaq National Market to facilitate continued listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq National Market. If our common stock loses its Nasdaq National Market status, it would most likely trade on
the Nasdaq Over the Counter Bulletin Board, which is viewed by most investors as a less desirable and less liquid marketplace. This outcome would be likely to harm the trading price of our common
stock. 

    In
addition, declines in our stock price might harm our ability to issue, or significantly increase the ownership dilution to stockholders caused by our issuing, equity securities in
financing or other transactions. The price at which we issue shares in such transactions is generally based on the market price of our common stock, and a decline in our stock price would result in
our needing to issue a greater number of shares to raise a given amount of funding or acquire a given dollar value of goods or services. 

    Moreover,
anticipated or actual declines in our stock price may prompt individuals to engage in short sales of our common stock, which may itself cause the price of our stock to
decline. 

Future sales of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.  

    In addition to potential future issuances of our common stock, upon completion of the mergers there will be a large number of shares of our common stock
outstanding and available for resale. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market, or the perception that such
sales could occur. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a price that we think is appropriate, or at all. 

We may issue common stock to pay for services in transactions that cause dilution to our stockholders, and the dilutive effect of these issuances would increase to the extent
that our stock price declines.  

    Juno has entered into a number of relationships in which it may use its common stock to compensate third parties for services performed for Juno, including
subscriber referral services, and we may enter into additional such relationships in the future. In most of these transactions, the payments owed by Juno will be calculated in dollar terms, with Juno
having the right to issue an equivalent amount of its common stock in lieu of making cash payments. We currently anticipate that we will generally exercise those rights to make payments in our common
stock where available to us, although we may choose to pay for some or all of such expenses in cash. If the price of our common stock should decline, our electing to pay with common stock would entail
issuing a relatively larger number of shares, increasing the dilutive effect on our stockholders, and potentially impairing our ability to execute financing
transactions. Additionally, the third parties to whom we issue common stock will generally have registration rights that require us to register these shares of common stock for resale in the public
markets. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of these shares in the market, or the perception that such sales could occur. Furthermore, Juno has entered into
several transactions pursuant to which it has the right to pay for goods or services using common stock rather than cash, and we may enter into more such transactions in the future. If we raise
additional funds, acquire assets, or obtain goods or services through the issuance of equity securities, stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interest and the newly
issued securities may have 

rights superior to those of our common stock. The dilutive effect of these issuances will be increased to the extent our share price declines. 

Our directors will have the ability to exercise significant influence over us.  

    Upon completion of the mergers, our executive officers, directors, and persons and entities affiliated with our executive officers or directors, are expected
to beneficially own in the aggregate approximately      % of our outstanding common stock. As a result of this concentration of ownership, our executive officers and directors will be
able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration
of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us. 

We have anti-takeover provisions which may make it difficult for a third-party to acquire us.  

    Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so
might be beneficial to our stockholders. 

We do not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future and, as a result, you will need to sell your shares in order to realize a near term return on your investment.  

    Neither NetZero nor Juno declared or paid any cash dividends on its capital stock since inception. We intend to retain any future earnings to finance the
operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders will need to sell shares of common stock in order to
realize a return on their investment, if any.

Stockholder Record Date for the Special Meetings  

    NetZero.
  NetZero's board of directors has fixed the close of business on      , 2001 as the record date for
determining which NetZero stockholders are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. On the record date, there were            shares of NetZero common stock outstanding,
held

determining which Juno stockholders are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Juno special meeting. On the record date, there were            shares of Juno common stock outstanding, held
by approximately            holders of record. 

Vote Required for Adoption of the Merger Agreement  

    NetZero.
  A majority of the outstanding shares of NetZero common stock must be represented, either in person or by
proxy, to constitute a quorum at the NetZero special meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of NetZero's common stock outstanding as of the record date is required to
adopt the merger agreement. At the NetZero special meeting, each share of NetZero common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters properly submitted to the NetZero stockholders. 

    Juno
has entered into voting agreements with three executive officers of NetZero and five major stockholders of NetZero which require these NetZero stockholders to vote their shares
of NetZero common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. As of the record date, these stockholders owned shares representing approximately  % of the voting power of
NetZero capital stock entitled to vote at the NetZero special meeting. 

    The
directors and executive officers of NetZero owned approximately  % of the outstanding shares of NetZero common stock as of the record date, and each of them has
indicated their intention to vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement or has entered into a voting agreement with Juno as described above. 

    Juno.
  A majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the Juno special meeting must be represented, either in person or
by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the Juno special meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Juno's common stock outstanding as of the record date is required to
adopt the merger agreement. At the Juno special meeting, each share of Juno common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters properly submitted to the Juno stockholders. 

    NetZero
has entered into voting agreements with five directors and senior officers of Juno, and several entities affiliated with Dr. Shaw, which require these Juno stockholders
to vote their shares of Juno common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. As of the record date, these stockholders owned shares representing approximately  % of the
voting power of Juno capital stock entitled to vote at the Juno special meeting. 

    The
directors and executive officers of Juno owned approximately  % of the outstanding shares of Juno common stock as of the record date, and each of them has
indicated their intention to vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement or has entered into a voting agreement with NetZero as described above. 

Proxies  

    All shares of NetZero common stock represented by properly executed proxy cards or voting instructions received before or at the NetZero special meeting and
all shares of Juno common stock represented by properly executed proxy cards or voting instructions received before or at the Juno special meeting will, unless the proxies or voting instructions are
revoked, be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxy cards or voting instructions. If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy card or voting instruction,
the shares will be voted FOR the adoption of the merger agreement. You are urged to mark the box on the proxy card to indicate how to vote your shares. 

    If
a properly executed proxy card or voting instruction is returned and the stockholder has abstained from voting on adoption of the merger agreement, the NetZero common stock or Juno
common stock represented by the proxy or voting instruction will be considered present at the special meeting for
purposes of determining a quorum, but will not be considered to have been voted on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. 

    If
your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must instruct them on how to vote your shares. If an executed proxy card is returned by a broker or bank holding
shares which indicates that the broker or bank does not have discretionary authority to vote on adoption of the merger agreement, the shares will be considered present at the meeting for purposes of
determining the presence of a quorum, but will not be considered to have been voted on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Your broker or bank will vote your shares only if you provide
instructions on how to vote by following the information provided to you by your broker. 

    Adoption
of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of NetZero's and Juno's common stock outstanding on the record date, as applicable.
Abstentions, failures to vote and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against adoption of the merger agreement. 

    The
special meeting of NetZero or Juno may be adjourned or postponed, including by their respective chairmen, in order to permit further solicitation of proxies. Unless you check the
withhold discretionary authority box on your proxy card or voting instruction, your proxies will have the power to vote to postpone or adjourn your special meeting even if you voted against the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. 

    You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted by: 


notifying
in writing


the
Secretary of NetZero, Inc. at 2555 Townsgate Road, Westlake Village, California 91361 if you are a NetZero stockholder, or


the
Secretary of Juno Online Services, Inc. at 120 West 45th Street, 32nd Floor, New York, New York 10036 if you are a Juno stockholder; 


granting
a subsequently dated proxy; or


appearing
in person and voting at the special meeting if you are a holder of record. 

    Your
attendance at the special meeting will not in and of itself revoke your proxy. 

Appraisal Rights  

    Under Delaware law, so long as the NetZero common stock and the Juno common stock remain listed on the Nasdaq National Market as of their respective record
dates, you are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the mergers. However, if the NetZero common stock does not remain listed on the Nasdaq National Market, then holders of NetZero
common stock will be entitled to appraisal rights under Delaware law. 

    If
you are a holder of NetZero common stock and (a) NetZero's common stock is delisted, (b) you submit a written demand for appraisal of your shares and (c) you
comply with the applicable statutory procedures under Delaware law, you will be entitled to appraisal rights and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of your shares as determined by the
Delaware Chancery Court. A summary of the applicable requirements of Delaware law is contained in this document under the caption "The MergersAppraisal Rights." In addition, the text of
the applicable provisions of Delaware law is attached as Annex D. The exercise of appraisal rights is a complicated legal act and you should not rely solely on the disclosure in this document
to inform you how to perfect your rights. 

Solicitation of Proxies  

    NetZero and Juno will equally share the expenses incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of this document. Juno has retained MacKenzie Partners,
at an estimated cost of $5,000 plus reimbursement of expenses, to assist in the solicitation of proxies. NetZero, Juno and Juno's proxy solicitor will also request banks, brokers and other
intermediaries holding shares of NetZero or Juno common stock beneficially owned by others to send this document to, and obtain proxies from, the beneficial owners and will, upon request, reimburse
the holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, telegram and other electronic means, advertisements and personal solicitation
by the directors, officers or employees of NetZero and Juno. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or employees for those solicitation efforts. 

    You
should not send in any stock certificates with your proxy card. A transmittal letter with instructions for the surrender of stock certificates will be mailed to you as soon as
practicable after completion of the mergers. 

THE MERGERS    

Background of the Mergers  

    In May 2000, Mark Goldston, NetZero's chief executive officer, telephoned Charles Ardai, Juno's president and chief executive officer, and David E.
Shaw, the chairman of Juno's board of directors, to discuss the merits of a potential combination of NetZero and Juno. Through July 2000, NetZero and Juno held several informal telephonic
discussions to consider the possibility of a business combination, but no proposals resulted from those discussions. 

    In
August 2000, representatives of Juno and NetZero met at the offices of Goldman Sachs in New York to continue the discussions regarding a potential combination. In late
August 2000, Mr. Ardai and Richard Eaton, Juno's former chief financial officer and treasurer, met with Mr. Goldston, Jon Fetveit, NetZero's vice president, strategy and
development, Ronald Burr, NetZero's president, and Charles Hilliard, NetZero's chief financial officer. The discussions between the parties continued by telephone and in September 2000, NetZero
advised Juno that NetZero was not prepared to enter into a business combination at that time. 

    During
the fall of 2000, the parties remained in occasional contact to determine whether there might be interest in a combination. In January 2001, Toby Bryce, Juno's former
senior vice president of business development, met with Messrs. Hilliard and Fetveit in California to discuss the pending lawsuits between the parties and to discuss the possibility of a
business combination or strategic relationship between the parties. 

    In
January 2001, NetZero launched the NetZero Professional service, which is currently called the Extended Access Pass its first pay Internet access service. In
March 2001, NetZero launched the NetZero Platinum service, NetZero's first monthly recurring billable subscription Internet access service. 

    In
April 2001, Mr. Goldston telephoned Dr. Shaw to once again initiate discussions concerning a possible business combination. Dr. Shaw and
Mr. Goldston agreed that their respective teams would have telephone discussions during the week of April 23, 2001, to assess the possibility of a transaction.
During the week of April 23, 2001, representatives of NetZero and Juno had conversations and began to analyze the merits of combining the two companies. 

    On
May 2, 2001, Messrs. Hilliard and Fetveit met with Mr. Ardai and Harshan Bhangdia, Juno's senior vice president and chief financial officer, at Juno's offices
in New York to continue discussions. 

    On
May 8, 2001, NetZero proposed a business combination between NetZero and Juno in the form of an all stock transaction. The proposed combination would be structured as a
merger of a subsidiary of NetZero with and into Juno, in which Juno stockholders would receive 35% of the combined company. 

    Over
the following week, NetZero and Juno discussed elements of the proposal, and the parties worked toward reaching an agreement on selected material terms. Among other terms, the
parties discussed an ownership percentage of approximately 38.5% for Juno stockholders. 

    On
May 16, 2001, NetZero and Juno entered into a three-week exclusivity agreement. 

    On
May 21, 2001 representatives of NetZero, Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP, counsel to NetZero, Morgan Stanley, financial advisor to NetZero, Juno and Simpson
Thacher & Bartlett, special counsel to Juno, met at the offices of Morgan Stanley in New York to discuss the proposed transaction. At this time, the parties agreed that the transaction would be
structured to provide for the establishment of a new holding company, of which both NetZero and Juno would become subsidiaries. Following that meeting, representatives of NetZero continued their due
diligence effort and, during the evening of May 21, 2001, Brobeck delivered a first draft of the merger agreement and related documents. 

    On May 24 and May 25, 2001, representatives of Juno and Simpson Thacher conducted due diligence with respect to NetZero in Westlake Village, California. 

    Over
the following days, due diligence continued and the parties negotiated the terms of the merger agreement and related documents. 

    On
June 4, 2001, Juno's board of directors held a meeting at Simpson Thacher's offices. Negotiation of the merger agreement continued after that meeting and on June 5,
2001. 

    During
the afternoon of June 5, 2001, NetZero's board of directors met telephonically and received presentations from NetZero's senior management team, representatives of
Morgan Stanley and representatives of Brobeck. After deliberation, NetZero's board of directors adopted resolutions with respect to the proposed transaction. See "Recommendation of NetZero's Board of
Directors." 

    During
the evening of June 5, 2001, Juno's board of directors met and received presentations from Juno's senior management, representatives of Simpson Thacher and
representatives of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. At that meeting, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown rendered its oral opinion to the Juno board of directors as to the fairness to Juno stockholders from a
financial point of view of the exchange ratio of shares of our common stock for each share of Juno common stock. After deliberation, Juno's board of directors adopted resolutions with respect to the
proposed transactions. See "Recommendation of Juno's Board of Directors." 

    Negotiation
of the merger agreement and related documents continued on June 6, 2001 and June 7, 2001. On the afternoon of June 7, 2001, Juno's board of directors held a
meeting at which representatives of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown reaffirmed its opinion as to the fairness of the exchange ratio for Juno common stock, from a financial point of view, to Juno's
stockholders, and Juno's board of directors reaffirmed its earlier approval of the proposed transaction. 

    After
the closing of the Nasdaq National Market on June 7, 2001, the parties executed and delivered the merger agreement and issued a press release announcing the proposed
transaction. 

NetZero's Reasons for the Mergers  

    From time to time beginning May 2000, NetZero's management team informally updated members of NetZero's board of directors with respect to of the status
of discussions with Juno and the reasons that NetZero's management team believed the combination had the potential to deliver value to NetZero's stockholders. At a meeting on June 5, 2001,
NetZero's board of directors received presentations from members of NetZero's management team, Morgan Stanley and Brobeck. NetZero's management team highlighted its belief in the transaction as well
as some of the risks associated with the mergers, including many of the issues described under "Risk Factors." NetZero's board of directors made a business judgment concerning the potential of the
combined company and the following are the material reasons that NetZero's board recommends that NetZero's stockholders vote, at the NetZero special meeting, in favor of the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement. 

    Accelerate Growth in Pay Internet Access Business.
  Beginning in early 2001, NetZero began supplementing its revenues by
offering pay Internet access services. Until early 2001, NetZero had no experience in the pay Internet access services business. Juno had been offering pay services since 1998 and had acquired a great
deal of expertise in managing pay services. In addition, Juno had developed a significant pay subscriber base. The proposed transaction presented NetZero's board of directors with
the opportunity to accelerate NetZero's growth and expertise in the pay Internet access business. NetZero's board of directors was aware of the costs, time and uncertainty associated with building a
similar base of pay subscribers and management experience with pay subscribers and determined that the opportunity was in NetZero's best interests. 

    Opportunity to Spread Telecommunications and Networking Costs over a Larger Base.
  NetZero secured favorable pricing and
protected itself against near term increases in telecommunication costs by 

negotiating telecommunications agreements of up to three years of duration with a number of vendors. Some of these agreements require NetZero to purchase a fixed amount of telecommunications capacity,
regardless of whether that capacity is used by subscribers. Juno generally has short-term agreements with telecommunications providers which do not require fixed capacity commitments and are priced at
levels per unit in excess of NetZero's costs, assuming full utilization of NetZero's purchased capacity. The mergers represent an opportunity to spread the costs of NetZero's telecommunications
capacity and infrastructure over a larger number of subscribers. 

    Marketing to the Value Segment of the Internet.
  Most of the largest Internet service providers, including AOL Time
Warner, Earthlink, and The Microsoft Network, offer standard monthly pricing ranging from $19.95 to $23.90. Both Juno and NetZero had previously focused on building their businesses to be supported by
advertising revenues. NetZero believes that, because of this focus, both its and Juno's infrastructure have a much lower cost basis than the typical Internet service provider. In addition, the offer
of free Internet access services has proven to be an effective consumer offering, and Juno has demonstrated that many free users can be converted to pay users at a $9.95 value price point. NetZero
believes there are a significant number of consumers interested in value priced Internet access as an alternative to the standard industry pricing. NetZero's board of directors determined that the
combined company could more efficiently offer these services while containing marketing and operating costs than either party could do on a stand-alone basis. 

    Attractive Consolidated Advertising Base.
  NetZero believes that the Internet access market will continue to be
attractive to advertisers. Our ability to deliver a large subscriber base of users, based on NetZero's and Juno's active subscriber counts in March 2001, will potentially be more attractive to
online advertisers than what NetZero or Juno would be able to deliver as stand-alone companies. 

    Potential Cost Savings.
  NetZero believes that our cost base will be lower than the sum of NetZero's and Juno's cost
bases as stand-alone entities. NetZero's management believes reductions in telecommunication expenses, headcount, elimination of duplicate purchasing of services, reduction of marketing expenses,
consolidation of facilities and other cost reductions may be achieved by us. NetZero's board of directors also recognized that there would be near term costs associated with implementing these
reductions. 

    Confidence in NetZero's Management Team.
  NetZero's board of directors was aware of the risks associated with the
mergers, including those set forth under "Risk Factors." NetZero's board of directors also considered the challenges of integrating the two organizations. NetZero's board of directors believes that
NetZero's management team will be successful in realizing the synergies referred to in Morgan Stanley's presentation. 

    Morgan Stanley's Opinion.
  NetZero's board of directors received a presentation from representatives of Morgan Stanley
on June 5, 2001. NetZero's board of directors considered that presentation as well as Morgan Stanley's opinion as of that date, and subject to the assumptions and considerations in its opinion,
that the ratio of the exchange ratio for shares of Juno common stock to the exchange ratio for shares of NetZero common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair to the holders of shares of
NetZero common stock from a financial point of view. Please read Annex B carefully in its entirety and see "Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated." 

    Due Diligence Review of Juno.
  NetZero's board of directors received presentations from NetZero's management on
June 5, 2001 concerning the results of NetZero's investigation of Juno's business, finances and legal affairs. NetZero's board considered the results of that investigation and risks identified
by members of NetZero's management team. 

    Terms of the Merger Agreement and Related Transactions.
  On June 5, 2001, NetZero's board of directors received a
presentation from representatives of Brobeck concerning the terms of the merger agreement, the negotiations with Juno and legal issues related to the proposed transaction. Members of 

NetZero's management also informed the NetZero board of directors about the terms of the agreements with related parties of Juno and the severance and retention bonus provisions proposed for Juno's
directors, officers and employees. For more information, see "Interests of Juno Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers." 

    Indications of Support.
  NetZero's board of directors noted that NetZero's senior management team supported the proposed
combination. NetZero's board of directors also noted that holders of 40.5% of NetZero's outstanding shares of common stock were willing to enter into agreements to vote for the adoption of the merger
agreement. 

    This
list is not exhaustive but includes the material factors considered by NetZero's board of directors. Individual members of NetZero's board may have considered other factors not
included in this list. NetZero's board of directors did not attempt to assign relative weight to these factors but rather made the decision to approve the merger agreement after considering the
totality of the available information. 

Recommendation of NetZero's Board Of Directors  

    After careful consideration, the NetZero board of directors, on June 5, 2001, unanimously determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the
mergers are fair to, and in the best interest of, NetZero and its stockholders and approved the merger agreement and the mergers. In reaching its decision, the NetZero board of directors consulted
with its management team and advisors and independently considered the proposed merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. 
The NetZero board of
directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of NetZero vote "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement.

    In
considering the recommendation of the NetZero board of directors with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware, however, that directors and executive officers of
NetZero may have interests in the mergers that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of NetZero stockholders. Please see "Interests of NetZero Directors and Executive Officers in
the Mergers." 

Juno's Reasons for the Mergers  

    At multiple meetings in June 2001, Juno's board of directors received presentations from members of Juno's management team, Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown Inc., and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett highlighting the potential benefits of the transaction as well as some of the risks associated with the mergers, including many of the issues
described under "Risk Factors." 
The following are material reasons that Juno's board approved the mergers and that it recommends that you vote FOR the adoption of the merger
agreement.

    Significantly Greater Cash Resources.
  As of March 31, 2001, NetZero had cash, cash equivalents short term
investments and restricted cash of $163.0 million and unencumbered cash (defined as cash and cash equivalents in excess of payables and indebtedness) estimated at $125 million. At the
same date, Juno had cash and cash equivalents of $46.8 million and unencumbered cash of approximately $20 million. A combination with NetZero would provide Juno with access to
significantly increased cash resources at a time when alternate sources of funding are either unavailable entirely or available only on unattractive terms and/or in insufficient quantity. Juno's board
believes that the mergers will reduce the risk of Juno's either exhausting its cash resources or suffering significant erosion in its subscriber base due to the expense-reduction measures necessary
for the preservation of such resources. 

    Opportunity to Enhance Billable Subscriber Base.
  Juno has been marketing billable services to its free subscriber base
since 1998. Repeated exposure to such marketing messages over time may reduce their effectiveness. NetZero's subscriber base of almost 4 million active users in March 2001 represents 

a largely untapped and potentially valuable pool of subscribers to whom Juno's billable services can be marketed. 

    Potential Cost Synergies.
  By combining operations, Juno and NetZero will have the opportunity to achieve significant
cost savings over time through the reduction of duplicative facilities and personnel, and through the coordination of marketing expenses and other costs. Additionally, with a larger combined
subscriber base, it should be possible to achieve economies of scale in areas such as the purchasing of telecommunications services and the provision of technical support and customer service to
subscribers. 

    Optimization of Telecommunications Commitments and Expenses.
  Telecommunications expense represents Juno's and NetZero's
largest expense. NetZero has purchased more telecommunications capacity than it is currently utilizing, while Juno currently has telecommunications traffic in excess of Juno's own capacity
commitments. Juno believes that by running a portion of its excess traffic over NetZero's excess capacity, it can generate cost savings for both companies. Furthermore, by carefully comparing the
companies' telecommunications pricing on a city-by-city basis, United Online should be able to take advantage of the most favorable telecommunications terms enjoyed by each
company. 

    Potential Advertising Revenue Synergies.
  Juno believes that as a larger company with a significantly greater subscriber
base, United Online should be able to compete more effectively for advertising revenues in an industry where scale is an important competitive factor. Based on the companies' combined active
subscriber count in March 2001, United Online's subscriber base would exceed seven million subscribers, roughly double the size of either Juno's or NetZero's subscriber base as stand-alone
companies. Additionally, by combining with NetZero, Juno will gain access to existing advertising relationships that NetZero has formed, as well as to sales staff and related resources in excess of
those Juno possesses independently. 

    Intellectual Property Resources.
  Juno and NetZero have developed highly complementary intellectual property, and Juno's
management believes both companies stand to gain from a combination that allows them to use their technology resources collaboratively for the development and operation of enhanced services for both
consumers and advertisers. 

    Greater Market Visibility.
  Juno believes that, by virtue of its greater size and market share, United Online will enjoy
greater visibility than Juno would be able to achieve independently, not only among consumers but also in the investment community. This increased visibility may attract greater levels of investment
research and should enhance trading liquidity. 

    Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's Opinion.
  Juno's board of directors received a presentation from representatives of Deutsche
Banc Alex. Brown on June 5, 2001. Juno's board of directors considered
that presentation as well as Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's opinion that, as of the date of the opinion, and subject to and based on the assumptions and considerations referred to in the opinion, the
0.3570 ratio to exchange shares of Juno common stock for shares of United Online stock was fair to the holders of Juno common stock from a financial point of view. Please read Annex C
carefully in its entirety and see "Opinion of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc." 

    This
list is not exhaustive but includes certain of the material factors considered by Juno's board of directors. Individual members of Juno's board may have considered other factors
not included in this list. 

    In
view of the variety of material factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the mergers, the Juno board of directors did not quantify or assign relative weights to the
specific factors considered in reaching its recommendation. Instead, the Juno board made its recommendation based on the totality of the information presented and considered by it. 

    Juno's board of directors also took into consideration potential costs and risks associated with the mergers and the combined company, and concluded that the potential benefits of the
mergers outweighed these factors. These factors include the risk that the potential benefits sought in the mergers might not be fully realized and the risk that the investment community and the
consumer marketplace might respond negatively to the proposed transaction. There can be no assurance that any of the expected results, efficiencies, opportunities or other benefits described in this
section will be achieved as a result of the mergers. For information concerning these and additional risks associated with the mergers, please see "Risk Factors." 

    The
board also considered the substantial costs expected to be incurred in connection with the mergers, including the costs of integrating the companies' businesses and transaction
expenses resulting from the mergers. 

Recommendation of Juno's Board of Directors  

    After careful consideration, the Juno board of directors, on June 5, 2001, unanimously determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the mergers
were fair to, and in the best interest of, Juno and its stockholders and approved the merger agreement and the mergers. In reaching its decision, the Juno board of directors consulted with its
management team and advisors and independently considered the proposed merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. On June 7, 2001, the Juno board of directors
reaffirmed its earlier determination that the terms of the mergers were fair to, and in the best interest of, Juno and its stockholders. The Juno
board of directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Juno vote "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement. 

    In
considering the recommendation of the Juno board of directors with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that directors and executive officers of Juno may have
interests in the mergers that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of Juno stockholders. Please see "Interests of Juno Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers." 

Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated  

    NetZero retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with a financial fairness opinion in connection with the mergers. NetZero's board of directors selected Morgan
Stanley to act as NetZero's financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley's qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of the business and affairs of NetZero. At the meeting of NetZero's
board of directors on June 5, 2001, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of June 5, 2001, and subject to and based on the considerations
in its opinion, the ratio of the exchange ratio for shares of Juno common stock to the exchange ratio for shares of NetZero common stock pursuant to the merger agreement is fair from a financial point
of view to the holders of NetZero common stock. 

    The
full text of Morgan Stanley's opinion, dated June 5, 2001, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
limitations on the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley is attached as Annex B to this document. We urge you to read this opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley's opinion is directed to
the board of directors of NetZero, addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view of the exchange ratio for shares of Juno common stock to the exchange ratio for shares of NetZero common
stock pursuant to the merger agreement, and does not address any other aspect of the mergers or constitute a recommendation to any NetZero stockholder as to how to vote at the NetZero special meeting.
This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. 

    In

    Morgan
Stanley assumed and relied upon without independent verification the accuracy and completeness of the information supplied or otherwise made available to it by Juno and NetZero
for the purposes of its opinion. With respect to the financial forecasts, including information relating to strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the mergers, Morgan Stanley
assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the future financial performance of each of Juno and NetZero. Morgan Stanley
relied upon the assessment by the management of each of Juno and NetZero of their ability to retain key employees of Juno and NetZero, respectively. Morgan Stanley also relied upon, without
independent verification, the assessment by the management of each of Juno and NetZero of Juno's and NetZero's technologies and products, the timing and risks associated with, Juno's and NetZero's
integration and the validity of, and risks associated with, Juno's and NetZero's existing products and technologies. Morgan Stanley relied upon, without independent verification, the terms disclosed
to Morgan Stanley by management of Juno and NetZero with respect to the resolution of Juno's litigation with Freewwweb, and assumed that the dispute would be resolved in accordance with the terms
outlined by Juno's management. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the mergers would be consummated in 

accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement, including, among other things, that the mergers would be treated as tax-free reorganizations and/or exchanges under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Morgan Stanley has not made any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of Juno or NetZero, nor has Morgan Stanley been furnished with any
appraisals. Morgan Stanley's opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Morgan Stanley as of June 5,
2001. 

    The
following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the preparation of its written opinion. These
summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the
text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. 

    Historical Share Price Performance.
  Morgan Stanley reviewed the price performance and trading volumes of the common
stock of each of NetZero and Juno from June 1, 2000 through June 4, 2001. The table below shows the twelve-month high and low closing prices during that period, compared with a closing
price on June 4, 2001 of $0.82 per share for the NetZero common stock and $1.62 per share for the Juno common stock:

    Morgan
Stanley then compared the price performance of the NetZero common stock and the Juno common stock from January 3, 2000 through June 4, 2001 with that of the
Morgan Stanley Internet Index and a group of selected Internet service providers. 

    The
group of selected Internet service providers included EarthLink Inc., Excite@Home and Prodigy Communications. Morgan Stanley selected EarthLink Inc., Excite@Home and
Prodigy Communications because they are publicly traded companies with operations that, for purposes of this analysis, may be considered similar to those of NetZero and Juno. None of the companies
utilized in this analysis as a comparison is identical to NetZero or Juno.

    Comparable Companies Analysis.
  Morgan Stanley compared selected historical and projected financial and operating data
from publicly available research analyst estimates of NetZero and Juno with the corresponding data and stock market performance data available from publicly available sources for
EarthLink Inc., Excite@Home and Prodigy Communications. 

    Morgan Stanley calculated trading statistics for each member of the comparable companies including: 


The
multiple of aggregate value to revenue for the last twelve months ending March 31, 2001


The
multiple of aggregate value to 2000 revenue


The
multiple of aggregate value to forecasted 2001 revenue


The

    Morgan
Stanley noted that the ratio of the exchange ratio for shares of Juno common stock to the exchange ratio for shares of NetZero common stock pursuant to the merger agreement
implied a last twelve month revenue multiple of 0.16x for Juno, 2000 revenue multiple of 0.17x for Juno, 2001 estimated revenue multiple of 0.19x for Juno, and pay subscriber multiple of $21.48 for
Juno. 

    No
company utilized in the comparable company analysis is identical to NetZero or Juno. In selecting and evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made certain judgments and
assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Mathematical analysis, like determining the average or median, of
financial ratios of the comparable companies is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data. 

    Multiples Paid in Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis.
  Morgan Stanley reviewed ten recent selected business
combinations and analyzed announced deal values to subscriber multiples. Morgan Stanley selected these transactions because they involved companies engaged in industries that are similar or related to
those in which NetZero and Juno operate. 

    These
transactions are: the LineOne/Tiscali S.p.A. transaction, the surfEU.com Ltd./Tiscali S.p.A. transaction, the Planet Inkerkom/Tiscali S.p.A. transaction, the Liberty
Surf/Tiscali S.p.A. transaction, the AddCom AG/Tiscali S.p.A. transaction, the Freeserve plc/Groupe Wanadoo SA transaction, the Korea Thrunet Co., Ltd./SoftBank Corporation transaction, the
Mageos/Telecom Italia S.p.A.
transaction, AOL/NTT Docomo, Inc. transaction and World Online International N.V./Tiscali S.p.A. transaction.

    Morgan
Stanley noted that the ratio of the exchange ratio for shares of Juno common stock to the exchange ratio for shares of NetZero common stock pursuant to the merger agreement
implied a pay subscriber multiple of $21.48 for Juno. 

    No
company or transaction utilized in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to NetZero or Juno or the mergers. In evaluating the transactions in this analysis, Morgan
Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of
NetZero or Juno, such as the impact of competition on the business of NetZero, Juno, or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial
condition and prospects of NetZero, Juno
or the industry or in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value of the transactions to which they are being compared.
Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, or the high or the low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using precedent transactions data. 

    Relative Contribution Analysis.
  Morgan Stanley compared pro forma contribution of each of NetZero and Juno, based on
active subscriber, pay subscriber and revenue projections provided to Morgan Stanley by the management of NetZero and Juno, to the resultant combined company assuming completion of the mergers. This
analysis indicated the following contribution for NetZero to the combined company on a pro forma basis: 

NetZero Contribution

Active Subscribers:

2001 estimated

49.3

%

    Morgan
Stanley compared these results with the pro forma ownership by NetZero stockholders of approximately 61.5% of the common stock of the combined company. 

    Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis.
  Morgan Stanley reviewed the implied historical exchange ratios for the shares of
common stock of each of NetZero and Juno determined by dividing the price 

per share of Juno common stock by the price per share of NetZero common stock over the twelve-month period from June 1, 2000 through June 4, 2001. Morgan Stanley performed this analysis
to
compare the exchange ratios in the mergers with those represented by historical exchange ratios prevailing in the open market. 

    This
analysis indicated the following average historical exchange ratios prevailing in the open market: 

Period Ending Day of June 4, 2001

Exchange Ratio

Last one week average

1.660x

Last one month average

1.631x

Last six months average

1.655x

Last twelve months average

1.612x

    Morgan
Stanley compared these results with the ratio of the exchange ratio for shares of Juno common stock to the exchange ratio for shares of NetZero common stock in the mergers of
1.785x. 

    Pro Forma Merger Analysis.
  Morgan Stanley analyzed the pro forma effect of the mergers on each of NetZero's and Juno's
projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2002, based on projections provided to Morgan Stanley by the management of Juno
and NetZero. The analysis indicated that the mergers would increase the EBITDA of the combined company as compared to each company on a stand-alone basis. 

    In
connection with the review of the mergers by NetZero's board of directors, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its
opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley
considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it. Morgan Stanley believes that the summary provided and
the analyses described above must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of these analyses, without considering all of them, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its
analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors and may have deemed various assumptions more or less
probable than other assumptions, so that the range of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should therefore not be taken to be Morgan Stanley's view of the actual value of
NetZero or Juno. 

    In
performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made many assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of NetZero or Juno. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley's analysis are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by these estimates. The analyses performed were prepared solely as a part of Morgan Stanley's analysis of the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders of
common stock of NetZero of the ratio of the fraction of a share of our common stock into which each share of Juno common stock will be converted to the fraction of a share of our common stock into
which each share of NetZero common stock will be converted pursuant to the merger agreement and were conducted in connection with the delivery by Morgan Stanley of its opinion dated June 5,
2001 to NetZero's board of directors. Morgan Stanley's analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of common stock of NetZero or Juno or our common stock
following the mergers might actually trade. The ratio of the exchange ratio for shares of Juno common stock to the exchange ratio for shares of NetZero common stock pursuant to the merger agreement
was determined through arm's length negotiations between NetZero and Juno and was approved by NetZero's board of directors. Morgan Stanley did not recommend to NetZero any specific ratio or that any
given ratio constituted the only appropriate ratio in connection with the mergers. 

    Morgan Stanley is an internationally recognized investment banking and advisory firm. Morgan Stanley, as part of its investment banking and financial advisory business, is
continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed
and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of business, Morgan Stanley may from time to time trade in the securities or
indebtedness of NetZero and Juno for its own account, the accounts of investment funds and other clients under the management of Morgan Stanley and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly,
may at any time hold a long or short position in these securities or indebtedness. 

    NetZero
paid Morgan Stanley a $600,000 financial advisory fee upon delivery of its financial opinion. NetZero has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses incurred in
performing its services and to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its
affiliates against liabilities and expenses, including liabilities under federal securities laws, related to or arising out of Morgan Stanley's engagement and any related transactions. 

Opinion of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc.  

    Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown acted as financial advisor to Juno in connection with the mergers. At the June 5, 2001 meeting of Juno's board of directors,
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown delivered its oral opinion to Juno's board of directors to the effect that, based upon and subject to the assumptions made, matters considered and limits of the review
undertaken by Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, the
exchange ratio of 0.3570 of a share of our common stock to be received in connection with the mergers by Juno common stockholders for each share of Juno common stock was fair, from a financial point
of view, to holders of Juno common stock. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown noted that the exchange ratio for Juno common stock in the mergers was equivalent to a ratio of 1.7850 shares of NetZero common
stock to each share of Juno common stock. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's oral opinion was subsequently confirmed in writing to Juno's board of directors on June 7, 2001. 

    Deutsche
Banc Alex. Brown's opinion is directed to the board of directors of Juno to assist it in connection with its consideration of the proposed mergers and relates only to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to Juno common stockholders of the exchange ratio of 0.3570 shares of our common stock for each share of Juno common stock. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's
opinion does not relate to any other aspect of the mergers, is not an opinion as to the fairness of the mergers to NetZero or its stockholders and does not constitute a recommendation to Juno, NetZero
or their respective stockholders as to the mergers or as to how Juno or NetZero stockholders should vote with respect to the merger agreement. 

    The
full text of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's written opinion, dated June 7, 2001, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, matters considered and limits on
the review undertaken by Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and we incorporate it by reference. Juno stockholders
are urged to read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. The summary of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's opinion set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of the opinion. 

    In
connection with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's role as financial advisor to the Juno board of directors, and in arriving at its opinion, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown has among other
things: 


reviewed
certain publicly available financial and other information concerning NetZero and Juno and certain internal analyses and other information
furnished to it by NetZero and Juno; 

discussed
with the members of the senior management of NetZero and Juno the businesses and prospects of their respective companies and the joint prospects
of a combined company;

the reported prices and trading activity for NetZero common stock and Juno common stock; 

compared
certain financial and stock market information for NetZero and Juno with similar information for certain other companies whose securities are
publicly traded; 

reviewed
the financial terms of certain recent business combinations which it deemed comparable in whole or in part; 

reviewed
the terms of the merger agreement and certain related documents; and 

performed
such other studies and analyses and considered such other factors as it deemed appropriate. 

    In
preparing its opinion, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown did not assume responsibility for the independent verification of, and did not independently verify, any information, whether
publicly available or furnished to it, concerning NetZero or Juno, including, without limitation, any financial information, forecasts or projections, considered in connection with the rendering of
its opinion. Accordingly, for purposes of its opinion, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all information it reviewed. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown did not
conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or assets, and did not prepare or obtain any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities of NetZero or Juno. With
respect to the financial forecasts and projections, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown was advised by the management of each of Juno and NetZero that only financial projections or forecasts for the years 2001
and 2002 were available for
both companies. In rendering its opinion, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown expresses no view as to the reasonableness of those forecasts and projections, including the synergies, or the assumptions on which
they are based. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's written opinion was based upon economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown as of,
June 5, 2001 and Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown undertook no obligation to update its opinion to reflect any developments occurring after that date. 

    For
purposes of rendering its opinion, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown has assumed that, in all respects material to its analyses, the representations and warranties of the parties to the
merger agreement contained in the merger agreement are true and correct, each party to the merger agreement will perform all of the covenants and agreements to be performed by it under the merger
agreement and all conditions to the obligations of each of the parties to the merger agreement to consummate the mergers will be satisfied without any waiver. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown has also
assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required in connection with the consummation of the mergers will be obtained and that in connection with obtaining
any necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents, or any amendments, modifications or waivers to any agreements, instruments or orders to which either Juno or NetZero is a party
or is subject or by which it is bound, no limitations, restrictions or conditions will be imposed or amendments, modifications or waivers made that would have a material adverse effect on Juno or
NetZero or materially reduce the contemplated benefits of the mergers. In addition, Juno informed Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, and accordingly for the purpose of rendering its opinion Deutsche Banc
Alex. Brown has assumed, that the mergers will be tax-free to each of Juno and NetZero and their respective stockholders. 

    Set forth below is a brief summary of certain financial analyses performed by Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown in connection with its opinion and reviewed with the Juno board of directors at
its meeting on June 5, 2001. 

    Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis.
  Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown compared the exchange ratio of 0.3570 of a share of our
common shares for each share of Juno common stock (which is equivalent to a ratio of 1.7850 shares of NetZero common stock to each share of Juno common stock) to the ratio of the closing market prices
of NetZero common stock and Juno common stock on June 5, 2001. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown also compared this ratio to selected average historical ratios of the closing market prices of Juno
common stock to NetZero common stock for several periods set forth below:

    Pro Forma Financial Effects Analysis.
  Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyzed pro forma effects of the mergers without
taking into account potential after-tax cost savings, operating efficiencies, revenue effects and financial synergies NetZero and Juno could achieve if the mergers were completed. The
analysis was based on the estimates of each company's management. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown observed that, on a standalone basis, Juno had approximately $11.41 of cash per active user and $4.88 of
unencumbered cash per active user as of March 31, 2001. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown also observed that, on a pro forma basis as of March 31, 2001, the pro forma combined company would have
a cash balance of $210.1 million, approximately 8 million active users and $26.26 of cash per active user. Finally, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown observed that, on a pro forma basis as of
March 31, 2001, the pro forma combined company would have an unencumbered cash balance of $145.0 million, resulting in $18.13 of unencumbered cash per active user. Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown used cash in excess of payables and indebtedness as of March 31, 2001 to calculate the unencumbered cash balance. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown noted that the amount of cash and unencumbered
cash per active user on a pro forma basis is
significantly higher than the amount of cash and unencumbered cash per active user for Juno on a standalone basis. 

    Relative Contribution Analysis.
  Based on financial projections prepared by Juno and NetZero management, Deutsche Banc
Alex. Brown compared the pro forma contribution of both NetZero and Juno to our company, giving effect to the completion of the mergers. This analysis showed that on a pro forma basis (excluding the
effects of any synergies that may be realized as a result of the mergers and of non-recurring expenses relating to the mergers), the relative contribution of Juno and NetZero would be:

    Premium Analysis.
  Based on data from Securities Data Corporation, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown also reviewed the premiums
paid in selected stock-for-stock transactions, both across all industry sectors and in the technology sector, since January 1, 2000, where the entire equity interest in
the target company was acquired and where the market capitalization of the target company was within a range from $50 million to $200 million. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown defined the
technology sector as the high-technology sector, excluding biotechnology and medical technology. The premiums were based upon Juno share price of $1.59 at close of business on
June 5, 2001 and assumed announcement date of June 6, 2001. The review indicated the following premiums:

    All
premiums for the selected transactions were calculated based on public information available at the time of announcement of such transactions, without taking into account
differing market and other conditions existing at the time the transactions occurred. Because the reasons for, and circumstances surrounding, each of the transactions in the sample set were so
diverse, and due to the inherent differences between the operations and financial conditions of Juno and NetZero, on the one hand, and the companies involved in the selected transactions, on the other
hand, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown believes the analysis of premiums paid in selected stock-for-stock transactions is not simply mathematical. Rather, it involves complex
considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected in Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's written opinion, concerning differences in the financial and operating
characteristics of the companies, prevailing market conditions and other factors that could affect the public trading value of the companies. 

    Analysis of Selected Publicly Traded Companies.
  Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown compared certain financial information and
commonly used valuation measurements relating to NetZero and Juno with the corresponding information and measurements for EarthLink, Inc., Prodigy Communications Corporation and Internet
America, Inc. None of the companies utilized as a comparison is identical to NetZero or Juno. Accordingly, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown believes the analysis of publicly traded comparable
companies is not simply mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected in Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's written opinion, concerning differences in
financial and operating characteristics of the comparable companies and other factors that could affect the public trading value of the comparable companies. Furthermore, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown
cautions that given the high volatility of the share prices of each of NetZero and Juno, combined with the absence of a set of truly comparable companies due to the unique business characteristics of
each of NetZero and Juno, the results of the comparable companies valuation analysis are less indicative than they would ordinarily be. 

    Financial
information and valuation measurements reviewed by Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown included, among other things: 


common
equity market valuation as of June 5, 2001; 

operating
performance; 

ratios
of modified enterprise value, defined as equity market capitalization adjusted for debt and capital lease obligations and excluding cash on balance
sheet, to latest twelve months, or LTM, revenues and estimated 2001 and 2002 revenues; and 

implied
cash value per share based on estimates of unencumbered cash (defined as cash and cash equivalents in excess of payables and indebtedness) as of
March 31, 2001. 

    To
calculate the trading multiples for the selected peer group companies, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown used publicly available information concerning the selected peer group companies'
LTM revenues and estimated 2001 and 2002 revenues. Multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or EBITDA, and earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, for the selected peer group companies were not meaningful due to continued projected operating losses.

    Analysis of Selected Precedent Transactions.
  Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown reviewed the financial terms, to the extent
publicly available, of eleven proposed, pending or completed acquisition transactions since January 1998 involving companies in the Internet service provider sector. All multiples for the
selected precedent transactions were based on public information available at the time of announcement of such transactions, without taking into account differing market and other conditions existing
at the time the transactions occurred. Because the reasons for, and circumstances surrounding, each of the selected precedent transactions analyzed were so diverse, and due to the inherent differences
between the operations and financial conditions of Juno and NetZero, on the one hand, and the companies involved in the selected precedent transactions, on the other hand, Deutsche 

Banc Alex. Brown believes that a selected precedent transactions analysis is not simply mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected in Deutsche Banc
Alex. Brown's written opinion, concerning differences between the characteristics of these transactions and the mergers that could affect the value of the subject companies and businesses of NetZero
and Juno. Furthermore, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown cautions that, given the high volatility of the share prices of each of NetZero and Juno, the wide range of valuations for technology/Internet-related
equities during the period surveyed and the unique business characteristics of each of NetZero and Juno, the results of the selected precedent transactions analysis are less indicative than they would
ordinarily be.

    Miscellaneous.
  The foregoing summary describes analyses and factors that Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown deemed material in
its presentation to the board of directors of Juno, but is not a comprehensive description of all analyses performed and factors considered by Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown in connection with preparing
its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving the application of subjective business judgment in determining the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, is not readily susceptible to summary description. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown believes that its analyses
must be considered as a whole and that considering any portion of the analyses and of the factors considered without considering all analyses and factors could create a misleading view of the process
underlying the opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown did not assign specific weights to any particular analyses. 

    In
conducting its analyses and arriving at its opinions, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown utilized a variety of generally accepted valuation methods. The analyses were prepared solely for
the purpose of enabling Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown to provide its opinion to Juno's board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of Juno common stock of the
exchange ratio of Juno common stock for shares of our common stock in the mergers and do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may
be sold, which are inherently 

subject to uncertainty. In connection with its analyses, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown made, and was provided by Juno management and NetZero management with, numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Juno's or NetZero's control. Analyses based on estimates or forecasts of future results are not
necessarily indicative of actual past or future values or results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by the analyses. Because such analyses are inherently subject to
uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of Juno, NetZero or their respective advisors, neither Juno nor Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown nor any other person assumes
responsibility if future results or actual values are materially different from these forecasts or assumptions. 

    The
terms of the merger agreement were determined through negotiations between Juno and NetZero and were approved by Juno's board of directors. Although Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown
provided advice to Juno's board of directors during the course of these negotiations, the decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of Juno's board of directors. As described above,
the opinion and presentation of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown to Juno's board of directors was only one of a number of factors taken into consideration by Juno's board of directors in making its
determination to approve the merger agreement. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's opinion was provided to Juno's board of directors to assist it in connection with its consideration of the mergers and does
not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Juno common stock or NetZero common stock as to how to vote with respect to the mergers. 

    Juno
selected Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown as financial advisor in connection with the mergers based on Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's qualifications, expertise, reputation and experience
in mergers and acquisitions. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown is a registered broker-dealer and member of the New York Stock Exchange. Juno retained Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown pursuant to a letter agreement
dated May 31, 2001. As compensation for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's services in connection with the mergers, Juno has agreed to pay Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown a cash fee of $500,000 which is
payable upon delivery of its opinion, and has agreed to pay an additional cash fee of $350,000 if the mergers are consummated. Regardless of whether the mergers are consummated, Juno has agreed to
reimburse Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown for all reasonable fees and disbursements of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's counsel (up to a total of $40,000) and all of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's reasonable travel
and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the mergers or otherwise arising out of the retention of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown under the letter agreement. Juno
has also agreed to indemnify Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and its related persons to the full extent lawful against liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of
its engagement or the mergers. 

    Deutsche
Banc Alex. Brown is an internationally recognized investment banking firm experienced in providing advice in connection with mergers and acquisitions and related
transactions. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and its affiliates may have, from time to time, provided investment banking, and other financial services to Juno and NetZero or their affiliates for which they
have received or may receive compensation, including Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's predecessor having acted as financial advisor to Juno in 2000 in connection with Juno's exploration of strategic
alternatives. In the ordinary course of business, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and its affiliates may actively trade in the securities and other instruments and obligations of Juno and NetZero for their
own accounts and for the accounts of their
customers. Accordingly, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and its affiliates may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities, instruments and obligations. 

Interests of NetZero Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers  

    In considering the recommendation of the board of directors of NetZero to vote for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, stockholders of NetZero should
be aware that members of the NetZero board of directors and members of NetZero's management team have agreements or arrangements that provide them with interests in the mergers that differ from those
of NetZero stockholders. The NetZero board of directors was aware of these agreements and arrangements during 

its deliberations of the merits of the mergers and in determining to recommend to the stockholders of NetZero that they vote for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. 

    Governance Structure and Management Positions.
  Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, upon completion of the
mergers, the officers and directors of NetZero immediately prior to the completion of the mergers will be our officers and directors. 

    NetZero Employee Stock Options and Restricted Shares.
  Once the mergers are completed, we will assume in full each
NetZero stock option pursuant to the merger agreement. This means that each NetZero employee stock option outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the mergers will be converted into an
option to acquire that number of shares of our common stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share, equal to the product of 0.2000 multiplied by the number of shares of NetZero common stock that
would have been obtained before the mergers upon exercise of the option, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. In addition, each outstanding restricted share of NetZero common stock will be converted
into 0.2000 of a share of our common stock. 

    Indemnification and Insurance.
  The merger agreement provides that, upon completion of the mergers, we will indemnify
and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors, officers and employees of NetZero and its subsidiaries, in all of their capacities, for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the completion of the mergers: 


to
the same extent they were indemnified or had the right to advancement of expenses as of June 7, 2001, which is the date of the merger agreement,
pursuant to NetZero's restated certificate of incorporation, restated bylaws and indemnification agreements with any directors, officers and employees of NetZero and its subsidiaries; and 

to
the fullest extent permitted by law. 

    The
merger agreement also provides that, upon completion of the mergers, that 


our
charter documents will include provisions regarding the elimination of liability for directors and officers no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions of NetZero's charter documents before the mergers; and 

we
will maintain, for a period of six years, the current, or similarly advantageous, policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by NetZero, with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the completion of the mergers up to a cost of $3,000,000 for such insurance. 

Interests of Juno Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers  

    In considering the recommendation of the board of directors of Juno to vote for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, stockholders of Juno should be
aware that members of the Juno board of directors and members of Juno's management team have agreements or arrangements that provide them with interests in the mergers that may differ from those of
Juno stockholders. The Juno board of directors was aware of these agreements and arrangements during its deliberations of the merits of the mergers and in determining to recommend to the stockholders
of Juno that they vote for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. 

    Termination Protection Agreements for Executive Officers.
  Each of Charles Ardai and Harshan Bhangdia have entered into
Termination Protection Agreements with Juno and it is anticipated that each of them will be terminated upon consummation of the mergers. Pursuant to these agreements, as amended, upon consummation of
the mergers, the employment of Messrs. Ardai and Bhangdia will be terminated without cause and (a) Mr. Ardai will receive a severance payment equal to 125% of the sum of his base
salary and guaranteed bonus and (b) Mr. Bhangdia will receive a severance payment equal to 75% of the sum of his base salary and guaranteed bonus. Additionally, any outstanding and
unvested options of these executive officers will become fully vested. All payments made pursuant to 

these agreements will be reduced by any cash payments actually made to these employees under the WARN Act. Furthermore, pursuant to these agreements, Mr. Ardai, in exchange for a payment equal
to 125% of the sum of his base salary and guaranteed bonus, has agreed not to compete with Juno's
business for a period of one year, and Mr. Bhangdia, in exchange for a payment equal to 100% of the sum of his base salary and guaranteed bonus, has agreed not to compete with Juno's business
for a period of six months, in each case following the consummation of the mergers. 

    Additionally,
Mr. Ardai and Mr. Bhangdia have agreed to provide services, as may be requested by United Online, during the 60 day period following consummation of
the mergers, for which they would be compensated at a weekly rate calculated based on their current annual base salary and guaranteed bonus. 

    Directors Stock Option Acceleration.
  Under Juno's 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, outstanding options granted to
non-employee directors automatically accelerate and become immediately exercisable in full upon consummation of the mergers. 

    Indemnification and Insurance.
  The merger agreement provides that, upon completion of the mergers, we will indemnify
and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors, officers and employees of Juno and its subsidiaries in all of their capacities, for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the completion of the mergers: 


to
the same extent they were indemnified or had the right to advancement of expenses as of June 7, 2001, which is the date of the merger agreement,
pursuant to Juno's restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws and indemnification agreements with any directors, officers and employees of Juno and its subsidiaries; and 

to
the fullest extent permitted by law, in each case for acts or omissions. 

    The
merger agreement also provides that, upon completion of the mergers, that 


our
charter documents must include provisions regarding the elimination of liability for directors and officers no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions of Juno's charter documents before the mergers; and 

we
purchase as of the time the mergers are completed, a prepaid, non-cancelable, six year, "runoff" tail policy to be effective for six years
following the completion of the mergers with the current coverage of Juno's policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance for a cost no greater than
$3,000,000, or, if less, the greatest amount of coverage available for $3,000,000. 

    Leases.
  Following the signing of the merger agreement, Juno will enter sublease agreements with D. E. Shaw &
Co., L.P. through March 31, 2003 for office space currently occupied by Juno at 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York. Juno currently occupies four floors totaling approximately
46,000 square feet in the aggregate, at this location. The sublease agreements will provide for rent payments at $52 per square foot, with 6-month termination rights by either party, and
termination payments ranging from $47,400 to $165,000 to be paid by Juno upon termination or expiration of its subleases for particular floors. 

Completion and Effectiveness of the Mergers  

    The mergers will be completed when all of the conditions to completion of the mergers are satisfied or waived, including the adoption of the merger agreement
by the stockholders of each of NetZero and Juno. The mergers will become effective upon the filing of certificates of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. 

    We
are working toward completing the mergers as quickly as possible. We anticipate completing the mergers immediately after the stockholders of NetZero and Juno adopt the merger
agreement at their respective special meetings. 

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers  

    The following summary discusses the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers to U.S. holders of NetZero common stock and Juno common stock. 

    For
purposes of this discussion, a U.S. holder means: 


a
citizen or resident of the United States; 

a
corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States or any of its political subdivisions; 

a
trust, if a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. fiduciaries have the authority
to control all substantial decisions of the trust; or 

an
estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source. 

    This
discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions currently in effect, all of which are
subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. The discussion assumes that NetZero stockholders hold their NetZero common stock and will hold their shares of our common stock, and that Juno
stockholders hold their Juno common stock and will hold their shares of our common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code. Further, the
discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular stockholder in light of his, her or its personal investment circumstances or to
stockholders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including: 


insurance
companies; 

tax-exempt
organizations; 

dealers
in securities or foreign currency; 

banks
or trusts; 

persons
that hold their NetZero common stock or Juno common stock as part of a straddle, a hedge against currency risk or a constructive sale or conversion
transaction; 

persons
that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar; 

investors
in pass-through entities; 

certain
expatriates; 

stockholders
who acquired their NetZero common stock or Juno common stock through the exercise of options or otherwise as compensation or through a
tax-qualified retirement plan; or 

holders
of options granted under any NetZero or Juno benefit plan. 

    This
summary does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or are contingent on, individual circumstances. Moreover, this summary does not address any non-income
tax or any foreign, state or local tax consequences of the mergers. This summary does not address the tax consequences of any transaction other than the mergers. Accordingly, you are strongly urged to
consult with your tax advisor to determine the particular federal, state, local or foreign income or other tax consequences of the mergers to you. 

    Neither
we, NetZero nor Juno will request a ruling from the United States Internal Revenue Service with respect to any of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers and,
as a result, we can not assure you that the Internal Revenue Service will not disagree with or challenge any of the conclusions described below. 

    It
is a condition to completion of the mergers that Brobeck deliver its opinion to NetZero and Simpson Thacher deliver its opinion to Juno to the effect that, on the basis of the
facts, representations 

and assumptions set forth in such opinion the merger of NZ Acquisition Corp. into NetZero and the merger of JO Acquisition Corp. into Juno will each constitute an exchange and/or a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 351 or Section 368(a), respectively, of the Internal Revenue Code. 

    As
a result the following tax consequences will apply: 


no
gain or loss will be recognized by us, NetZero, Juno, NZ Acquisition Corp. or JO Acquisition Corp. as a result of the mergers; 

no
gain or loss will be recognized by: 


U.S.
holders of NetZero common stock on the exchange of their NetZero common stock for shares of our common stock, except with respect to cash received by
U.S. holders of NetZero common stock in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock; or 

U.S.
holders of Juno common stock on the exchange of their Juno common stock for shares of our common stock, except with respect to cash received by U.S.
holders of Juno common stock in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock; 


the
aggregate adjusted basis of the shares of our common stock received in connection with the mergers by: 


a
U.S. holder of NetZero common stock will be equal to the aggregate adjusted basis of the U.S. holder's NetZero common stock exchanged for those shares of
our common stock reduced by any amount allocable to the fractional share interests in our common stock for which cash is received; and 

a
U.S. holder of Juno common stock will be equal to the aggregate adjusted basis of the U.S. holder's Juno common stock exchanged for those shares of our
common stock reduced by any amount allocable to the fractional share interests in our common stock for which cash is received; and 


the
holding period of the shares of our common stock received in connection with the mergers by: 


a
U.S. holder of NetZero common stock will include the holding period of the U.S. holder's NetZero common stock exchanged for those shares of our common
stock; and 

a
U.S. holder of Juno common stock will include the holding period of the U.S. holder's Juno common stock exchanged for those shares of our common stock. 

    Any
change in currently applicable law, which may or may not be retroactive, or failure of any factual representations or assumptions to be true, correct and complete in all material
respects, could affect the continuing validity of the Brobeck tax opinion and the Simpson Thacher tax opinion. 

    Cash Instead of Fractional Shares.
  The receipt of cash instead of a fractional share of our common stock by a U.S.
holder of NetZero common stock or Juno common stock will result in taxable gain or loss to that U.S. holder for U.S. federal income tax purposes based upon the difference between the amount of cash
received by that U.S. holder and the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in the fractional share. The gain or loss will constitute capital gain or loss and will constitute long-term capital
gain or loss if
the U.S. holder's holding period is greater than twelve months as of the date the mergers are completed. For non-corporate U.S. holders, this long-term capital gain generally
will be taxed at a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20%. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. 

    Backup Withholding.
  Payments to certain non-corporate U.S. holders may be subject to backup withholding on
cash payments received in connection with the mergers (including cash paid instead of fractional shares of our common stock). Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a U.S. holder who: 


furnishes
a correct taxpayer identification and certifies as to not being subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 or a substitute
or successor form; or 

is
otherwise exempt from backup withholding. 

    If
a U.S. holder does not provide a correct taxpayer identification number, the U.S. holder may be subject to penalties imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. Any amount paid as
backup withholding does not constitute an additional tax and will be creditable against such U.S. holder's U.S. federal income tax liability. U.S. holders should consult with their own tax advisors as
to their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining the exemption. 

    A
U.S. holder may avoid backup withholding by completing IRS Form W-9 or a substitute or successor form and submitting it to the paying agent for the transaction
when submitting such U.S. holder's stock certificate. 

Reporting Requirements
. A U.S. holder of NetZero common stock or Juno common stock receiving shares of our common stock as a result of
the mergers may be required to retain records related to their NetZero common stock and Juno common stock, as applicable, and file with their federal income tax return, a statement setting forth facts
relating to the mergers. 

Accounting Treatment of the Transaction  

    We intend to account for the transaction under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations. 

Regulatory Matters  

    Antitrust Considerations.
  The mergers are subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, which prevents specified transactions from being completed until required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and
the Federal Trade Commission and specified waiting periods are terminated or expire. We have filed the required information and materials to notify the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission of the mergers. We may not complete the mergers until a thirty day waiting period after our filings expires. The government may extend the waiting period if it requests additional
information with respect to the mergers. We have also asked that the waiting period be terminated early, and the government may grant our request in its discretion. 

    The
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission may challenge the mergers on antitrust grounds, either before or after expiration of the waiting
period. Accordingly, at any time before or after the completion of the mergers, either the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission could take action under the
antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, or other persons could take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the mergers. Additionally, at any
time before or after the completion of the mergers, notwithstanding that the applicable waiting period expired or was terminated, any state could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems
necessary or desirable in the public interest. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the mergers will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail. 

Restrictions on Sales of Shares by Affiliates of NetZero and Juno  

    The shares of our common stock to be issued in connection with the mergers will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and will be freely transferable
under the Securities Act, except for shares of our common stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of either NetZero or Juno at the time of the special meetings. Persons who may
be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under the common control of either NetZero or Juno and may include executive officers, directors and
significant stockholders of NetZero 

and Juno. Affiliates may not sell their shares of our common stock acquired in connection with the mergers except pursuant to: 


an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of those shares; 

an
exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or 

any
other applicable exemption under the Securities Act. 

    Our
registration statement on Form S-4, of which this document forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of our common stock to be received by NetZero's,
Juno's or our affiliates in connection with the mergers. 

Nasdaq National Market Listing of United Online Common Stock to be Issued in the Mergers  

    We agreed in the merger agreement to use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of our common stock to be issued in connection with the
mergers to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of issuance, before the completion of the mergers. 

Appraisal Rights  

    Under Delaware law, so long as the NetZero common stock and the Juno common stock remain listed on the Nasdaq National Market on their respective record dates
and assuming that our common stock will be listed on the Nasdaq National Market, you are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the mergers. 

    If
the NetZero common stock does not remain listed on the Nasdaq National Market as of its record date, then holders of NetZero common stock will be entitled to appraisal rights under
Delaware law. Juno does not have to close the transaction if the holders of more than five percent of the NetZero common stock have exercised their appraisal rights. 

    If
NetZero stockholders become entitled to appraisal rights with respect to the mergers, Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporate Law will govern the exercise of such
appraisal rights. We have attached the full text of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporate Law as Annex D to this document for your review. The following summary of the provisions of
Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law is not intended to be a complete statement of its provisions and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of that law,
which we incorporate by reference: 

    If
the mergers are completed, and a holder of NetZero common stock (1) files written notice with NetZero of an intention to exercise rights to appraisal of shares prior to the
special meeting, (2) does not vote in favor of the transaction and (3) follows the procedures set forth in Section 262, the holder will be entitled to be paid by us the fair value
of the shares of NetZero common stock as to which appraisal rights have been perfected. The fair value of shares of NetZero common stock will be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive
of any element of value arising from the mergers. The shares of NetZero common stock with respect to which holders have perfected their appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 and have
not effectively withdrawn or lost their appraisal rights are referred to in this document as the "dissenting shares." 

    Appraisal
rights are available only to the record holder of shares. If you wish to exercise appraisal rights but have a beneficial interest in shares which are held of record by or in
the name of another person, such as a broker or nominee, you should act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 to perfect your appraisal rights. 

    A
demand for appraisal should be signed by or on behalf of the stockholder exactly as the stockholder's name appears on the stockholder's stock certificates. If the shares are owned
of record in a fiduciary capacity such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, the demand should be executed in that capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a
joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including one or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on
behalf of a record 

holder; however, in the demand the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that the agent is executing the demand as an agent or the record owner or owners. A record
holder such as a broker who holds shares as nominee for several beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights of the shares held for one or more beneficial owners and not exercise rights of the
shares held for other beneficial owners. In this case, the written demand should state the number of shares for which appraisal rights are being demanded. When no number of shares is stated, the
demand will be presumed to cover all shares of record by the broker or nominee. 

    If
you demand appraisal of your shares under Section 262 and you fail to perfect, or effectively withdraw or lose, your right to appraisal, your shares will be converted into a
right to receive a number
of shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. Dissenting shares lose their status as dissenting shares if: 


the
mergers are abandoned; 

the
dissenting stockholder fails to make a timely written demand for appraisal; 

the
dissenting shares are voted in favor of adoption of the merger agreement; 

neither
we nor the dissenting stockholder files a complaint or intervenes in a pending action within 120 days after the effective date of the
mergers; or 

the
dissenting stockholder delivers to us within 60 days of the effective date of the mergers, or thereafter with our approval, a written withdrawal
of the stockholder's demand for appraisal of the dissenting shares, although no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery may be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of
the court. 

    Failure
to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law for perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of your appraisal rights, in
which event a stockholder will be entitled to receive the consideration with respect to your dissenting shares in accordance with the merger agreement. In view of the complexity of the provisions of
Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, if you are considering objecting to the mergers should that option become available, you should consult your own legal advisor. 

    Within
ten days after the effective date of the mergers, we must mail a notice to all stockholders who have complied with (1) and (2) above notifying such stockholders
of the effective date of the mergers. Within 120 days after the effective date, holders of NetZero common stock may file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery for the appraisal of
their shares, although they may, within 60 days of the effective date, withdraw their demand for appraisal. Within 120 days of the effective date, the holders of dissenting shares may
also, upon written request, receive from us a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares with respect to which demands for appraisals have been received. 

Delisting and Deregistration of NetZero and Juno Common Stock after the Mergers  

    When the mergers are completed, NetZero common stock and Juno common stock will each be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

THE MERGER AGREEMENT    

    The following summary of the merger agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, which we incorporate by
reference and urge you to read carefully in its entirety. 

The Mergers  

    To accomplish the combination of NetZero's and Juno's businesses, we formed a new company, United Online, with two subsidiaries, NZ Acquisition Corp. and JO
Acquisition Corp. At the time the mergers are completed: 


NZ
Acquisition Corp. will be merged into NetZero, and NetZero will be the surviving corporation.


JO
Acquisition Corp. will be merged into Juno, and Juno will be the surviving corporation.


As
a result, NetZero and Juno will each become a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. 

Effective Time  

    Once all the conditions to the mergers contained in the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived, we will complete the mergers. The mergers will become
effective when each of the certificates of merger are filed with the Delaware Secretary of State. 

Conversion and Exchange of NetZero and Juno Stock  

    When the mergers are completed, NetZero common stockholders will receive 0.2000 of a share of our common stock for each share they own, and Juno common
stockholders will receive 0.3570 of a share of our common stock for each share they own. No fractional shares of our common stock will be issued in connection with the mergers. 

    When
the mergers are completed, our exchange agent will mail to you a letter of transmittal and instructions for surrendering your NetZero or Juno stock certificates in exchange for
statements indicating book-entry ownership of our common stock. If you make a special request, we will issue you stock certificates. When you deliver your stock certificates to the
exchange agent along with a properly executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, your stock certificates will be cancelled and you will receive statements indicating
book-entry ownership of our common stock, or, if requested, stock certificates representing the number of full shares of our common stock to which you are entitled under the merger
agreement. You will receive payment in cash, without interest, in lieu of any fractional shares of our common stock which would have been otherwise issuable to you as a result of the mergers. 

    You
should not submit your NetZero or Juno stock certificates for exchange until you receive the transmittal instructions and a form of letter of transmittal from the exchange agent. 

    You
are not entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on our common stock until the mergers are completed and you have surrendered your NetZero or Juno stock
certificates in exchange for certificates for shares of our common stock. 

    We
will only issue a stock certificate or a check in lieu of a fractional share in a name other than the name in which a surrendered NetZero or Juno stock certificate is registered if
you present the exchange agent with all documents required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership and show that you paid any applicable stock transfer taxes. 

Treatment of NetZero and Juno Stock Options and Other Rights  

    NetZero.
  We will assume each NetZero option. Thus, upon completion of the mergers, each outstanding NetZero stock
option will be converted into an option to purchase the number of shares of our common stock that is equal to the product of 0.2000 multiplied by the number of shares of NetZero common stock subject
to that option, rounded down to the nearest whole share. The exercise price per share will be equal to the exercise price per share of NetZero common stock subject to the option before the conversion
divided by 0.2000, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. In addition, each outstanding right to receive a restricted share of NetZero common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.2000
restricted shares of our common stock. Furthermore, we will assume the outstanding offering period under NetZero's employee stock purchase plan and the purchase rights under the plan will be converted
into rights to purchase shares of our common stock, with the number of shares rounded down to the nearest whole share and the purchase price rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The other terms of
the NetZero options and restricted shares referred to above will continue to apply. 

    Juno.
  Similarly we will assume each Juno option. Thus, upon completion of the mergers, each outstanding Juno stock
option will be converted into an option to purchase the number of shares of our common stock that is equal to the product of 0.3570 multiplied by the number of shares of Juno common stock subject to
that option, rounded down to the nearest whole share. The exercise price per share will be equal to the exercise price per share of Juno common stock subject to the option before the conversion
divided by 0.3570, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. In addition, we will assume the outstanding offering period under Juno's employee stock purchase plan and the purchase rights under the plan
shall be converted into rights to purchase shares of our common stock, with the number of shares rounded down to the nearest whole share and the purchase price rounded up to the nearest whole cent.
The other terms of the Juno options referred to above will continue to apply. 

    Registration.
  We will file a registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of our common stock
subject to each NetZero and Juno option and restricted shares and will maintain the effectiveness of that registration statement for as long as any of the options or restricted shares remain
outstanding.

    The

 Interim Conduct of Juno Pending the Mergers  

    Juno agreed that, during the period before completion of the mergers, except as expressly contemplated or permitted by the merger agreement, or to the extent
that the other party consents in writing, Juno and its subsidiaries will each carry on its respective business in the usual, regular and ordinary course, and substantially in the same manner as
previously conducted, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact its present line of business and its relationships with third parties. In addition to these agreements
regarding the conduct of business generally, Juno has agreed that, subject to specified exceptions, neither it nor its subsidiaries will: 


amend
its certificate of incorporation or bylaws;


issue,
sell, transfer, pledge, dispose or of encumber any shares of capital stock, any voting debt or other securities convertible into such securities,
other than the granting of options to employees consistent with past practices or shares pursuant to previous agreements;

or pay dividends;


split,
combine or reclassify any shares of its stock or redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of its stock;


modify
any of its material contracts or waive or assign any material rights or claims;


incur
any long term debt or, except in the ordinary course of business, incur or modify any short term indebtedness, or assume, guarantee, endorse or
otherwise become liable for the obligations of another, make any investments or capital contributions or enter into any material commitment or transaction, except as in the ordinary course of business
and consistent with past practice;


transfer,
lease, sell or otherwise dispose of any assets worth more than $25,000 individually or $250,000 combined, other than in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with past practice;


change
the compensation of, or make any loans to, its officers, directors, employees, agents or consultants, other than in the ordinary course of business
and consistent with past practice;


make
payments to any existing pension, retirement allowance of other employee benefit or adopt or amend any such plans, or make payments to any officer,
director employee or affiliate, for unused vacation days;


enter
into any material commitment or transaction;


cancel
any insurance policy over $500,000 of which it is a beneficiary if the policy is not otherwise terminating or being replaced;


revalue
any of its assets in any material respects; 


settle
or compromise any pending or threatened suit, action or claim relating to the mergers or involving more than $200,000 or material
non-monetary obligations, or the settlement of which would otherwise be material to Juno;


pay
or otherwise satisfy any claims, liabilities or obligations inconsistent with past practices of doing so and other than as contemplated in its
financial statements;


adopt
a plan of liquidation, dissolution, merger, consolidation, restructuring, recapitalization or other reorganization (other than the mergers
contemplated by the merger agreement);


unless
required by GAAP, change any accounting methods or make or change any material election or accounting method relating to taxes;


enter
into any transaction with affiliates;


take
actions that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the mergers not being satisfied, or a material delay in the
satisfaction of any of the conditions to the mergers; or


enter
into any agreement that would accomplish, recommend, propose or announce an intention to do any of the foregoing. 

 Interim Conduct of NetZero Pending the Mergers  

    NetZero agreed that, during the period before completion of the mergers, neither it nor its subsidiaries will: 


amend
its certificate of incorporation or bylaws;


declare
or pay dividends;


split,
combine or reclassify any shares of its stock or redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of its stock;


transfer,
lease, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets;


take
actions that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the mergers not being satisfied, or a material delay in the
satisfaction of any of the conditions to the mergers; or


enter
into any agreement that would accomplish, recommend, propose or announce an intention to do any of the foregoing. 

 No Solicitation of Alternate Transactions  

    The merger agreement contains detailed provisions prohibiting Juno from seeking an alternative transaction. Under these "no solicitation" provisions, Juno has
agreed that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries, officers and directors, will, directly or indirectly: 


solicit,
initiate, knowingly encourage or induce the making, submission or announcement of any takeover proposal with respect to Juno;


participate
in any discussions or negotiations with any person regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or take any other
action that would reasonably be expected to facilitate any inquiry or proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any takeover proposal with respect to Juno;


authorize,
approve or recommend any takeover proposal with respect to Juno; or 


enter
into any letter of intent or similar document accepting or providing for any takeover proposal with respect to Juno. 

    However,
the merger agreement does not prevent Juno, or its board of directors from: 


complying
with Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with regard to a tender or exchange offer not arising out of a violation of the
non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement; or


before
the adoption of the merger agreement by Juno's stockholders, from furnishing information regarding Juno or entering into negotiations or discussions
with, or entering into an agreement relating to a takeover proposal with, any person in response to a takeover proposal with respect to Juno made, submitted or announced (and not withdrawn) to the
extent that


the
takeover proposal is not attributable to a material breach of the merger agreement;


the
board of directors of Juno concludes in good faith, consistent with advice of outside legal counsel, that failure to take such actions would likely
constitute a breach of the fiduciary obligations of the board of directors of Juno to Juno's stockholders;


the
board of directors of Juno concludes, in good faith, consistent with the advice of Juno's financial advisor, that such Juno takeover proposal is
reasonably likely to lead to a superior takeover proposal;


prior
to furnishing any information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, the person making that proposal, Juno gives NetZero written
notice of the identity of the person making the proposal, the terms and conditions of the takeover proposal and Juno's intention to furnish information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations
with, the person making the takeover proposal;


Juno
receives from the person making the takeover proposal an executed confidentiality agreement which will not in any way restrict Juno from complying
with its disclosure obligations under the merger agreement and which will contain customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral information furnished to that person
by or on behalf of Juno and other terms no less favorable to Juno than those set forth in the confidentiality agreement between NetZero and Juno; and


contemporaneously
with furnishing any information to the person making the takeover proposal with respect to Juno, Juno furnishes the same information to
NetZero. 

    For
purposes of the merger agreement, a takeover proposal means any offer or proposal for a merger or other business combination involving Juno after which the stockholders of Juno
immediately prior to such merger or business combination would own less than 80% of the voting securities of the surviving corporation or the parent of the surviving corporation, or the acquisition of
20% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Juno, or the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of Juno. 

    Juno
has agreed that: 


it
will promptly keep NetZero informed of the status and terms of any proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations covered by the "no solicitation"
provisions of the merger agreement;


it
will immediately cease and terminate any activities, exchanges of information, discussions or negotiations existing as of June 7, 2001, the date
of the merger agreement, with any parties conducted before that date with respect to any acquisition proposal;


it
will inform its directors, officers, and financial, legal, accounting and other advisors retained or involved in the mergers of the obligations of the
"no solicitation" provisions of the merger agreement; and 


it
will request that each person who has executed such a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement in connection with the mergers return to
Juno or otherwise dispose of the confidential information. 

 Compliance with FTC Consent Agreement  

    Juno covenants and agrees to fully comply with all the terms of its consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission dated May 15, 2001. 

 Notification  

    Juno and NetZero each have agreed to give prompt notice to the other party of: 


the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event of which would reasonably be expected to cause any of its representations or warranties to be
untrue in any material respect; and


its
material failure to comply with or satisfy any of covenant, condition or agreement in the merger agreement. 

Additional Agreements  

    The merger agreement also provides for additional agreements and covenants which we urge you to read carefully. Specifically, the merger agreement provides
that the parties use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions and do all things necessary, proper and advisable under the merger agreement and applicable laws to complete the mergers as
soon as practicable after the date of the merger agreement. The merger agreement also contains covenants relating to the cooperation between NetZero and Juno in the preparation of this document and
additional agreements between them relating to, among other things, access to information, mutual notice of specified matters, public announcements, affiliate agreements and securities, tax and other
governmental regulations. 

    The
parties have further agreed to the following: 

 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance  

    We will indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors, officers and employees of NetZero and Juno, and
their subsidiaries, in all of their capacities, for acts or omissions occurring prior to the completion of the mergers: 


to
the same extent they were indemnified or had the right to advancement of expenses as of June 7, 2001, which is the date of the merger agreement,
pursuant to Juno's restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws and indemnification agreements with any directors, officers and employees of Juno and its subsidiaries; and


to
the fullest extent permitted by law, in each case for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the completion of the mergers. 

    We
will also maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance for six years following the completion of the mergers with coverage no less
advantageous than the current policies of NetZero and Juno, for a cost of up to $3,000,000. 

 Juno Benefit Matters  

    We will grant Juno's employees credit for service with Juno up to the time of the completion of the mergers for purposes of benefit plans, waive any
limitations on pre-existing conditions and apply expenses incurred before the completion of the mergers to applicable deductible, co-insurance and maximum
out-of-pocket provisions. 

 Severance Agreements  

    We will honor the severance arrangements between Juno and its executive officers and directors. For more information, see "Interests of Juno Directors and
Executive Officers in the Mergers." 

 Name  

    If, within 30 days of the date of the merger agreement, NetZero determines that it will not use the name "United Online, Inc." because it would
violate the rights of a third party or otherwise be inadvisable or impractical from a trademark law perspective, it will notify Juno and Juno and NetZero will engage in good faith discussions to
select an alternate name. 

    With
limited exceptions, within 90 days of the completion of the mergers, we, NetZero and Juno will stop using the name "NetZero" to advertise, promote or offer pay Internet
access services. 

 Juno 401(k) Plan  

    Immediately before the completion of the mergers, Juno will terminate its 401(k) plan. 

 Juno's Transfer of Shares of India Subsidiary  

    Before completion of the mergers, an affiliate of Juno will transfer all the shares of Juno Online Services Development Private Limited not owned by it to
NetZero. 

 Leases  

    Following the signing of the merger agreement, Juno will enter a sublease agreement with D. E. Shaw & Co., L.P. through March 31,
2003 for office space currently occupied by Juno at 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York. Juno currently occupies four floors at this location, totaling approximately
46,000 square feet in the aggregate, in this location. The sublease agreement will provide for rent payments at $52 per square foot, with 6-month termination rights by either party, and
termination payments ranging from $47,400 to $165,000 to be paid by Juno if it terminates its lease for particular floors on or prior to March 31, 2003.

Termination  

    The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the completion of the mergers, whether before or after the stockholder approvals have been
obtained: 


by
mutual written consent of NetZero and Juno;


by
either NetZero or Juno if:


the
mergers are not completed on or before November 30, 2001, except that this right to terminate the merger agreement will not be available to any
party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under the merger agreement has been the cause of, or has resulted in, the failure of the mergers to be completed such date;


any
governmental entity shall have:


issued
an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the mergers, and the order, decree,
ruling or other action becomes final and nonappealable; or


failed
to issue an order, decree or ruling or to take any other action, and the denial of a request to issue the order, decree, ruling or take any other
action becomes final and nonappealable, which action is necessary to complete the mergers, except that this right to terminate the merger agreement will not be available to any party whose failure to
comply with the provisions of the merger agreement relating to the use of commercially reasonable efforts to complete the mergers is the cause of such action or inaction; 


the
approval of either party's stockholders to adopt the merger agreement is not obtained;


the
other party materially breaches its obligations under the merger agreement because of a failure to call a special meeting of its stockholders to vote
on the adoption of the merger agreement or a failure to mail this document to its stockholders; or


the
other party breaches or fails to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in the merger agreement in
such a way as to render those conditions incapable of being satisfied on or before November 30, 2001. 


by
NetZero if Juno's board of directors fails to recommend that Juno's stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement or effects a
change in its recommendation of adoption of the merger agreement, whether or not permitted by the terms of the merger agreement, or if Juno's board
failed to call the stockholder meeting or failed to prepare and mail the proxy statements to the stockholders; or


by
Juno if Juno notifies NetZero that it intends to accept a superior proposal and NetZero does not timely respond with a more favorable proposal, and Juno
pays NetZero a termination fee. 

    Effect of Termination.
  If the merger agreement is terminated by either party, the merger agreement will become void and
NetZero and Juno will have no liability under the merger agreement, assuming no willful material breach of the merger agreement has occurred. However, if the merger agreement is terminated, the
following provisions will survive termination: the confidentiality agreement, the agreement to file the requisite press releases, the provisions of the merger agreement related to termination fees and
expenses and the general contract provisions. 

    Termination Fee and/or Payment of Expenses Upon Termination.
  The merger agreement requires each party to pay a
termination fee or expenses to the other party depending on the circumstances surrounding the termination. Specifically, if the agreement is terminated because: 


Juno's
board of directors failed to recommend that Juno's stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement or effected a change in its
recommendation of the adoption of the merger agreement, or Juno accepts a superior proposal, Juno must pay to NetZero a termination fee of $2,500,000 plus expenses up to $1,000,000 incurred by NetZero
and its subsidiaries with respect to the mergers.


Juno
failed to obtain the required vote at a stockholders meeting to approve the mergers, then within two business days of termination, Juno will pay to
NetZero expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement by NetZero and its subsidiaries up to $1,000,000. However, if prior to the termination any person communicated to Juno an alternate
proposal for a business combination and within nine months of the termination Juno entered into a definitive agreement for an alternate proposal, then Juno will pay NetZero the termination fee of
$2,500,000, less the expenses previously paid.


NetZero's
board of directors failed to obtain the required vote of its stockholders to approve the mergers, then NetZero will pay to Juno expenses incurred
by Juno, not to exceed $1,000,000. 

Expenses  

    Notwithstanding the provisions above regarding termination fees and expenses, whether or not the mergers are completed, all expenses and fees incurred in
connection with the merger agreement and the mergers will be paid by the party incurring the expenses or fees, except: 


if
the mergers are completed, the surviving corporation of each merger will pay any property or transfer taxes imposed in connection with the mergers; and


all
expenses and fees incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and registration statement will
be shared equally by Juno and NetZero. 

Amendment, Extension and Waiver  

    The merger agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any
time before or after the approval of the mergers by the stockholders of NetZero and Juno has been obtained. All amendments to the merger agreement must be in writing signed by each party. After the
agreement has been approved by the stockholders of the respective companies, no amendment which under applicable law requires further approval of the stockholders may be made without such further
approval. 

Our Organizational Documents and Management Team  

    We agreed to cause our certificate of incorporation and bylaws to be in the form described under the section "Description of United Online Capital Stock" at
the time the mergers are completed. NetZero, Juno and we agreed that NetZero's directors and officers would become our directors and executive officers when the mergers are completed. 

RELATED AGREEMENTS    

Voting Agreements  

    The following summary of the voting agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the voting agreements, forms of which are
exhibits to the registration statement we filed with the SEC. We urge you to carefully read the full text of the voting agreements. 

    In
connection with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, NetZero entered into a voting agreement with each of David E. Shaw, several entities affiliated with
Dr. Shaw, Charles E. Ardai, Harshan Bhangdia, Richard D. Buchband and Louis K. Salkind under which those Juno stockholders agreed to vote all the shares of Juno common stock with respect to
which they have voting power in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. As of the record date for the Juno special meeting, these stockholders owned shares of Juno common stock representing
approximately    % of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of Juno capital stock. 

    In
addition, Juno entered into a voting agreement with Qualcomm, entities affiliated with Clearstone Venture Management I, LLC, Draper Fisher Jurvetson Management Company
V LLC, Mark R. Goldston, Charles S. Hilliard, and Frederic A. Randall, Jr. under which those NetZero stockholders agreed to vote their shares of NetZero common stock in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement. As of the record date for the NetZero special meeting, these stockholders owned shares of NetZero common stock representing approximately    % of the
total voting power of the outstanding shares of NetZero capital stock. 

    The
voting agreements entered into between NetZero and the Juno stockholders prohibit the Juno stockholders, or their employees or affiliates, from soliciting or participating in
discussions or negotiations with another party with respect to an alternate transaction, with limited exceptions. 

    These
voting agreements terminate on the earliest of the (a) closing date of the mergers, (b) the termination of the merger agreement or (c) November 30,
2001. 

Agreement with David E. Shaw  

    David E. Shaw agreed, in his affiliate agreement with us, that he would not dispose of any shares of our common stock that he beneficially owns for a period of
ninety days following completion of the mergers. Dr. Shaw has also agreed that, for the period until one year from the date of the mergers, he would limit his public sale of shares of our
common stock that he beneficially owns, as required by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, to the extent he may be considered an "affiliate" of United Online, as defined under that Rule. Among
other limitations, Rule 144 imposes on affiliates volume limitations that permit no more than the greater of (i) one percent of our outstanding shares or (ii) our average weekly
trading volume for the preceding four weeks, to be sold in the public markets within any rolling
three-month period. Additionally, Dr. Shaw has agreed that, even if not considered an "affiliate," he would adhere to volume restrictions that would, for the period beginning three months after
the date of the mergers until one year from the date of the mergers, permit him aggregate sales into the public marketplace during that nine-month period in an amount no greater than the
aggregate amount that could have been sold publicly by an "affiliate" during such period under the volume restrictions of Rule 144 (notwithstanding any holding period requirement).

NETZERO'S MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements based on NetZero's current expectations, estimates and projections about
NetZero's operations, industry, financial condition and liquidity. Words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "believes," "may," "will" or similar expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are
forward-looking statements. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, NetZero's actual
results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. The section entitled "Risk Factors" set forth in this document
discusses some of the important risk factors that may affect NetZero's business, results of operations and financial condition. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any
forward-looking statements for any reason.

Overview  

    NetZero is a leading provider of Internet access services and online targeted marketing solutions. NetZero offer consumers free and pay access to the Internet,
free e-mail and customizable navigation tools that provide "speed dial" to key sites on the Internet. NetZero's services are currently available in more than 5,000 cities across the United
States and Canada. In addition to offering consumers access to the Internet, NetZero offers mass marketers targeting capabilities through numerous online advertising channels. NetZero also offers
advertisers and commerce partners a variety of additional services to build their brands and market their products, including referring its users to partners' Web sites, enabling customer
registrations and facilitating electronic commerce transactions. NetZero's CyberTarget division offers marketers and advertisers mass-scale, online market research and measurement
services. 

    NetZero
incorporated in July 1997 and launched its Internet access service in October 1998. During that period, it had no revenues and its operating activities related
primarily to the development of its proprietary zCast software. Since October 1998, it has focused on building its free Internet access business and the NetZero brand. 

    In
January 2001, NetZero began limiting its free Internet service to a maximum of 40 hours per household per calendar month. Households desiring to exceed the
40 hour limitation are currently offered the opportunity to sign up for an Extended Access Pass, a plan that provides households the option to pay a fee, currently set at $9.95, to allow them
access to the service for the remainder of the
calendar month. If these households elect not to pay a fee when they reach the 40 hour limit during a given month they will be denied access to service for the remainder of the month, but their
account will not be terminated and they can begin accessing the service for free at the beginning of the next month. 

    In
March 2001, NetZero launched a new service called NetZero Platinum. The NetZero Platinum service is intended to offer households Internet service for a monthly fee,
currently $9.95, that is in most respects the same as NetZero's standard free service except that the 40 hour limitation does not apply, the user accesses a modified start-page and
the service features a small toolbar without the advertising banners currently included in the ZeroPort on the free service. There can be no assurance that these new products and services will meet
with commercial success. 

    Through
March 31, 2001 approximately 8.6 million users registered for its Internet access services, of which approximately 3.9 million used the service in the
month of March. Approximately 75,000 of these users were subscribers of one of its pay Internet access services as of March 31, 2001. 

    In
December 1999, NetZero acquired AimTV, which has developed a patent-pending technology to run broadcast quality television commercials over narrowband Internet connections
resulting in the launch of NZTV in May 2000. In August 2000, NetZero acquired Simpli.com, which has developed 

proprietary technologies to enhance its banner targeting and personalization capabilities. In September 2000, it acquired RocketCash, which has developed a secure, flexible-currency-shopping
technology enabling consumers to make purchases on the Internet with or without a credit card. In November 2000, it acquired certain tangible and intangible assets of one of its competitors,
Freei, a free Internet access provider, for approximately $4.7 million. The assets acquired primarily included the domain names "Freeinternet.com," "Freeinet.com" and "Freei.net", certain
proprietary rights, certain fixed assets, and the rights to market the NetZero service to Freei users. All of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. During
the quarter ended March 31, 2001, NetZero determined that the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with these acquisitions was impaired. As a result, NetZero
recorded an impairment charge totaling $48.6 million. 

Revenues  

    NetZero generates revenues through advertising and commerce transactions, fees for its Internet access services, sales of CD's incorporating its Internet
access software, and through the sale or license of its data. Its advertising and commerce related revenues consist of fees from the placement of media, direct marketing agreements, referring its
users to partners' Web sites, enabling customer registrations for partners, and facilitating electronic commerce transactions. NetZero's fees for Internet access services
consist of monthly fees for users who elect to exceed the monthly limit on the number of free hours of Internet access NetZero offers and monthly subscription fees from its users who choose to receive
service without the banner advertising window in the ZeroPort. NetZero generates revenues from the license or sale of its data through its CyberTarget division by offering marketers, advertisers and
market research companies mass-scale, online market research and measurement services. NetZero has only recently begun offering several of its products and services, including CyberTarget
and fee-based Internet access services, and there is no assurance as to when, or if, these products or services will make a significant contribution to its revenue. 

    Advertising and Commerce Revenues.
  NetZero sells both targeted and non-targeted advertising on its service.
In general, it receives higher advertising rates for targeted advertisements and sponsorships than for non-targeted advertisements. However, NetZero has limited experience in selling and
managing these types of arrangements and there can be no assurance that it will successfully sell all of the various advertising services it offers or intends to offer or that such arrangements will
generate significant revenues or higher advertising rates. To date, NetZero has sold targeted advertising based upon Web sites visited, key word searches, and users' demographic and geographic
information. In addition, the growth in NetZero's user base has resulted, and may result in the future, in situations where advertising inventory capacity has increased faster than its ability to sell
such inventory at desired rates. NetZero has in the past relied, and intends to rely in the future, on third parties to sell a portion of its banner advertisements, although NetZero does not believe
any third party sales relationships are material to its business. The failure of NetZero to sell inventory at reasonable rates may materially and adversely affect operating results. In addition,
success with performance-based fee arrangements may depend on NetZero's ability to effectively target users. NetZero is still in the early stages of that process and may encounter technical and other
limitations on its ability to successfully target users, including limitations associated with privacy concerns. There can be no assurance that it will adequately perform under these arrangements or
that it will be able to replace such arrangements on comparable terms, if at all. The failure to generate significant relationships with advertisers or the failure to replace significant contracts
when they expire could adversely affect NetZero's revenues, results of operations and financial position. 

    Banner
advertising and sponsorship revenues are recognized in the periods in which the advertisement or sponsorship placement is displayed, based upon the lesser of impressions
delivered over the total number of guaranteed impressions or ratably over the period in which the advertisement is displayed, provided that no significant obligations on its part remain, fees are
fixed and determinable, 

and collection of the related receivable is probable. NetZero's obligations typically include the guarantee of a minimum number of impressions or the satisfaction of other performance criteria. A
guaranteed minimum number of impressions are generally required to be delivered over the term of the commitment. Revenues from performance-based arrangements, including click-throughs, are recognized
as the related performance criteria are met. Referral revenues are recognized in the periods in which the referrals are made to advertisers' or sponsors' Web sites, provided that no significant
obligations on NetZero's part remain, fees are fixed and determinable, and collection of the related receivable is probable. 

    NetZero
generally invoices customers at the end of its performance, such as at the completion of an advertising campaign or service sponsorship. In addition, certain customers are
invoiced for sponsorships and other commitments on a quarterly basis. Recently there has been a reduction in the growth of online advertising and currently a number of its customers hold back a
significant amount of their advertising dollars spent with NetZero until the last month of a quarter. Such practices may result in extended average days sales outstanding at the end of a fiscal
quarter. 

    NetZero's
advertising revenues are subject to the effects of seasonality. Advertisers typically purchase impressions on a forward basis. If purchasing patterns or timing of purchasing
by advertisers were to change, its financial position and results of operations could be materially affected. 

    Advertising
on the Internet, particularly the products and services NetZero offers, is a relatively new and changing industry, and there is no assurance that the products and services
NetZero offers now, or in the future, will meet with commercial acceptance. Internet advertising rates have been declining rapidly, and it is possible that rates will continue to decline in the
future. Many of the purchasers of Internet advertising have been companies with Internet-based business models. Certain of these companies have come under financial pressure and have not been able to
access the capital markets to fund their operations. This trend has impacted NetZero's ability to generate revenues and could continue to do so in the future. This trend could also result in increased
allowances for doubtful accounts. 

    Due
to market forces and other factors, NetZero's revenues and results of operations may fluctuate from period to period. NetZero has experienced several consecutive quarters of
decreased revenues and there can be no assurance that NetZero will not experience decreased revenues in sequential quarters in future periods. 

    NetZero
does not currently anticipate that inflation will have a material impact on its results of operations. 

    NetZero
has entered into barter transactions on an extremely limited basis and, for the periods presented, barter revenue accounts for less than 1% of its total net revenue. 

    Billable Services Revenue.
  During the quarter ended March 31, 2001, NetZero began limiting its free Internet
access to 40 hours per month per household and offering its users who reach their limit the Extended Access Pass for $9.95, which currently provides unlimited Internet access for the remainder
of the month. This is designed to either reduce telecommunications expense associated with heavy users or, alternatively, generate additional revenues to mitigate such expense. In addition, in
March 2001 NetZero began offering the NetZero Platinum service at a standard rate of $9.95 per month, which provides users with unlimited Internet access each month and features a thin toolbar
without the advertising banners currently included in the ZeroPort on its free service. NetZero has a very limited history with usage limitations and pay services. While experience has demonstrated
that limiting hours reduces its telecommunication costs, NetZero also believes that it adversely impacts its ability to
maintain or increase its free user base. NetZero may impose additional limitations on its free usage in the future, which it believes may have additional adverse impacts on its ability to maintain or
increase its free user base. Decreases in NetZero's free user base and in the number of hours users are 

permitted to access its free service result in a reduction of its volume of advertising inventory, which may adversely affect its advertising revenues. 

    Billable
services revenues are recognized in the period in which the fees are fixed and determinable and the related products or services are provided to the user. Billable services
revenue primarily consists of subscription fees that NetZero receives from users of its fee-based access services. NetZero generally requires that its subscribers pre-pay for
their services, which results in the deferral of certain revenues into the period in which the access services are provided. Billable services also consists of fees charged to prospective users for
producing, shipping and handling copies of the NetZero software on CD's. NetZero has a very limited history with respect to its various billable services and there can be no assurances that it will be
able to generate significant revenues from these services. NetZero's standard pricing plan is currently $9.95 per month, or $49.95 for six months, although NetZero currently offers its billable
services under a standard number of different pricing plans, and occasionally offers discounted promotional pricing plans or modified plans in conjunction with third parties. NetZero continually
evaluates the desirability and effectiveness of its plans, and may in the future make changes to its pricing plans or offer different discounted promotions. Future changes in NetZero's plans and
promotional discounts may adversely impact the number of billable service subscriptions and the amount of revenues it receives for such subscriptions. 

Cost of Revenues  

    Cost of revenues consists of telecommunications costs, depreciation of network equipment, credit card processing fees, occupancy costs, costs of producing,
shipping and handling CD's and personnel and related expenses of the network department. NetZero has expended significant funds on its network infrastructure, and, while it will expend additional
funds on capital expenditures in the future, NetZero currently anticipates that capital expenditures will decrease from historical levels. Capital expenditures may fluctuate based on the number of
users, user growth and usage patterns, as well as needs associated with acquired businesses and new products. Telecommunications costs for network access are expensed as incurred. NetZero's failure to
accurately forecast users' needs could result in significant over-capacity, which would adversely impact its results of operations. Due to limitations NetZero has imposed on the number of
hours users may access its free service, NetZero may have significant over-capacity in future periods. Conversely, under-forecasting usage could adversely impact the ability of users to
receive adequate service and adversely impact its reputation and its ability to maintain or increase its user base. NetZero has limited history in forecasting its user requirements, and there can be
no assurance that it will be able to accurately forecast such requirements in the future. 

Operating Expenses  

    Sales and Marketing.
  Sales and marketing expenses include advertising and promotion expenses, salaries, sales
commissions, employee benefits, travel and related expenses for its in-house sales force, fees paid to third-party advertising sales agents and sales support functions. In the past,
NetZero has expended significant amounts on sales and marketing, including a national branding campaign comprised of television, radio, print and outdoor advertising, sponsorships and a variety of
other promotions and, due to the timing of these promotions, amounts expended have varied significantly from period to period. NetZero has in place significant marketing obligations, certain of which
expire in June 2001. While NetZero intends to significantly reduce its marketing expenses following such date, it has little experience marketing pay services and there can be no assurance
NetZero will be able to decrease its marketing expenses as currently anticipated. Marketing costs associated with increasing brand awareness and user base are expensed in the period incurred. 

    Product Development.
  Product development costs include expenses for the development of new or improved technologies and
products, including salaries and related expenses for the software engineering department, as well as costs for contracted services, facilities and equipment. NetZero is currently evaluating its
product development programs and may reduce its expenses in the near term. 

However there can be no assurance NetZero will be able to decrease its product development expenses as currently anticipated. 

    General and Administrative.
  General and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits and expenses for
executive, finance, legal, human resources and internal customer support personnel. In addition, general and administrative expenses include fees for professional services, third-party customer
support, bad debt expense, and occupancy costs. 

    Amortization of Intangible Assets.
  Amortization of intangible assets includes amortization of goodwill, purchased
technologies and other identifiable intangible assets associated with NetZero's various acquisitions. During the quarter ended March 31, 2001, NetZero determined that the carrying value of
goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with several acquisitions was impaired. Indications of impairment included the deterioration in the business climate for Internet advertising and
other Web-related companies, reduced levels of venture capital funding activity for Internet-based consumer businesses, which historically have represented a significant portion of its
revenues, significant declines in the market value of NetZero and its competitors in the Internet advertising industry for a significant period of time, recent changes in its 2001 operating cash flow
forecasts and long-term strategies and changes in its strategic plans for certain of its acquired businesses. An impairment charge totaling $48.6 million was recorded during the
quarter ended March 31, 2001, reflecting the amount by
which the carrying amount of the assets exceeded their respective fair values. The impairment charge consisted of $33.5 million for goodwill and $15.1 million for other acquired
intangible assets. No impairment charge was recorded during fiscal 2000. 

    As
of March 31, 2001, NetZero had approximately $1.5 million in remaining intangible assets on its balance sheet, primarily related to costs incurred to acquire and
develop patents and trademarks. Decreases in the fair value of these assets, or assets acquired as a result of future acquisitions, could result in its recording impairment losses with respect to some
or all such assets. Any such loss could adversely and materially impact its results of operations and financial position. 

Stock-Based Charges  

    In connection with the grant of stock options and restricted stock to employees, the imposition of restrictions on shares of stock held by founders, the
issuance of restricted shares of stock in connection with the recent acquisitions and the issuance of warrants in connection with various marketing programs, NetZero recorded deferred stock-based
charges, which are being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable shares.

Nine Months Ended March 31, 2001 Compared to the Nine Months Ended March 31, 2000    

Revenues  

    Advertising and Commerce.
  Advertising and commerce revenues for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 were
$42.8 million, which represented an increase of $6.4 million, or 18%, from $36.4 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2000. The increase was primarily attributable
to increases in ZeroPort advertising revenues generated from various agreements, including General Motors, LookSmart and Cisco, partially offset by a reduction in revenues from the agreement with
AdSmart, which ended in February 2000. 

    Billable Services.
  Billable services revenues for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 were $2.4 million,
which represented an increase of $2.0 million from $0.4 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2000. The increase in revenues was due primarily to the launch of the NetZero
Platinum and the Extended Access Pass pay Internet service plans during the quarter ended March 31, 2001. 

Cost of Revenues  

    Cost of revenues for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 was $64.0 million, which represented an increase of $18.0 million, or 39%, from
$46.0 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to increased telecommunications usage related to the growth in the NetZero user base and
increased depreciation related to its internal network costs, partially offset by a reduction in telecommunications cost per user hour. During the nine months ended March 31, 2001, NetZero's
cost of telecommunications services purchased averaged less than $0.15 per user hour. 

Operating Expenses  

    Sales and Marketing.
  Sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 were
$43.7 million, which represented an increase of $8.9 million, or 25%, from $34.8 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2000. The increase was primarily due to an
increase in media advertising and promotion expense by NetZero and RocketCash, increased stock based charges and increased sales and marketing personnel related costs as a result of management's focus
on developing an in-house sales force. Sales and marketing included $4.1 million of stock based charges for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 compared to
$1.3 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2000. Stock based charges increased primarily as a result of the issuance of warrants in connection with a RocketCash marketing
promotion. 

    Product Development.
  Product development expenses for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 were
$20.4 million, which represented an increase of $16.4 million, or 405%, from $4.0 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2000. The increase was primarily due to
increased depreciation related to equipment used in product development and testing, increased stock-based charges, and the hiring of additional personnel directly by NetZero and in connection with
the acquisitions of Simpli.com and RocketCash. Product development expenses included $5.1 million of stock-based charges for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 compared to
$0.2 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2000. Stock-based charges associated with product development increased primarily as a result of restricted shares issued in connection
with the acquisition of Simpli.com. 

    General and Administrative.
  General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 were
$23.8 million, which represented an increase of $6.8 million, or 40%, from $17.0 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2000. The increase was primarily due to the
hiring of additional
administrative personnel, increased stock-based charges and increased occupancy costs. General and administrative expenses included $6.3 million of stock-based charges for the nine months ended
March 31, 2001 compared to $2.9 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2000. Stock-based charges associated with general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a
result of 

restricted stock awards to employees and the issuance of restricted stock in connection with its recent acquisitions. 

    Amortization of Intangible Assets.
  Amortization of intangible assets for the nine months ended March 31, 2001
was $16.7 million compared to $3.2 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2000. The increase was primarily the result of the acquisitions of Simpli.com in August 2000,
RocketCash in September 2000, and certain assets of Freei in November 2000. 

    Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
  During the quarter ended March 31, 2001, NetZero determined that
the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with several acquisitions was impaired. An impairment charge totaling $48.6 million was recorded during the quarter
ended March 31, 2001, reflecting the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeded their respective fair values. The impairment charge consisted of $33.5 million for
goodwill and $15.1 million for other acquired intangible assets. No impairment charge was recorded during fiscal 2000. 

Interest Income and Interest Expense  

    NetZero's interest income consists of earnings on its cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Interest expense
consists primarily of interest expense on capital leases and notes payable. Net interest income for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 was $8.4 million, which represented an increase of
$4.6 million from $3.8 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2000. The increase was primarily due to higher average cash and short-term investment balances,
partially offset by an increase in interest expense on capital leases and notes payable. 

Income Taxes  

    As a result of operating losses and its inability to recognize a benefit from its deferred tax assets, NetZero has not recorded a benefit for income taxes for
the nine months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000. 

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2000 Compared to The Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1999    

Revenues  

    Revenues for the year ended June 30, 2000 were $55.5 million, which represented an increase of $50.9 million, or 1,098%, from
$4.6 million for the year ended June 30, 1999. The increase was primarily attributable to increased revenue from sales of targeted and non-targeted banner advertisements
primarily through its in-house sales force and third parties, growth in the amount of start page revenue from NetZero's agreement with LookSmart as a result of the increased number of
users, and increased sponsorships on The ZeroPort. Approximately $15.7 million and $1.3 million, or 28% and 28%, of its total revenues for the years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999,
respectively, were generated from its agreement with LookSmart. NetZero does not anticipate that the rate of growth that it experienced in fiscal 2000 will continue and its revenues may fluctuate from
quarter to quarter. 

Cost of Revenues  

    Cost of revenues for the year ended June 30, 2000 was $63.9 million, which represented an increase of $51.4 million, or 411%, from
$12.5 million for the year ended June 30, 1999. The increase was primarily attributable to increased telecommunications expense related to the growth in its user base and an increase in
the costs of its network department and depreciation of network equipment. During the year ended June 30, 2000, the cost of telecommunications services purchased averaged less than $0.25 per
user hour. 

Operating Expenses  

    Sales and Marketing.
  Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended June 30, 2000 were $51.4 million,
which represented an increase of $49.7 million, or 2,945%, from $1.7 million for the year 

ended June 30, 1999. The increase was primarily due to increased levels of advertising and other marketing expenses associated with the initial major nationwide consumer branding campaign
(including the start of its exclusive sponsorship of the half-time show of televised National Basketball Association games on NBC), an increase in personnel costs related to the hiring of
additional sales force and marketing personnel and an increase in stock-based charges related to a warrant issued for marketing services. 

    Product Development.
  Product development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2000 were $10.0 million,
which represented an increase of $9.0 million, or 884%, from $1.0 million for the year ended June 30, 1999. The increase was primarily due to the hiring of additional software
engineers and increases in professional and consulting expenses and equipment maintenance costs. 

    General and Administrative.
  General and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2000 were
$22.8 million, which represented an increase of $17.9 million, or 369%, from $4.9 million for the year ended June 30, 1999. The increase was primarily due to the hiring of
additional administrative personnel, increased customer support services, an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts, increased professional and consulting expenses and an increase in
non-income taxes and licenses, and an increase in stock-based charges due to stock option grants and restrictions placed on founders' shares. 

    Amortization of Intangible Assets.
  Amortization of intangible assets amounted to $5.5 million for the year ended
June 30, 2000 as a result of its acquisition of AimTV in December 1999. The intangible assets acquired are being amortized over a period of two to three years. 

Interest Income and Interest Expense  

    Interest income consists of earnings on its cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Interest expense consists
primarily of interest expense on capital leases and notes payable. Net interest income for the year ended June 30, 2000 was $6.8 million, which represented an increase of
$6.7 million from net interest income of $0.1 million for the year ended June 30, 1999. The increase was primarily due to income earned on cash balances from the proceeds of its
initial public offering and the investment by Qualcomm, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on capital leases and notes payable. 

Income Taxes  

    As a result of operating losses and the inability to recognize a benefit for its deferred tax assets, no income tax provision has been recorded for years ended
June 30, 2000 or June 30, 1999. 

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1999 Compared to the period from July 21, 1997 (inception) Through June 30, 1998  

    NetZero began business operations in October 1998, and as a result, operating results for the period from July 21, 1997 (inception) through
June 30, 1998 included no revenues, no cost of revenues, and no expenses other than $25,000 of general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the results for this period are not meaningful
or material in comparison to the operating results for the year ended June 30, 1999. 

Revenues  

    Revenues for the year ended June 30, 1999 were $4.6 million, compared to no revenue for the period from July 21, 1997 (inception) through
June 30, 1998. The increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated from banner advertisements and revenues generated from NetZero's start page agreement with LookSmart, as well as
increased sales of banner advertisements, primarily through a third party sales force. In particular, NetZero generated approximately $1.3 million, or 28% of its total revenues for the year
ended June 30, 1999, from its agreement with LookSmart, which NetZero 

entered into in April 1999. NetZero also generated approximately $1.2 million, or 26% of its total revenues for the year ended June 30, 1999, from banner advertisements sold
through AdSmart. 

Cost of Revenues  

    Cost of revenues for the year ended June 30, 1999 were $12.4 million, compared to no cost of revenues for the period from July 21, 1997 in
(inception) through June 30, 1998. The increase was primarily attributable to increased telecommunication expense related to the growth in NetZero's user base and depreciation related to its
network costs. 

Operation Expenses  

    Sales and Marketing.
  Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended June 30, 1999 were $1.7 million,
compared to no sales and marketing expenses for the period from July 21, 1997 (inception) through June 30, 1998. The increase was primarily due to the hiring of additional direct sales
force personnel. 

    Product Development.
  Product development expenses for the year ended June 30, 1999 were $1.0 million,
compared to no product development expense for the period from July 21, 1997 (inception) through June 30, 1998. The increase was primarily due to the hiring of additional software
engineers. 

    General and Administrative.
  General and administrative expense for the year ended June 30, 1999 increased to
$3.7 million from $25,000 for the period from July 21, 1997 (inception) through June 30, 1998. The increase was primarily due to the hiring of additional management and
administrative personnel, increased professional and consulting expense and an increase in stock-based charges due to stock option grants and restrictions placed on founders' shares. The $25,000 of
general and administrative expense for the period from July 21, 1997 through June 30, 1998 primarily represented employee salaries. 

Interest Income and Interest Expense  

    Interest income is comprised primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense is comprised primarily of interest expense on
capital equipment leases. Interest income, net, for the year ended June 30, 1999, was $115,000, compared to no interest income or expense for the period from July 21, 1997 (inception)
through June 30, 1998. The increase was primarily due to interest earned on the proceeds from the Series C and Series D preferred stock financings. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

    From inception of the business to March 31, 2001, NetZero's operations have been financed primarily through the sale of equity securities, cash
generated from sales of its products and services and, to a lesser extent, equipment lease financing. At March 31, 2001, it had approximately $150.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments and approximately $12.4 million in restricted cash. 

    For
the nine months ended March 31, 2001, net cash used for operating activities was $68.4 million consisting primarily of operating losses and increases in restricted
cash and other assets, partially offset by an impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets, depreciation and amortization, stock-based charges, decreases in accounts receivable and increases
in accounts payable and deferred revenue. For the nine months ended March 31, 2000 net cash used for operating activities was $61.4 million and consisted of operating losses, deposits to
guarantee future obligations and increases in accounts receivable and other assets, partially offset by depreciation, amortization, stock-based charges and an increase in accounts payable and accrued
expenses. 

    For the nine months ended March 31, 2001, net cash used for investing activities was $58.1 million of which $45.1 million represented the net increase in
short-term investments and the balance was for acquisitions and capital expenditures. In the nine months ended March 31, 2000, cash used for investing activities of
$20.1 million consisted of capital expenditures of $12.6 million and $7.5 million for the purchase of short-term investments. 

    Net
cash used for financing activities was $6.3 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 and was primarily for payments on capital lease and notes payable
obligations. In the nine months ended March 31, 2000 cash provided from financing activities was $176.0 million and was principally attributable to the proceeds from NetZero's initial
public offering. 

    NetZero's
business model of offering free Internet access is predicated on receiving revenues for advertisements. However, declines in Internet advertising rates have resulted in
declining revenues and increasing gross losses over the last three sequential quarters. NetZero has limited visibility as to when, or if, online advertising rates will stabilize or increase, and they
may continue to decrease. NetZero has taken steps to address its declining revenues and increasing gross loss by introducing, in the March 2001 quarter, billable services and restrictions on
the number of free hours per household per month. In addition, it intends to implement limitations on its operating expenses, particularly with regards to its marketing expenses. NetZero has
substantially built out its network infrastructure and, in the near term, does not foresee the need for the same level of capital expenditures it has experienced in the past. In order to succeed
NetZero must increase its revenues while controlling its telecommunications costs, its operating expenses and its capital expenditures. Many factors will impact its ability to grow revenues including,
but not limited to, the number of users who sign up for the new pay services, the growth or reduction in its user base, the Internet advertising market and NetZero's ability to sell its existing
products and develop new revenue generating products. Billable services are new products for NetZero and NetZero cannot assure you that its existing users or new users will sign up for these plans. In
addition, as a result of limiting the number of free hours per month, NetZero may lose a significant number of users. There can be no assurance that it will be able to effectively manage its business
to decrease its losses. 

    NetZero
has invested significantly in its network infrastructure, software licenses, furniture, fixtures and equipment and it may need to make further investments in the future
although, at this time, its does not foresee the need for the same level of expenditures which it has experienced since its initial public offering. The actual amount of capital expenditures will
depend on the rate of growth or reduction in its user base, which is difficult to predict and could change dramatically over time. Technological advances may also require it to make capital
expenditures to develop or acquire new equipment or technology. NetZero intends to use cash to fund its future operating losses and a combination of cash and lease financing to fund its capital
expenditures in a manner which minimizes its cost of capital. However, NetZero cannot assure you that lease financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all, and if it is not available, it
would be required to use a greater portion of cash to fund its capital expenditures. 

    NetZero
currently anticipates that its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund its operating activities, capital expenditures
and other obligations for at least the next 12 months. However, NetZero may need to raise additional capital for a variety of reasons including, without limitation, in order to fund its
operations, expand its marketing activities, develop new or enhance existing services or products to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary services, businesses or technologies.
If, in the future, NetZero is not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations, it may need to raise additional capital through public or private financings, strategic relationships
or other arrangements. This additional funding, if needed, might not be available to NetZero on acceptable terms, or at all. NetZero's failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could have a
material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage of stock owned by the
then-current stockholders would be reduced. Furthermore, such 

equity securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to holders of NetZero common stock. 

    NetZero
has received a notice from the Nasdaq National Market that its common stock has failed to maintain the required minimum bid price of $1.00 over a period of 30 consecutive
trading days. As a result, NetZero has 90 calendar days, or until June 25, 2001, to regain compliance with this requirement. At the end of such time period, NetZero has 7 days in which
to request an appeal with respect to the delisting notice and it will be granted an appeal within 45 days of such request. If unable to regain compliance with this requirement during this time
period, and any appeal to the Nasdaq National Market for relief from this requirement is unsuccessful, the securities will be delisted from trading by the Nasdaq National Market. If NetZero common
stock were delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, the ability of any potential or future investors to achieve liquidity from its common stock would be severely limited and such delisting will
inhibit, if not preclude, NetZero's ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, if at all. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

    In June 1998, The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133 "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." The statement requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments
at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the planned use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Because NetZero does not currently hold any
derivative instruments and does not engage in hedging activities, the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 133 did not have a material impact on financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. NetZero was required to implement SFAS No. 133 in the first quarter of fiscal 2001. 

    In
December 1999, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101, "Revenue Recognition," which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of
revenue in financial statements filed with the SEC. SAB 101 outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition
policies. In June 2000, the SEC issued SAB 101B, which requires implementation of SAB 101 by NetZero no later than June 30, 2001. The SEC issued additional guidance in the form of its
Frequently Asked Questions and Answers document in October 2000. NetZero believes that the adoption of SAB 101 will not have a material impact on NetZero's financial position and results of
operations. 

    In
March 2000, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 44, "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation." FIN 44 provides guidance for issues
arising in applying APB 25. FIN 44 applies specifically to new awards, exchanges of awards in a business combination, modification to outstanding awards and changes in grantee status that occur on or
after July 1, 2000, except for the provisions related to repricings and the definition of an employee which apply to awards issued after December 15, 1998. The application of FIN 44 has
not had a material impact on NetZero's financial reporting. 

Future results of operations may vary due to certain factors  

    NetZero's operating results may fluctuate substantially in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of its control, including
those discussed elsewhere in this document. While NetZero currently intends to limit operating expenses, it may increase operating expenses and capital expenditures for a variety of reasons including,
without limitation, the growth in its user base, the expansion of its sales and marketing efforts, the promotion of the NetZero brand, the enhancement of the features and functionality of its
services, the development of new services and products, the integration of acquired companies, the upgrading of the internal network infrastructure, pursuit of new distribution channels and the hiring
of new personnel. Expenditures in each of these categories may vary significantly from period to period. While some expenses are fixed in the short-term, total 

operating expenses are principally determined on the basis of anticipated revenues. There are risks associated with the timing and achievement of revenue targets due to a variety of factors, and there
can be no assurance that revenues will increase commensurately with expenses. NetZero believes that expenses will significantly exceed revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result of these and
other factors, operating results may vary substantially from quarter to quarter. 

    In
addition, seasonal trends could affect revenues generated. To the extent that revenues depend on the amount of usage by users, any seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage could
affect revenues during such periods of fluctuation. NetZero anticipates that the summer and year-end vacation and holiday periods will impact user traffic levels. Moreover, the rate at
which new users sign up for NetZero service may be related to gifts or purchases of personal computers, which typically increase during the fourth
calendar quarter because of the holiday season and may decline during other periods. As a result, new user registration may be subject to seasonality. However, because NetZero's operating history is
limited, it is difficult to accurately predict these trends and plan accordingly. Since operating expenses are based on expectations of future revenues, it is possible that seasonal fluctuations could
materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. 

    In
addition to seasonality, there are several other factors that may cause the quarter-to-quarter revenues to fluctuate significantly, including changes in
advertising rates, fluctuations in user count, termination of material contracts, such as the LookSmart agreement, and the effect of short-term contracts which provide significant revenues
in one quarter, but do not provide significant revenues in subsequent quarters. These and other factors may cause significant fluctuations in its quarter-over-quarter revenues. 

    NetZero
has previously experienced reductions in revenues from material customers and may experience additional reductions in the future. For the three and nine months ended
March 31, 2001 LookSmart accounted for 14% and 25% of its revenues, respectively. The agreement with LookSmart was terminated on January 19, 2001. LookSmart provided search functionality
on its start page and on the ZeroPort, and was provided with the right to advertise third party services on NetZero's start page. After the termination of the LookSmart agreement, NetZero experienced
a significant decline in revenues derived from search functionality on its start page and its does not anticipate generating the amount of revenue from the start page that it historically experienced.
In addition, NetZero derived approximately 20% and 11% of its revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 from its agreements with General Motors Corporation and Cisco Systems, Inc.,
respectively. While NetZero has a long-term relationship with General Motors, they were recently provided reductions in their advertising obligations. While NetZero does not currently
anticipate such reductions will be material to its business, it can give no assurance that it will continue to derive the amount of anticipated revenues from General Motors. In addition, NetZero's
agreement with Cisco is terminable by Cisco commencing on June 30, 2001, and NetZero can give no assurance that it will continue to generate significant revenues from Cisco beyond such date.
The termination or renegotiation of significant agreements, as well as the timing of orders under such agreements, may cause significant fluctuations in the quarterly results. NetZero's business,
results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected if it is unable either to maintain or renew its significant agreements or to replace such agreements with
similar agreements with new customers. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk  

    NetZero currently does not hold any derivative instruments and does not engage in hedging activities. Also, NetZero is not currently party to any transactions
denominated in a foreign currency. Thus, NetZero's exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations is minimal.

JUNO'S MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of Juno should be read in conjunction with the condensed
consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this document as well as its audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. This discussion
contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Juno's actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of
various factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under "Risk Factors" elsewhere in this document.

Overview  

    Juno is a leading provider of Internet access to millions of computer users throughout the United States. Juno offers several levels of service, including free
basic Internet access, billable premium dial-up service, and high-speed broadband access, which is currently provided on a limited scale in selected markets. Juno's revenues
are derived primarily from the subscription fees it charges for the use of its premium Web access services, and to a lesser extent from the sale of advertising and from various forms of electronic
commerce. 

    Juno
launched its basic service in April 1996. Initially, this service provided only basic dial-up e-mail services. In July 1998, Juno introduced
its first premium services, which offered features ranging from enhanced e-mail services to full access to the World Wide Web, and for which it charged subscription fees. In 1999 and 2000,
Juno announced a number of major expansions of its services: 


Juno's

basic service
 now provides full Internet access for free in addition to e-mail.


Juno Web
 provides competitively priced premium Internet access, supplementing the features of the basic
service with free live technical support and customer service, priority access to Juno's network, and the reduction of some forms of on-screen advertising.


Juno Express
SM
 is a broadband service designed to provide high-speed access to
the Internet through a variety of technologies, including wireless, cable and digital subscriber line, commonly known as DSL. Juno Express is currently provided on an experimental basis in selected
markets around the country. 

    In
December 1999, in connection with the expansion of Juno's free basic service to include full Web access, Juno upgraded all subscribers using its enhanced e-mail
service, Juno Gold, to Juno Web at no additional cost. 

    In
the month of March 2001, Juno's base of active subscribers increased to 4.1 million, up from 4.0 million in December 2000. Juno's billable subscriber
base grew to 910,000 at March 31, 2001, up from 842,000 at December 31, 2000. Total registered subscriber accounts grew to 15.9 million at March 31, 2001, up from
14.2 million at December 31, 2000. Juno's base of active subscribers encompasses all registered subscriber accounts that connected at least once during the month, together with all
subscribers to a billable service, in each case regardless of the type of activity or activities engaged in by such subscribers. See "Selected Subscriber Data." 

    The
net increase of 68,000 billable subscribers during the first quarter of 2001 was largely attributable to migrations from Juno's free basic service to its billable premium
services. Toward the end of 2000, Juno began implementing measures designed to encourage heavier users of the free service to modify their usage patterns or upgrade to a billable service. While these
measures are believed to have caused a certain amount of subscriber attrition from the free service and are likely to contribute to a projected decline in the active subscriber count over the coming
quarters, Juno believes the measures are also responsible in part for the increase in migrations to its billable services that Juno 

experienced at the end of the fourth quarter of 2000 and the start of the first quarter of 2001. Juno does not expect the growth it experienced in December 2000 and the beginning of the first
quarter of 2001 to continue in the current quarter or in subsequent quarters. 

    Juno
classifies its revenues as follows: 


Billable
services revenues, consisting of:


subscription
fees that it receives from subscribers to its premium services;


technical
support fees received when subscribers to its free basic service and those subscribers to Juno Web who are subscribed at selected discounted
price points call a 900 number for live assistance from a support technician, as well as fees for other billable services; and


fees
charged, at various times, for shipping and handling associated with mailing copies of the Juno software upon request to prospective Juno subscribers,
and for short-term consulting engagements. 


Advertising
and transaction fees, consisting of revenues earned from advertisers and strategic marketing partners for displaying advertisements to, and
facilitating electronic commerce with, Juno's subscribers. These advertisements are displayed within the main Juno software while a Juno subscriber reads or writes e-mail and on Juno's Web
portal site, and during 2000 and a portion of 2001 were also displayed on the persistent advertising and navigation banner shown to its free subscribers at all times while they use the Web.


Direct
product sales, consisting of revenues generated from the sale of products directly by Juno to its subscribers and the associated shipping and
handling fees. Juno began phasing out its direct product sales activities during 1999, and completed this process in August 2000. 

    Juno
currently offers its billable premium services under a number of pricing plans. The list price for Juno Web is a flat rate of $19.95 per month, but since the launch of the
service, Juno has offered a number of promotions, such as a free month of service or a discounted rate for an initial or prepaid period, as well as discounted flat-rate plans. Currently,
the most common pricing plan for Juno Web is a flat fee of $9.95 per month following a free initial month. During the first quarter of 2001, Juno began adjusting the discounted prices offered through
some marketing channels and to some of its existing subscribers. For example, Juno changed the billable service price plan it offered on its main Web page and through some other marketing channels
from $9.95 per month to $14.95 per month. Although Juno expects the reduction of discounted pricing to cause some attrition from its billable services, the company currently projects that revenue lost
due to a decline in billable subscriber count is likely to be largely counterbalanced by the higher revenues collected from the subscribers that remain and the cost savings associated with the
elimination of the usage hours of any billable subscribers that leave the service. Juno's broadband service, Juno Express, is currently provided through a number of technologies, including DSL and
mobile wireless technologies, at price points starting at $49.95 per month. Juno has not undertaken any substantial amount of marketing for Juno Express to date, and as of March 31, 2001, only
a negligible number of subscribers, roughly 3,000, not all of whom had completed the installation and set-up process by such date had signed up for broadband service through Juno Express.
Juno has not accepted new subscribers to its DSL service since April 2001 and it currently believes that it is likely to discontinue this service at least in its present form in the near
future. Subscription revenues for its billable premium services accounted for approximately 97% of billable services revenues during the first quarter of 2001. 

    The
expansion of Juno's free basic service to include full Web access in December 1999 caused the costs associated with operating its free basic service to increase
significantly on a quarter-over-quarter basis in each of the first three quarters of 2000 due to significantly increased telecommunications 

connection time per subscriber per month. These costs, which are reflected in the Operations, free service line of its statement of operations, improved somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2000 and
improved substantially further in the first quarter of 2001, following the adoption of measures designed to encourage heavier users of the free service to modify their usage patterns or upgrade to a
billable service. These measures led to a quarter-over-quarter reduction of 44.5% in average monthly Web connection time for users of its free service in the first quarter of
2001 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2000. Juno expects its cost of Operations, free service to improve further in the second quarter of 2001. 

    When
Juno expanded its free service to include full Web access, the company also introduced a persistent advertising and navigation banner that is displayed to its free subscribers at
all times while they use the Web. Juno's long-term strategy contemplated generating sufficient additional revenues from this persistent advertising banner and from other advertising
inventory it controls to cover the costs associated with Juno's service expansion. However, Juno has not yet been able to generate sufficient additional revenues to cover these increased costs.
Furthermore, in December 2000, NetZero commenced legal action against Juno asserting that elements of the technology Juno uses in connection with Juno's persistent advertising and navigation
banner infringe on a United States patent issued to NetZero earlier that month. Juno intends to vigorously contest the allegations. For most of the first quarter, Juno was prevented from displaying
advertisements for third parties in this persistent advertising banner due to a temporary restraining order issued in connection with this dispute. However, on April 12, 2001, the court lifted
this temporary restraining order. On April 17, 2001, Juno resumed displaying third-party advertisements in the persistent advertising banner. Please see "Juno's BusinessLegal
Proceedings" for more detailed information. 

    Revenues
from advertising and transaction fees declined by 44.9% to $5.8 million in the first quarter of 2001, down from $10.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2000.
This decrease in advertising revenues can be attributed in large part to the widely reported decline in the market for Internet advertising, manifested in part through reduced signings, the reduction
or cancellation of certain existing advertising contracts, and an increase in uncollectible receivables. On a per-subscriber basis, revenues associated with Juno's free basic service
declined approximately 46.3% in the first quarter of 2001, to an average of $0.51 per month, down from approximately $0.95 per month in the fourth quarter of 2000. As noted above, Juno has taken steps
to reduce expenses associated with providing the free service, with a particular emphasis on managing telecommunications costs through the reduction of average monthly Web connection time. Juno
currently expects revenues associated with the free basic service to continue to be exceeded for some time by the sum of the expenses reported on the Operations, free service line and the portion of
the Cost of revenues line associated with the free service. Juno's business may suffer if the market for Internet-based advertising fails to recover or if the steps it is taking to reduce expenses
fail to have the desired impact. The impact on Juno of the softness in demand for Internet advertising is reflected in Juno's backlog of advertising contracts, which continued to decrease, to
approximately $7.0 million at the end of the first quarter of 2001 from about $12.0 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2000 and $28 million at the end of the third
quarter of 2000. New signings continued to slow in the first quarter of 2001 and a number of advertisers either shortened or cancelled their advertising contracts. Additionally, as certain advertisers
have gone out of business or found themselves in financial distressparticularly Internet-related companies, which continue to account for the majority of its advertisersJuno
has also experienced a significant increase in uncollectible receivables. In light of these trends, Juno currently expects advertising and transaction fee revenue to
decline further over the coming quarters, although it does not expect the revenue decline during the second quarter of 2001 to be as extensive as the roughly 40% drop in backlog from
December 31, 2000 to March 31, 2001. 

    During
the first quarter of 2001, approximately 80% of Juno's revenues came from billable services, while the remaining 20% came from advertising and transaction fees. Juno's current 

expectation is that this mix of revenues will remain roughly constant for the remainder of the year, as it continues to emphasize its billable services. 

    Juno's
competitors for billable services revenues and advertising and transaction fees revenues include companies that have substantially greater market presence, and financial,
technical, distribution, marketing, and other resources than Juno has. This competitive environment could have a variety of harmful effects on Juno, including, among other things, necessitating
advertising rate reductions or price reductions for Juno's billable services, or placing Juno at a competitive disadvantage if, as Juno currently believes is likely, the company does not maintain or
increase its spending in areas such as marketing and product development. 

    As
of March 31, 2001, Juno held a total of $46.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. Juno believes that changes in the market environment over the past year have
increased the value of corporate cash reserves as well as the relative importance of bringing expenses more in line with revenues and reducing reliance on external sources of capital. Juno has
significantly reduced its operating expenses over each of the last three quarters. In particular, Juno has reduced Operations, free service expenses and expenditures for subscriber acquisition.
Operations, free service expenses dropped to $6.3 million in the first quarter of 2001, down 42.2% from $10.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2000. Subscriber acquisition expenses also
decreased to $6.3 million in the first quarter of 2001, down 27.7% as compared to the immediately preceding quarter and down 85.9% as compared to the year-ago quarter. Juno
currently expects that net losses for the remaining nine months of 2001 will total $15 million or less. 

    Juno
is subject to industry trends that affect Internet access providers generally, including seasonality and subscriber cancellations. Juno believes Internet access providers may
incur higher expenses during the last and first calendar quarters, corresponding to heavier usage during the fall and winter, and may experience relatively lighter usage and relatively fewer account
registrations during the summer. Juno believes some subscriber acquisition methods also tend to be most effective during the first and last calendar quarters of each year, and if Juno were to pursue
such subscriber acquisition activities at some point in the future, Juno may take these types of seasonal effects into consideration in scheduling such marketing campaigns. Although Juno has relied
heavily on direct mail in the past, Juno has suspended substantially all use of direct mail and does not currently plan to use either this channel or other cash-intensive marketing
channels for subscriber acquisition in the near term. The results of operations of Internet access providers, including those of Juno, are significantly affected by subscriber cancellations. The
failure to retain subscribers to its billable premium services, or an increase in the
rate of cancellations of those services, would cause its business and financial results to suffer. Advertising revenues also depend in part on the size of its overall active subscriber base. Any
reduction in its overall active subscriber base due to subscriber attrition would reduce the amount of ad inventory it has available to sell and may also have the effect of reducing its advertising
revenue. Juno currently expects its active and billable subscriber count to decline over the coming quarters, in part as a result of the measures Juno has begun implementing to reduce
telecommunications costs associated with its free service, drive migrations to its billable services, and reduce the use of discounted promotional pricing for its billable services. 

    Juno's
principal expenses consist of telecommunications, customer service, personnel and related costs, and marketing. Juno has elected to obtain a number of services principally from
third-party providers. Services obtained from such providers include telecommunications services, customer service and technical support, and services related to the sale of certain advertising
inventory and the delivery of the associated advertisements. Juno's business and financial results would be harmed were Juno no longer able to obtain these services at competitive rates. 

    Juno
has incurred net losses of $289 million from its inception on June 30, 1995 through March 31, 2001. Juno has relied primarily on sales of equity securities,
totaling $300 million through 

March 31, 2001, to fund its operations. Included in this amount are $81.1 million of net proceeds from Juno's February 2000 follow-on offering of common stock,
$77.3 million of net proceeds from Juno's May 1999 initial public offering of common stock, $61.9 million of net proceeds from Juno's March 1999 private placement of
Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock, which automatically converted into shares of common stock upon the closing of the initial public offering, and $232,000 of net proceeds from
sales of Juno's common stock under its "equity line" facility, which Juno secured in October 2000. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" of this Section for additional information about this
facility. 

Results of Operations  

Three Months Ended March 31, 2001 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2000    

Revenues  

    Total revenues increased $4.7 million, to $28.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from $24.0 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2000, an increase of 19.4%. This increase was due to increases in billable services, partially offset by a decrease in advertising and transaction fees and direct product
sales. 

    Billable Services.
  Billable services revenues increased $6.2 million, to $22.9 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2001 from $16.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2000, an increase of 36.9%. This increase was due primarily to a greater number of billable
service subscribers and higher average monthly revenue per subscriber in the three months ended March 31, 2001, as compared with the year-ago period. 

    Advertising and Transaction Fees.
  Advertising and transaction fee revenues decreased $0.6 million, to
$5.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from $6.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2000, a decrease of 9.7%. This decrease was due primarily to
the decline in the market for Internet advertising and an increase in uncollectible receivables. Barter transactions accounted for approximately 1.8% and 1.5% of total revenues and 8.9% and 5.5% of
advertising and transaction fees for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 

    Direct Product Sales.
  Juno stopped conducting direct product sales activities in August 2000 and has not sold
any merchandise or recorded any revenue related to such sales since then. Direct product sales totaled $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2000. 

Cost of Revenues  

    Total cost of revenues increased approximately $2.2 million, to $16.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from
$14.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2000, an increase of 15.3%. This increase was due primarily to increases in costs associated with providing billable services to a
substantially larger number of billable subscribers, partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with advertising and transaction fees and direct product sales. 

    Billable Services.
  Cost of revenues related to billable services consists primarily of the costs to provide billable
premium services, including telecommunications, customer service, operator-assisted technical support, credit card fees, and personnel and related overhead costs. In addition, during the three months
ended March 31, 2001, cost of revenues related to billable services included the costs of mailing copies of the Juno software upon request to prospective Juno subscribers, who had to pay for
delivery of the disks at that time, a practice Juno had discontinued for most of 2000. 

    Cost
of revenues related to billable services increased approximately $3.3 million, to $15.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from
$12.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2000, an increase of 27.6%. This increase was due primarily to the costs of providing its billable 

subscription services to a substantially larger number of subscribers, offset in part by a decrease in the average monthly cost to provide the service to each billable subscriber as compared with the
year-ago period. Costs related to the provision of these billable premium services, principally telecommunications, customer service, and technical support expenses, accounted for 87.1% of
the total costs of revenues related to billable services during the three months ended March 31, 2001 and accounted for the majority of the increase. These expenses accounted for 88.6% of the
total costs of revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2000. Cost of billable services revenues as a percentage of billable services revenues improved to 67.0% for the three months
ended March 31, 2001 from 71.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2000. This improvement is primarily attributable to decreased average telecommunications rates, partially offset by
increased average hours of usage per subscriber and average customer service costs per subscriber. However, cost of billable services revenues as a percentage of billable services revenues increased
for the three months ended March 31, 2001 when compared with 62.2% for in the three months ended December 31, 2000. This deterioration of billable service margin resulted from an
increase in average hours of Web usage per billable subscriber in particular, as heavier users of its free service migrated to its billable services following its December 2000 adoption of
measures designed to address resource consumption by such users. The effect of this increase was offset, in part, by an increase in average revenue per billable subscriber and a decrease in Juno's
effective telecommunications rate. Juno currently expects hours of usage per billable subscriber to continue to increase. There can be no assurance that this growth will be offset by a further
improvement in average revenue per billable subscriber or in Juno's effective telecommunications rate. 

    Advertising and Transaction Fees.
  Cost of revenues for advertising and transaction fees consists primarily of the
transmission costs associated with downloading advertisements to the hard drives of subscribers' computers for later display, the personnel and related costs associated with the creation and
distribution of these advertisements, and the costs associated with reporting the results of ad campaigns to advertisers. 

    Cost
of revenues for advertising and transaction fees decreased approximately $219,000, to $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from
$1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2000, a decrease of 12.5%. This decrease was due primarily to the decline in advertising and transaction fee revenue associated with
continued weakness in the market for Internet advertising. Cost of revenues related to advertising and transaction fees as a percentage of advertising and transaction fees improved to 26.4% for the
three months ended March 31, 2001 from 27.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2000. This improvement is due primarily to a decrease in telecommunications rates. However, cost of
revenues related to advertising and transaction fees as a percentage of advertising and transaction fees increased for the three months ended March 31, 2001 when compared with 18.4% for the
three months ended December 31, 2000. This deterioration of advertising and transaction fees margin resulted from smaller average deal sizes and a reduced revenue base over which to allocate
related overhead costs. Cost of revenues for advertising and transaction fees as a percentage of advertising and transaction fees is expected to remain at around 30% over the remainder of 2001. 

    Direct Product Sales.
  Cost of revenues for direct product sales consists primarily of the costs of merchandise sold
directly by Juno to its subscribers and the associated shipping and handling costs. 

    Juno
stopped conducting direct product sales activities in August 2000 and has not incurred any costs since then. The cost of revenues for direct product sales was $856,000 for
the three months ended March 31, 2000. 

Operating Expenses  

    Operations, Free Service.
  Operations, free service expenses represent the costs associated with providing Juno's free
basic service. Costs consist principally of telecommunications costs, expenses 

associated with providing customer service, depreciation of network equipment, and personnel and related overhead costs. 

    Expenses
associated with operations, free service increased approximately $152,000 to $6.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from $6.1 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2000, an increase of 2.5%. This increase was due primarily to an increase in the average number of hours that each of Juno's free service subscribers used the
Web, offset primarily by a reduction in its effective telecommunications rate. However, expenses associated with operations, free service decreased $4.6 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2001 when compared with expenses of $10.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2000. This improvement resulted primarily from a 44.5% reduction in average
monthly Web connection time for users of its free service during the three months ended March 31, 2001 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2000. This reduction was driven
primarily by measures Juno began implementing late in the fourth quarter of 2000 to encourage heavier users of the free service to modify their usage patterns or upgrade to a billable service. 

    Subscriber Acquisition.
  Subscriber acquisition costs include all costs incurred to acquire subscribers to either Juno's
free basic service or to one of its billable premium services. These costs have historically included the cost of direct mail campaigns, advertising through conventional and computer-based media,
telemarketing, the production of advertisements to be displayed over the Juno services and
transmission of such advertisements to its subscribers, disk duplication and fulfillment, and bounties paid to acquire subscribers, including fees paid under stock-based subscriber referral agreements
where payment is made primarily or entirely through the issuance of shares of common stock, among other marketing activities. These costs also include various subscriber retention activities, as well
as personnel and related overhead costs. 

    Subscriber
acquisition costs decreased $38.5 million, to $6.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from $44.8 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2000, a decrease of 85.9%. This decrease was due to Juno not repeating in the first quarter of 2001 the extensive direct mail campaigns undertaken in the first quarter of 2000,
as well as its suspending other marketing activities such as most television, radio, outdoor and other advertising campaigns. In June 2000, Juno decided to substantially curtail cash intensive
subscriber acquisition activities in order to help bring its operating expenses more in line with its revenues. As a percentage of revenues, subscriber acquisition costs decreased to 21.9% in the
three months ended March 31, 2001 from 186.1% in the three months ended March 31, 2000. 

    Sales and Marketing.
  Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the personnel and related overhead costs of the
following departments: advertising sales and business development; direct product sales; and product marketing. Also included are costs associated with trade advertising intended to support Juno's
advertising sales effort, corporate branding activities unrelated to subscriber acquisition, and public relations, as well as advertising production, advertising transmission, customer service and
fulfillment costs associated with Juno's direct product sales activities. 

    Sales
and marketing costs increased approximately $113,000, to $3.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from $3.6 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2000, an increase of 3.1%. This increase was due primarily to an increase in personnel and related costs (excluding sales commissions), as well as in trade advertising, partially
offset by a reduction in telecommunications and credit card costs associated with direct product sales and sales commissions. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing costs improved to 13.0%
in the three months ended March 31, 2001 from 15.0% in the three months ended March 31, 2000. This improvement was due primarily to an increase in revenues for the three months ended
March 31, 2001 as compared to the year-ago period. 

    Product Development.
  Product development includes research and development expenses and other product development
costs. These costs consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs. 

    Product development costs decreased approximately $73,000, to $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from $2.5 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2000, a decrease of 3.0%. This decrease was due primarily to a decline in personnel costs in both Juno's domestic and India offices, offset in part by a slight increase in overhead
costs. To date, Juno has not capitalized any expenses related to any software development activities. 

    General and Administrative.
  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead
costs associated with executive, finance, legal, recruiting, human resources and facilities functions, as well as various professional expenses. 

    General
and administrative costs increased $1.6 million, to $3.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from $1.8 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2000, an increase of 90.4%. This increase was due primarily to a rise in expenses associated with additional personnel and related overhead costs, uncollectible receivables, and
legal fees associated with Juno's defense of various claims brought against the company by third parties. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative costs increased to approximately 11.8%
for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from 7.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2000. 

Interest Income, Net  

    Interest income, net decreased $1.1 million to $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001, from $1.7 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2000, a decrease of 62.5%. This decrease was due primarily to interest income earned on lower average cash balances in the three months ended March 31, 2001
as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2000. Interest income, net includes interest expense of $19,000 and $44,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. 

Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1999    

Revenues  

    Total revenues increased $62.0 million, to $114.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $52.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 119%. This increase was due to increases in billable services and in advertising and transaction fees, partially offset by a decrease in direct product
sales. 

    Billable Services.
  Billable services revenues increased $39.4 million, to $73.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2000 from $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 114%. This increase was due primarily to a greater number of billable service
subscribers in the year ended December 31, 2000, as compared with the much smaller number in the year ago period, partially offset by lower average monthly revenue per subscriber. 

    Advertising and Transaction Fees.
  Advertising and transaction fees increased $26.0 million, to
$38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 206%. This increase was due primarily to the
increase in Web-enabled subscribers associated with the expansion of its free basic service to include full Web access. Juno believes this expansion made its subscriber base and ad
inventory more attractive to some categories of advertisers, particularly those interested in attracting traffic to their own Web sites, and may account in part for its
year-over-year increase in sales. Barter transactions accounted for approximately 2.8% and 1.5% of total revenues and 8.2% and 6.2% of advertising and transaction fees for the
years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 

    Direct Product Sales.
  Direct product sales decreased $3.4 million, to $1.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000 from $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, a decrease of 

70.4%. This decline reflects Juno's strategic decision to cease its direct product sales activities and focus instead on other forms of electronic commerce. Specifically, Juno decided to concentrate
on forming strategic marketing alliances and developing other uses for its advertising inventory that it believes should generate revenues with higher margins than direct product sales. Juno stopped
conducting direct product sales activities in August 2000. 

Cost of Revenues  

    Total cost of revenues increased $24.7 million, to $58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $33.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 73.0%. This increase was due primarily to increases in costs associated with billable services and in advertising and transaction fees, partially
offset by a decrease in costs associated with direct product sales. 

    Billable Services.
  Cost of revenues related to billable services increased approximately $24.1 million, to
$49.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 96.5%. This increase was due primarily to the
costs of providing Juno's billable subscription services to a substantially larger number of subscribers as compared with the number of subscribers in the year-ago period. Costs related to
the provision of these billable subscription services, principally telecommunications, customer service, and technical support expenses, accounted for 92.9% of the total costs of revenues related to
billable services during the year ended December 31, 2000 and accounted for the majority of the increase. These expenses accounted for 91.0% of the total costs of revenues during the year ended
December 31, 1999. Cost of billable services revenues as a percentage of billable services revenues improved to 66.3% for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 72.2% for the year ended
December 31, 1999. This improvement is primarily attributable to decreased customer service costs per subscriber and declining average telecommunications rates, partially offset by increased
average hours of usage per subscriber. 

    Advertising and Transaction Fees.
  Cost of revenues for advertising and transaction fees increased $3.4 million,
to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 73.6%. This increase was due primarily to the
increase in advertising and transaction fee revenue associated with the increase in Web-enabled subscribers due to the expansion of Juno's free basic service to include full Web access.
Cost of revenues related to advertising and transaction fees as a percentage of advertising and transaction fees improved to 21.0% for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 36.9% for the year
ended December 31, 1999. This improvement is due primarily to decreased telecommunications rates, faster average connection speeds, larger average deal sizes over which to spread relatively
fixed production costs, and improvements in Juno's production and distribution methods. 

    Direct Product Sales.
  The cost of revenues for direct product sales decreased approximately $2.8 million, to
$1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, a decrease of 67.8%. This decrease corresponds to the decrease in
merchandise sold. The cost of revenues for direct product sales as a percentage of direct product sales revenues increased to 94.7% for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 87.1% for the year
ended December 31, 1999. This increase was due primarily to a greater decline in the average retail price of merchandise sold relative to the declines in the costs of such merchandise as well
as additional promotional pricing in response to increasing competition in the computer hardware retail market, which category represented the majority of its merchandise sold. Juno stopped conducting
direct product sales activities in August 2000. 

Operating Expenses  

    Operations, Free Service.
  Expenses associated with operations, free service increased $31.6 million, to
$38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $6.7 million for the year ended 

December 31, 1999, an increase of 472%. This increase was due primarily to additional telecommunications costs incurred as a result of the expansion of Juno's free service to include full
Internet access. 

    Subscriber Acquisition.
  Subscriber acquisition costs increased $68.8 million, to $116.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2000 from $47.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 144%. This increase is due primarily to costs related to extensive direct mail
campaigns as well as other marketing activities including television, radio, outdoor and other advertising campaigns. To a lesser extent, the increase reflects costs incurred in connection with two
stock-based subscriber referral agreements as well as inbound telemarketing costs incurred in connection with subscriber acquisition
and retention activities. As a percentage of revenues, subscriber acquisition costs increased to 102.1% in the year ended December 31, 2000 from 91.6% in the year ended December 31,
1999. 

    Sales and Marketing.
  Sales and marketing costs increased $6.5 million, to $18.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2000 from $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 56.7%. This increase is due primarily to an increase in personnel and related
costs, including sales commissions, as well as in trade advertising, partially offset by a reduction in telecommunications costs. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing costs improved to
15.9% in the year ended December 31, 2000 from 22.2% in the year ended December 31, 1999. This improvement was due primarily to an increase in revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2000 as compared to the year-ago period. 

    Product Development.
  These costs consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs as well as, for periods
prior to May 1999, the costs associated with research and development and other product development activities performed for us on a contract basis by a related party in Hyderabad, India. In
May 1999, Juno hired as employees substantially all of the individuals who provided services to us under this related-party arrangement. 

    Product
development costs increased approximately $3.1 million, to $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $7.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999, an increase of 42.2%. This increase is due primarily to additional personnel and related costs in both Juno's domestic and India offices related to the development of the
Juno Express premium service and of a new release of its client-side software, version 5.0. These costs were partially offset by the lower costs associated with operating its India-based
research and development efforts as a majority-owned subsidiary rather than obtaining these services on a contract basis. To date, Juno has not capitalized any expenses related to any software
development activities. 

    General and Administrative.
  General and administrative costs increased $4.7 million, to $9.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 2000 from $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 102%. This increase is due primarily to a rise in expenses associated with
additional personnel and related overhead costs, uncollectible receivables, insurance, and professional service fees. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative costs improved to
approximately 8.2% for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 8.9% for the year ended December 31, 1999. 

    Interest Income, Net.
  Interest income, net increased $1.8 million to $5.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000, from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 48.2%. This increase is due primarily to interest income earned on higher average cash
balances in the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1999. Interest income, net includes interest expense of $158,000 and $345,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 

Year Ended December 31, 1999 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1998    

Revenues  

    Total revenues increased $30.3 million, to $52.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $21.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 1998, an increase of 140%. This increase was due to increases in billable services and in advertising and transaction fees, partially offset by a decrease in direct product sales. 

    Billable Services.
  Billable services revenues increased $27.9 million, to $34.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 1999 from $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of 420%. This increase was due primarily to the additional number of subscribers to its
billable premium services in the year ended December 31, 1999, as compared with the much smaller number in the year ended December 31, 1998. Juno's billable premium services were
introduced in July 1998. Revenues associated with these services contributed $32.5 million of revenues in the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to $3.6 million in the
year ended December 31, 1998, representing an increase of 797%. 

    Advertising and Transaction Fees.
  Advertising and transaction fees increased $6.2 million, to
$12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of 96.2%. This increase was due primarily to larger
average deal sizes associated with the shift in its emphasis towards strategic marketing alliances, partially offset by declines in the number of and the aggregate revenue generated from shorter term
ad sales contracts. Barter transactions accounted for approximately 1.5% and 0.6% of total revenues and 6.2% and 1.9% of advertising and transaction fees for the years ended December 31, 1999
and 1998, respectively. 

    Direct Product Sales.
  Direct product sales decreased $3.8 million, to $4.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999 from $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, a decrease of 44.2%. This decline reflects Juno's strategic decision in 1998 to narrow the range of its
direct product sales activities and of the types of products offered to its subscribers. Instead, Juno decided to concentrate on forming strategic marketing alliances and developing other uses for its
advertising inventory that it believed would be likely to generate revenues with higher margins than direct product sales. 

Cost of Revenues  

    Total cost of revenues increased $16.8 million, to $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $17.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of 99.3%. This increase was due primarily to increases in costs associated with higher revenues from billable services and advertising and transaction
fees, partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with direct product sales revenues. 

    Billable Services.
  Cost of revenues related to billable services increased approximately $19.3 million, to
$25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of 345%. This increase was due primarily to the costs
of providing Juno's billable premium services to a substantially larger number of subscribers in the year ended December 31, 1999, as compared with the year ended December 31, 1998.
Costs related to the provision of these billable premium services, principally customer service, technical support and telecommunications expenses, accounted for 80.0% of the total costs of revenues
related to billable services during the year ended December 31, 1999 and accounted for the majority of the increase. Cost of billable services revenues as a percentage of billable services
revenues improved to 72.2% for the year ended December 31, 1999 from 84.4% for the year ended December 31, 1998. This improvement is primarily attributable to decreased customer service
costs per subscriber and declining average telecommunications rates. 

    Advertising and Transaction Fees.
  Cost of revenues for advertising and transaction fees increased $1.0 million,
to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of 25.5%. This increase was due primarily to the
impact of additional strategic marketing alliances. Cost of revenues related to advertising and transaction fees as a percentage of advertising and transaction fees improved to 36.9% for the year
ended December 31, 1999 from 57.7% for the year ended December 31, 1998. This improvement is due primarily to decreased telecommunications rates, faster average connection speeds, larger
average deal sizes over which to spread production costs and improvements in Juno's production and distribution methods. 

    Direct Product Sales.
  Cost of revenues for direct product sales decreased approximately $3.5 million, to
$4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, a decrease of 45.2%. This decrease corresponds to the decrease in
merchandise sold. The cost of revenues for direct product sales as a percentage of direct product sales revenues improved to 87.1% for the year ended December 31, 1999 from 88.7% for the year
ended December 31, 1998. This improvement was due primarily to efficiencies associated with outsourcing various functions rather than performing them internally, partially offset by a greater
decline in the average retail price of merchandise sold relative to the declines in the costs of such merchandise, and additional promotional pricing in response to increasing competition in the
market for computer hardware sales. 

Operating Expenses  

    Operations, Free Service.
  Expenses associated with operations, free service decreased $2.7 million, to
$6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, a decrease of 28.6%. This decrease was primarily due to declining
telecommunications rates and increasing connection speeds resulting from the use of faster modems by a portion of its subscriber base. The results were not materially impacted by the expansion of
Juno's basic service to provide full Internet access for free, since this expansion occurred on December 20, 1999. 

    Subscriber Acquisition.
  Subscriber acquisition costs increased approximately $42.3 million, to
$47.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. This increase is due primarily to costs related to Juno's 1999
external marketing campaign which launched in the second quarter of 1999, including direct mail programs, television and radio commercials, outdoor advertising and various other advertising
expenditures. This increase is also due to inbound telemarketing costs incurred in connection with subscriber acquisition and retention activities and to ad production and transmission costs
associated with soliciting basic service subscribers to upgrade to Juno's billable services. As a percentage of revenues, subscriber acquisition costs increased to 91.6% in
the year ended December 31, 1999 from 24.6% in the year ended December 31, 1998. This percentage increase was primarily due to increased costs related to Juno's 1999 external marketing
campaign. 

    Sales and Marketing.
  Sales and marketing costs were $11.6 million for the years ended December 31, 1999
and 1998. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 1999 include increased trade advertising costs as compared to the year ended December 31, 1998. This increase was
partially offset by cost reductions associated with Juno's decision to scale back various direct product sales activities. Sales and marketing costs for the year ended December 31, 1998 include
one-time costs associated with this decision, as well as expenses related to the closing of regional advertising sales offices. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing costs
improved to 22.2% in the year ended December 31, 1999 from 53.4% in the year ended December 31, 1998. This improvement was primarily due to an increase in revenues for the year ended
December 31, 1999. 

    Product Development.
  Product development costs decreased $0.1 million, to $7.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999 from $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, a decrease of 1.5%. This decrease is primarily due to lower costs associated with operating Juno's
India-based research and development efforts as a majority-owned subsidiary, rather than obtaining these services on a contract basis, partially offset by additional personnel and related costs in
both its domestic and India offices. Product development costs in the year ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 related primarily to the continued development of Juno's billable premium services
and of various pieces of software. 

    General and Administrative.
  General and administrative costs increased approximately $1.9 million, to
$4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, an increase of 67.2%. This increase is primarily due to increased
insurance costs for directors' and officers' liability insurance, professional service fees and additional personnel and related overhead costs. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative
costs decreased to 8.9% for the year ended December 31, 1999 from 12.7% for the year ended December 31, 1998. This decrease was primarily due to the increase in revenue for the year
ended December 31, 1999 compared to the year ended December 31, 1998. 

    Interest Income, Net.
  Interest income, net increased approximately $3.7 million, to $3.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 1999 from $44,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998. This increase is primarily due to interest income earned on higher average cash balances in the year ended
December 31, 1999 resulting from Juno's initial public offering in May 1999 and from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock in March 1999, partially offset by
higher interest payments for borrowings. Interest income, net includes interest expense of $345,000 and $537,000 for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

    Since its formation, Juno has financed its operations primarily from funds generated by the sale of equity securities. Sales of equity securities include
$81.1 million of net proceeds from Juno's February 2000 follow-on offering of common stock, $77.3 million of net proceeds from Juno's May 1999 initial public
offering of common stock, $61.9 million of net proceeds from Juno's March 1999 private placement of redeemable convertible preferred stock, which converted into common stock upon the
completion of its initial public offering, and $232,000 of net proceeds from sales of Juno's common stock under its "equity line" facility, which Juno secured in October 2000. Juno has incurred
significant losses since inception, totaling $289 million through March 31, 2001. As of March 31, 2001 Juno had $46.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. 

    Net
cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2001 decreased $33.2 million to $8.7 million, down from $41.9 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2000. This decrease was primarily the result of a decline in subscriber acquisition expenses, which represented approximately 101% of the overall decrease in the
net loss, and a decrease in the balance of accounts receivable, offset in part by a decrease in the balance of accounts payable and accrued expenses associated with subscriber acquisition liabilities
and deferred revenue. The decline in subscriber acquisition expenses was attributable to Juno's decision to substantially curtail subscriber acquisition activities in order to help bring its operating
expenses more in line with its revenues. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted from a decline in advertising and transaction fee revenues, as well as increased collection efforts during the
three months ended March 31, 2001 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2000. Accounts receivable includes the portion of advertising and transaction fees and billable
subscriber fees that have been billed in advance of the performance of all or a portion of the related services and that have not been collected. The portions of accounts receivable related to these
fees as
of March 31, 2001 and 2000and the corresponding equal amounts that remained in its deferred revenue liability account balances at such dateswere $4,453 and $2,691,
respectively. 

    Net
cash used in investing activities was $140,000, and $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The principal use of cash for the
periods presented was for the purchase of fixed assets. As a result of its outsourcing arrangements for telecommunications services and customer service, Juno has substantially reduced the level of
capital expenditures that would otherwise have been necessary to develop its product offerings. In the event that these outsourcing arrangements were no longer available to Juno, significant capital
expenditures would be required and its business and financial results could suffer. Expenditures associated with the purchase of telecommunications capacity, the provision of customer service, and
subscriber acquisition and retention activities are expected to continue to represent a material use of Juno's cash resources. 

    Net
cash used by and provided by financing activities was $64,000 and $81.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Financing
activities for the three months ended March 31, 2000 primarily included $81.1 million in net proceeds Juno received from its February 2000 follow-on offering of common
stock. 

    In
October 2000, Juno entered into a common stock investment agreement with a private investment fund, The Kingston Limited Partnership, providing for the future issuance and
purchase of shares of its common stock. This agreement and a related registration rights agreement constitute what is commonly referred to as an "equity line" facility. The equity line facility
permits Juno to sell, subject to various restrictions, up to $7.5 million of common stock in each of up to 20 drawdown periods of 22 trading days each over the course of a period of up to two
years, provided that Juno cannot sell more than $125 million worth of shares in total under the facility and may in practice only be able to sell a much lower amount. The total number of shares
that may be issued under the facility depends on a number of factors, including the market price and trading volume of its common stock during each drawdown period Juno chooses to initiate. Any stock
issued to Kingston under this facility will 

generally be purchased at a price equal to 94 percent of the volume-weighted average trading price of Juno's common stock on a given purchase day. Additionally, Kingston will generally not be
obligated to purchase shares from Juno on any day when the purchase price of Juno's common stock would be less than $1.50 per share. Since Kingston's purchase price will generally be 94% of Juno's
volume-weighted average trading price during a given purchase day, Kingston generally will have no obligation to purchase shares on a given day to the extent that the volume-weighted average trading
price of Juno's shares during such day is less than $1.60 per share. Prior to the reduction of this minimum price condition from $2.50 per share to $1.50 per share in March 2001, Kingston
agreed to waive the $2.50 minimum price condition with respect to one drawdown period, and Kingston may agree from time to time to waive the minimum purchase price in effect in the future to allow
Juno to sell common stock to Kingston at prices lower than $1.50 per share. Kingston does not have an obligation to permit such sales, and may grant or deny such waivers in its sole discretion. Even
if Kingston does grant such a waiver in a particular case and, at Juno's request, accepts a new minimum purchase price lower than $1.50 per share for a given drawdown period, there can be no assurance
that Juno will meet such new
minimum trading price condition to Juno's ability to draw down funds for all or any portion of such drawdown period. Juno will control the timing and frequency of any sales, subject to the facility's
various restrictions, and has no obligation to draw down any minimum amount or number of times. However, the facility may be terminated if Juno sells no shares to the fund for a period of four
consecutive months. Juno has not sold any shares to the fund since March 2001, and Juno may not draw down any amount under the facility while the mergers are pending. 

    The
common stock investment agreement provides that the equity line will not be available to Juno unless a registration statement is effective to permit the fund to resell the shares
purchased by it. Juno has filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 28, 2000 to register the resale by the fund of up
to 10,000,000 shares of the common stock that may be issued to Kingston under the equity line facility. As of April 30, 2001 Juno had sold 317,400 shares and raised net proceeds of $232,000
under this facility. 

    Juno
believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months. 

    Over
the coming quarters, Juno expects further improvements in its operating expenses. Savings are expected to be driven by further reductions in telecommunications hours associated
with the free service and, to a lesser extent, in expenditures for subscriber acquisition, as well as by reductions in staff-related expenses achieved by the recent scaling back of selected
departments in response to the evolving business environment and expanding the use of Juno's resources in India. In April 2001, Juno eliminated approximately forty positions (net of ongoing
replacement searches) that Juno concluded were no longer necessary due to shifts in the business and the relocation of certain functions to Juno's India office. At April 30, 2001, worldwide
headcount was 262. 

    In
2000, Juno entered into several transactions in which Juno's payment for services rendered may be settled, in whole or in part, through the issuance of its common stock. 

    On
June 29, 2000, Juno entered into a subscriber referral agreement with SmartWorld Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries SmartWorld Technologies, LLC and Freewwweb,
LLC. Under the terms of the Freewwweb Agreement, Freewwweb began to refer Freewwweb's subscribers to Juno's Internet access services on July 19, 2000 and is entitled to receive consideration
from Juno for each former Freewwweb subscriber that became a new subscriber to Juno's services and subsequently met certain qualification criteria. Under the terms of the Freewwweb Agreement, such
consideration will include cash and may include, at Juno's option, shares of Juno's common stock. The number of shares of Juno's common stock will be based on the closing sale price of Juno's common
stock on the dates of issuance. In accordance with the Freewwweb Agreement, Juno has ceased accepting additional Freewwweb subscribers. Juno has not yet issued any shares of its common stock to
Freewwweb or 

Freewwweb's affiliates under this agreement. Please see "Juno's BusinessLegal Proceedings" for additional information concerning this transaction. 

    On
September 18, 2000, Juno entered into a distribution agreement with Babbage's Etc. LLC. Under the terms of this agreement, Babbage's agreed to distribute Juno's software and
will receive periodic compensation from Juno for each new subscriber generated by such distribution that subsequently meets certain qualification criteria. The compensation received by Babbage's will
include shares of Juno's common stock or, at Juno's option, cash. The number of shares of Juno's common stock issuable to Babbage's will be based on the closing sale price of Juno's common stock on
the dates of issuance. Juno has not yet issued any shares of its common stock to Babbage's under this agreement. 

    Juno
may find additional opportunities to issue its equity securities as consideration for subscriber acquisition, telecommunications, or other significant operating costs in the
future. Juno may also seek to sell additional equity or debt securities. If non-cash methods for payment of operating costs are used or additional funds are raised by Juno issuing equity
securities, stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interest and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of Juno's common stock. If additional funds
are raised by its issuing debt, Juno may be subject to limitations on its operations. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk  

    Juno's results of operations, financial position, and cash flows are not materially affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the
U.S. dollar. Juno does not use derivative financial instruments to limit its foreign currency risk exposure. 

NETZERO'S BUSINESS    

General  

    NetZero is a leading provider of Internet access services and online targeted marketing solutions. NetZero offers consumers free and pay access to the
Internet, e-mail and customizable navigation tools that provide "speed dial" to key sites on the Internet. Its services are currently available in more than 5,000 cities across the United
States and Canada. In addition to offering consumers access to the Internet, NetZero offers marketers targeting capabilities through numerous online advertising channels. NetZero also offers
advertisers and commerce partners a variety of additional services to build their brands and market their products, including referring its users to partners' Web sites, enabling customer
registrations and facilitating electronic commerce transactions. NetZero's CyberTarget division offers marketers and advertisers mass-scale, online market research and measurement
services. The company was incorporated in July 1997 and launched its Internet access service in October 1998. 

    From
October 1998 through December 2000, NetZero offered a free and unlimited Internet access service which was supported by advertising and commerce. However, several
factors, including declines in Internet advertising rates, have resulted in NetZero amending its strategy to include billable services and to restrict the number of free hours it offers per household
per month. Through March 31, 2001 approximately 8.6 million users registered for NetZero's Internet access services, of which approximately 3.9 million accessed its services in
the month of March 2001. Approximately 75,000 of these users were subscribers of NetZero's pay services as of March 31, 2001. 

    In
January 2001, NetZero began limiting its free Internet service to a maximum of 40 hours per household per calendar month. Households desiring to exceed the
40 hour limitation are currently offered the opportunity to sign up for the Extended Access Pass, a plan that provides households the option to pay a fee, currently set at $9.95, to allow them
access to the NetZero service for the remainder of the calendar month. If these households elect not to pay a fee when they reach the 40 hour limit during a given month they will be denied
access to the service for the remainder of the month, but their account will not be terminated and they can begin accessing the service for free at the beginning of the next month. 

    In
March 2001, NetZero launched a new service called NetZero Platinum. The NetZero Platinum service offers users Internet service for a monthly fee, currently $9.95. In most
respects, NetZero
Platinum is the same as NetZero's standard free service except that the 40 hour limitation does not apply, the user accesses a modified start-page and the service features a small
toolbar without the advertising banners currently included in the ZeroPort on the free service. 

Industry Background  

    There are over 7,000 Internet service providers in the United States, varying widely in geographic coverage, user focus and the nature and quality of services
provided to users. With the exception of several large providers, the vast majority of Internet service providers do not offer branded nationwide coverage. A number of Internet service providers
supplement their basic access with services such as electronic commerce and telecommunications. Most Internet service providers charge users monthly access fees and fees for additional services, such
as hosting users' Web sites. Pay services can cost as much as $280 per year for dial-up Internet access. Telecommunications costs associated with providing dial-up Internet
access have declined in recent years with the emergence of wholesale providers that resell capacity to Internet service providers. These providers have built networks on a large scale and are able to
spread the cost of their networks over multiple Internet service providers. NetZero believes that while users are generally focused on speed and reliability as they evaluate Internet access services,
they are also increasingly focusing on cost, particularly as their other computing costs decline and since the rest of their online experience is generally free. 

    Many Internet service providers supplement their billable service revenues through sales of online advertising. NetZero was the first company to offer free, unlimited Internet access
on a nationwide basis supported primarily by advertising. A number of a companies followed suit by offering either free Internet access or Internet access that is priced significantly lower than the
fees charged by some of the larger providers. However, online advertising rates have declined significantly, and NetZero does not believe that an unlimited, free Internet access service can be
profitable on a standalone basis in the current environment. In fiscal 2001 the majority of companies who offered free Internet access have either ceased to offer free Internet access or have ceased
operations as a result of their failure to generate positive cash flow or raise additional funding through the capital markets. 

    Due
to factors including the decline in online advertising rates, NetZero has shifted its strategy away from offering an unlimited free access service to offering a limited free
access service and value priced pay services. While NetZero continues to focus on developing and offering a variety of products to advertisers and marketers to support its limited free service
offering, the uncertainty in the advertising market will require NetZero to continue to evaluate the scope of services that can be offered to users free of charge. In the near term, NetZero intends to
focus on marketing its pay services to existing free users as well as to potential users serviced by other Internet services providers or users who are purchasing Internet services for the first time. 

Sources of Revenue  

    NetZero generates revenues through billable services, media fees, direct marketing agreements, referring its users to partners' Web sites, enabling customer
registrations for partners and facilitating electronic commerce transactions. NetZero also generates revenues through sales of market research data generated by its service. NetZero implements these
revenue arrangements through a number of products and services, primarily including the following: 

Billable Services Revenues  

    In January 2001, NetZero began limiting its free Internet access to 40 hours per month per household and offering users who reach their limit the
Extended Access Pass for $9.95, which currently provides unlimited Internet access for the remainder of the month. This is designed to either reduce telecommunications expense associated with heavy
users or, alternatively, generate additional revenues to mitigate such expense. Also, in March 2001, NetZero introduced the NetZero Platinum service at $9.95 per month, which provides users
with unlimited Internet access each month and features a thin toolbar without the advertising banners currently included in the ZeroPort on the free service. In addition, billable services includes
fees charged to prospective users related to the cost of producing, shipping and handling copies of the NetZero software on CDs. 

Advertising and Commerce Revenues  

    The Start Page.
  NetZero designates the first Web site viewed by its users during an Internet access session. This page
for the vast majority of users used to be My Z Start and has recently been replaced by Best of the Net, a Web site designed by NetZero that displays sponsored links to a variety of information,
services and products, including search, news, sports, music, weather, stocks and shopping. NetZero generates revenues from the Best of the Net start page by users clicking on links and being referred
to sponsors' Web sites. For the nine months ended March 31, 2001, NetZero derived approximately 25% of its revenue from its start page agreement with LookSmart which provided search
functionality on both the Start Page and the ZeroPort. The agreement with LookSmart was terminated in January 2001 and has not been replaced with a comparable agreement. As a result, revenues
from the Start Page will be significantly lower in the future. 

    The ZeroPort.
  A primary element of NetZero's free service is the ZeroPort displayed on users' screens throughout their
Internet access sessions. The ZeroPort is a small window displayed on its users' computer screens while they are online that is always visible regardless of where they navigate. Users can dock the
ZeroPort at the top or bottom of their screen but they cannot close it. NetZero generates revenues through the ZeroPort by displaying and/or users clicking on banner advertisements which can be
targeted based on users' profiles and online behavior; buttons, icons and drop-down menus which are linked to advertisers' and sponsors' Web sites or functionality offerings, including
search; a ticker which, when enabled by the user, delivers information through the ZeroPort which is linked directly to sponsors' Web sites; and displaying a sponsor's media message with no resulting
link to a Web site. 

    NZTV.
  While making the initial dial-up connection to access the Internet, certain NetZero users are
displayed video and other forms of animated advertisements in a small window on their computer screens which NetZero has named NZTV. Users can click on the NZTV advertisement during the connection
process and be referred to advertisers' Web sites once the Internet session has begun. NetZero generates revenues from displaying NZTV advertisements to its users and by users clicking on such
advertisements and being referred to sponsors' Web sites. 

    Targeted E-Mail.
  All of its registered users are given a NetZero e-mail address as part of its
Internet access service. Also, when registering for its service, certain users provide NetZero with their pre-existing e-mail address. During the registration process for its
service, users can designate certain subjects for which they have a particular interest, such as sports, health, news and finance. Users can elect to receive e-mail messages regarding
promotions or targeted information on these subjects. NetZero generates revenues by delivering e-mail messages on behalf of advertisers targeted to each subject of interest and by users
clicking on such messages and being referred to sponsors' Web sites. The advertising messages are delivered to users who have elected to receive such information, regardless of whether the message is
delivered to a NetZero e-mail address or alternate address provided. 

    CyberTarget.
  A fundamental component of its zCast technology is NetZero's ability to capture detailed data regarding
its users' online behavior, including Web sites visited, advertisements clicked on, and other activities. NetZero believes that this data, especially when combined with the demographic data it
receives when users register with NetZero, serves as a valuable tool for NetZero's partners to improve the effectiveness of their online service offerings. Through NetZero's CyberTarget division, it
generates revenues through the sale of market research data to third parties. CyberTarget's services are performed within the guidelines of NetZero's privacy policy which dictates that no personal
identifying information may be shared with third parties without the express consent of the NetZero user. 

Sales and Business Development  

    NetZero sells its advertising products and services primarily through its own direct sales force and, to a lesser extent, through third parties. From time to
time, NetZero has relied on third party sales forces to resell a significant portion of its advertising inventory. While NetZero intends to still use third parties for the resale of a portion of its
inventory, NetZero does not believe any third party sales relationships are material to its business. In addition, the limitations imposed on NetZero's free service have
resulted, and are likely to result in the future, in a decrease in the amount of advertising inventory available for sale and potentially a decrease in advertising revenue. NetZero's sales and
business development department is comprised of sales and business development, management, account executives, telemarketers, sales planning and traffic management and, at March 31, 2001,
NetZero had 53 in-house sales staff. As a result of the weakness in the online advertising market NetZero has closed its Dallas, Boston, Atlanta, Washington D.C. and Miami offices. Its
remaining sales offices are in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Los Angeles. 

Marketing and User Acquisition  

    During the first three quarters of calendar 2000, competition for free Internet access users was intense. However, due to the failure of a number of NetZero's
free access competitors commencing in the fourth quarter of calendar 2000, NetZero experienced a significant increase in registered and active users through January 2001. Due in part to the
costs associated with servicing this user base, during January 2001 NetZero imposed restrictions on the number of users that could access the free service, instituted limitations on monthly
usage and shifted the focus of its marketing from its free to its pay services. As a result or these and other factors, NetZero has experienced and believes it may continue to experience declines in
its active free user base. 

    NetZero's
marketing department consists of marketing management, media, creative services, Web development, strategic alliances and billable services personnel which, at
March 31, 2001, consisted of 23 people. Since its initial public offering in September 1999, NetZero has expended significant resources in building its brand and increasing its free user
base. Its brand awareness has grown substantially through its sponsorship of the half-time show of televised National Basketball Association games on NBC and through other television,
radio, print and online media. NetZero anticipates that, following the June 2001 quarter, it will significantly decrease its marketing expenditures. While NetZero's free user acquisition
efforts will continue to include brand-building marketing efforts through television, radio, print and online media advertising, NetZero anticipates it will focus its user acquisition and marketing
efforts primarily on pay services. A large component of these pay subscriber acquisition efforts is expected to be a variety of programs designed to up sell NetZero's free users to pay services. To
date, NetZero has engaged in direct mailing and distribution of compact discs containing its software and has also established download links on numerous Web sites from which a potential user can
download its software. It has undertaken significant co-branding initiatives where it co-sponsors the distribution of compact discs to the sponsors' user base. The service
provided through such discs contains branding of both NetZero and the sponsor. NetZero anticipates reviewing the effectiveness of these types of campaigns to increase its pay user base, and to
implement these and a variety of other initiatives designed to increase its pay user base. However, NetZero has limited experience in marketing pay services and its competitors spend funds
significantly in excess of what NetZero intends to spend going forward. There can be no assurance that NetZero will be able to decrease its marketing expenditures or successfully grow its pay user
base. 

User Support  

    NetZero's user support service strategy is to build programs designed to increase user satisfaction and retention in a cost-effective manner. NetZero's user
support service is a combination of internal personnel and selective outsourcing of certain aspects of its user service to vendors that provide NetZero with greater efficiency and scalability for
future growth. 

    NetZero
provides online and offline "self-help" services that provide a variety of support options to its users, including its SPEEDY Assistant offline software which is
loaded onto the user's computer when the service is initially installed from the compact disc and can also be downloaded from its Web site. This offline tool assists users in loading and operating its
software, provides answers to common questions and helps users set up their e-mail account through step-by-step instructions. NetZero also provides comprehensive
help, tutorials, advisories, answers to frequently asked questions and tips via its Web site and automated e-mail response system. Over 65% of all customer support inquiries utilize
NetZero's automated support options. In addition, NetZero provides traditional e-mail support where NetZero personnel respond generally with a one day turnaround. NetZero offers a
fee-based support option with toll-free telephone access and minimum wait time on a per-incident basis. NetZero's user support service organization continually
monitors different quantitative measurements such as average wait time, first call resolution rate and abandon rate. All user contacts are logged and categorized to enable NetZero to quickly recognize
and act on trends. An internal quality assurance team monitors 

the work of both telephone and e-mail agents and provides feedback to its agents to improve their skills, increase their productivity, and guarantee consistency throughout the user support
group. 

Technology  

    NetZero has developed or acquired a variety of technologies designed to enhance the functionality of its service for the user and to provide a platform for the
creation of products and services tailored to the needs of advertisers and commerce partners. The foundation of its service is a proprietary software system called zCast that enables NetZero to track
its users' navigational activities and to deliver highly targeted advertising. The zCast client is a JAVA application that runs on a user's personal computer and that currently operates on the Windows
95, Windows 98, Windows ME and Windows NT 4.x operating systems. zCast has the following major components: 

    The zCast Client Software.
  The zCast Client application is the software product that includes The ZeroPort, which is
installed on users' personal computers and is constantly visible while a connection to NetZero's service is maintained. The zCast Client performs multiple tasks, including: 


establishing
a connection to the NetZero service;


capturing
demographic information;


authenticating
a user via a user ID and password;


tracking
Web sites visited;


managing
the display of advertising banners;


targeting
advertising based on Web sites visited and on keyword search;


logging
the number of times an ad was shown and the number of times an ad was clicked on;


monitoring
the quality of the online session including dial-up and network errors;


providing
a mechanism for customer feedback; and


controlling
the download of various materials, including new software versions. 

    The zCast Server Network.
  Powered by JAVA, the zCast server network is a group of software applications running on
multiple servers that manage and collect important data relating to each user's online session. The system is designed to be scalable to handle large amounts of data. The servers consist of
application server software which interacts with the ZeroPort to send and receive information such as authentication, playlists of advertisements and impression and click counts; database servers
which store session information, user information and ad display and click counts; and ad servers which manage the ad inventory and determine which ads users will view during their online session. All
of the above components run on Sun Microsystems servers and many run on VA Linux servers. The system is designed for scalability and to handle large amounts of data and are connected to disk arrays
which provides NetZero with the ability to quickly scale and improve overall system performance. 

    Other Technologies.
  Many of its technologies are designed to enhance user experience, to provide the ability to offer
additional revenue streams or to increase operating efficiencies. For example, NZTV involves the display of full-motion video advertisements during the log-on process. The
advertisement is downloaded to the user's computer while the user is online without adversely impacting the user's online experience. The advertisement is updated based on playlists. Another example
is its Autodialer technology which is designed to automatically ensure the user accesses its network through a dial-in number which minimizes costs and enhances connectivity. NetZero
intends to continue to develop and acquire additional technologies with the goal of
