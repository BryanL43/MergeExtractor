(1) This Registration Statement relates to securities of the registrant issuable
    to holders of common stock, par value $.001 per share ("Heartport common
    stock"), of Heartport, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Heartport"), in the
    proposed merger of HP Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
    owned subsidiary of the registrant, with and into Heartport.

(2) Based on the maximum number of shares to be issued in connection with the
    merger, calculated as the product of (a) 29,665,265, the aggregate number of
    shares of Heartport common stock outstanding on February 16, 2001 (other
    than shares owned by Heartport, HP Merger Sub, Inc. or the registrant) or
    issuable pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options prior to the date
    the merger is expected to be completed and (b) an assumed exchange ratio of
    0.0290 shares of the registrant's common stock for each share of Heartport
    common stock.

(3) Estimated solely for the purpose of calculating the registration fee
    required by Section 6(b) of the Securities Act, and calculated pursuant to
    Rule 457(f) under the Securities Act. Pursuant to Rule 457(f)(1) under the
    Securities Act, the proposed maximum aggregate offering price of the
    registrant's common stock was calculated based upon the market value of
    shares of Heartport common stock (the securities to be cancelled in the
    merger) in accordance with Rule 457(c) under the Securities Act as follows:
    (a) $2.5785, the average of the high and low prices per share of Heartport
    common stock on February 16, 2001, as reported on The Nasdaq SmallCap
    Market, multiplied by (b) 29,665,265, the aggregate number of shares of
    Heartport common stock outstanding as of February 16, 2001 or issuable
    pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options prior to the date the merger
    is expected to be completed.

    THE REGISTRANT HEREBY AMENDS THIS REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON SUCH DATE OR
DATES AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO DELAY ITS EFFECTIVE DATE UNTIL THE REGISTRANT SHALL
FILE A FURTHER AMENDMENT WHICH SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT THIS REGISTRATION
STATEMENT SHALL THEREAFTER BECOME EFFECTIVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 8(a) OF
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR UNTIL THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT SHALL BECOME
EFFECTIVE ON SUCH DATE AS THE COMMISSION, ACTING PURSUANT TO SAID SECTION 8(a),
MAY DETERMINE.

Dear Stockholder:

     You are cordially invited to attend the special meeting of stockholders of
Heartport, Inc. to be held on [--], April [--], 2001, at 10:00 a.m., local time,
at the offices of Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian, LLP,
155 Constitution Drive, Menlo Park, California.

     At the special meeting, we will ask you to vote on the merger of Heartport
with a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. In the merger, you will receive a
fraction of a share of Johnson & Johnson common stock for each share of
Heartport common stock that you own, based upon an exchange ratio that will be
calculated by dividing $2.72 by the average per share closing price of Johnson &
Johnson common stock during a period of 20 trading days ending on the second
trading day immediately preceding the date on which the merger is completed. You
will receive cash for any fractional share of Johnson & Johnson common stock
that you would be entitled to receive in the merger.

     Johnson & Johnson common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange
under the trading symbol "JNJ" and on March [--], 2001, its closing price was
$[--] per share.

     The board of directors of Heartport carefully reviewed and considered the
terms and conditions of the proposed merger. Based on its review, the board of
directors has determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the merger
are advisable and in the best interests of Heartport and its stockholders. THE
BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED AND ADOPTED THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND
RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

     Your vote is important. We cannot complete the merger unless the merger
agreement is adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of
Heartport common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.
Failure to submit a signed proxy or vote in person at the special meeting will
have the same effect as a vote against adoption of the merger agreement. Only
stockholders who owned shares of Heartport common stock at the close of business
on March [--], 2001 will be entitled to vote at the special meeting.

     PLEASE COMPLETE, SIGN, DATE AND RETURN YOUR PROXY. If you hold your shares
in "street name", you should instruct your broker how to vote in accordance with
the voting instruction form that your broker will provide.

     The accompanying proxy statement/prospectus explains the proposed merger
and merger agreement and provides specific information concerning the special
meeting, and the accompanying Annual Report on Form 10-K of Heartport for the
year ended December 31, 2000 contains important business and financial
information relating to Heartport. Please review both documents carefully. YOU
SHOULD CONSIDER THE MATTERS DISCUSSED UNDER "RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE
MERGER" ON PAGE 11 OF THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS BEFORE VOTING.

                                          Sincerely,

                                          Casey M. Tansey

     We will transact no other business at the special meeting except such
business as may properly be brought before the special meeting or any

     Only stockholders who owned shares of Heartport common stock at the close
of business on March [--], 2001, the record date for the special meeting, are
entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and any adjournments

outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. This proxy
statement/prospectus describes the proposed merger and the actions to be taken
in connection with the merger and provides additional information about the

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:  WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO HEARTPORT AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER?

A: If the merger is completed, Heartport will become a wholly owned subsidiary
   of Johnson & Johnson.

Q:  WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this
   proxy statement/prospectus, please complete, sign and date your proxy and
   return it in the enclosed postage-paid return envelope as soon as possible,
   so that your shares may be represented at the special meeting. If you sign
   and send in your proxy and do not indicate how you want to vote, we will
   count your proxy as a vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement.
   Because the required vote of Heartport stockholders is based upon the number
   of outstanding shares of Heartport common stock, rather than upon the number
   of shares actually voted, the failure by the holder of any outstanding shares
   to submit a proxy or to vote in person at the special meeting, including
   abstentions and broker non-votes, will have the same effect as a vote against
   adoption of the merger agreement.

   The special meeting will take place on April [--], 2001, at 10:00 a.m., local
   time, at the offices of Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin &
   Hachigian, LLP, 155 Constitution Drive, Menlo Park, California. You may
   attend the special meeting and vote your shares in person, rather than
   completing, signing, dating and returning your proxy.

Q:  CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE MAILED MY SIGNED PROXY?

A: Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
   special meeting. You can do this in one of three ways. First, you can send a
   written notice stating that you would like to revoke your proxy. Second, you
   can complete and submit a new proxy bearing a later date. If you choose
   either of these two methods, you must submit your notice of revocation or
   your new proxy to Heartport at 700 Bay Road, Redwood City, CA 94063,
   Attention: Stockholder Relations. Third, you can attend the special meeting
   and vote in person. Attendance at the special meeting will not in and of
   itself constitute revocation of a proxy.

Q:  IF MY HEARTPORT SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY
    BROKER VOTE MY SHARES FOR ME?

A: Your broker will vote your Heartport shares only if you provide instructions
   on how to vote. You should follow the directions provided by your broker
   regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your shares. Without
   instructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the effect of a
   vote against adoption of the merger agreement.

Q:  SHOULD I SEND IN MY STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A: No. After the merger is completed, you will receive a transmittal form with
   instructions for the surrender of Heartport common stock certificates. Please
   do not send in your stock certificates with your proxy.

Q:  WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A: We are working to complete the merger as quickly as possible. If approved by
   the Heartport stockholders, we expect to complete the merger during the
   second quarter of 2001.

the legal terms of the merger, you should carefully read this entire proxy
statement/prospectus and the other documents to which we refer you, including in
particular the copies of the merger agreement, the stockholder agreement and the
opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated that are attached to this proxy
statement/prospectus as Annexes 1, 2 and 3, respectively. See also "Where You

                                    GENERAL

WHAT HEARTPORT STOCKHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE IN THE MERGER

     In the merger, holders of Heartport common stock will receive a fraction of
a share of Johnson & Johnson common stock based on an exchange ratio for each
share of Heartport common stock that they own. The exchange ratio will be
calculated by dividing $2.72 by the average per share closing price of Johnson &
Johnson common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Transactions Tape during a period of 20 trading days ending on the second
trading day immediately preceding the date on which the merger is completed.

     Heartport stockholders will receive cash for any fractional shares of
Johnson & Johnson common stock they would otherwise receive in the merger. The
amount each Heartport stockholder will receive will be calculated by multiplying
the fractional share interest to which that stockholder is entitled by the
closing price of Johnson & Johnson common stock on the date on which the merger
is completed as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions
Tape.

     On March [--], 2001, the last practicable trading day before the date of
this proxy statement/prospectus, Johnson & Johnson common stock closed at $[--]
per share. If this were the average closing price of Johnson & Johnson common
stock during the 20 trading day valuation period, the exchange ratio would be
equal to [--]. This means that a Heartport stockholder who owns 150 shares of
Heartport common stock would be entitled to receive [--] shares of Johnson &
Johnson common stock. Since cash will be paid instead of fractional shares of
Johnson & Johnson common stock, that Heartport stockholder would receive [--]
shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock and a check in an amount equal to the
fractional share multiplied by the closing price of Johnson & Johnson common
stock on the date on which the merger is completed.

     The market value of Johnson & Johnson common stock on the day the merger is
completed may be different than the average closing price of Johnson & Johnson
common stock used in determining the exchange ratio. As a result, the market
value of the shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock that you receive in the
merger may be more or less than the value attributed to your shares of Heartport
common stock in calculating the exchange ratio.

OWNERSHIP OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON FOLLOWING THE MERGER

     Based on the number of outstanding shares of Heartport common stock on the
record date and the closing price of Johnson & Johnson common stock on March
[--], 2001, we anticipate that Heartport stockholders will receive approximately
[--] shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock in the merger. Based on that
number and on the number of outstanding shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock
on March [--], 2001, Heartport stockholders will own approximately [--]% of the
outstanding shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock following the merger.

APPRAISAL/DISSENTERS' RIGHTS (PAGE 29)

     Stockholders of Heartport who do not vote in favor of adoption of the
merger agreement and who otherwise comply with the requirements of the Delaware
General Corporation Law relating to appraisal rights will be entitled to receive
an amount in cash equal to the fair value of their Heartport common stock.
Heartport stockholders may also be entitled to exercise dissenters' rights under
the California General Corporation Law. The fair value of shares of Heartport
common

stock as determined in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware or
California law may be more or less than the value of the Johnson & Johnson
common stock to be paid to non-dissenting Heartport stockholders in the merger.
DISSENTING HEARTPORT STOCKHOLDERS MUST PRECISELY FOLLOW SPECIFIC PROCEDURES TO
EXERCISE THIS RIGHT, OR THE RIGHT MAY BE LOST. These procedures, which differ in
some important respects under Delaware law and California law, are described in
this proxy statement/prospectus, and the relevant provisions of Delaware and
California law are attached hereto as Annex 4 and Annex 5, respectively. You are
urged to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER (PAGE 27)

     The merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Assuming the merger
qualifies as a reorganization, holders of Heartport common stock will not
recognize gain or loss for United States Federal income tax purposes as a result
of the exchange of their Heartport common stock for Johnson & Johnson common
stock in the merger, except for cash received instead of fractional shares of
Johnson & Johnson common stock. It is important to note, however, that if the
amount of cash that is required to be paid by Heartport or Johnson & Johnson in
order to satisfy those stockholders who have exercised appraisal/ dissenters'
rights exceeds certain threshold levels, the merger will not qualify as a
reorganization. Because there is no limit on the number of stockholders who may
exercise appraisal/ dissenters' rights, there can be no assurance that the
merger will qualify as a reorganization. If the merger does not qualify as a
reorganization, each holder of Heartport common stock will recognize gain or
loss equal to the difference between the fair market value of the Johnson &
Johnson common stock received in the merger and his or her tax basis in the
Heartport common stock surrendered in exchange therefor. Regardless of whether
the merger qualifies as a reorganization, holders of Heartport common stock who
exercise appraisal/dissenters' rights will generally recognize gain or loss upon
receipt of cash in exchange for their Heartport common stock. See "The
Merger -- Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger"
on page 27.
     TAX MATTERS ARE VERY COMPLICATED AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO
YOU WILL DEPEND ON THE FACTS OF YOUR OWN SITUATION. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN
TAX ADVISORS FOR A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO
YOU.

RECOMMENDATION OF HEARTPORT'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS (PAGE 19)

     The Heartport board of directors believes that the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best
interests of Heartport and its stockholders and unanimously recommends that the
stockholders vote "FOR" adoption of the merger agreement.

     To review the background of and reasons for the merger, as well as certain
risks related to the merger, see "The Merger -- Background to the Merger" on
page 15 and "The Merger -- Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of
Heartport's Board of Directors" on page 17.

OPINION OF MORGAN STANLEY & CO. INCORPORATED (PAGE 19)

     In deciding to approve the merger, the Heartport board of directors
considered the opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, its financial
advisor in connection with the merger, that, as of January 25, 2001, the day
before the date of the merger agreement, and based upon and subject to certain
matters described in the opinion, the consideration to be received by the
Heartport stockholders was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
Heartport stockholders. The opinion addresses only the fairness of the
consideration to be received by the Heartport stockholders from a financial
point of view, does not address the merits of the underlying decision by
Heartport to engage in the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to
any Heartport stockholder as to how to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement. The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, which sets
forth assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review
undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex 3. You are urged
to read the opinion carefully and in its entirety.

INTERESTS OF HEARTPORT DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGER (PAGE 23)

     In considering the recommendation of the Heartport board of directors in
favor of adoption of the merger agreement, Heartport stockholders should be
aware that Heartport directors and executive officers have interests in the
merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of other
Heartport stockholders. These interests include the continuance of rights of
indemnification, the accelerated vesting of certain stock option rights and, for
certain directors and executive officers, cash severance and bonus payments.

MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RIGHTS OF COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON
AND HEARTPORT (PAGE 49)

     Heartport stockholders, whose rights are currently governed by Heartport's
certificate of incorporation, by-laws, Delaware law and, in certain respects,
California law, will, upon completion of the merger, become stockholders of
Johnson & Johnson and their rights will be governed by Johnson & Johnson's
certificate of incorporation, by-laws and New Jersey law.

                         THE SPECIAL MEETING (PAGE 12)

     The special meeting of Heartport stockholders will be held at the offices
of Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian, LLP, 155
Constitution Drive, Menlo Park, California, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on April
[--], 2001. At the special meeting, Heartport stockholders will be asked to
adopt the merger agreement.

RECORD DATE; VOTING POWER

     Heartport stockholders are entitled to vote at the special meeting if they
owned shares of Heartport common stock as of the close of business on March
[--], 2001, the record date.

     On the record date, there were [--] shares of Heartport common stock
entitled to vote at the special meeting. Stockholders will have one vote at the
special meeting for each share of Heartport common stock that they owned on the
record date.

VOTES REQUIRED

     The adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of
stockholders holding a majority of the shares of Heartport common stock
outstanding on the record date.

VOTING BY HEARTPORT DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND AFFILIATES

     On the record date, directors and executive officers of Heartport and their
affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled to vote [7,975,982] shares of
Heartport common stock, which represented approximately [30.2]% of the shares of
Heartport common stock outstanding on that date. All directors and executive
officers of Heartport and their affiliates have agreed to vote in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement. See "The Stockholder Agreement" on page 45.

                              THE MERGER (PAGE 15)

     The merger agreement is attached as Annex 1 to this proxy
statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read the merger agreement because it
is the principal document governing the merger.

CONDITIONS TO THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER (PAGE 36)

     Johnson & Johnson and Heartport will complete the merger only if several
conditions are satisfied or, in some cases, waived, including the following:

     - the merger agreement has been adopted by the affirmative vote of
       stockholders of Heartport representing a majority of the shares of
       Heartport common stock outstanding on the record date

     - the shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock to be issued to Heartport
       stockholders upon completion of the merger have been approved for listing

       rule, legal

       restraint or prohibition is in effect that prevents the completion of the

       in all material respects.

     In addition, Johnson & Johnson will complete the merger only if there is no
pending or threatened suit, action or preceding by any governmental entity
seeking to restrain or prohibit the completion of the merger, to limit Johnson &
Johnson's or Heartport's ownership or operation of either company's business or
assets, to compel Johnson & Johnson or Heartport to divest or hold separate any
business or assets as a result of the merger, to prevent Johnson & Johnson from
effectively controlling in any material respect the business or operations of
Heartport or otherwise having, or being reasonably expected to have, a material
adverse effect on Heartport.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (PAGE 39)

     The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the completion
of the merger, even if the merger agreement has been adopted by the Heartport
stockholders:

     - by mutual written consent of Johnson & Johnson and Heartport

     - by either Johnson & Johnson or Heartport, if the merger has not been
       completed by July 26, 2001

     - by either Johnson & Johnson or Heartport, if there exists a final,
       nonappealable restraining order, injunction or other court order or
       statute, law, rule, legal restraint or prohibition that prevents
       completion of the merger

     - by either Johnson & Johnson or Heartport, if the Heartport stockholders
       do not adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting

     - by either Johnson & Johnson or Heartport, if the other party has breached
       any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
       in the merger agreement, which breach would result in a failure of a
       condition to the merger and cannot be or has not been cured within the
       time periods specified in the merger agreement or

     - by Johnson & Johnson, if the Heartport board of directors withdraws, or
       modifies in a manner adverse to Johnson & Johnson, or proposes to
       withdraw, or modify in a manner adverse to Johnson & Johnson, its
       approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability of the merger
       agreement or the merger or recommends, adopts or approves, or proposes
       publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any proposal of a third party to
       acquire 15% or more of Heartport's assets or 15% or more of the Heartport
       common stock or a merger or similar transaction involving Heartport and a
       third party.

TERMINATION FEE (PAGE 40)

     Heartport must pay to Johnson & Johnson a termination fee of $5.75 million
if:

     - Johnson & Johnson terminates the merger agreement for any reason
       described in the last bullet point above under "-- Termination of the
       Merger Agreement" or

     - (a) a proposal of a third party to acquire 15% or more of Heartport's
       assets or 15% or more of the Heartport common stock or a merger or
       similar transaction involving Heartport and a third party has been made
       to Heartport or its stockholders or otherwise publicly disclosed, (b) the
       merger agreement is terminated by either Johnson & Johnson or Heartport
       for the reason described in the second bullet point above under
       "-- Termination of the Merger Agreement" without a vote on the merger
       agreement having been taken at the special meeting of Heartport
       stockholders or for the reason described in fourth bullet point

above under "-- Termination of the Merger Agreement" and (c) within 12 months of
the termination of the merger agreement, Heartport enters into a definitive
agreement for, or completes, any such alternative transaction.

THE STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT (PAGE 45)

     Stockholders of Heartport who held approximately [30.2]% of the outstanding
shares of Heartport common stock on the record date have entered into a
stockholder agreement with Johnson & Johnson. Under the terms of the stockholder
agreement, these stockholders have agreed to vote all of their shares of
Heartport common stock in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and to take
or refrain from taking certain other actions. In addition, these stockholders
have agreed that, in certain circumstances, they will pay to Johnson & Johnson
the difference between the amount they receive in their capacity as stockholders
from the consummation by Heartport of an alternative transaction and what they
are entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement with Johnson &
Johnson as in effect on January 26, 2001.

REGULATORY MATTERS (PAGE 29)

     United States antitrust laws prohibit Johnson & Johnson and Heartport from
completing the merger until they have furnished certain information and
materials to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal
Trade Commission and a required waiting period has ended. Johnson & Johnson and
Heartport each filed the required notification and report forms with the
Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission on February 16, 2001 and
have requested an early termination of the required waiting period. If early
termination of the required waiting period is not granted and a request for
additional information by the relevant antitrust authorities is not made, the
waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
will expire at midnight on March 18, 2001.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     Johnson & Johnson intends to treat the merger as a purchase for accounting
and financial reporting purposes, which means that Heartport will be treated as
a separate entity for periods prior to the completion of the merger and,
thereafter, Heartport's financial results will be consolidated with Johnson &
Johnson's financial results.

FEES AND EXPENSES (PAGE 40)

     Each of Johnson & Johnson and Heartport will pay its own fees and expenses
in connection with the merger, except that they will share equally the expenses
incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the registration
statement of which this proxy statement/ prospectus is a part and the filing
fees for the premerger notification and report forms under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.

                STOCK PRICES AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION (PAGE 47)

     Shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock are listed on the New York Stock
Exchange. Shares of Heartport common stock are listed on

The Nasdaq SmallCap Market. The following table presents:

     - the last reported sale price of a share of Johnson & Johnson common
       stock, as reported by the Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

     - the last reported sale price of a share of Heartport common stock, as
       reported on The Nasdaq SmallCap Market and

     - the market value of a share of Heartport common stock on an equivalent
       per share basis

announcement of the proposed merger, and on March [--], 2001, the last
practicable trading day prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus.
The equivalent price per share data for Heartport common stock has been
determined by multiplying the last reported sale price of a share of Johnson &

does not pay dividends. See "Comparative Stock Prices and Dividend Information"
on page 47.

                       COMPARATIVE PER SHARE INFORMATION

     The following table shows certain per share data of Johnson & Johnson and
Heartport and also shows similar information reflecting the combination of the
two companies, which is referred to as "pro forma" information. In presenting
the comparative pro forma information, it is assumed that the companies have
been separate entities for accounting and financial reporting purposes for all
periods presented, as required by purchase accounting.

     The comparative per share data is derived from, and should be read with,
the historical financial statements of Johnson & Johnson and the historical
financial statements of Heartport that are included in the documents described
under "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 61.

     The Heartport "equivalent pro forma" data was calculated by multiplying the
corresponding pro forma combined data by an exchange ratio of 0.0279, which
would have been the exchange ratio had the merger been completed on January 25,
2001, the last full trading day prior to the public announcement of the proposed
merger. This data shows how each share of Heartport common stock would have
participated in net income and book value of Johnson & Johnson if the companies
had always been combined for accounting and financial reporting purposes for all
periods presented. These amounts, however, are not intended to reflect future
per share levels of net income and book value of Johnson & Johnson. Heartport
has not declared or paid any cash dividends during any of the periods presented.

                                                                                  NINE MONTHS ENDED

                      RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE MERGER

     In addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference
in this proxy statement/prospectus, Heartport stockholders should consider
carefully the matters described below in determining whether to adopt the merger
agreement.

     THE EXCHANGE RATIO USED TO DETERMINE HOW MANY SHARES OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON
COMMON STOCK HEARTPORT STOCKHOLDERS WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE UPON COMPLETION
OF THE MERGER WILL NOT BE CALCULATED UNTIL AFTER THE SPECIAL MEETING, AND COULD
BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE ESTIMATED EXCHANGE RATIO INCLUDED IN THIS PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS.  Under the merger agreement, each share of Heartport
common stock will be converted into the right to receive a fraction of a share
of Johnson & Johnson common stock based on an exchange ratio that will be
calculated shortly before the completion of the merger. We have included in this
proxy statement/prospectus an estimated exchange ratio based on the closing
price of Johnson & Johnson common stock on March [--], 2001, the last
practicable trading day before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. The
actual exchange ratio could be higher or lower than this estimated exchange
ratio, which would result in Heartport stockholders receiving a greater or
lesser number of shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock upon completion of the
merger than they would receive based upon the estimated exchange ratio.

     THE MARKET VALUE OF SHARES OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON COMMON STOCK RECEIVED BY
HEARTPORT STOCKHOLDERS IN THE MERGER MAY BE MORE OR LESS THAN THE VALUE
ATTRIBUTED TO SHARES OF HEARTPORT COMMON STOCK IN CALCULATING THE EXCHANGE
RATIO.  The exchange ratio will be calculated by dividing $2.72 by the average
per share closing price of Johnson & Johnson common stock during a period of 20
trading days ending on the second trading day immediately preceding the date on
which the merger is completed. The market value of Johnson & Johnson common
stock on the date on which the merger is completed may be different than the
average Johnson & Johnson share price used in determining the exchange ratio. As
a result, the market value of the shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock that
Heartport stockholders will receive in the merger may be more or less than the
value attributed to shares of Heartport common stock in calculating the exchange
ratio.

     IF THE AMOUNT OF CASH THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE PAID BY HEARTPORT OR JOHNSON &
JOHNSON IN ORDER TO SATISFY THOSE HEARTPORT STOCKHOLDERS WHO HAVE EXERCISED
APPRAISAL/DISSENTERS' RIGHTS EXCEEDS CERTAIN THRESHOLD LEVELS, THE MERGER WILL
NOT QUALIFY AS A REORGANIZATION WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 368(A) OF THE
INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.  Because there is no limit on the number of stockholders
who may exercise appraisal/dissenters' rights, there can be no assurance that
the merger will qualify as a reorganization. If the merger does not qualify as a
reorganization, each holder of Heartport common stock will recognize gain or
loss equal to the difference between the fair market value of the Johnson &
Johnson common stock received in the merger and his or her tax basis in the
Heartport common stock surrendered in exchange therefor. See "The
Merger -- Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger"
on page 27.

     THE PRICE OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON COMMON STOCK MAY BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS
DIFFERENT FROM THOSE AFFECTING THE PRICE OF HEARTPORT COMMON STOCK.  Upon
completion of the merger, holders of Heartport common stock will become holders
of Johnson & Johnson common stock. Johnson & Johnson's business differs from
that of Heartport and Johnson & Johnson's results of operations, as well as the
price of Johnson & Johnson common stock, may be affected by factors different
from those affecting Heartport's results of operations and the price of
Heartport common stock. For a discussion of Johnson & Johnson's and Heartport's
businesses and certain factors to consider in connection with such businesses,
see Johnson & Johnson's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
January 2, 2000, which is incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus, and Heartport's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2000, which is incorporated by reference in, and accompanies,
this proxy statement/prospectus.

                              THE SPECIAL MEETING

     We are furnishing this proxy statement/prospectus to stockholders of
Heartport as of the record date as part of the solicitation of proxies by the
Heartport board of directors for use at the special meeting.

DATE, TIME AND PLACE

     We will hold the special meeting at the offices of Gunderson Dettmer Stough
Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian, LLP, 155 Constitution Drive, Menlo Park,
California, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on April [--], 2001.

PURPOSE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

     At the special meeting, we will ask holders of Heartport common stock to
adopt the merger agreement. The Heartport board of directors has determined that
the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are
advisable to, and in the best interests of, Heartport and its stockholders, has
unanimously adopted and approved the merger agreement and the merger and
unanimously recommends that Heartport stockholders vote "FOR" adoption of the
merger agreement.

RECORD DATE; SHARES ENTITLED TO VOTE; QUORUM

     Only holders of record of Heartport common stock at the close of business
on March [--], 2001, the record date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at
the special meeting. On the record date, [--] shares of Heartport common stock
were issued and outstanding and held by approximately [--] holders of record. A
quorum is present at the special meeting if a majority of all of the shares of
Heartport common stock issued and outstanding on the record date and entitled to
vote at the special meeting are represented at the special meeting in person or
by a properly executed proxy. In the event that a quorum is not present at the
special meeting, it is expected that the meeting will be adjourned or postponed
to solicit additional proxies. Holders of record of Heartport common stock on
the record date are entitled to one vote per share on each matter submitted to a
vote at the special meeting.

VOTES REQUIRED

     The adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of
stockholders holding a majority of the shares of Heartport common stock
outstanding on the record date. Because the required vote of Heartport
stockholders is based upon the number of outstanding shares of Heartport common
stock, rather than upon the number of shares actually voted, the failure by the
holder of any outstanding shares to submit a proxy or to vote in person at the
special meeting, including abstentions and broker non-votes, will have the same
effect as a vote against adoption of the merger agreement.

VOTING BY HEARTPORT DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND AFFILIATES

     At the close of business on the record date, directors and executive
officers of Heartport and their affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled
to vote [7,975,982] shares of Heartport common stock, which represented
approximately [30.2]% of the shares of Heartport common stock outstanding on
that date. All directors and executive officers of Heartport and their
affiliates have agreed to vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.
See "The Stockholder Agreement" on page 45.

VOTING OF PROXIES

     All shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for
the special meeting will be voted at the special meeting in the manner specified
by the holders. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting
instructions will be voted "FOR" adoption of the merger agreement.

     Shares of Heartport common stock represented at the special meeting but not
voting, including shares of Heartport common stock for which proxies have been
received but for which holders of shares have

abstained, will be treated as present at the special meeting for purposes of
determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of all
business.

     Brokers who hold shares of Heartport common stock in "street name" for
customers who are the beneficial owners of such shares may not give a proxy to
vote those customers' shares in the absence of specific instructions from those
customers. These non-voted shares are referred to as broker non-votes and count
as votes against adoption of the merger agreement.

     The persons named as proxies by a stockholder may propose and vote for one
or more adjournments of the special meeting, including adjournments to permit
further solicitations of proxies. No proxy voted against the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement will be voted in favor of any such adjournment or
postponement.

     Heartport does not expect that any matter other than the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement will be brought before the special meeting. If, however,
the Heartport board of directors properly presents other matters, the persons
named as proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment.

REVOCABILITY OF PROXIES

     The grant of a proxy on the enclosed form of proxy does not preclude a
stockholder from voting in person at the special meeting. A stockholder may
revoke a proxy at any time prior to its exercise by submitting to Heartport a
properly executed revocation of proxy, by submitting to Heartport a properly
executed proxy bearing a later date or by appearing at the special meeting and
voting in person. If a stockholder chooses either of the first two methods, the
notice of revocation or new proxy, as the case may be, must be submitted to
Heartport at 700 Bay Road, Redwood City, California 94063, Attention:
Stockholder Relations. Attendance at the special meeting will not in and of
itself constitute revocation of a proxy.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     Heartport will bear the cost of the solicitation of proxies from its
stockholders. In addition to solicitation by mail, the directors, officers and
employees of Heartport may solicit proxies from stockholders by telephone or
other electronic means or in person. Heartport will cause brokerage houses and
other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward solicitation materials to
the beneficial owners of stock held of record by such persons. Heartport will
reimburse such custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses in doing so.

     Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. will assist in the solicitation
of proxies by Heartport. Heartport will pay Georgeson a fee of $10,000, plus
reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses, and will indemnify Georgeson
against any losses arising out of its proxy solicitation services on behalf of
Heartport.

     STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT SEND STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH THEIR PROXIES.  A
transmittal form with instructions for the surrender of Heartport common stock
certificates will be mailed to Heartport stockholders shortly after completion
of the merger.

                                   THE MERGER

BACKGROUND TO THE MERGER

     Beginning in the fall of 1999, Heartport's management and board of
directors began discussing the possibility of finding a strategic business
partner for the purposes of:

     - leveraging Heartport's products through a larger, more established sales
       organization

     - gaining greater market share in the beating heart surgical market
       utilizing an established sales organization

     - gaining greater protection of intellectual property rights and

     - gaining greater access to capital to fund operational growth and key
       product development initiatives.

     On November 19, 1999, the Heartport board of directors discussed the need
to engage an independent financial advisor to assist Heartport in finding a
strategic business partner. On December 9, 1999, Heartport engaged Morgan
Stanley & Co. Incorporated to:

     - assist Heartport in identifying and evaluating candidates for a potential
       sale or merger

     - contact potential candidates which Heartport and Morgan Stanley believed
       to be appropriate for a sale or merger and

     - meet with and interact with potential candidates in the context of
       assisting Heartport in evaluating and negotiating a potential sale or
       merger.

     Subsequent to December 9, 1999, Morgan Stanley conducted an auction process
for Heartport. Initially, Morgan Stanley strategically targeted two companies,
including Johnson & Johnson. Both companies expressed initial interest in the
proposal and formally began discussions with Heartport under confidentiality
agreements that had been entered into with Heartport earlier in the fall of
1999. Senior members of Heartport's management and representatives of Morgan
Stanley sent descriptive materials regarding Heartport to each of the two
companies.

     On January 20, 2000, Morgan Stanley presented to the Heartport board of
directors an initial overview of the two interested companies. Between January
2000 and March 2000, senior members of Heartport's management and
representatives of Morgan Stanley held due diligence meetings and conference
calls with Johnson & Johnson and the other company. After a lengthy due
diligence process, Johnson & Johnson and the other company both withdrew from
bidding for reasons related to valuation.

     During March 2000, senior management of Heartport and representatives of
Morgan Stanley contacted four additional companies to ascertain their interest
with respect to a potential business combination. Each of these companies showed
little interest.

     Between March 2000 and January 2001, Heartport's management and Morgan
Stanley conducted ongoing discussions regarding potential strategic and
financing alternatives.

     On March 23, 2000, the Heartport board of directors discussed the viability
of other strategic alternatives in the event that an acceptable business
combination transaction could not be achieved.

     In the first week of January 2001, Heartport received an unsolicited oral
offer from Johnson & Johnson to exchange shares of Johnson & Johnson common
stock for shares of Heartport common stock at a specified value. Heartport
evaluated this offer and eventually rejected the offer based upon valuation.

     Johnson & Johnson responded on or about January 12, 2001 by orally offering
to discuss a higher valuation and requesting that Johnson & Johnson and
Heartport continue discussions. Due diligence meetings and conference calls
between Heartport and Johnson & Johnson resumed.

     Between January 12, 2001 and January 25, 2001, Johnson & Johnson and
Heartport engaged in several conference calls and other due diligence
activities. Simultaneously, Heartport, Johnson & Johnson

and their respective legal counsel engaged in contract negotiations for the
proposed acquisition of Heartport by Johnson & Johnson, subject to the companies
coming to an agreement as to valuation.

     During the week of January 15, 2001, Morgan Stanley, on behalf of
Heartport, contacted other companies to ascertain interest levels with respect
to a potential business combination transaction with Heartport.

     On January 24, 2001, a company made an oral offer for each outstanding
share of Heartport common stock, subject to a full due diligence review being
completed by that company. This offer was rejected due to its low valuation in
comparison to the expected value of the forthcoming Johnson & Johnson bid.

     On January 24, 2001, the Heartport board of directors met to discuss the
proposed merger with Johnson & Johnson. Morgan Stanley presented its assessment
of the transaction in view of other prospects for a merger and presented its
opinion that the consideration offered by Johnson & Johnson was fair from a
financial point of view. The Heartport board of directors extensively discussed
the proposed merger and authorized management to continue discussions regarding
the terms and conditions of the proposed merger.

     On January 25, 2001, Johnson & Johnson submitted a final offer to Heartport
of $2.72 for each outstanding share of Heartport common stock, or approximately
$81 million in the aggregate, to be paid in Johnson & Johnson common stock.
Johnson & Johnson's offer was subject to certain conditions, including the
following:

     - Heartport's directors and executive officers and their affiliates
       entering into a stockholder agreement with Johnson & Johnson pursuant to
       which such stockholders would agree to vote in favor of a merger with
       Johnson & Johnson

     - Heartport agreeing that neither it nor any of its officers, directors,
       employees or agents would solicit, initiate or encourage competing offers
       to purchase Heartport or a substantial portion of its business; provided,
       however, that legitimate unsolicited offers could be considered pursuant
       to the board's fiduciary responsibility to Heartport's stockholders,
       subject to Heartport's compliance with the specific provisions in the
       merger agreement relating to this matter, and

     - the stockholders entering into the stockholder agreement agreeing to the
       profit recoupment provisions described on page 45 below under "The
       Stockholder Agreement -- Profit Recoupment Provisions".

     On January 25, 2001, the Heartport board of directors met again with
representatives from Morgan Stanley and Heartport's legal counsel. The Heartport
board of directors entered into extensive discussion with and questioning of the
representatives of Morgan Stanley and Heartport's legal counsel regarding
Johnson & Johnson's offer, including the terms and conditions of the offer, the
stockholder agreement and the termination fee proposed by Johnson & Johnson. In
addition, the Heartport board of directors discussed the importance of
minimizing the ability of Johnson & Johnson to terminate the merger agreement as
a result of adverse changes to Heartport's business related to the announcement
of the merger. After these discussions, the Heartport board of directors
unanimously:

     - declared advisable the merger and the merger agreement and declared the
       contemplated transactions to be fair to, and in the best interests of,
       Heartport and its stockholders

     - approved the merger agreement and the stockholder agreement

     - directed that the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of
       the stockholders of Heartport

     - recommended that the stockholders of Heartport adopt the merger agreement
       and

     - approved an amendment to Heartport's rights plan that would permit the
       merger with Johnson & Johnson to be completed without triggering
       Heartport's rights plan.

     In the early morning of January 26, 2001, the parties executed and
delivered the merger agreement, the stockholder agreement and the amendment to
Heartport's rights plan and issued a joint press release announcing the
execution of the merger agreement.

     On February 16, 2001, the parties executed and delivered an amended an
restated merger agreement dated and effective as of January 26, 2001, the date
of the original merger agreement, in which certain technical and other
amendments were made to the original merger agreement.

REASONS FOR THE MERGER AND RECOMMENDATION OF HEARTPORT'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     REASONS FOR THE MERGER.  In reaching its decision to approve the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and to recommend the
adoption of the merger agreement by Heartport's stockholders, Heartport's board
of directors consulted with its management team, financial advisors, legal
counsel and other advisors. In making its decision, Heartport's board of
directors carefully weighed the following factors, which is not intended to be
an exhaustive list, but includes all material factors considered:

     - its belief that a higher sale price could not be obtained in view of:

        - the fact that no higher offer had emerged in the process run by
          Heartport and its advisors to solicit indications of interest in a
          business combination with Heartport,

        - the fact that the only other offer received was conditional and at a
          price significantly lower than the offer received from Johnson &
          Johnson,

        - the fact that the value of $2.72 for each outstanding share of
          Heartport common stock offered by Johnson & Johnson represented a
          premium of 61.2% over the closing price of Heartport one month prior
          to the announcement of the transaction and a premium of 31.9% over the
          closing price of Heartport on January 25, 2001, the last full trading
          day prior to the public announcement of the proposed merger and

        - its belief that, based upon a lengthy search of over a year, it was
          not possible to achieve a higher price from Johnson & Johnson or any
          other party

     - the opinion of Morgan Stanley that, as of January 25, 2001, and based
       upon and subject to the various considerations in its opinion, the
       consideration to be received by the Heartport stockholders in the merger
       was fair from a financial point of view to the Heartport stockholders

     - the financial position and business prospects of Johnson & Johnson, a
       large, well-capitalized merger partner

     - the opportunity for Heartport's stockholders to reduce their exposure to
       risks and dilution associated with Heartport's need to obtain additional
       capital resources in order to continue to grow its operations

     - the opportunity for Heartport's stockholders to reduce their exposure to
       the risks and costs associated with the repayment or restructuring of
       Heartport's existing long-term debt obligations of approximately $48.0
       million, which exceeded Heartport's cash and cash equivalents of
       approximately $11.4 million as of December 31, 2000

     - the opportunity for Heartport's stockholders to reduce their exposure to
       the risks associated with Heartport's reliance on a limited product line
       and the difficulty of competing against larger, more diversified
       companies with substantially greater financial resources

     - the changing healthcare environment, with its increasing focus on cost
       containment, coupled with the trend of consolidation in the medical
       device industry

     - the ability to fund and accelerate product development and product line
       diversification by leveraging the resources and technological expertise
       of the combined company

     - the fact that, although the actual number of shares of Johnson & Johnson
       common stock that a Heartport stockholder will be entitled to receive in
       the merger will not be determined until shortly before the completion of
       the merger, the consideration of $2.72 per share of Heartport common
       stock is fixed and not subject to change based on changes in the market
       valuation of Johnson & Johnson common stock

     - the fact that the merger will afford Heartport's stockholders an
       opportunity to retain an equity interest in the combined company in a
       transaction designed to result in a tax-free exchange and to achieve
       substantially greater liquidity than could be achieved by holding shares
       of Heartport common stock, which are currently listed on The Nasdaq
       SmallCap Market and have an average daily trading volume of approximately
       193,000 shares, as opposed to holding shares of Johnson & Johnson common
       stock, which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and have an
       average daily trading volume of approximately 3.4 million shares

     - Johnson & Johnson's inability to terminate the merger agreement in the
       event there were materially adverse changes to Heartport's business based
       on:

        - changes affecting the medical devices industry generally and not
          specifically relating to Heartport,

        - changes affecting the United States economy generally,

        - a decrease in the price of the Heartport common stock or the failure
          by Heartport to meet or exceed Wall Street research analysts' or
          Heartport's internal earnings or other estimates or projections, in
          each case in and of itself,

        - any adverse change or effect resulting from compliance by Heartport
          with the terms of the merger agreement or

        - any adverse change or effect resulting from certain matters set forth
          in the disclosure letter delivered by Heartport to Johnson & Johnson
          in connection with the merger agreement and

     - the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the belief of
       Heartport's board of directors that the parties will be able to satisfy
       the closing conditions.

     Heartport's board of directors also identified and considered a number of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger,
including:

     - the recognition that Johnson & Johnson common stock is currently trading
       near its all-time high, and the risk that such market valuation might not
       be sustained in the future

     - the risk that, prior to and after the merger, key personnel might leave
       Heartport and

     - the risk that the potential benefits of the merger might not be fully
       realized.

     Heartport's board of directors discussed with Heartport's management and
financial and legal advisors the prospects for business combination transactions
with companies other than Johnson & Johnson and whether incremental or superior
benefits could be achieved through such transactions. Heartport's board of
directors also discussed the risks and benefits of a stand-alone strategy. After
reviewing the potentially negative factors, Heartport's board of directors
concluded that such negative factors were outweighed by the positive factors
and, accordingly, determined that the merger is fair to, and in the best
interests of, Heartport and its stockholders.

     In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its
evaluation of the merger and the merger agreement and the stockholder agreement,
Heartport's board of directors did not find it practicable to and did not
quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to the specific factors considered
in reaching its determination. In addition, individual members of Heartport's
board of directors may have given different weight to different factors.

     RECOMMENDATION OF HEARTPORT'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  After careful
consideration, Heartport's board of directors has unanimously approved and
adopted the merger agreement and determined that the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best
interests of Heartport and its stockholders. Heartport's board of directors
unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Heartport vote "FOR" the
adoption of the merger agreement.

OPINION OF MORGAN STANLEY & CO. INCORPORATED

     Pursuant to an engagement letter agreement dated December 9, 1999,
Heartport engaged Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated to provide financial
advisory services and a financial fairness opinion to Heartport in connection
with the merger. Heartport selected Morgan Stanley to act as Heartport's
financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley's qualifications, expertise and
reputation, and its knowledge of the business and affairs of Heartport. On
January 24, 2001, at the meeting of the Heartport board of directors held to
evaluate the proposed merger, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed in writing on January 25, 2001, that, based upon and
subject to the various considerations set forth in the opinion, the
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Heartport common stock
pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such
holders.

     THE FULL TEXT OF THE WRITTEN OPINION OF MORGAN STANLEY DATED JANUARY 25,
2001, WHICH SETS FORTH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, PROCEDURES
FOLLOWED, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS ON THE SCOPE OF THE REVIEW
UNDERTAKEN BY MORGAN STANLEY IN RENDERING ITS OPINION, IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX 3 TO
THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. HEARTPORT STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO, AND
SHOULD, READ THE OPINION CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. MORGAN STANLEY'S OPINION
ADDRESSES ONLY THE FAIRNESS FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW OF THE CONSIDERATION
TO BE RECEIVED BY THE HEARTPORT STOCKHOLDERS IN THE MERGER AS OF THE DATE OF THE
OPINION, DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE MERGER AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE
A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY HEARTPORT STOCKHOLDER AS TO HOW TO VOTE AT THE HEARTPORT
SPECIAL MEETING. THE SUMMARY OF THE OPINION OF MORGAN STANLEY SET FORTH IN THIS
PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL
TEXT OF SUCH OPINION.

     In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other
things:

     - reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other
       information of Heartport and Johnson & Johnson

     - reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and
       operating data concerning Heartport prepared by the management of
       Heartport

     - analyzed certain financial projections prepared by the management of
       Heartport

     - discussed past and current operations and financial condition and the
       prospects of Heartport and Johnson & Johnson, including information
       relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits
       anticipated from the merger, with senior executives of Heartport

     - reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for Heartport common
       stock and Johnson & Johnson common stock

     - compared the financial performance of Heartport and Johnson & Johnson and
       the prices and trading activity of Heartport common stock and Johnson &
       Johnson common stock with that of certain other comparable publicly
       traded companies and their securities

     - reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of
       certain comparable acquisition transactions

     - participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of
       Heartport and Johnson & Johnson and their financial and legal advisors

     - reviewed the draft merger agreement and certain related documents and

     - performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as Morgan
       Stanley deemed appropriate.

     In rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without
independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information
reviewed by it for the purposes of its opinion. Morgan Stanley did not receive
financial forecasts or internal financial information for Johnson & Johnson and
instead relied on the publicly available estimates of selected analysts who
report on Johnson & Johnson. With respect to the financial projections,
including information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational
benefits anticipated from the merger, Morgan Stanley assumed that they have been
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments of the future financial performance of Heartport and Johnson &
Johnson. Morgan Stanley relied upon the assessments of the management of
Heartport of the strategic, financial and other benefits expected to result from
the merger and the validity of, and risks associated with, Heartport's existing
and future products, technologies or services. In addition, Morgan Stanley
assumed that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set
forth in the merger agreement, including, among other things, that the merger
will be treated as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986.

     Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the
assets or liabilities of Heartport, nor was it furnished with any such
appraisals. Morgan Stanley's opinion is necessarily based on financial,
economic, market or other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to it as of, January 25, 2001.

     The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by
Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the preparation of its
written opinion letter dated January 25, 2001. These summaries of financial
analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully
understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be
read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute
a complete description of the financial analyses.

     PEER GROUP COMPARISON.  Using publicly available information, Morgan
Stanley compared selected historical and estimated stock price and financial
ratios for a group of selected publicly traded companies in the medical device
industry that share similar characteristics with Heartport for the purposes of
this analysis. The companies comparable to Heartport included:

    - Boston Scientific Corporation
    - Edwards Lifesciences Corporation
    - Guidant Corporation
    - Medtronic, Inc. and
    - St. Jude Medical, Inc.

     Morgan Stanley calculated the price of each of the comparable companies'
common stock as a multiple of estimated calendar year 2001 earnings per share,
or "EPS". Morgan Stanley also calculated the aggregate value, defined as market
capitalization plus total debt less cash and cash equivalents, as a multiple of:

     - last twelve months' revenues as reported in publicly available filings of
       the companies

     - estimated calendar year 2001 revenue

     - estimated calendar year 2001 EBITDA, defined as earnings before interest,
       taxes, depreciation and amortization, and

     - estimated calendar year 2001 EBIT, defined as earnings before interest
       and taxes.

     The following table sets forth the results of this analysis:

                                                                      AGGREGATE VALUE TO    AGGREGATE VALUE TO

Morgan Stanley noted that as of January 23, 2001, the implied aggregate value of
Heartport (using Heartport's estimate of its end of year 2000 indebtedness) was
approximately $79 million.

     No company utilized in the peer group comparison analysis is identical to
Heartport. In evaluating the peer group companies, Morgan Stanley made judgments
and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the
control of Heartport, such as the impact of competition on the business of
Heartport or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any
adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of Heartport or
the industry or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis, such
as determining the average or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of
using peer group data.

     ANALYSIS OF SELECTED PRECEDENT TRANSACTIONS.  Using publicly available
information, Morgan Stanley reviewed sixteen transactions that involved
acquisition of companies in the medical device industry and, in some cases, in
the cardiothoracic surgical device segment of that industry. These transactions
are:

ACQUIRING COMPANY                       ACQUIRED COMPANY
- -----------------                       ----------------

Johnson & Johnson                       Innovasive Devices, Inc.
Guidant Corp.                           CardioThoracic Systems, Inc.
Medtronic, Inc.                         Xomed Surgical Products, Inc.
Synthes USA                             Stratec Holding AG
Kimberly-Clark Corp.                    Ballard Medical Products
Arterial Vascular Engineering, Inc.     CR Bard, Inc. -- Coronary Catheter
Boston Scientific Corp.                 Schneider Worldwide (Pfizer)
Tyco International Ltd.                 US Surgical, Inc.
Conmed Corp.                            Linvatec Corp.
Urohealth, Inc.                         Imagyn Medical, Inc.
Baxter International, Inc.              Research Medical, Inc.
St. Jude Medical, Inc.                  Daig Corp.
Boston Scientific Corp.                 Symbiosis Corp. (AHP)
Johnson & Johnson                       Cordis Corp.
Boston Scientific Corp.                 EP Technologies, Inc.
Boston Scientific Corp.                 Heart Technology, Inc.

     For each of these transactions, Morgan Stanley calculated the aggregate
value of the transaction as a multiple of the acquired company's last twelve
months' revenue. Morgan Stanley noted that for at least one of the transactions,
the acquisition of CardioThoracic Systems, Inc. by Guidant Corp., the
performance of the acquired company was uncharacteristic during the last twelve
months preceding the announcement of the acquisition and, therefore, excluded
the multiples of that transaction's aggregate value to last twelve months'
revenue from the results of the analysis. The results of this analysis were as
follows:

                                          AGGREGATE VALUE TO LAST TWELVE    AGGREGATE VALUE REFERENCE RANGE
                                                 MONTHS' REVENUE                 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)
                                          ------------------------------    -------------------------------

Low.....................................               4.5x                              $ 91
Median..................................                5.1                               103
High....................................                6.5                               131

     Morgan Stanley noted that the multiple of aggregate value to last twelve
months' revenue for Heartport, based on an aggregate enterprise value of
Heartport in the merger of approximately $115.6 million (including assumed
indebtedness and without giving effect to certain adjustments) is approximately
5.7x, which was within its range as shown above.

     No transaction utilized as a comparison in the precedent transactions
analysis is identical to the merger. In evaluating the transactions listed
above, Morgan Stanley made judgements and assumptions with regard to industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Heartport, such as the
impact of competition on Heartport or the industry generally, industry growth
and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and
prospects of Heartport or the industry or in the financial markets in general.
Mathematical analysis, such as determining the average or median, is not in
itself a meaningful method of using comparable transaction data.

     DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.  Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash
flow analysis of the present aggregate value of Heartport using projections
provided to Morgan Stanley by the management of Heartport, with certain
adjustments associated with potential synergies from the merger.

     Nominal discount rates ranging from 12.0% to 14.0% were applied to
Heartport's projected unlevered free cash flows for the years 2001 through 2005
and terminal value in 2005 based on a perpetual growth rate of 4% for the
unlevered free cash flow of Heartport. Based on these assumptions, the
stand-alone present aggregate value of Heartport ranged from $73 million to $91
million, depending on the discount rate applied. Morgan Stanley noted that the
aggregate enterprise value of Heartport in the merger is approximately $115.6
million (including assumed indebtedness and without giving effect to certain
adjustments).

     Morgan Stanley also prepared, under the guidance of Heartport management, a
discounted cash flow analysis scenario that examined the present value of
Heartport using financial projections made by Heartport's management that
considered potential revenue increases and cost savings realizable as a result
of the merger. Under this scenario, nominal discount rates ranging from 12.0% to
14.0% were applied to Heartport's projected unlevered free cash flows for the
years 2001 through 2005 and terminal value in 2005 based on a perpetual growth
rate of 4% for the unlevered free cash flow of Heartport. Based on these
assumptions, the potential present aggregate value of Heartport controlled by a
major surgical products company ranged from $114 million to $144 million,
depending on the discount rate applied. Morgan Stanley noted that the aggregate
enterprise value of Heartport in the merger is approximately $115.6 million
(including assumed indebtedness and without giving effect to certain
adjustments).

     Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses
for purposes of its opinion given in connection with the review of the merger by
the Heartport board of directors. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a
complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the
results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular
weight to any individual analysis or factor considered by it. Furthermore,
Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without
considering all analyses, would create an incomplete view of the process
underlying its opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various
analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors and may
have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions, so
that the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described
above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley's view of the actual value of
Heartport.

     In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Heartport. Any estimates
contained in Morgan Stanley's analyses are not necessarily indicative of future
results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
those suggested by such estimates. The analyses performed were prepared solely
as part of Morgan Stanley's analyses of the fairness of the consideration to be
received by the holders of shares of Heartport common stock pursuant to the
merger agreement and were conducted in connection with the delivery of the
Morgan

Stanley opinion to the board of directors of Heartport. The analyses do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which Heartport common
stock might actually trade. The merger consideration pursuant to the merger
agreement and other terms of the merger agreement were determined through
arm's-length negotiations between Heartport and Johnson & Johnson and were
approved by the Heartport board of directors. Morgan Stanley provided advice to
Heartport during such negotiations; however, Morgan Stanley did not recommend
any specific consideration to Heartport or that any specific consideration
constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger. In addition, as
described above, Morgan Stanley's opinion and presentation to the Heartport
board of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the
Heartport board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger
agreement. Consequently, the Morgan Stanley analyses described above should not
be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Heartport board of directors
with respect to the value of Heartport or whether the Heartport board of
directors would have been willing to agree to a different consideration.

     The Heartport board of directors retained Morgan Stanley based on Morgan
Stanley's qualifications, experience and expertise. Morgan Stanley is an
internationally recognized investment banking and advisory firm. Morgan Stanley,
as part of its investment banking and financial advisory business, is
continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements
and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of
Morgan Stanley's trading and brokerage activities, Morgan Stanley or its
affiliates may at any time hold long or short positions, trade or otherwise
effect transactions, for its own account or for the account of customers, in the
equity or debt securities or senior loans of Heartport or Johnson & Johnson.

     Pursuant to an engagement letter dated December 9, 1999, Morgan Stanley
provided financial advisory services and a financial fairness opinion in
connection with the merger, and Heartport agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a $3.0
million fee in the event that the merger is completed. Heartport has also agreed
to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses incurred in performing its
services. In addition, Heartport has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its
affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each
person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against
certain liabilities and expenses, including certain liabilities under the
Federal securities laws, related to or arising out of Morgan Stanley's
engagement and any related transactions. In the past, Morgan Stanley has
provided financial advisory and financial services for Heartport and has
received fees for the rendering of those services.

INTERESTS OF HEARTPORT DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

     In considering the recommendation of the Heartport board of directors that
stockholders of Heartport vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement,
stockholders should be aware that certain directors and executive officers of
Heartport have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition
to, the interests of other stockholders of Heartport generally. These interests,
to the extent material, are described below. The Heartport board of directors
was aware of, and considered, the interests of the directors and executive
officers in approving the merger agreement and the merger.

     INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.  The merger agreement provides that all
rights of indemnification for acts and omissions occurring before the completion
of the merger existing in favor of the current and former directors or officers
of Heartport as provided in its certificate of incorporation, by-laws and
existing indemnification agreements will be assumed by the surviving corporation
in the merger and will continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms. The merger agreement also provides that for six years after the
completion of the merger, Johnson & Johnson will maintain Heartport's current
directors' and officers' liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger covering those persons
who were, as of the date of the merger agreement, covered by that policy, on
terms no less favorable than those in effect on the date of the merger agreement
(provided that, in satisfying this obligation, Johnson & Johnson is not
obligated to pay aggregate premiums in excess of 200% of the amount Heartport
paid in its last full fiscal year).

     CHANGE IN CONTROL SEVERANCE PLAN.  Heartport has adopted a Change in
Control Severance Plan under which eligible employees are entitled to income
continuation and certain health benefits if within 24 months following a change
in control of Heartport (1) the employee's employment is terminated by Heartport
or any successor without cause or (2) the employee terminates his or her
employment following (a) a change in his or her position with Heartport that
materially reduces his or her job responsibility, (b) a reduction in his or her
salary and target bonus level or (c) a change in his or her place of employment
to a location that is more than 25 miles from his or her prior place of
employment, in each case if the change or reduction is effected without the
employee's written consent. The eligible participants who are executive officers
of Heartport include Casey Tansey, Christopher Hubbard, Steven Johnson and
Lawrence Siegel. The Change in Control Severance Plan provides a severance
benefit for director-level employees equal to 12 months of base salary and 100%
of the employee's target bonus for the fiscal year in which the employee is
terminated, as well as continuation of health benefits. The Change in Control
Severance Plan provides a severance benefit for officers (vice president or more
senior) equal to 24 months of base salary and 200% of the officer's target bonus
for the fiscal year in which the officer is terminated, as well as continuation
of health benefits. Payments under the Change in Control Severance Plan will be
reduced if necessary to provide employees with the greatest after-tax benefit,
after taking into account any excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the
Internal Revenue Code. The completion of the merger will constitute a change in
control of Heartport under the Change in Control Severance Plan. The cash
severance benefits (exclusive of health benefits) for which the named officers
are eligible under the Change in Control Severance Plan is set forth in the
table below.

     INCENTIVE LETTER AGREEMENTS.  Heartport has entered into incentive letter
agreements with each of Casey Tansey, Christopher Hubbard, Steven Johnson and
Lawrence Siegel that provide for the payment of cash bonuses immediately prior
to the closing of the merger. The bonuses payable under the respective incentive
letter agreements are set forth in the table below.

     STOCK OPTIONS.  All outstanding unvested stock options, including options
held by all Heartport employees, officers, board members and consultants, will
accelerate and become fully vested upon completion of the merger. On December
29, 2000, options were granted to each of Casey Tansey, Christopher Hubbard,
Steven Johnson and Lawrence Siegel at an exercise price of $1.563 per share,
which was equal to the closing price of Heartport common stock on the date of
grant. The options held by the named officers that will vest as a result of the
merger are set forth in the table below (assuming relinquishment of all options
required to receive the incentive letter agreement cash bonus payment).

     The following table sets forth the benefits that may become payable to the
named officers under each of these programs either upon the completion of the
merger or upon the termination of employment in certain circumstances, as
described above:

Heartport common stock, other equity-based compensation and employee benefits
that are also applicable to directors and executive officers of Heartport, see
"-- Heartport Employee Benefits Matters" and "-- Effect on Awards Outstanding
Under Heartport Stock Plans".

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     Johnson & Johnson intends to treat the merger as a purchase for accounting
and financial reporting purposes, which means that Heartport will be treated as
a separate entity for periods prior to the completion of the merger and,
thereafter, Heartport's financial results will be consolidated with Johnson &
Johnson's financial results.

FORM OF THE MERGER

     Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and in
accordance with Delaware law, at the effective time of the merger, HP Merger
Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson and a party to the
merger agreement, will merge with and into Heartport. Heartport will survive the
merger as a wholly owned Delaware subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson.

MERGER CONSIDERATION

     In the merger, holders of Heartport common stock will receive a fraction of
a share of Johnson & Johnson common stock based on an exchange ratio for each
share of Heartport common stock that they own. The exchange ratio will be
calculated by dividing $2.72 by the average per share closing price of Johnson &
Johnson common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Transactions Tape during a period of 20 trading days ending on the second
trading day immediately preceding the date on which the merger is completed.

     The market value of the Johnson & Johnson common stock on the date on which
the merger is completed may be different than the average closing price of
Johnson & Johnson common stock used in determining the exchange ratio. As a
result, the market value of the shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock you
receive in the merger may be more or less than the value attributed to your
shares of Heartport common stock in calculating the exchange ratio.

     Heartport stockholders will receive cash for any fractional shares of
Johnson & Johnson common stock they would otherwise receive in the merger. The
amount each Heartport stockholder will receive will be calculated by multiplying
the fractional share interest to which that stockholder is entitled by the
closing price of Johnson & Johnson common stock on the closing date of the
merger as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions Tape.

OWNERSHIP OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON FOLLOWING THE MERGER

     Based on the number of outstanding shares of Heartport common stock on the
record date and the closing price of Johnson & Johnson common stock on March
[--], 2001, we anticipate that Heartport stockholders will receive approximately
[--] shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock in the merger. Based on that
number and on the number of outstanding shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock
on March [--], 2001, Heartport stockholders will own approximately [--]% of the
outstanding shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock following the merger.

CONVERSION OF SHARES; PROCEDURES FOR EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; FRACTIONAL SHARES

     The conversion of Heartport common stock into the right to receive Johnson
& Johnson common stock will occur automatically at the effective time of the
merger. As soon as reasonably practicable after the completion of the merger,
EquiServe Trust Company, the exchange agent, will send a letter of transmittal
to each former Heartport stockholder. The transmittal letter will contain
instructions for obtaining shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock and cash for
any fractional shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock in exchange for shares
of Heartport common stock.

     HEARTPORT STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT RETURN STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH THE
ENCLOSED PROXY.

     After the effective time of the merger, each certificate that previously
represented shares of Heartport common stock will no longer be outstanding, will
be automatically canceled, will cease to exist and will represent only the right
to receive the Johnson & Johnson common stock into which such shares were
converted in the merger and the right to receive cash for any fractional shares
of Johnson & Johnson common stock as described below.

     Until holders of certificates previously representing Heartport common
stock have surrendered those certificates to the exchange agent for exchange,
those holders will not receive dividends or distributions on the Johnson &
Johnson common stock into which such shares have been converted with a record
date after the effective time of the merger and will not receive cash for any
fractional shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock. When holders surrender such
certificates, they will receive any dividends with a record date after the
effective time of the merger and a payment date on or prior to the date of
surrender and any cash for fractional shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock,
in each case without interest.

     In the event of a transfer of ownership of Heartport common stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of Heartport, a certificate representing
the proper number of shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock may be issued to a
person other than the person in whose name the certificate so surrendered is
registered if:

     - such certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise is in proper form for
       transfer and

     - the person requesting such exchange pays any transfer or other taxes
       resulting from the issuance of shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock
       to a person other than the registered holder of such certificate.

     All shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock issued in exchange for shares
of Heartport common stock, including any cash paid instead of any fractional
shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock, will be issued in full satisfaction of
all rights relating to such shares of Heartport common stock.

     No fractional shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock will be issued to
any Heartport stockholder upon surrender of certificates previously representing
Heartport common stock. Each Heartport stockholder who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Johnson & Johnson common stock will
receive cash in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying the
fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by
the closing price for a share of Johnson & Johnson common stock on the closing
date of the merger as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Transactions Tape.

EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER

     The merger will become effective upon the filing of the certificate of
merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such later time
as is agreed upon by Johnson & Johnson and Heartport and specified in the
certificate of merger. The filing of the certificate of merger will occur as
soon as practicable after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the
completion of the merger described in the merger agreement.

STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON COMMON STOCK

     It is a condition to the completion of the merger that the Johnson &
Johnson common stock issuable to Heartport stockholders in the merger be
approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice
of issuance.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF HEARTPORT COMMON STOCK

     If the merger is completed, Heartport common stock will be delisted from
The Nasdaq SmallCap Market and will be deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

     The following general discussion summarizes the anticipated material United
States Federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders of Heartport
common stock. This discussion addresses only such stockholders who hold their
Heartport common stock as a capital asset, and does not address all of the
United States Federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to particular
stockholders in light of their individual circumstances or to stockholders who
are subject to special rules, such as holders who are subject to alternative
minimum tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, financial institutions,
tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, mutual funds, dealers in
securities or foreign currencies, foreign holders, persons who hold such shares
as a hedge against currency risk, or as part of a constructive sale or
conversion transaction, holders whose shares are qualified small business stock
for purposes of Sections 1202 and 1045 of the Internal Revenue Code or holders
who acquired their shares upon the exercise of employee stock options or
otherwise as compensation. The following discussion is not binding on the
Internal Revenue Service. It is based upon the Internal Revenue Code, laws,
regulations, rulings and decisions in effect as of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. Tax consequences under state, local and foreign laws are not
addressed, nor are the tax consequences of transactions effectuated prior or
subsequent to, or concurrently with, the merger (whether or not any such
transactions are undertaken in connection with the merger), including without
limitation any transaction in which shares of Heartport common stock are
acquired or shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock are disposed of.

     The parties are not requesting a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service
as to the United States Federal income tax consequences of the merger, and no
opinions of counsel will be provided regarding the qualification of the merger
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code (a "reorganization").

     HOLDERS OF HEARTPORT COMMON STOCK ARE STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX
ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING
THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN INCOME AND
OTHER TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

     The merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, as explained more fully
below under "-- -- Effect of Appraisal/ Dissenters' Rights on Reorganization
Qualification; Effect of Failure to Qualify as a Reorganization", the merger
will not qualify as a reorganization if the amount of cash that is required to
be paid by Heartport or Johnson & Johnson in order to satisfy those stockholders
who have exercised appraisal/dissenters' rights exceeds certain threshold
levels.

     EFFECT OF QUALIFICATION AS A REORGANIZATION; EXCHANGE OF HEARTPORT COMMON
STOCK FOR JOHNSON & JOHNSON COMMON STOCK.  As noted above, the merger is
intended to qualify as a reorganization, and both Heartport and Johnson &
Johnson have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the merger
to so qualify. If the merger qualifies as a reorganization, the following tax
consequences will apply to holders of Heartport common stock who exchange their
shares of Heartport common stock for shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock in
the merger:

     - Each such stockholder will not recognize gain or loss for United States
       Federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger, except with
       respect to cash, if any, that he or she receives instead of a fractional
       share of Johnson & Johnson common stock.

     - Each stockholder's aggregate tax basis in the Johnson & Johnson common
       stock received in the merger will be the same as his or her aggregate tax
       basis in the Heartport common stock surrendered in the merger, decreased
       by the amount of any tax basis allocable to any fractional share interest
       for which cash is received.

     - The holding period of the Johnson & Johnson common stock received in the
       merger by each such stockholder will include the holding period of the
       Heartport common stock that he or she surrendered in the merger.

     - Each such stockholder who receives cash instead of a fractional share of
       Johnson & Johnson common stock will recognize gain or loss equal to the
       difference between the amount of cash received and his or her tax basis
       in the Johnson & Johnson common stock that is allocable to the fractional
       share.

     EFFECT OF APPRAISAL/DISSENTERS' RIGHTS ON REORGANIZATION QUALIFICATION;
EFFECT OF FAILURE TO QUALIFY AS A REORGANIZATION.  In order for the merger to
qualify as a reorganization, the following two requirements, among others, must
be satisfied. First, Johnson & Johnson must acquire at least 80% of the
outstanding shares of Heartport common stock solely for shares of Johnson &
Johnson common stock (this requirement is referred to as the "80% stock
consideration requirement"). Second, immediately after the merger, Heartport
must hold "substantially all" the assets it held immediately prior to the merger
(this requirement is referred to as the "substantially all requirement"). There
is no controlling bright-line standard for what constitutes "substantially all"
for purposes of the substantially all requirement. Instead, the courts have
tended to look, on a case by case basis, at both the amount and nature of the
assets that have been transferred by an acquired company in determining whether
the substantially all requirement has been satisfied. While the Internal Revenue
Service requires, for purposes of issuing an advance ruling as to whether a
merger qualifies as a reorganization, that immediately after the merger the
acquired corporation hold at least 90% of the net assets it held immediately
prior to the merger, the Internal Revenue Service expressly acknowledges that
such advance ruling guidelines do not necessarily reflect substantive law.

     To the extent that holders of Heartport common stock who exercise their
appraisal/dissenters' rights are paid with cash that originated from Johnson &
Johnson, Johnson & Johnson will be treated for purposes of the 80% stock
consideration requirement as having acquired the Heartport common stock of these
holders in exchange for cash. To the extent that holders of Heartport common
stock who exercise their appraisal/dissenters' rights are paid with cash that
originated from Heartport, Heartport will be treated for purposes of the
substantially all requirement as having held such cash immediately prior to, but
not subsequent to, the merger. Both Johnson & Johnson and Heartport have agreed
to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the merger to qualify as a
reorganization. Accordingly, it is expected that Johnson & Johnson and Heartport
will use commercially reasonable efforts to supply the source of the funds
needed to pay Heartport stockholders who exercise their appraisal/dissenters'
rights, if any, in a manner that is consistent with the satisfaction of both the
80% stock consideration requirement and the substantially all requirement.
However, it is important to note that there is no limit on the number of
stockholders who may exercise appraisal/dissenters' rights, and, therefore,
there can be no assurance that Johnson & Johnson and Heartport will be able to
direct the source of funds in a manner that will satisfy both the 80% stock
consideration requirement and the substantially all requirement. In this
connection, it should also be noted that Heartport may have little, if any, cash
available to satisfy claims of holders who exercise their appraisal/dissenters'
rights, and that Johnson & Johnson may be required to supply most, if not all,
of the cash needed to satisfy such claims. In such event, if holders of more
than approximately 20% of the outstanding shares of Heartport common stock
exercise their appraisal/dissenters' rights, the merger will not satisfy the 80%
stock consideration requirement and, accordingly, will not qualify as a
reorganization.

     If the merger does not qualify as a reorganization, whether by reason of
failing to satisfy the substantially all requirement, the 80% stock
consideration requirement, or otherwise, each holder of Heartport common stock
will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the fair market
value of the Johnson & Johnson common stock received in the merger and his or
her tax basis in the Heartport common stock surrendered in exchange therefor.
Such gain or loss generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. There is a
chance, however, that the Internal Revenue Service may assert that any such gain
is ordinary income by reason of the "collapsible corporation" provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code.

     CONSEQUENCES OF EXERCISE OF APPRAISAL/DISSENTERS' RIGHTS.  Holders of
Heartport common stock who exercise appraisal/dissenters' rights with respect to
their shares of Heartport common stock and who receive payment for their shares
in cash generally will recognize gain or loss measured by the difference between
the amount of cash received and such stockholder's basis in the shares
surrendered, if the

payment is not treated as a dividend pursuant to Section 302(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code (a "dividend equivalent transaction"). Such gain or loss generally
will be treated as capital gain or loss. There is a chance, however, that the
Internal Revenue Service may assert that any such gain is ordinary income by
reason of the "collapsible corporation" provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
A sale of Heartport common stock pursuant to an exercise of
appraisal/dissenters' rights will generally not be a dividend equivalent
transaction if, as a result of such exercise, the Heartport stockholder
exercising appraisal/ dissenters' rights owns no shares of Johnson & Johnson
common stock (either actually or constructively within the meaning of Section
318 of the Internal Revenue Code) immediately after the merger. If, however, a
Heartport stockholder's sale for cash of Heartport common stock pursuant to an
exercise of appraisal/dissenters' rights is a dividend equivalent transaction,
then such Heartport stockholder generally will recognize ordinary income for
Federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the entire amount of cash so
received.

     BACKUP WITHHOLDING.  Certain noncorporate holders of Heartport common stock
may be subject to backup withholding at a 31% rate on amounts received in
exchange for their Heartport common stock. Backup withholding will not apply,
however, to a stockholder who (1) furnishes a correct taxpayer identification
number and certifies that he or she is not subject to backup withholding on the
substitute Form W-9 or successor form included in the letter of transmittal that
will be mailed to Heartport stockholders by the exchange agent shortly after
completion of the merger, (2) provides a certification of foreign status on Form
W-8BEN or successor form or (3) is otherwise exempt from backup withholding.

REGULATORY MATTERS

     Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and related
rules, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed unless
certain waiting period requirements have been satisfied. On February 16, 2001,
Johnson & Johnson and Heartport each filed a Notification and Report Form with
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission and requested an early termination of the required waiting period. If
early termination is not granted and a request for additional information by the
relevant antitrust authorities is not made, the waiting period will expire at
midnight on March 18, 2001. At any time before or after the effective time of
the merger, the Antitrust Division, the Federal Trade Commission or others could
take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to prevent the merger,
to rescind the merger or to conditionally approve the merger upon the
divestiture of substantial assets of Johnson & Johnson or Heartport. There can
be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be
made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

     It is possible that any of the governmental entities with which filings are
made may seek, as a condition for their granting approval of the merger, various
regulatory concessions. There can be no assurance that:

     - Johnson & Johnson or Heartport will be able to satisfy or comply with
       such conditions or

     - compliance or noncompliance will not have adverse consequences for
       Johnson & Johnson after completion of the merger.

See "The Merger Agreement -- Conditions to the Completion of the Merger" on page

APPRAISAL/DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

     BACKGROUND.  If the merger is completed, Heartport stockholders who do not
vote their shares of Heartport common stock in favor of the merger may, under
applicable state laws regarding dissenting stockholders' appraisal rights,
become entitled to be paid cash for their shares of Heartport common stock in
lieu of receiving shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock in the merger.
Holders of options or warrants to purchase Heartport common stock will not be
entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger by virtue of holding
such options or warrants.

     Shares of Heartport common stock that are outstanding immediately prior to
the completion of the merger and have not been voted in favor of the merger will
not be converted into shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock if the holder of
such shares validly exercises and perfects statutory appraisal rights with
respect to such shares. However, such shares will be automatically converted
into shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock on the terms provided in the
merger agreement if and when the holder of those shares withdraws his, her or
its demand for appraisal or otherwise becomes legally ineligible to exercise
appraisal rights.

     Delaware law with respect to appraisal rights will be applicable to
Heartport stockholders because Heartport is a Delaware corporation. In addition,
under Section 2115 of the California General Corporation Law, California law in
respect of dissenters' rights may be applicable to Heartport stockholders
because a majority of such stockholders are located in the State of California
and because Heartport has other significant contacts with the State of
California. Because of the potential applicability of California law, summaries
of both Delaware and California law are relating to appraisal/dissenters' rights
are provided below.

     APPRAISAL RIGHTS UNDER DELAWARE LAW.  When the merger is completed,
stockholders of Heartport who comply with the procedures prescribed in Section
262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law will be entitled to a judicial
appraisal of the fair value of their shares, exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, and to receive
from Heartport, as the surviving corporation in the merger, payment of the fair
value of their shares in cash. The following is a brief summary of the statutory
procedures that must be followed by a stockholder of Heartport in order to
perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law.

     THIS SUMMARY IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE STATEMENT OF THE PROVISIONS
OF, AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO, SECTION 262 OF THE
DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, THE FULL TEXT OF WHICH IS INCLUDED AS ANNEX 4
TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE
PROVISIONS AND THE NEED TO STRICTLY COMPLY WITH VARIOUS TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS,
HEARTPORT STOCKHOLDERS CONSIDERING DISSENTING AND EXERCISING THEIR APPRAISAL
RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL.

     In order to exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law, a stockholder
must be the stockholder of record of the shares of Heartport common stock as to
which appraisal rights are to be exercised on the date that the written demand
for appraisal, described below, is made, and the stockholder must continuously
hold such shares through the date on which the merger is completed.

     Only Heartport stockholders who do not vote in favor of adoption of the
merger agreement or consent thereto in writing may exercise appraisal rights
under Delaware law. A vote by a Heartport stockholder against adoption of the
merger agreement is not required in order for that stockholder to exercise
appraisal rights. However, a Heartport stockholder who returns a signed proxy
but does not specify a vote against adoption of the merger agreement or include
a direction to abstain will be deemed to have waived that stockholder's
appraisal rights because such proxy, if not revoked, will be voted in favor of
adoption of the merger agreement. While it will not impact a stockholder's
ability to exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law, failure to submit a
signed proxy or vote in person at the special meeting will have the same effect
as a vote against adoption of the merger agreement.

     To exercise appraisal rights, a Heartport stockholder must deliver, before
the taking of the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special
meeting of Heartport stockholders, a written demand for appraisal to Heartport
that reasonably informs Heartport of the identity of the stockholder of record
and that such stockholder of record intends to demand appraisal of such
stockholder's shares. This written demand must be separate from any proxy or
vote abstaining from or voting against adoption of the merger agreement. Voting
against adoption of the merger agreement, abstaining from voting or failing to
vote with respect to adoption of the merger agreement will not constitute a
demand for appraisal under Delaware law. A stockholder's failure to make the
written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the merger
agreement at the special meeting of Heartport stockholders will constitute a
waiver of appraisal rights.

     A record owner, such as a broker, who holds Heartport common stock as a
nominee for beneficial owners of the shares may exercise appraisal rights for
shares held for one or more beneficial owners and not exercise appraisal rights
for the shares held for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written
demand must state the number of shares of Heartport common stock for which
appraisal rights are being demanded. Where the number of shares of Heartport
common stock is not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all
shares of Heartport common stock outstanding in the name of that record owner.
Beneficial owners who are not record owners and who intend to exercise appraisal
rights should instruct the record owner to comply strictly with the statutory
requirements with respect to the delivery of written demand prior to the taking
of the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement.

     A Heartport stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights must mail
or deliver the written demand for appraisal to:

     Heartport, Inc.
     700 Bay Road
     Redwood City, California 94063
     Attention: Stockholder Relations

     Dissenting stockholders may also deliver their demands for appraisal to
Heartport in person at the special meeting of Heartport stockholders before the
taking of the vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

     Within 10 days after the effective date of the merger, Heartport, as the
surviving corporation in the merger, must provide notice of the effective date
of the merger to all stockholders of record who have timely delivered written
demands for appraisal and not voted for or consented to the adoption of the
merger agreement.

     Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, any stockholder who
has complied with the applicable provisions of Section 262 will be entitled,
upon written request, to receive from Heartport a statement setting forth the
aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of adoption of the merger
agreement and with respect to which demands for appraisal were received by
Heartport, and the number of holders of such shares. Such statement must be
mailed within 10 days after the written request therefor has been received by
Heartport or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of
demands for appraisal, whichever is later.

     Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, Heartport, or any
stockholder who has satisfied the foregoing conditions and is otherwise entitled
to appraisal rights under Section 262, may file a petition in the Delaware Court
of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the shares held by all
stockholders entitled to appraisal rights. If no such petition is filed,
appraisal rights will be lost for all stockholders who previously had demanded
appraisal of their shares.

     If a petition in the Court of Chancery is timely filed, at the hearing on
such petition the court will determine the stockholders of Heartport entitled to
appraisal rights. Thereafter, the court will appraise the value of the shares of
Heartport common stock owned by such stockholders and determine the fair value
of such shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment
or expectation of the merger. The court will direct payment by Heartport of the
fair value of such shares together with a fair rate of interest, if any, on such
fair value to stockholders entitled thereto upon surrender to Heartport of
Heartport stock certificates. The costs of the proceeding may be determined by
the court and imposed upon the parties as the court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the court may, in its
discretion, order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any
stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against
the value of all the shares entitled to appraisal.

     If no petition for an appraisal is filed within 120 days after the
effective date of the merger or if a holder of shares delivers to Heartport a
written withdrawal of such holder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of
the merger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or with
the written approval of Heartport at a later date, then the right of such
stockholder to an appraisal will cease.

No appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any
stockholder without the approval of the court, which approval may be conditioned
on such terms as the court deems just.

     DISSENTERS' RIGHTS UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW.  When the merger is completed,
stockholders of Heartport who comply with the procedures prescribed in Chapter
13 of the California General Corporation Law may be entitled to a judicial
appraisal of the fair market value of their shares, which, for purposes of the
exercise of dissenters' rights under California law, is determined as of the day
before the first announcement of the terms of the merger, excluding any
appreciation or depreciation relating to the merger, but adjusted for any stock
split, reverse stock split or stock dividend that becomes effective thereafter,
and to require Heartport to purchase the stockholder's shares for cash at such
fair market value. The following is a brief summary of the statutory procedures
that must be followed by a stockholder of Heartport in order to dissent from the
merger and perfect dissenters' rights under Chapter 13 of the California General
Corporation Law.

     THIS SUMMARY IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE STATEMENT OF THE PROVISIONS
OF, AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO, CHAPTER 13 OF THE
CALIFORNIA GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, THE FULL TEXT OF WHICH IS INCLUDED AS ANNEX
5 TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE
PROVISIONS AND THE NEED TO STRICTLY COMPLY WITH VARIOUS TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS,
HEARTPORT STOCKHOLDERS CONSIDERING EXERCISING THEIR DISSENTERS' RIGHTS SHOULD
CONSULT THEIR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL.

     In order to exercise dissenters' rights under California law, a Heartport
stockholder must be entitled to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement or be a transferee of record of shares held by such a stockholder.
Under Chapter 13, dissenters' rights can only be exercised with respect to
shares of Heartport common stock that are outstanding on the record date for the
determination of Heartport stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting.

     Only Heartport stockholders who do not vote in favor of adoption of the
merger agreement may exercise dissenters' rights under California law. If the
merger agreement is adopted by Heartport stockholders, then within 10 days after
the date of the adoption of the merger agreement by Heartport stockholders,
Heartport must mail to each Heartport stockholder who did not vote in favor of
the adoption of the merger agreement a notice of the adoption of the merger
agreement, together with a copy of Sections 1300, 1301, 1302, 1303 and 1304 of
the California General Corporation Law, a statement of the price determined by
Heartport to represent the fair market value of dissenting shares and a brief
description of the procedure to be followed if the stockholder desires to
exercise dissenters' rights under California law. The statement of the fair
market value of the Heartport common stock in the notice of the adoption of the
merger agreement will constitute an offer by Heartport to purchase at that price
any shares of Heartport common stock for which dissenters' rights are perfected.

     A stockholder of Heartport wishing to require Heartport, as the surviving
corporation in the merger, to purchase his, her or its shares of Heartport
common stock pursuant to Chapter 13 must make written demand upon Heartport to
have Heartport purchase those shares for cash at their fair market value. The
demand must be made by a person who was a stockholder of record on the record
date for the special meeting of Heartport stockholders, must state the number
and class of dissenting shares held of record by such stockholder and must
contain a statement of what the stockholder claims to be the fair market value
of the shares as of the last day before the merger was first announced. The
statement of fair market value by the stockholder will constitute an offer by
the stockholder to sell his, her or its shares to Heartport at the specified
price. The written demand must be received by Heartport within 30 days after the
date on which the notice of the adoption of the merger agreement by Heartport
stockholders is mailed to the stockholder. If the stockholder's demand is not
received by Heartport within this 30-day period, then the stockholder will
forfeit his, her or its appraisal rights.

     The dissenting stockholder must also submit to Heartport, within 30 days
after the date on which the notice of adoption of the merger agreement by
Heartport stockholders is mailed to the stockholder, at Heartport's principal
office or the office of its transfer agent, the certificates representing any
shares of Heartport common stock with respect to which a demand for purchase is
being made, to be stamped or endorsed with a statement that the shares are
dissenting shares.

     Written demands, notices or other communications concerning the exercise of
dissenters' rights should be addressed to:

     Heartport, Inc.
     700 Bay Road
     Redwood City, California 94063
     Attention: Stockholder Relations

     Under California law, a dissenting stockholder may not withdraw his, her or
its demand for payment in cash of the fair market value of the stockholder's
dissenting shares unless Heartport consents.

     If the stockholder and Heartport agree that the shares of Heartport common
stock as to which the stockholder is seeking to exercise dissenters' rights
qualify as dissenting shares under Chapter 13, and also agree upon the price to
be paid to purchase the shares, then the dissenting stockholder is entitled to
the agreed price with interest thereon at the legal rate on judgments under
California law from the date of the agreement between Heartport and the
stockholder. Any agreements fixing the fair market value of any dissenting
shares as between Heartport and any dissenting stockholder must be filed with
the Secretary of Heartport. Unless provided otherwise by agreement, the agreed
price is required by law to be paid to the dissenting stockholder within the
later of 30 days after the date of such agreement or 30 days after any statutory
or contractual conditions to the completion of the merger are satisfied or
waived.

     However, if Heartport denies that the stockholder's shares qualify as
dissenting shares under Chapter 13, or if Heartport and the stockholder fail to
agree upon the fair market value of the shares, then the stockholder may, within
six months after the date on which Heartport mailed to the stockholder the
notice of the adoption of the merger agreement by Heartport stockholders, but
not thereafter, file a complaint in the California Superior Court requesting the
court to determine whether the stockholder's shares qualify as dissenting shares
under Chapter 13, the fair market value of such shares, or both, or may
intervene in any action pending on such a complaint.

     If the court is requested to determine the fair market value of the shares,
it will appoint one or more impartial appraisers to determine the fair market
value of the shares. However, if the appraisers cannot determine the fair market
value within 10 days of their appointment or within a longer time determined by
the court, then the court will determine the fair market value. If the court
determines that the stockholder's shares qualify as dissenting shares under
Chapter 13, then, following determination of the fair market value of these
shares, Heartport will be obligated to pay the dissenting stockholder the fair
market value of the shares, as so determined, together with interest thereon at
the legal rate from the date on which judgment is entered. Payment on this
judgment will be due upon the endorsement and delivery to Heartport of the
certificates for the shares as to which the dissenters' rights are being
exercised.

     The costs of the appraisal action, including reasonable compensation to the
appraisers appointed by the court, will be allocated among Heartport and
dissenting stockholders as the court deems equitable. However, if the appraisal
of the fair market value of the shares exceeds the price offered by Heartport,
then Heartport must pay such costs. If the fair market value of the shares
awarded by the court exceeds 125% of the price offered by Heartport for the
shares in the notice of approval of the adoption of the merger agreement by
Heartport stockholders, then the court may in its discretion include attorneys'
fees, fees of expert witnesses and interest in the costs payable by Heartport.

     CERTAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DELAWARE AND CALIFORNIA LAW ON
APPRAISAL/DISSENTERS' RIGHTS.  As noted above, there are several differences
between the laws of Delaware and California with respect to stockholders'
appraisal/dissenters' rights. These differences include, but are not limited to,
the following:

     - Under Delaware law, in order to exercise appraisal rights, a stockholder
       must deliver a written demand for appraisal before the taking of the vote
       on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting of
       Heartport stockholders. By comparison, under California law, a Heartport
       stockholder who has not voted in favor of the merger is not required to
       deliver a written demand for purchase until 30 days after the date on
       which the notice of the adoption of the merger agreement by Heartport
       stockholders is mailed to the stockholder.

     - Under Delaware law, Heartport or a dissenting stockholder must file a
       petition for an appraisal of the fair market value of the dissenting
       shares within 120 days after the effective date of the merger for
       appraisal rights to be perfected. By comparison, under California law, if
       the parties do not agree on the status of shares as dissenting shares or
       on their fair market value, the stockholder has until six months after
       the date on which the notice of adoption of the merger agreement by
       Heartport stockholders was mailed to such stockholder to file a complaint
       in the California Superior Court requesting a determination of the status
       of his, her or its shares and their fair market value.

     STOCKHOLDERS OF HEARTPORT CONSIDERING WHETHER TO SEEK APPRAISAL OF THEIR
SHARES OF HEARTPORT COMMON STOCK SHOULD BEAR IN MIND THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF
THEIR SHARES OF HEARTPORT COMMON STOCK DETERMINED UNDER SECTION 262 OR CHAPTER
13 COULD BE MORE THAN, THE SAME AS, OR LESS THAN THE VALUE OF THE RIGHT TO
RECEIVE SHARES OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER. ALSO, HEARTPORT,
AS THE SURVIVING CORPORATION IN THE MERGER, RESERVES THE RIGHT TO ASSERT IN ANY
APPRAISAL PROCEEDING THAT, FOR PURPOSES THEREOF, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEARTPORT
COMMON STOCK IS LESS THAN THE VALUE OF THE SHARES OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON COMMON
STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN THE MERGER.

     THE PROCESS OF DISSENTING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL/DISSENTERS' RIGHTS
REQUIRES STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH TECHNICAL STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. HEARTPORT
STOCKHOLDERS WISHING TO DISSENT SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL IN
CONNECTION WITH COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 262 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION
LAW OR CHAPTER 13 OF THE CALIFORNIA GENERAL CORPORATION LAW.

     ANY STOCKHOLDER WHO FAILS TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 262 OF
THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, ATTACHED AS ANNEX 4 TO THIS PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, OR CHAPTER 13 OF THE CALIFORNIA GENERAL CORPORATION LAW,
ATTACHED AS ANNEX 5 TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, WILL FORFEIT HIS, HER OR
ITS RIGHT TO DISSENT FROM THE MERGER AND EXERCISE APPRAISAL/DISSENTERS' RIGHTS.

HEARTPORT EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MATTERS

     Johnson & Johnson has agreed that, for at least one year following the
effective time of the merger, it will provide, or cause to be provided, to
employees of Heartport who continue their employment after the merger, base
salary or hourly wage rates and employee benefits which are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such employees as of the date
of the merger agreement. Neither Johnson & Johnson nor Heartport, as the
surviving corporation in the merger, will have any obligation to issue, or adopt
any plans or arrangements providing for the issuance of, shares of capital
stock, warrants, options, stock appreciation rights or other rights in respect
of any shares of capital stock of any entity or any securities convertible or
exchangeable into such shares pursuant to any such plans or arrangements, and
any plans or arrangements of Heartport providing for such will be disregarded in
determining whether employee benefits provided after the effective time of the
merger are substantially comparable in the aggregate to pre-merger benefits.

     Johnson & Johnson has also agreed to recognize the service of each
Heartport employee who continues employment through the effective time of the
merger as if such service had been performed for Johnson & Johnson for purposes
of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual) under Johnson & Johnson's
defined benefit pension plan, for purposes of eligibility for vacation under
Johnson & Johnson's vacation program and for benefit accrual under Johnson &
Johnson's severance plan, in each case only to the extent Johnson & Johnson
makes such plan or program available to employees of Heartport, as the surviving
corporation in the merger, but not for purposes of any other benefit plan of
Johnson & Johnson.

EFFECT ON AWARDS OUTSTANDING UNDER HEARTPORT STOCK PLANS

     The merger agreement provides that neither Johnson & Johnson nor the
surviving corporation will assume any outstanding Heartport stock options in
connection with the merger. Immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, each outstanding stock option granted under any of Heartport's stock
option plans, which are referred to as stock plan options, will automatically
accelerate and become fully exercisable for all of the shares of Heartport
common stock at the time subject to such stock plan option as fully-vested
shares of Heartport common stock. ANY OUTSTANDING STOCK PLAN OPTIONS THAT ARE
NOT

EXERCISED PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER WILL, UPON THE EFFECTIVE
TIME OF THE MERGER, TERMINATE AND CEASE TO BE OUTSTANDING.

     The merger agreement also requires the Heartport board of directors, as
soon as practicable after the date of the merger agreement, to take or cause to
be taken such actions with respect to stock options granted outside of
Heartport's stock option plans, which are referred to as non-plan stock options,
as may be necessary to cause the non-plan stock options to be treated in the
same manner as described above for the stock plan options.

     The merger agreement further provides that the rights of participants in
Heartport's employee stock purchase plan with respect to any offering underway
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be determined in
accordance with the provisions of such plan as in effect on the date of the
merger agreement. Each share of Heartport common stock purchased under such
offering will be automatically converted in the merger into the right to receive
a number of shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock equal to the exchange ratio
as described in "-- Merger Consideration". Heartport's employee stock purchase
plan will automatically terminate at the effective time of the merger.

RESALE OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON COMMON STOCK

     Johnson & Johnson common stock issued in the merger will not be subject to
any restrictions on transfer arising under the Securities Act of 1933, except
for shares issued to any Heartport stockholder who may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of Heartport or Johnson & Johnson for purposes of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act. It is expected that each such affiliate will agree not to
transfer any shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock received in the merger
except in compliance with the resale provisions of Rule 144 or 145 under the
Securities Act or as otherwise permitted under the Securities Act. The merger
agreement requires Heartport to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its affiliates to enter into such agreements. This proxy statement/prospectus
does not cover resales of Johnson & Johnson common stock received by any person
upon completion of the merger, and no person is authorized to make any use of
this proxy statement/prospectus in connection with any such resale.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     This is a summary of the material provisions of the merger agreement. The
merger agreement, which is attached as Annex 1 to this proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference, contains the
complete terms of that agreement. You should read the entire merger agreement
carefully.

CONDITIONS TO THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

     Each party's obligation to effect the merger is subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of various conditions that include, in addition to other customary
closing conditions, the following:

     - the merger agreement has been adopted by the affirmative vote of
       stockholders of Heartport representing a majority of the shares of
       Heartport common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special
       meeting

     - the shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock to be issued to Heartport
       stockholders upon completion of the merger have been approved for listing
       on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance

     - the waiting period applicable to the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
       Antitrust Improvements Act has expired or has been terminated

     - no restraining order, injunction or other court order or statute, law,

       completion of the merger and

     - the registration statement on Form S-4, of which this proxy
       statement/prospectus forms a part, has been declared effective by the
       Securities and Exchange Commission and is not the subject of any stop
       order or proceedings seeking a stop order.

     Each party's obligation to effect the merger is further subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the following additional conditions:

     - the representations and warranties of the other party set forth in the
       merger agreement that are qualified as to materiality are true and
       correct, and the representations and warranties of the other party that
       are not so qualified are true and correct in all material respects, in
       each case as of the date on which the merger is to be completed as though
       made on and as of that date or, if such representations and warranties
       expressly relate to an earlier date, then as of that date and

     - the other party to the merger agreement has performed in all material
       respects all obligations required to be performed by it under the merger
       agreement on or prior to the date on which the merger is to be completed.

     In addition, Johnson & Johnson's obligation to effect the merger is further
subject to satisfaction or waiver of the following additional condition:

       governmental entity (1) challenging the acquisition by Johnson & Johnson
       of any shares of Heartport common stock, seeking to restrain or prohibit
       the completion of the merger, or seeking to place limitations on the
       ownership of shares of Heartport common stock (or shares of common stock
       of the surviving corporation in the merger) by Johnson & Johnson or
       seeking to obtain from Heartport or Johnson & Johnson any damages that
       are material in relation to Heartport, (2) seeking to prohibit or
       materially limit the ownership or operation by Heartport, Johnson &
       Johnson or any of its subsidiaries of any material portion of any
       business or of any assets of Heartport, Johnson & Johnson or any of its
       subsidiaries, or to compel Heartport, Johnson & Johnson or any of its
       subsidiaries to divest or hold separate any business or any assets of
       Heartport, Johnson & Johnson or any of its subsidiaries, as a result of
       the merger, (3) seeking to prohibit Johnson & Johnson or any of its
       subsidiaries from effectively controlling in any material respect the
       business or operations of Heartport or (4) otherwise having, or being
       reasonably expected to have, a material adverse effect on Heartport.

The merger agreement provides that a "material adverse effect" on Heartport
means any change, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts (or any
development or developments which, individually or in the aggregate, could
reasonably be expected to result in any change or effect) that is materially
adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities, financial condition or
results of operations of Heartport, other than:

     - changes affecting the medical devices industry generally and not
       specifically relating to Heartport

     - changes affecting the United States economy generally

     - a decrease in the price of the Heartport common stock or the failure by
       Heartport to meet or exceed Wall Street research analysts' or Heartport's
       internal earnings or other estimates or projections, in each case in and
       of itself

     - any adverse change or effect resulting from compliance by Heartport with
       the terms of the merger agreement or

     - any adverse change or effect resulting from certain matters set forth in
       the disclosure letter delivered by Heartport to Johnson & Johnson in
       connection with the merger agreement.

     Heartport can provide no assurance that all of the conditions precedent to
the merger will be satisfied or waived by the party permitted to do so.
Heartport cannot at this point determine whether it would resolicit proxies in
the event that it decides to waive any of the items listed above. This decision
would depend upon the facts and circumstances leading to Heartport's decision to
complete the merger and whether Heartport believes there has been a material
change in the terms of the merger and its effect on Heartport and its
stockholders. In making this determination, Heartport would consider, among
other factors, the reasons for the waiver, the effect of the waiver on the terms
of the merger, whether the requirement being waived was necessary in order to
make the transaction fair to the stockholders from a financial point of view,
the availability of alternative transactions and the prospects of Heartport as
an independent entity. If Heartport determines that a waiver of a condition
would materially change the terms of the merger, including the expected
qualification of the merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, it will resolicit proxies.

NO SOLICITATION

     The merger agreement provides that Heartport will not, nor will it
authorize or permit any of its officers, directors or employees or any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor,
agent or representative retained by it to, directly or indirectly:

     - solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any other action intended to, or
       which could reasonably be expected to, facilitate, any inquiries or the
       making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
       to lead to, a takeover proposal, as described below or

     - participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to
       any person any information, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any
       takeover proposal.

     The merger agreement provides that the term "takeover proposal" means:

     - any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to, or that is
       reasonably likely to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition or
       purchase of a business that constitutes 15% or more of the revenues, net
       income or assets of Heartport, or 15% or more of Heartport common stock

     - any tender offer or exchange offer that if completed would result in any
       person beneficially owning 15% or more of the Heartport common stock or

     - any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
       liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or
       similar transaction involving Heartport pursuant to which any person or
       the stockholders of any person would own 15% or more of Heartport or any
       resulting parent company of Heartport, other than the transactions
       contemplated by the merger agreement or the stockholder agreement entered
       into with Johnson & Johnson.

     The merger agreement provides further that, notwithstanding the
restrictions described above, if, at any time prior to the time the Heartport
stockholders have adopted the merger agreement with Johnson & Johnson:

     - Heartport receives a bona fide written takeover proposal that the
       Heartport board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
       with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
       reputation, constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior
       proposal, as described below,

     - which takeover proposal was unsolicited and made after the date of the
       merger agreement and did not otherwise result from a breach by Heartport
       of the no solicitation provisions described above,

Heartport may, if the Heartport board of directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required to do so in order
to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Heartport stockholders under
applicable law, subject to providing prior notice to Johnson & Johnson:

     - furnish under a customary confidentiality agreement information about
       Heartport to any person making such takeover proposal and

     - participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such takeover
       proposal.

     The merger agreement provides that the term "superior proposal" means any
bona fide offer made by a third party that if completed would result in such
person, or its stockholders, owning, directly or indirectly, 75% or more of the
then outstanding shares of Heartport common stock, or of the surviving entity in
a merger or its direct or indirect parent, or 75% or more of the assets of
Heartport, which the Heartport board of directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation,
to be:

     - more favorable to Heartport's stockholders from a financial point of view
       than the merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
       proposal and the merger agreement with Johnson & Johnson, including any
       changes to the financial terms of the merger proposed by Johnson &
       Johnson in response to such proposal or otherwise and

     - reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial,
       legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

     The merger agreement provides further that neither the Heartport board of
directors nor any committee of the Heartport board of directors may:

     - withdraw, or modify in a manner adverse to Johnson & Johnson, or propose
       to withdraw, or modify in a manner adverse to Johnson & Johnson, the
       approval, recommendation, or declaration of advisability by the Heartport
       board of directors or such committee of the Heartport board of directors
       of the merger agreement with Johnson & Johnson or the merger

     - recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or
       approve, any takeover proposal or

     - approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or permit
       Heartport to execute or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
       understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
       agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
       agreement or other similar agreement related to or that is reasonably
       likely to lead to any takeover proposal.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the time the Heartport
stockholders have adopted the merger agreement with Johnson & Johnson, in
response to a superior proposal that was unsolicited and made after the date of
the merger agreement and that did not result from a breach by Heartport of the
no solicitation provisions described above, the Heartport board of directors may
withdraw its recommendation of the merger agreement and the merger and recommend
the approval of a superior proposal if the Heartport board of directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is

required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Heartport
stockholders under applicable law. No such withdrawal of the Heartport board of
directors' recommendation of the merger agreement and the merger or
recommendation of a superior proposal may be made until after the fifth business
day following Johnson & Johnson's receipt of written notice from Heartport
advising Johnson & Johnson the Heartport intends to take such action and
specifying the terms and conditions of such superior proposal. In determining
whether to take such action, the Heartport board of directors must take into
account any changes to the financial terms of the merger proposed by Johnson &
Johnson in response to its receipt of such notice from Heartport or otherwise.

     If the Heartport board of directors, or any committee of the Heartport
board of directors, withdraws its recommendation of the merger agreement or the
merger or recommends a superior proposal, Johnson & Johnson is entitled to
terminate the merger agreement. If Johnson & Johnson terminates the merger
agreement in this circumstance, Heartport must pay Johnson & Johnson a fee in
the amount of $5.75 million. See "-- Termination of the Merger Agreement" and
"-- Fees and Expenses -- Termination Fee".

     In addition to the no solicitation provisions described above, the merger
agreement provides that Heartport must promptly advise Johnson & Johnson orally
and in writing of any takeover proposal or any inquiry that could reasonably be
expected to lead to a takeover proposal, the material terms and conditions of
any such takeover proposal or inquiry and the identity of the person making any
such takeover proposal or inquiry. Heartport must keep Johnson & Johnson fully
informed of the status and material details, including any changes, of any such
takeover proposal or inquiry and must provide promptly to Johnson & Johnson
copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided by any
person to Heartport that describes any of the terms or conditions of any
takeover proposal.

     Nothing in the merger agreement prohibits the Heartport board of directors
from taking and disclosing to the Heartport stockholders a position contemplated
by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) under the Securities Exchange Act or from making any
required disclosure to Heartport stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of
the Heartport board of directors, after consultation with outside counsel,
failure to make such disclosure would constitute a violation of applicable law,
except that in no event may Heartport or its board of directors or any committee
thereof withdraw its recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger or
recommend a superior proposal in a manner prohibited by the no solicitation
provisions described above.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective
time of the merger, even if the merger agreement has been adopted by the
Heartport stockholders:

     - by mutual written consent of Johnson & Johnson and Heartport

     - by either Johnson & Johnson or Heartport, if the merger has not been
       completed by July 26, 2001, which is referred to as the outside date,
       except that this right to terminate the merger agreement will not be
       available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a
       principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to be
       completed on or before that date

     - by either Johnson & Johnson or Heartport, if there exists a restraining
       order, injunction or other court order or statute, law, rule, legal
       restraint or prohibition, in each case, that has become final and cannot
       be appealed and which prevents the completion of the merger

     - by either Johnson & Johnson or Heartport, if the Heartport stockholders
       do not adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting

     - by either Johnson & Johnson or Heartport, if the other party has breached
       any of its representations and warranties contained in the merger
       agreement, which breach would give rise to the failure of a condition to
       the merger and has not been or cannot be cured by the date that is 30
       calendar days prior to the outside date or if the other party has
       breached or failed to perform any of

       its covenants or agreements contained in the merger agreement, which
       breach would give rise to the failure of a condition to the merger and
       has not been or cannot be cured within 30 calendar days after receiving
       written notice from the other party of such breach or failure to perform
       and

     - by Johnson & Johnson, if the Heartport board of directors or any
       committee thereof withdraws, or modifies in a manner adverse to Johnson &
       Johnson, or proposes to withdraw, or modify in a manner adverse to
       Johnson & Johnson, its approval, recommendation or declaration of
       advisability of the merger agreement or the merger or recommends, adopts
       or approves, or proposes publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any
       takeover proposal.

FEES AND EXPENSES

     GENERAL.  The merger agreement provides that each party will pay its own
fees and expenses in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, whether or not the merger is completed,
except that Johnson & Johnson and Heartport will each pay one-half of (1) the
expenses incurred in connection with filing, printing and mailing of the
registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part and
(2) the filing fees for the premerger notification and report forms under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.

     TERMINATION FEE.  Heartport must pay to Johnson & Johnson a termination fee
of $5.75 million in each of the two following circumstances:

     - first, if the merger agreement is terminated by Johnson & Johnson
       pursuant to its right described in the last bullet point under
       "-- Termination of the Merger Agreement" and

     - second, if:

          - Heartport or its stockholders receive a takeover proposal or a
            takeover proposal otherwise becomes publicly known or any person
            publicly announces an intention, whether or not conditional, to make
            a takeover proposal,

          - the merger agreement is terminated by either Johnson & Johnson or
            Heartport because either (1) the outside date has been reached
            without a vote in respect of the adoption of the merger agreement
            with Johnson & Johnson having been taken at the special meeting of
            Heartport stockholders or (2) the Heartport stockholders have not
            adopted the merger agreement with Johnson & Johnson at the special
            meeting of Heartport stockholders and

          - within 12 months after such termination, Heartport enters into a
            definitive agreement for, or completes, any takeover proposal.

       or other disposition of such shares of Heartport common stock

     - enter into any voting arrangement or agreement with respect to shares of
       Heartport common stock held by such person or deposit any such shares in
       a voting trust

     - solicit, initiate or encourage, including by way of furnishing
       information, or take any action to facilitate, any inquiries or the
       making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
       to lead to, a takeover proposal as described in "The Merger
       Agreement -- No Solicitation" or

     - exercise any appraisal/dissenters' rights.

     Each of the stockholders that is a party to the stockholder agreement has
irrevocably appointed Johnson & Johnson and Michael H. Ullmann, Secretary of
Johnson & Johnson, and Steven M. Rosenberg, Assistant Secretary of Johnson &
Johnson, in their respective capacities as officers of Johnson & Johnson, and
any individual who succeeds to any such office of Johnson & Johnson, and each of
them individually, and any individual designated in writing by any of them, as
his or her proxy and attorney-in-fact to vote, or grant a consent with respect
to, his, her or its Heartport common stock in favor of the merger and the
adoption of the merger agreement and in favor of the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and against any of the matters that the
stockholder has agreed to vote against.

PROFIT RECOUPMENT PROVISIONS

     In addition to the voting arrangements and related provisions described
above, the stockholder agreement contains profit recoupment provisions pursuant
to which:

     - each stockholder is required to pay to Johnson & Johnson all profit
       (determined in accordance with the stockholder agreement) of such
       stockholder, solely in his capacity as a stockholder of Heartport, from
       the consummation of any takeover proposal as described in "The Merger

       Agreement -- No Solicitation" that is consummated, or the definitive
       agreement with respect to which is entered into by Heartport, in either
       case within 12 months after the merger agreement is terminated under
       circumstances where Johnson & Johnson is or may become entitled to
       receive a termination fee from Heartport pursuant to the terms of the
       merger agreement in connection with such termination and

     - in the event that, prior to the consummation of the merger, a takeover
       proposal as described in "The Merger Agreement -- No Solicitation" shall
       have been made to Heartport or with respect to Heartport, the merger
       shall have been consummated and Johnson & Johnson for any reason shall
       have increased the amount payable to Heartport stockholders in connection
       with the merger above the amount contemplated by the merger agreement as
       in effect on January 26, 2001, which is referred to as the original
       merger consideration, each stockholder is required to pay Johnson &
       Johnson an amount equal to the product of:

          - the number of shares of Heartport common stock beneficially owned by
            such stockholder that are subject to the stockholder agreement and

          - 100% of the excess, if any, of (1) the per share consideration
            received by the stockholder as a result of the consummation of the
            merger, pursuant to the merger agreement as in effect on the date of
            such consummation, over (2) the original merger consideration.

The general effect of these provisions is that these stockholders are obligated
to pay Johnson & Johnson the difference between the amount they receive in their
capacity as stockholders from the consummation by Heartport of an alternative
transaction (including a transaction with Johnson & Johnson that would result in
the Heartport stockholders receiving an amount that is greater than the original
merger consideration) and what they are entitled to receive under the terms of
the merger agreement as in effect on January 26, 2001. These provisions may have
the effect of discouraging a third party from proposing an alternative
transaction.

     The stockholder agreement generally terminates on the earlier of the
effective date of the merger or the date of termination of the merger agreement.
The profit recoupment provisions of the stockholder agreement survive the
termination of the merger agreement or the consummation of the merger until the
end of the 12-month period referred to in the description of the profit
recoupment provisions above.

                 DESCRIPTION OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON CAPITAL STOCK

     The following summary of the capital stock of Johnson & Johnson is subject
in all respects to applicable New Jersey law, the Johnson & Johnson restated
certificate of incorporation, as amended, and the Johnson & Johnson by-laws. See
"Comparison of Rights of Common Stockholders of Johnson & Johnson and Heartport"
on page 49 and "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 61.

     The total authorized shares of capital stock of Johnson & Johnson consist
of (1) 2,160,000,000 shares of common stock, $1.00 par value per share, and (2)
2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value. At the close of business
on March [--], 2001, approximately [--] shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock
were issued and outstanding and no shares of Johnson & Johnson preferred stock
were issued and outstanding.

     The Johnson & Johnson board of directors is authorized to provide for the
issuance from time to time of Johnson & Johnson preferred stock in series and,
as to each series, to fix the designation, the dividend rate and the
preferences, if any, which dividends on that series will have compared to any
other class or series of capital stock of Johnson & Johnson, the voting rights,
if any, the voluntary and involuntary liquidation prices, the conversion or
exchange privileges, if any, applicable to that series and the redemption price
or prices and the other terms of redemption, if any, applicable to that series.
Cumulative dividends, dividend preferences and conversion, exchange and
redemption provisions, to the extent that some or all of these features may be
present when shares of Johnson & Johnson preferred stock are issued, could have
an adverse effect on the availability of earnings for distribution to the
holders of Johnson & Johnson common stock or for other corporate purposes.

                  COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF COMMON STOCKHOLDERS
                       OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON AND HEARTPORT

     Johnson & Johnson is a New Jersey corporation subject to the provisions of
the New Jersey Business Corporation Act, which we refer to as New Jersey law.
Heartport is a Delaware corporation subject to the provisions of the Delaware
General Corporation Law, which we refer to as Delaware law, and to certain
provisions of the California General Corporation Law, which we refer to as
California law. Heartport stockholders, whose rights are currently governed by
the Heartport restated certificate of incorporation, the Heartport amended and
restated by-laws, Delaware law and, to a limited extent, California law, will,
upon completion of the merger, become stockholders of Johnson & Johnson and
their rights will be governed by the Johnson & Johnson restated certificate of
incorporation, as amended, the Johnson & Johnson by-laws and New Jersey law.

     The following description summarizes the material differences that may
affect the rights of stockholders of Johnson & Johnson and Heartport but does
not purport to be a complete statement of all those differences, or a complete
description of the specific provisions referred to in this summary. The
identification of specific differences is not intended to indicate that other
equally or more significant differences do not exist. Stockholders should read
carefully the relevant provisions of New Jersey law, Delaware law, California
law, the Johnson & Johnson restated certificate of incorporation, the Johnson &
Johnson by-laws, the Heartport restated certificate of incorporation and the
Heartport amended and restated by-laws.

CAPITALIZATION

     JOHNSON & JOHNSON

     Johnson & Johnson's authorized capital stock is described under
"Description of Johnson & Johnson Capital Stock" on page 48.

     HEARTPORT

     The total authorized shares of capital stock of Heartport consist of (1)
100,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and (2)
20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share. On the close
of business on March [--], 2001, approximately [--] shares of Heartport common
stock were issued and outstanding and no shares of Heartport preferred stock
were issued and outstanding.

     Heartport has the authority to issue preferred stock from time to time in
one or more series. Heartport's board of directors may determine the
designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series
and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof.

NUMBER, ELECTION, VACANCY AND REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

     JOHNSON & JOHNSON

     The Johnson & Johnson restated certificate of incorporation, as amended,
and the Johnson & Johnson by-laws provide that the total number of Johnson &
Johnson directors will be not less than nine nor more than 18, as determined by
the Johnson & Johnson board of directors from time to time. Johnson & Johnson
currently has 15 directors. All directors are elected at each annual meeting of
stockholders to serve until the next annual meeting. The Johnson & Johnson
by-laws do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors. The
Johnson & Johnson by-laws provide that vacancies on the Johnson & Johnson board
of directors will be filled by appointment made by a majority vote of the
remaining directors. The Johnson & Johnson restated certificate of
incorporation, as amended, and the Johnson & Johnson by-laws provide that
directors may be removed, with cause, by a majority vote of the stockholders.

     HEARTPORT

     Under Delaware law, the board of directors of Heartport must consist of one
or more members. The Heartport restated certificate of incorporation provides
that the exact number of directors will be determined from time to time by the
majority of existing directors. Currently, Heartport's board of directors has
five members. No decrease in the number of Heartport directors can shorten the
term of any incumbent director. The Heartport restated certificate of
incorporation and by-laws provide for a staggered board of directors consisting
of three classes of directors. Heartport directors in each class have a term
that continues until the third annual meeting of stockholders following their
election. Vacancies on the Heartport board of directors are filled by a majority
vote of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, and not by
stockholders. However, if after the filling of any vacancy by the directors, the
directors then in office who have been elected by the stockholders constitute
less than a majority of the directors then in office, under California law, any
stockholder who owns at least 5% of the total number of outstanding shares of
Heartport common stock may call a special meeting of stockholders or petition
the California Superior Court to call such a meeting for the purpose of electing
the entire board of directors. Under California law, any or all directors may be
removed without cause by the affirmative vote of stockholders representing a
majority of the then-outstanding shares of Heartport capital stock entitled to
vote in the election of directors; however, no director may be removed if the
votes cast against removal would be sufficient to elect such director under
cumulative voting rules.

AMENDMENTS TO CHARTER DOCUMENTS

     JOHNSON & JOHNSON

     Under New Jersey law, a proposed amendment to a corporation's certificate
of incorporation requires approval by its board of directors and an affirmative
vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of shares entitled to vote
on the amendment, unless a specific provision of New Jersey law or the
corporation's certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. The Johnson &
Johnson restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, provides that if any
class or series of shares is entitled to vote thereon as a class, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in each class is required. The
Johnson & Johnson restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, also
provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the
votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all then outstanding shares of
voting stock, voting together as a single class, and the affirmative vote of a
majority of the combined votes entitled to be cast by "disinterested
stockholders" voting together as a single class is required to amend, repeal or
adopt provisions inconsistent with Article Eight of the Johnson & Johnson
restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, which relates to business
combinations with interested parties, unless the amendment, repeal or adoption
is unanimously recommended by the Johnson & Johnson board of directors if none
of its directors are affiliates or associates of any interested stockholder.

     HEARTPORT

     Under Delaware law, an amendment to the certificate of incorporation of a
corporation requires the approval of the board of directors and the approval of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote upon the
proposed amendment. The holders of the outstanding shares of a class are
entitled to vote as a separate class on a proposed amendment that would:

     - increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of the
       class

     - increase or decrease the par value of the shares of the class or

     - alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the shares
       of the class, so as to affect them adversely.

     If any proposed amendment would alter or change the powers, preferences or
special rights of one or more series of any class so as to affect them
adversely, but would not so affect the entire class, then only the shares of the
series so affected by the amendment will be considered a separate class.

     Under Heartport's restated certificate of incorporation, Heartport reserves
the right to amend or repeal any provision contained in its certificate of
incorporation in the manner prescribed by Delaware law and all rights and powers
conferred upon stockholders are subject to this reservation. The Heartport
restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least 75% of the voting power of all of the
then-outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote in the election of
directors, voting together as a single class, is required to amend any of
provisions listed in Article Ninth of the Heartport restated certificate of
incorporation, which include Article Ninth itself, the provisions that eliminate
the ability of the Heartport stockholders to act by written consent instead of
at a stockholders meeting contained in Article Fifth, Article Sixth, which
contains provisions relating to the election and removal of directors and the
classification of the Heartport board of directors into three separate classes
of directors, Article Seventh, which contains provisions relating to the
adoption, amendment and repeal of by-laws, and Article Eighth, which contains
provisions that limit the liability of directors for breaches of their fiduciary
duties as directors.

AMENDMENTS TO BY-LAWS

     JOHNSON & JOHNSON

     Pursuant to New Jersey law, the Johnson & Johnson restated certificate of
incorporation, as amended, and the Johnson & Johnson by-laws, the Johnson &
Johnson by-laws generally may be amended or repealed in whole or in part by the
stockholders at a regular or special meeting of the stockholders or by the
Johnson & Johnson board of directors at a regular or special meeting of the
board of directors, if notice of the proposed amendment is contained in the
notice of such meeting, except that a by-law adopted or amended by the Johnson &
Johnson board of directors may be superseded by stockholder action and that
stockholder action may preempt any further action by the Johnson & Johnson board
of directors with respect to that by-law provision.

     HEARTPORT

     Under Delaware law, unless a corporation's certificate of incorporation
provides otherwise, the stockholders entitled to vote have the power to adopt,
amend or repeal the corporation's by-laws. The Heartport restated certificate of
incorporation and by-laws provide that the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least 75% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital
stock entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class, is required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the by-laws. The
Heartport restated certificate of incorporation provides that a majority of the
total number of authorized directors may adopt, amend or repeal the by-laws.

ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT

     JOHNSON & JOHNSON

     Under New Jersey law, any action required or permitted to be taken at a
meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote, upon the written consent of stockholders who would have been
entitled to cast the minimum number of votes which would be necessary to
authorize the action at a meeting at which all stockholders entitled to vote
thereon were present and voting; provided, however, that in case of an annual
meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, any consent in writing
must be unanimous.

     HEARTPORT

     Under Heartport's restated certificate of incorporation, any action
required or permitted to be taken by stockholders must be effected at a duly
called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any
consent in writing of such stockholders.

NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDER ACTIONS

     JOHNSON & JOHNSON

     New Jersey law and the Johnson & Johnson by-laws provide that written
notice of the time, place and purpose or purposes of every meeting of
stockholders must be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the
date of the meeting, either personally or by mail, telegram or telex, to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. The Johnson & Johnson
by-laws further provide that the only matters that may be considered and acted
upon at an annual meeting of stockholders are those matters brought before the
meeting:

     - through the notice of meeting

     - by Johnson & Johnson's board of directors or

     - by a record stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting.

Generally, the Johnson & Johnson by-laws require a stockholder who intends to
bring matters before an annual meeting to provide advance notice of such
intended action not less than 120 days prior to the date of the proxy statement
relating to the prior year's annual meeting. The notice must contain a brief
description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and must
identify any personal or other material interest of the stockholder in such
proposed business. The person presiding at the meeting will have the discretion
to determine whether any item of business was brought before such meeting in
compliance with the above procedures.

     HEARTPORT

     The Heartport by-laws provide that a written notice of the place, date and
hour, and in the case of a special meeting, the purpose, of the meeting must be
given to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting not less than 10 days
nor more than 60 days prior to the meeting, except in the case of a stockholder
meeting where stockholders will vote on a merger of Heartport, in which case
Delaware law requires that notice be provided to each stockholder not less than
20 days prior to the meeting. Pursuant to the Heartport by-laws, the only
matters that may be considered and acted upon at an annual meeting of the
stockholders are those matters brought before the meeting:

     - through the notice of meeting

     - by Heartport's board of directors or

     - by any record stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting.

     Generally, the Heartport by-laws require a stockholder who intends to
nominate directors or propose new business at any annual meeting to provide
advance notice of such intended action not less than 120 days nor more than 150
days prior to the first anniversary of the date on which Heartport first mailed
its proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting. The notice must
contain a brief description of the matter to be considered and must state the
number of shares of Heartport common stock held by, and the identity of, the
stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf
the proposal is being made. The person presiding at the meeting will have the
discretion to determine whether a matter was brought before a meeting in
compliance with the above procedures.

SPECIAL STOCKHOLDER MEETINGS

     JOHNSON & JOHNSON

     Under the Johnson & Johnson by-laws, a special meeting of the stockholders
may be called at any time by the chairman of the board of directors, a
vice-chairman of the board of directors, the chairman of the executive
committee, a vice-chairman of the executive committee, the president or by a
majority of the board of directors, and may be held on the business day and
place stated in the notice of the meeting.

     In addition, New Jersey law provides that holders of not less than 10% of
all shares entitled to vote at a meeting may apply to the New Jersey Superior
Court to request that a special meeting of the stockholders be called for good
cause shown. At such a meeting, the stockholders present in person or by proxy
will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business described in such
order.

     HEARTPORT

     Under Delaware law, a special meeting of stockholders may be called by the
board of directors or by other persons authorized by the certificate of
incorporation or the by-laws. The Heartport by-laws provide that special
meetings of the stockholders may only be called by the Heartport board of
directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of
authorized directors. Written notice of a special meeting stating the time,
place and purpose for which the meeting is called must be given to each
stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting at least 10 but not more than 60
days prior to the meeting, except in the case of a stockholder meeting where
stockholders will vote on a merger of Heartport, in which case Delaware law
requires that notice be provided to each stockholder not less than 20 days prior
to the meeting.

STOCKHOLDER INSPECTION RIGHTS; STOCKHOLDER LISTS

     JOHNSON & JOHNSON

     Under New Jersey law, a stockholder who has been a stockholder for at least
six months or who holds, or is authorized in writing by holders of, at least 5%
of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock of a corporation has
the right, for any proper purpose and upon at least five days' written notice,
to inspect in person or by agent or attorney the minutes of the proceedings of
the corporation's stockholders and its record of stockholders. Irrespective of
the period such stockholder has held his, her or its stock or the amount of
stock such stockholder holds, a court may, upon proof of proper purpose, compel
production for examination by the stockholder of the books and records of
account, minutes and record of stockholders. Under the Johnson & Johnson
by-laws, a complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting must be
produced at the time and place of the meeting and be subject to the inspection
of any stockholder for reasonable periods during the meeting.

     HEARTPORT

     Under Delaware law and the Heartport by-laws, any stockholder, in person or
by attorney or other agent, may, upon written demand given under oath and
stating the purpose thereof, inspect for any proper purpose Heartport's stock
ledger, a list of its stockholders and its other books and records. A proper
purpose is a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a
stockholder. A complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of
stockholders must be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose
germane to the meeting, for a period of at least 10 days prior to such meeting.
The list must also be kept at the place of the meeting during the whole time
thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

LIMITATION OF PERSONAL LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

     JOHNSON & JOHNSON

     Under New Jersey law, a corporation may indemnify a director or officer
against his or her expenses and liabilities in connection with any proceeding
involving the director or officer by reason of his or her being or having been a
director or officer, other than a proceeding by or in the right of the
corporation, if:

     - the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he or she
       reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
       corporation and

     - with respect to any criminal proceeding, the director or officer had no
       reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.

     The Johnson & Johnson restated certificate of incorporation, as amended,
provides that, to the full extent permitted under New Jersey law, no director or
officer of Johnson & Johnson will be personally liable to Johnson & Johnson or
its stockholders for damages for breach of any duty owed to Johnson & Johnson or
its stockholders.

     The Johnson & Johnson by-laws provide that to the full extent permitted
under New Jersey law, Johnson & Johnson will indemnify any person who was or is
involved in any manner in any threatened, pending or completed investigation,
claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
arbitrative, legislative or investigative, or who is threatened with being so
involved, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer
of Johnson & Johnson or, while serving as a director or officer of Johnson &
Johnson, is or was at the request of Johnson & Johnson also serving as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, against all expenses (including attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such proceeding.

     Johnson & Johnson enters into indemnification agreements with its directors
and officers and enters into insurance agreements on its own behalf.

     HEARTPORT

     Delaware law provides that a certificate of incorporation may contain a
provision eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors to the
corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of a fiduciary
duty as a director, except no provision in the certificate of incorporation may
eliminate or limit the liability of a director:

     - for any breach of a director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its
       stockholders

     - for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
       misconduct or a knowing violation of law

     - statutory liability for unlawful payment of dividends or unlawful stock
       purchase or redemption or

     - for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
       benefit.

     The Heartport restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, directors will have no personal liability for
monetary damages for breach of a fiduciary duty in their capacity as directors
of Heartport.

     Under Delaware and California laws, a corporation may indemnify any person
who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding,
other than an action by or on behalf of the corporation, because the person is
or was a director or officer, against liability incurred in connection with the
proceeding if:

     - the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably
       believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation
       and

     - the director or officer, with respect to any criminal action or
       proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was
       unlawful.

     Under Delaware and California laws, a corporation may not indemnify a
director or officer in connection with any proceeding in which the director or
officer has been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the
extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which the proceeding was
brought determines that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of
all the circumstances of the case, the director or officer is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity for those expenses which the Court of Chancery
or the other court, as the case may be, deems proper.

     Under Delaware and California laws, a corporation may advance expenses
before the final disposition of a proceeding if the director or officer
undertakes to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined that the director
or officer is not entitled to indemnification. Under Delaware law, such expenses
incurred by

former directors or officers may be paid upon the terms and conditions, if any,
as the corporation deems appropriate.

     The Heartport by-laws provide that Heartport will indemnify any and all of
its directors and officers to the fullest extent allowed by Delaware law. The
Heartport by-laws provide that expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred by
an officer or director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative action, suit or proceeding will be paid by Heartport in advance of
the final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay the amount if it
is ultimately determined that he or she was not entitled to be indemnified by
Heartport.

DIVIDENDS

     JOHNSON & JOHNSON

     The Johnson & Johnson restated certificate of incorporation, as amended,
provides that the Johnson & Johnson board of directors may from time to time
declare dividends on its outstanding shares in accordance with New Jersey law.

     HEARTPORT

     Delaware law provides that a corporation may pay dividends out of its
surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year
in which the dividend is declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Delaware
law also provides that dividends may not be paid out of the net profits if,
after the payment of the dividend, the corporation's capital would be less than
the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes
having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Under California law, a
corporation may not make any distribution (including dividends, whether in cash
or other property, and repurchases of its shares) unless either the
corporation's retained earnings immediately prior to the proposed distribution
equal or exceed the amount of the proposed distribution or, immediately after
giving effect to such distribution, the corporation's assets (exclusive of
goodwill, capitalized research and development expenses and deferred charges)
would be at least equal to 125% of its liabilities (not including deferred
taxes, deferred income and other deferred credits), and the corporation's
current assets, as defined, would be at least equal to its current liabilities
(or 125% of its current liabilities if the average pre-tax and pre-interest
earnings for the preceding two fiscal years were less than the average interest
expenses for such year). Such tests are applied to California corporations on a
consolidated basis. Under California law, there are certain exceptions to the
foregoing rules for repurchases of shares in connection with certain rescission
actions or pursuant to certain employee stock plans. In addition, any
stockholder who receives a prohibited distribution, knowing that such
distribution was prohibited under California law, may be held liable by the
corporation's creditors for the amount of the distribution received. The
Heartport by-laws provide that board of directors may declare dividends in
accordance with law.

CONVERSION

     JOHNSON & JOHNSON

     Holders of Johnson & Johnson common stock have no rights to convert their
shares into any other securities.

     HEARTPORT

     Holders of Heartport common stock have no rights to convert their shares
into any other securities.

RIGHTS PLAN

     JOHNSON & JOHNSON

     Johnson & Johnson does not have a rights plan. New Jersey law, however,
endorses share rights or options issued by New Jersey corporations that, among
other things, include conditions precluding holders

of a specified percentage of outstanding shares of a corporation from exercising
such share rights or options or which invalidate the share rights or options
beneficially owned by such holders and their transferees.

     HEARTPORT

     In 1996, Heartport's board of directors adopted the Heartport rights
agreement and issued, as a dividend, one preferred stock purchase right for each
outstanding share of Heartport common stock. One Heartport purchase right has
also been issued with respect to each share of Heartport common stock issued
since the date of that dividend.

     Each Heartport purchase right entitles the holder to buy one unit (or
1/1,000 of a share) of Heartport's Series A Junior Preferred Stock at a price of
$46 per unit, subject to adjustment, or, under certain circumstances described
below, shares of Heartport common stock or common stock of a third party. The
Heartport purchase rights will be exercisable after the earlier of:

     - 10 days after a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated
       or associated persons has acquired, obtained the right to acquire, or
       otherwise obtained beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding
       shares of Heartport common stock or

     - 10 business days (or such later date as may be determined by the
       Heartport board of directors prior to any person or group obtaining
       beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of
       Heartport common stock) after the commencement of, or the first public
       announcement of the intention to commence, a tender or exchange offer
       which would result in a person or group beneficially owning 15% or more
       of the outstanding shares of Heartport common stock.

     If a person or group beneficially owns 20% or more of the outstanding
shares of Heartport common stock, each holder of a Heartport purchase right may
receive, in lieu of shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock, upon exercise of
each purchase right then held, shares of Heartport common stock with a market
value equal to two times the exercise price of a Heartport purchase right,
except that purchase rights owned by such acquiring person or group will be
void. If, following the date that a person or group becomes the beneficial owner
of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Heartport common stock, Heartport is
acquired in a merger or other business combination, each Heartport purchase
right will be exercisable, in lieu of shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock,
for the number of the acquiring company's shares of common stock having a market
value equal to two times the exercise price of the Heartport purchase right.

     Heartport may redeem the purchase rights at a price of $0.001 per purchase
right at any time prior to such time as any person or group becomes a beneficial
owner of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Heartport common stock.
Furthermore, at any time prior to such time as any person or group becomes a
beneficial owner of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Heartport common
stock, Heartport may amend or supplement any provision of the rights agreement
without the approval of any holders of purchase rights.

     Heartport and Fleet National Bank, the rights agent under Heartport's
rights plan, entered into an amendment dated as of January 26, 2001 to the
rights agreement governing Heartport's rights plan, to render the rights plan
inapplicable to the execution and delivery of the merger agreement or the
stockholder agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby.

VOTING RIGHTS; REQUIRED VOTE FOR AUTHORIZATION OF CERTAIN ACTIONS

     JOHNSON & JOHNSON

     Each holder of Johnson & Johnson common stock is entitled to one vote for
each share held of record and may not cumulate votes for the election of
directors.

     Merger or Consolidation.  Under New Jersey law, the consummation of a
merger or consolidation of a New Jersey corporation organized prior to January
1, 1969, such as Johnson & Johnson, requires the approval of such corporation's
board of directors and the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes cast by

the holders of shares of the corporation entitled to vote thereon; however, no
such approval and vote are required if such corporation is the surviving
corporation and

     - such corporation's certificate of incorporation is not amended

     - the stockholders of the surviving corporation whose shares were
       outstanding immediately before the effective date of the merger will hold
       the same number of shares, with identical designations, preferences,
       limitations, and rights, immediately after and

     - the number of voting shares and participation shares outstanding after
       the merger will not exceed by 40% the total number of voting or
       participating shares of the surviving corporation before the merger.

Similarly, a sale of all or substantially all of such corporation's assets other
than in the ordinary course of business, or a voluntary dissolution of such
corporation, requires the approval of such corporation's board of directors and
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes cast by the holders of shares of
such corporation entitled to vote thereon.

     Business Combinations.  Under New Jersey law, no New Jersey corporation may
engage in any "business combination" with any interested stockholder (generally,
a 10% or greater stockholder) for a period of five years following such
interested stockholder's stock acquisition, unless such business combination is
approved by the board of directors of such corporation prior to the stock
acquisition.

     Under New Jersey law, "business combination" includes:

     - any merger or consolidation of a resident domestic corporation or one of
       its subsidiaries:

        - with an interested stockholder or

        - with any corporation which is, or would be after such merger or
          consolidation, an affiliate or associate of an interested stockholder

     - any transfer or other disposition to or with an interested stockholder or
       any affiliate or associate of an interested stockholder of at least 10%
       of (1) the assets, (2) the outstanding shares or (3) the earning power or
       income, on a consolidated basis, of such resident domestic corporation
       and

     - other specified self-dealing transactions between such resident domestic
       corporation and an interested stockholder or any affiliate or associate
       thereof.

     In addition, no resident domestic corporation may engage, at any time, in
any business combination with any interested stockholder of such corporation
other than:

     - a business combination approved by the board of directors of such
       corporation prior to the stock acquisition

     - a business combination approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of
       two-thirds of the voting stock not beneficially owned by such interested
       stockholder at a meeting called for such purpose or

     - a business combination in which the interested stockholder meets certain
       fair price criteria.

     In addition to the requirement under New Jersey law regarding business
combinations with an interested stockholder, the Johnson & Johnson restated
certificate of incorporation, as amended, prohibits Johnson & Johnson from
engaging in any "business combination" with any interested stockholder
(generally, a 10% or greater stockholder) without (1) the affirmative vote of at
least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all then
outstanding shares of Johnson & Johnson voting stock, voting together as a
single class, and (2) the affirmative vote of a majority of the combined votes
entitled to be cast by "disinterested stockholders" (as defined in the Johnson &
Johnson restated certificate of incorporation), voting together as a single
class; provided that any business combination will require only the approval
required under New Jersey law if, among other things, such business combination
has been approved at any time by a majority of the "continuing directors" (as
defined in the Johnson & Johnson restated certificate of incorporation) and
certain fair price requirements are met.

     The Johnson & Johnson restated certificate of incorporation defines
"business combination" to include:

     - any merger or consolidation of Johnson & Johnson

        - with an interested stockholder or

        - with any other corporation which is, or after such merger or
          consolidation would be, an affiliate or associate of an interested
          stockholder

     - any transfer or other disposition to or with any interested stockholder
       or any affiliate or associate of an interested stockholder of any assets
       or securities of Johnson & Johnson or any of its subsidiaries having an
       aggregate fair market value of 5% of the total assets of Johnson &
       Johnson and its subsidiaries

     - the adoption of a plan of liquidation of Johnson & Johnson proposed by an
       interested stockholder or any affiliate or associate of an interested
       stockholder and

     - any transaction which increases the capital stock beneficially owned by
       an interested stockholder or any affiliate or associate of an interested
       stockholder.

     HEARTPORT

     Each holder of Heartport common stock is entitled to one vote for each
share held of record. Under California law, Heartport stockholders may cumulate
their votes for the election of directors.

     Merger or Consolidation.  Under Delaware and California laws, mergers or
consolidations or sales or exchanges of all or substantially all of a
corporation's assets or a dissolution of the corporation require the affirmative
vote of the board of directors (except in certain limited circumstances). In
addition, the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding stock of the
corporation entitled to vote on the matter is required, except in certain cases
where stockholder approval is not required by a corporation's certificate of
incorporation.

     Under Delaware law, stockholder consent is not required under the following
circumstances:

     - for a corporation that survives a merger and does not issue in the merger
       more than 20% of its outstanding shares immediately prior to the merger

     - if the merger agreement does not amend in any respect the survivor's
       certificate of incorporation

     - if each share of the surviving corporation outstanding immediately prior
       to the merger remains an identical outstanding share of the surviving
       corporation after the merger and

     - for either corporation where one corporation owns 90% of each class of
       outstanding stock of the other corporation.

     Under California law as it might apply to Heartport, stockholder consent is
not required under the following circumstances:

     - if a corporation, or its stockholders immediately before the merger, own
       immediately after the merger voting stock possessing more than
       five-sixths of the voting power of the surviving corporation or acquiring
       corporation and

     - for holders of preferred stock of a corporation, if the rights,
       preferences, privileges and restrictions that apply to such stock remain
       the same before and after the merger.

     Business Combinations.  Heartport is subject to the anti-takeover
provisions in Delaware law. The anti-takeover provisions prohibit business
combinations between a Delaware corporation and an interested

stockholder, as described below, within three years of the time the interested
stockholder became an interested stockholder unless:

     - before that time, the board of directors approved either the business
       combination or the transaction in which the interested stockholder became
       an interested stockholder

     - upon completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder
       becoming an interested stockholder, the stockholder owned at least 85% of
       the voting stock of the corporation, excluding shares held by directors
       who are also officers of the corporation and by employee stock ownership
       plans that do not permit employees to determine confidentially whether
       shares held by the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer or

     - on or following that time, the business combination is approved by the
       board of directors and the business combination transaction is approved
       by the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock of the
       corporation not owned by the interested stockholder.

     The business combination restrictions described above do not apply if:

     - the corporation's original certificate of incorporation contains a
       provision expressly electing not to be governed by the anti-takeover
       provisions in Delaware law

     - the holders of a majority of the voting stock of the corporation approve
       an amendment to its certificate of incorporation or by-laws expressly
       electing not to be governed by the anti-takeover provisions, which
       election will be effective 12 months after the amendment's adoption and
       would not apply to any business combination with a person who was an
       interested stockholder at or prior to the time the amendment was approved
       or

     - the corporation does not have a class of voting stock that is (1) listed
       on a national securities exchange, (2) authorized for quotation on The
       Nasdaq Stock Market or (3) owned by more than 2,000 stockholders of
       record.

     The anti-takeover provisions do not apply to a business combination that:

     - is proposed after the public announcement of, and before the consummation
       or abandonment of

        - a merger or consolidation of the corporation,

        - a sale of 50% or more of the aggregate market value of the assets of
          the corporation and its subsidiaries determined on a consolidated
          basis or the aggregate market value of all outstanding shares of the
          corporation or

        - a tender or exchange offer for 50% or more of the outstanding shares
          of voting stock of the corporation

     - is with a person who either was not an interested stockholder during the
       previous three years or who became an interested stockholder with the
       approval of the board of directors and

     - is approved by a majority of the current directors who were also
       directors before any person became an interested stockholder during the
       previous three years.

     An "interested stockholder" generally is defined as a person that owns 15%
or more of the corporation's outstanding voting stock and the affiliates and
associates of that person.

     The term "business combination" includes the following transactions with an
interested stockholder:

     - a merger or consolidation of the corporation with an interested
       stockholder

     - any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other
       disposition, except proportionately as a stockholder of the corporation,
       of assets of the corporation or its subsidiaries having an aggregate
       market value equal to 10% or more of either the aggregate market value of
       all assets of the corporation and its subsidiaries determined on a
       consolidated basis or the aggregate market value of all the outstanding
       stock of the corporation

     - any transaction which results in the issuance or transfer by the
       corporation or its subsidiaries of stock of the corporation or the
       subsidiary to the interested stockholder, except for transactions
       involving the exercise, conversion or exchange of securities outstanding
       before the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and
       certain other transactions which do not increase the interested
       stockholder's proportionate share of any class or series of the
       corporation's stock

     - any transaction involving the corporation or any of its subsidiaries
       which increases the proportionate share of any class or series of stock,
       or securities convertible into the stock of any class or series, of the
       corporation or any subsidiary which is owned by the interested
       stockholder, except as a result of immaterial changes due to fractional
       share adjustments or as a result of any purchase or redemption of any
       shares of stock not caused by the interested stockholder or

     - any receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit, except
       proportionately as a stockholder of the corporation, of any loans,
       advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by the
       corporation or its subsidiaries.

     Due to the contemplated consummation of the merger, Heartport does not
currently expect to hold a 2001 annual meeting of stockholders because Heartport
will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. In the event the merger
is not completed, Heartport's by-laws require that Heartport hold its 2001
annual stockholder meeting within 13 months of its 2000 annual stockholder
meeting, which was held on June 7, 2000. Heartport's by-laws require a
stockholder who intends to nominate directors or propose new business at any
annual meeting to provide advance notice of such intended action as well as
certain additional information. Such advance notice and additional information
must have been received by Heartport no later than January 3, 2001. In addition,
under the Federal securities laws, a stockholder proposal must have been
received by Heartport no later than January 3, 2001 in order to be considered by
the Heartport board of directors for inclusion in the proxy statement for the
2001 annual stockholder meeting.

               SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     This proxy statement/prospectus contains certain forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with
respect to the financial condition, results of operations, business strategies,
operating efficiencies or synergies, competitive positions, growth opportunities
for existing products, plans and objectives of management, markets for stock of
Johnson & Johnson and Heartport and other matters. Statements in this proxy
statement/prospectus that are not historical facts are hereby identified as
"forward-looking statements" for the purpose of the safe harbor provided by
Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act. Such
forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those relating to the
future business prospects, revenues and income, in each case relating to Johnson
& Johnson and Heartport, wherever they occur in this proxy statement/prospectus,
are necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgment of the senior management
of Johnson & Johnson (with regard to matters relating to Johnson & Johnson) and
Heartport (with regard to matters relating to Heartport) and involve a number of
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking
statements should, therefore, be considered in light of various important
factors, including those set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus. Important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or
projections contained in the forward-looking statements include without
limitation:

     - competitive factors, including technological advances achieved and
       patents attained by competitors and generic competition as patents on
       Johnson & Johnson's and Heartport's products expire and

     - government laws and regulations affecting domestic and foreign
       operations, including those relating to trade, monetary and fiscal
       policies, taxes, price controls, regulatory approval of new products and
       licensing.

     Words such as "estimate," "project," "plan," "intend," "expect," "believe"
and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
These forward-looking statements are found at various places throughout this
proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents incorporated by reference,
including, but not limited to, the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
January 2, 2000 of Johnson & Johnson, including any amendments, and the Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000 of Heartport, including
any amendments. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus. Neither Johnson & Johnson nor Heartport undertakes any
obligation to publicly update or release any revisions to these forward-looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

     The foregoing list sets forth some, but not all, of the factors that could
impact upon Johnson & Johnson's and Heartport's ability to achieve results
described in any forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on such statements that speak only as of the date made.
Investors also should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify
all such factors and that this list should not be considered a complete
statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Investors should also
realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or
uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from Johnson &
Johnson's and Heartport's projections. Johnson & Johnson and Heartport undertake
no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of future
events or developments.

                                                                         ANNEX 1

                              AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
                         (this "Agreement") dated as of January 26, 2001, among
                         JOHNSON & JOHNSON, a New Jersey corporation ("Parent"),
                         HP MERGER SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation and a
                         wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and
                         HEARTPORT, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
                         "Company").

     WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger dated as of January 26, 2001 (the "Original Agreement"), and they now
desire to amend and restate the Original Agreement in its entirety to provide
for certain technical and other modifications thereto;

     WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company
have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the merger of Sub with
and into the Company (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding
share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Company ("Company
Common Stock"), other than Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Sub or the
Company, will be converted into the right to receive common stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock");

     WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of the Original
Agreement and as a condition and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter
into the Original Agreement, Parent and certain stockholders of the Company (the
"Principal Stockholders") entered into an agreement (the "Stockholder
Agreement") pursuant to which the Principal Stockholders agreed to vote, approve
and adopt this Agreement and to take certain other actions in furtherance of the
consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Stockholder Agreement;

     WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and that this Agreement
constitutes a plan of reorganization; and

     WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to
prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

     SECTION 1.01.  The Merger.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall
succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in accordance with
the DGCL.

     SECTION 1.02.  Closing.  The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will
take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the parties (the "Closing
Date"), which shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), at the offices of Cravath, Swaine &
Moore, Worldwide Plaza, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10019, unless another
date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

     SECTION 1.03.  Effective Time.  Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") executed in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the DGCL and, as soon as practicable on or after

                                       A-1

the Closing Date, shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at
such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree should be specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the
"Effective Time").

     SECTION 1.04.  Effects of the Merger.  The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

     SECTION 1.05.  Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws.  (a) The
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended at
the Effective Time to be in the form of Exhibit A and, as so amended, such
Certificate of Incorporation shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or
by applicable law.

     (b) The By-laws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed
or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

     SECTION 1.06.  Directors.  The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are
duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

     SECTION 1.07.  Officers.  The officers of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are
duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

                                   ARTICLE II

                EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE
               CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     SECTION 2.01.  Effect on Capital Stock.  As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Sub:

          (a) Capital Stock of Sub.  Each issued and outstanding share of
     capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
     fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
     share, of the Surviving Corporation.

          (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock.  Each share
     of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Sub shall
     automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
     Parent Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
     therefor.

          (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock.  Subject to Sections 2.01(d)
     and 2.02(e), each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled
     in accordance with Section 2.01(b)) shall be converted into the right to
     receive that number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares
     of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Merger
     Consideration"). The "Exchange Ratio" means the quotient obtained by
     dividing $2.72 by the Average Closing Price and rounding to the nearest
     1/10,000. The "Average Closing Price" shall be an amount equal to the
     average per share closing price of Parent Common Stock, as reported on the
     New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") Composite Transactions Tape (as
     reported by The Wall Street Journal (Northeast edition), or, if not
     reported thereby, any other authoritative source) (the "NYSE Composite
     Transactions Tape") for the 20 trading days ending with the second trading
     day immediately preceding the Closing Date. As of the Effective Time, all
     such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
     shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
     each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
     represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate")
     shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to

                                       A-2

     receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to
     which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and any cash in
     lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in
     consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance
     with Section 2.02(e), without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
     between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding
     shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a different
     number of shares or a different class, by reason of the occurrence or
     record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
     recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
     transaction, the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect
     such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
     split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

          (d) Appraisal Rights.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
     the contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock
     issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are
     held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal
     of such Appraisal Shares pursuant to the relevant provisions of applicable
     law, shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
     Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead the holders of
     Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
     Appraisal Shares in accordance with applicable law; provided, however, that
     if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw
     or lose the right to appraisal under applicable law, or a court of
     competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
     the relief provided by applicable law, then the right of such holder to be
     paid the fair value of such holder's Appraisal Shares shall cease and such
     Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective
     Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the appropriate
     portion of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). At the
     Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
     shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
     of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
     except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance
     with the relevant provisions of applicable law. The Company shall serve
     prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of
     Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and
     direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior
     to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
     consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
     settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

     SECTION 2.02.  Exchange of Certificates.  (a) Exchange Agent. As of the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with First Chicago Trust Company of New
York or such other bank or trust company of similar size as may be designated by
Parent (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through
the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 2.01 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto with a record date after the Effective Time
and any cash payments in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock,
being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). Subject to Section
2.02(f), the Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver
the Parent Common Stock contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 2.01 out
of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by this Article II, the Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

     (b) Exchange Procedures.  As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, but in any event within 10 business days thereafter, Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate
whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.01(c), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in
customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in
surrendering the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the
Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares. Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of

                                       A-3

transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II after taking into account all the
shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder under all such
Certificates so surrendered, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.02(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing
the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c), may be issued to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if, upon
presentation to the Exchange Agent, such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
issuance shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of
any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.02(e).
No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates pursuant to Section 2.02(c) or 2.02(e).

     (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.  No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no
cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section 2.02(e) until the holder of record of such Certificate shall
surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of
the certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect
to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

     (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.  All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Article II (including any cash paid pursuant
to Section 2.02(c) or 2.02(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.

     (e) No Fractional Shares.  (i) No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution of Parent shall relate to
such fractional share interests and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent.

                                       A-4

     (ii) In lieu of such fractional share interests, Parent shall pay to each
former holder of Company Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such former
holder (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the
Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the per share
closing price of Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date, as such price is
reported on the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape.

     (f) Termination of Exchange Fund.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of
the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment
of their claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent
Common Stock in accordance with this Article II. If any Certificates shall not
have been surrendered prior to three years after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would
otherwise escheat to or became the property of any Governmental Entity), any
such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

     (g) No Liability.  None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock
(or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or cash from the Exchange Fund, in each
case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

     (h) Investment of Exchange Fund.  The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent.

     (i) Lost Certificates.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Parent
Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, in each case pursuant to this
Agreement.

     (j) Withholding Rights.  The Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code,
or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, the
Exchange Agent will be treated as though it withheld an appropriate amount of
the type of consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Company Common Stock, sold such consideration for an amount of cash
equal to the fair market value of such consideration at the time of such deemed
sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate taxing authority.

                                  ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     SECTION 3.01.  Representations and Warranties of the Company.  Except as
(i) set forth on the disclosure schedule (with specific reference to the
particular subsection of this Agreement to which the information set forth in
such disclosure schedule relates; provided, however, that to the extent it is
readily apparent on the face of such exception that such exception also relates
to another subsection of this Section 3.01, each such other subsection shall
also be qualified by such exception) delivered by the
                                       A-5

Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure Schedule") or (ii) described in any Company SEC Document filed and
publicly available at least three business days prior to the date of this
Agreement, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows:

          (a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power.  The Company is a
     corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
     laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and
     authority and possesses all governmental licenses, permits, authorizations
     and approvals necessary to enable it to use its corporate name and to own,
     lease or otherwise hold and operate its properties and other assets and to
     carry on its business as presently conducted, except where the failure to
     have such governmental licenses, permits, authorizations or approvals,
     individually or in the aggregate, has not had and could not reasonably be
     expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly qualified
     or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
     which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of
     its properties or other assets makes such qualification or licensing
     necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
     qualified or licensed individually or in the aggregate has not had and
     could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
     Company has delivered to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement
     true and correct copies of its Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the
     "Company Certificate") and Amended and Restated By-laws (the "Company
     By-laws"), in each case as amended through the date hereof.

          (b) Subsidiaries.  The Company does not own any capital stock or other
     ownership interest in any person other than short-term investments that
     constitute cash equivalents.

          (c) Capital Structure.  The authorized capital stock of the Company
     consists of 100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 20,000,000
     shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share ("Preferred Stock").
     At the close of business on January 23, 2001, (i) 26,379,821 shares of
     Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding, (ii) 42,666 shares of
     Company Common Stock were held by the Company in its treasury, (iii)
     10,793,615 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance
     pursuant to the Company Stock Plans (of which 6,415,233 shares of Company
     Common Stock were subject to outstanding options to purchase shares of
     Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans ("Stock Plan
     Options")), (iv) 1,109,530 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for
     issuance pursuant to options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
     outside of the Company Stock Plans ("Non-Plan Stock Options" and, together
     with the Stock Plan Options, "Stock Options") (all of which shares of
     Company Common Stock are subject to outstanding Non-Plan Stock Options),
     (v) 1,652,393 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance
     upon conversion of the Company's 7.25% Convertible Subordinated Notes due
     2004 (the "Convertible Notes") (after giving effect to any conversion or
     redemption prior to January 23, 2001), (vi) no shares of Preferred Stock
     were issued or outstanding and (vii) 50,000 shares of Series A Junior
     Participating Preferred Stock were reserved for issuance in connection with
     the Rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement. Except as set forth
     above in this Section 3.01(c), at the close of business on January 23,
     2001, no shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company
     were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. Except as set forth
     above in this Section 3.01(c), there are no outstanding stock appreciation
     rights, "phantom" stock rights, rights to receive shares of Company Common
     Stock on a deferred basis or other similar rights, granted under the
     Company Stock Plans or otherwise. Section 3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list, as of January 23, 2001,
     of all outstanding Stock Options or other rights to purchase or receive
     Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise,
     the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto, expiration
     dates and exercise prices thereof and the names of the holders thereof. All
     outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are, and all shares
     which may be issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plans will be, when
     issued in accordance with the terms thereof, duly authorized, validly
     issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights.
     Except as set forth above in this Section 3.01(c), there are no issued or
     outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company
     having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for,

                                       A-6

     securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders
     of the Company may vote. Except as set forth above in this Section 3.01(c)
     or resulting from the issuance of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
     to the exercise of Stock Options outstanding as of the date hereof or
     purchase rights held by participants under the Company ESPP outstanding as

     issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding (A) any shares of capital
     stock or other voting securities of the Company, (B) any securities of the
     Company convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of
     capital stock or voting securities of the Company, (C) any warrants, calls,
     options or other rights to acquire from the Company, and no obligation of
     the Company to issue, any capital stock, voting securities or securities
     convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock or voting
     securities of the Company and (y) there are not any outstanding obligations
     of the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such
     securities or to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered
     or sold, any such securities. The Company is not a party to any voting
     agreement with respect to the voting of any such securities.

          (d) Authority; Noncontravention.  The Company has the requisite
     corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and,
     subject to receipt of the Stockholder Approval, to consummate the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of
     this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by
     all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no other
     corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
     this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
     subject, in the case of the Merger, to receipt of the Stockholder Approval
     and the filing and acceptance for record of the Certificate of Merger as
     required by the DGCL. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
     by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
     by each of the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
     obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance
     with its terms. The Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly
     called and held at which all directors of the Company were present, duly
     and unanimously adopted resolutions (i) approving and declaring advisable
     this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
     (ii) declaring that it is in the best interests of the stockholders of the
     Company that the Company enter into this Agreement and consummate the
     Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
     Agreement, (iii) directing that this Agreement be submitted to a vote at a
     meeting of the stockholders of the Company and (iv) recommending that the
     stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement. The execution and
     delivery of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the Merger and
     the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with
     the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any
     violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
     time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation
     or acceleration of any obligation or the loss of a material benefit under,
     or result in the creation of any pledge, claim, lien, charge, encumbrance
     or security interest of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively,
     "Liens") in or upon any of the properties or assets of the Company under,
     (x) the Company Certificate or Company By-laws, (y) any loan or credit
     agreement, bond, debenture, note, mortgage, indenture, lease or other
     contract, agreement, obligation, commitment, arrangement, understanding,
     instrument, permit or license, whether oral or written, to which the
     Company is a party or any of its properties or other assets is subject or
     (z) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in
     the following sentence, any (A) statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
     or (B) order, writ, injunction, decree, judgment or stipulation, in each
     case applicable to the Company or its properties or other assets, other
     than, in the case of clauses (y) and (z), any such conflicts, violations,
     breaches, defaults, rights, losses or Liens that individually or in the
     aggregate have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a
     Material Adverse Effect. No consent, approval, order or authorization of,
     action by or in respect of, or registration, declaration or filing with,
     any Federal, state, local or foreign government, any court, administrative,
     regulatory or other governmental agency, commission or authority or any
     non-governmental self-regulatory agency, commission or authority (each, a

                                       A-7

     "Governmental Entity") is required by or with respect to the Company in
     connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
     or the consummation by the Company of the Merger or the other transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement, except for (1) the filing of a premerger
     notification and report form by the Company under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
     Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (together with the rules and
     regulations promulgated thereunder, the "HSR Act"), (2) the filing with the
     Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") of (A) a proxy statement
     relating to the adoption by the stockholders of the Company of this
     Agreement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Proxy
     Statement") and (B) any such reports under Section 13(a), 13(d), 15(d) or
     16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the
     rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act"), as may
     be required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement, (3) applicable requirements, if any, of (A)
     the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and
     regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Securities Act"), (B) state
     securities or "blue sky" laws and (C) the rules and regulations of The
     Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., (4) the filing and recordation of the
     Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
     and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states in
     which the Company is qualified to do business and (5) such other consents,
     approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings
     the failure of which to be obtained or made individually or in the
     aggregate has not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a
     Material Adverse Effect.

          (e) Company SEC Documents.  The Company has filed all reports,
     schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including, in all
     material respects, exhibits and other information incorporated therein)
     with the SEC required to be filed by the Company since January 1, 1998 (the
     "Company SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates, the Company SEC
     Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
     Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, applicable to such
     Company SEC Documents, and except to the extent that information contained
     in any Company SEC Document has been revised, superseded or updated by a
     later-filed Company SEC Document, none of the Company SEC Documents
     contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
     material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
     the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
     were made, not misleading. The financial statements (including, in each
     case, any related notes thereto) of the Company included in the Company SEC
     Documents comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
     accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
     with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally
     accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited
     statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent
     basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
     thereto) and fairly present, in all material respects, the financial
     position of the Company as of the dates thereof and the results of its
     operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case
     of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end audit
     adjustments). Except as set forth in the most recent financial statements
     included in the Company SEC Documents filed by the Company and publicly
     available prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Filed Company SEC
     Documents"), the Company has no liabilities or obligations (whether
     accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) (i) of a nature required to be
     disclosed on a balance sheet or in the related notes to financial
     statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or (ii) which, individually or
     in the aggregate, have had or could reasonably be expected to have a
     Material Adverse Effect.

          (f) Information Supplied.  None of the information supplied or to be
     supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
     reference in (i) the registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed with
     the SEC by Parent in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in
     the Merger (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Form S-4")
     will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is
     amended or supplemented and at the time it becomes effective under the
     Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
     state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
     to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
     which they are made, not misleading or (ii) the Proxy

                                       A-8

     Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the Company's
     stockholders and at the time of the Stockholders' Meeting, contain any
     untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
     required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
     therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
     misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material

     Company to any current or former director, officer or employee of the
     Company of any increase in compensation, bonus or other benefits, except
     for normal increases in cash compensation in the ordinary course of
     business consistent with past practice or as was required under employment
     agreements in effect as of the date of the most recent audited financial
     statements included in the Filed Company SEC Documents, (B) any granting by
     the Company to any current or former director, officer or employee of any

     the most recent financial statements included in the Filed Company SEC
     Documents, (C) any entry by the Company into, or any amendment of, (1) any

     except insofar as may have been required by a change in GAAP, or (vi) any

     income tax liability.

          (h) Litigation.  Except as disclosed in the Filed Company SEC
     Documents, there is no suit, action or proceeding pending or, to the
     Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company that
     individually or in the aggregate has had or could reasonably be expected to
     have a Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any judgment, decree,
     injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator
     outstanding against, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, investigation by
     any Governmental Entity involving, the Company that individually or in the
     aggregate has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material
     Adverse Effect.

          (i) Contracts.  The Company is not a party to, and none of its
     properties or other assets are subject to, any contract or agreement that
     are of a nature required to be filed as an exhibit to a report or filing
     under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. The Company is not in
     violation of or in default under (nor to the Knowledge of the Company does
     there exist any condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of
     notice or both would cause such a violation of or default under) any loan
     or credit agreement, bond, debenture, note, mortgage, indenture, lease or
     other contract, agreement, obligation, commitment, arrangement,
     understanding, instrument, permit or license, whether oral or written, to
     which the Company is a party or by which it or any of its properties or

                                       A-9

     other assets is bound, except for violations or defaults that individually
     or in the aggregate have not had and could not reasonably be expected to
     have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has not entered into any
     contract, agreement, obligation, commitment, arrangement or understanding
     with any Affiliate of the Company that is currently in effect other than
     any such agreements, obligations, commitments, arrangements or
     understandings that, individually, has aggregate future payment or other
     obligations of no greater than $50,000 and, in the aggregate, have future
     payment or other obligations of no greater than $100,000 and other than
     agreements, obligations, commitments, arrangements or understandings that
     are disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents. The Company is not a
     party to or otherwise bound by any agreement or covenant not to compete or
     by any agreement or covenant restricting in any material respect the
     development, marketing or distribution of the Company's products or
     services.

          (j) Compliance with Laws.  (i) The Company is in compliance with all
     statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, judgments, orders and
     decrees of any Governmental Entity applicable to it, its properties or
     other assets or its business or operations (collectively, "Legal
     Provisions"), except for instances of noncompliance or possible
     noncompliance that individually or in the aggregate have not had and could
     not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company
     has in effect all approvals, authorizations, certificates, filings,
     franchises, licenses, notices, permits and rights of or with all
     Governmental Entities, including all authorizations under Environmental
     Laws (collectively, "Permits"), necessary for it to own, lease or operate
     its properties and assets and to carry on its business and operations as
     presently conducted, except for failures to have in effect such Permits
     that individually or in the aggregate have not had and could not reasonably
     be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There has occurred no
     default under, or violation of, any such Permit, except individually or in
     the aggregate as has not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a
     Material Adverse Effect. The Merger, in and of itself, would not cause the
     revocation or cancellation of any such Permit that individually or in the
     aggregate could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
     No action, demand, requirement or investigation by any Governmental Entity
     and no suit, action or proceeding by any other person, in each case with
     respect to the Company or any of its properties or other assets under any
     Legal Provision, is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
     threatened, other than, in each case, those the outcome of which
     individually or in the aggregate has not had and could not reasonably be
     expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (ii) Except for those matters disclosed in the Filed Company SEC
     Documents or those matters that individually or in the aggregate have not
     had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect:
     (A) the Company is, and has been, in compliance with all applicable
     Environmental Laws; (B) during the period of ownership or operation by the
     Company of any of its currently or previously owned, leased or operated
     properties, there have been no Releases or, to the Knowledge of the
     Company, threatened Releases of Hazardous Material in, on, under or
     affecting such properties or any surrounding sites; (C) to the Knowledge of
     the Company, prior to the period of ownership or operation by the Company
     of any of its currently or previously owned, leased or operated properties,
     no Hazardous Material was generated, treated, stored, disposed of, used,
     handled or manufactured at, or transported or disposed of at or from, such
     properties, and there were no Releases of Hazardous Material in, on, under
     or affecting any such properties or any surrounding sites; (D) there is no
     investigation, suit, claim, action or proceeding pending, or to the
     Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company,
     relating to or arising under Environmental Laws, and the Company has not
     received any notice of, or entered into or assumed by contract or operation
     of law or otherwise, any obligation, liability, order, settlement,
     judgment, injunction or decree relating to or arising under Environmental
     Laws; and (E) to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts,
     circumstances or conditions which could reasonably be expected to form the
     basis for a suit, investigation, claim, action or proceeding against or
     affecting the Company relating to or arising under Environmental Laws. The
     term "Environmental Laws" means any applicable and binding Federal, state,
     local or foreign laws (including the common law), rules, regulations,
     codes, ordinances, orders, decrees, judgments, injunctions, notices or
     Permits relating to the environment,

                                      A-10

     preservation or reclamation of natural resources, the presence, management,
     Release or threat of Release of, or exposure to, Hazardous Materials, or to
     human health and safety. The term "Hazardous Material" means (A) petroleum
     products and byproducts, asbestos, urea formaldehyde foam insulation,
     asbestos or asbestos-containing materials, medical or infectious wastes,
     polychlorinated biphenyls, radon gas, chlorofluorocarbons and all other
     ozone-depleting substances or (B) any chemical, material, substance, waste,
     pollutant or contaminant that is prohibited, limited or regulated by or
     pursuant to any Environmental Law. The term "Release" shall be defined as
     in 42 U.S.C. Section 9601(22).

          (k) Absence of Changes in Benefit Plans; Labor Relations.  Except as
     disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents, since the date of the most
     recent financial statements included in the Filed Company SEC Documents,
     there has not been any adoption or amendment (or, in the case of any
     non-stock-based Benefit Plans, any amendment in any material respect) by
     the Company of any collective bargaining agreement or any employment,
     bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive
     compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock appreciation,
     restricted stock, stock option, phantom stock, performance, retirement,
     thrift, savings, stock bonus, paid time off, perquisite, fringe benefit,
     vacation, severance, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical,
     welfare benefit or other plan, program, policy, arrangement or
     understanding (whether or not legally binding) maintained, contributed to
     or required to be maintained or contributed to by the Company or any other
     person or entity that, together with the Company, is treated as a single
     employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each, a
     "Commonly Controlled Entity"), in each case providing benefits to any
     current or former officer, director or employee of the Company
     (collectively, the "Benefit Plans"), or any material change in any
     actuarial or other assumption used to calculate funding obligations with
     respect to any Pension Plans, or any material change in the manner in which
     contributions to any Pension Plans are made or the basis on which such
     contributions are determined. Except for any Benefit Agreements that,
     individually, has aggregate future payment or other obligations of no
     greater than $50,000 and, in the aggregate, have future payment or other
     obligations of no greater than $100,000 and except as disclosed in the
     Filed Company SEC Documents, there exist no currently binding Benefit
     Agreements. There are no collective bargaining or other labor union
     agreements to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound. Since
     January 1, 1998, the Company has not encountered any labor union organizing
     activity or had any actual or threatened employee strikes, work stoppages,
     slowdowns or lockouts that individually or in the aggregate has had or
     could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (l) ERISA Compliance.  (i) Section 3.01(l)(i) of the Company
     Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and accurate list of each "employee
     pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee
     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) (sometimes
     referred to herein as a "Pension Plan"), "employee welfare benefit plan"
     (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and all other Benefit Plans. The
     Company has made available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of
     (A) each Benefit Plan (or, in the case of any unwritten Benefit Plans,
     descriptions thereof), (B) the two most recent annual reports on Form 5500
     required to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with
     respect to each Benefit Plan (if any such report was required), (C) the
     most recent summary plan description for each Benefit Plan for which such
     summary plan description is required and (D) each trust agreement and
     insurance or group annuity contract relating to any Benefit Plan. To the
     Knowledge of the Company, each Benefit Plan has been administered in all
     material respects in accordance with its terms. The Benefit Plans have been
     administered in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the
     Code and all other applicable laws, including laws of foreign
     jurisdictions, except for instances of noncompliance or possible
     noncompliance that individually or in the aggregate have not had and could
     not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (ii) All Pension Plans intended to be tax-qualified have been the
     subject of determination letters from the IRS to the effect that such
     Pension Plans are qualified and exempt from United States Federal income
     taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code; no such

                                      A-11

     determination letter has been revoked (or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
     has revocation been threatened) nor has any event occurred since the date
     of the most recent determination letter or application therefor relating to
     any such Pension Plan that would adversely affect the qualification of such
     Pension Plan or materially increase the costs relating thereto or require
     security under Section 307 of ERISA. All Pension Plans maintained or
     contributed to by the Company required to have been approved by any foreign
     Governmental Entity have been so approved; no such approval has been
     revoked (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, has revocation been
     threatened) nor has any event occurred since the date of the most recent
     approval or application therefor relating to any such Pension Plan that
     would materially affect any such approval relating thereto or materially
     increase the costs relating thereto. The Company has delivered to Parent a
     true and complete copy of the most recent determination letter received
     with respect to each Pension Plan, as well as a true and complete copy of
     each pending application for a determination letter, if any. The Company
     has also provided to Parent a true and complete list of all Pension Plan
     amendments as to which a favorable determination letter has not yet been
     received.

          (iii) Neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has (A)
     maintained, contributed or been obligated to contribute to any Benefit Plan
     that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or (B) has any unsatisfied liability
     under Title IV of ERISA.

          (iv) All reports, returns and similar documents with respect to all
     Benefit Plans required to be filed with any Governmental Entity or
     distributed to any Benefit Plan participant have been duly and timely filed
     or distributed, except for failures to file or distribute that individually
     or in the aggregate have not had and could not reasonably be expected to
     have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has received no notice of, and
     to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no investigations by any
     Governmental Entity with respect to, termination proceedings or other
     claims (except claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the
     Benefit Plans), suits or proceedings against or involving any Benefit Plan
     or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Benefit Plan that
     could give rise to any material liability, and, to the Knowledge of the
     Company, there are not any facts that individually or in the aggregate have
     had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (v) All contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or in
     connection with the Benefit Plans that are required to have been made as of
     the date hereof in accordance with the terms of the Benefit Plans have been
     timely made or have been reflected on the most recent consolidated balance
     sheet filed or incorporated by reference into the Filed Company SEC
     Documents. No Pension Plan has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such
     term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code),
     whether or not waived.

          (vi) With respect to each Benefit Plan, (A) there has not occurred any
     prohibited transaction in which the Company or any of its employees has
     engaged that could subject the Company or any of its employees, or, to the
     Knowledge of the Company, a trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of
     any trust created under any Benefit Plan to the tax or penalty on
     prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of ERISA or the sanctions
     imposed under Title I of ERISA and (B) neither the Company nor, to the
     Knowledge of the Company, any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of
     any Benefit Plan nor any agent of any of the foregoing has engaged in any
     transaction or acted in a manner that could, or failed to act so as to,
     subject the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any trustee,
     administrator or other fiduciary to any liability for breach of fiduciary
     duty under ERISA or any other applicable law. No Benefit Plan or related
     trust has been terminated, nor has there been any "reportable event" (as
     that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the 30-day
     reporting requirement has not been waived with respect to any Benefit Plan
     during the last five years, and no notice of a reportable event will be
     required to be filed in connection with the transactions contemplated
     hereby.

          (vii) Section 3.01(l)(vii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
     discloses whether each Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit
     plan is (A) unfunded, (B) funded through a "welfare benefit

                                      A-12

     fund", as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the Code, or other
     funding mechanism or (C) insured. Each such employee welfare benefit plan
     may be amended or terminated (including with respect to benefits provided
     to retirees and other former employees) without material liability to the
     Company at any time after the Effective Time. The Company complies in all
     material respects with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of
     the Code with respect to each Benefit Plan that is a group health plan, as
     such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code. The Company does
     not have any material obligations for retiree health or life insurance
     benefits under any Benefit Plan.

          (viii) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
     obtaining of the Stockholder Approval or the consummation of the Merger or
     any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (including as a result
     of any termination of employment during a fixed period following the
     Effective Time) will (A) entitle any current or former director, officer or
     employee of the Company to severance or termination pay, (B) accelerate the
     time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a
     grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the
     amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any
     Benefit Plan or (C) result in any breach or violation of, or a default
     under, any Benefit Plan. The total amount of all payments and the fair
     market value of all non-cash benefits that may become payable or provided
     to any employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company under the
     Benefit Agreements (assuming for such purpose that such individuals'
     employment were terminated immediately following the Effective Time) will
     not exceed the amount set forth in Section 3.01(l)(viii) of the Company
     Disclosure Schedule.

          (ix) The Company does not have any material liability or obligations,
     including under or on account of a Benefit Plan, arising out of the hiring
     of persons to provide services to the Company and treating such persons as
     consultants or independent contractors and not as employees of the Company.

          (m) No Excess Parachute Payments.  Other than payments or benefits
     that may be made to the persons listed in Section 3.01(m) of the Company
     Disclosure Schedule ("Primary Company Executives"), no amount or other
     entitlement or economic benefit that could be received (whether in cash or
     property or the vesting of property) by or for the benefit of any officer,
     director or employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates who is a
     "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in proposed Treasury
     Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any Benefit Plan, Benefit Agreement or
     otherwise would be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as such
     term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No such person is
     entitled to receive any additional payment from the Company, the Surviving
     Corporation or any other person (a "Parachute Gross Up Payment") in the
     event that the excise tax required by Section 4999(a) of the Code is
     imposed on such person. The Board of Directors of the Company has not
     granted to any officer, director or employee of the Company any right to
     receive any Parachute Gross Up Payment. Section 3.01(m) of the Company
     Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) the "base amount" (as such term is
     defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each Primary Company
     Executive and each other disqualified individual (defined as set forth
     above) whose Stock Options will vest pursuant to their terms in connection
     with this Agreement or the Merger and (ii) the estimated maximum amount
     that could be paid or provided to each Primary Company Executive as a
     result of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement (including as a result of any termination of employment during a
     fixed period following the Effective Time).

          (n) Taxes.  The Company has timely filed all tax returns and reports
     required to be filed by it, and all taxes required to be paid by the
     Company have either been paid by it or are reflected in accordance with
     GAAP as a reserve for taxes on the most recent financial statements
     included in the Filed Company SEC Documents, and all such returns and
     reports are complete and correct in all material respects (provided, that
     no such return or report shall be considered to be incorrect or incomplete
     on account of an amount of unpaid taxes for which a reserve for taxes on
     the aforementioned financial statements has been established), or requests
     for extensions to file such returns or reports have been timely filed,
     granted and have not expired, except to the extent that such failures to
     file, to pay or to have extensions granted that remain in effect
     individually or in the
                                      A-13

     aggregate have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a
     Material Adverse Effect, and the most recent financial statements contained
     in the Filed Company SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve for all
     taxes payable by the Company for all taxable periods and portions thereof
     through the date of such financial statements. All taxes required to be
     withheld by the Company have been withheld and have been (or will be) duly
     and timely paid to the proper governmental authority. No deficiencies for
     any taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against the Company, and
     no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such taxes are pending.
     The Federal income tax returns of the Company have not been examined by the
     IRS. All assessments for material taxes due with respect to any concluded
     litigation have been fully paid or have been adequately reserved on the
     Company's financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Neither the Company
     nor any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action or knows
     of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger
     from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
     the Code; provided, however, that the exercise of appraisal rights by any
     of the Company's stockholders as contemplated by Section 2.01(d) shall not
     constitute a breach of the foregoing representation. The Benefit Plans and
     other Company employee compensation arrangements in effect as of the date
     of this Agreement have been designed so that the disallowance of a
     deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code for employee remuneration will
     not apply to any material amounts paid or payable by the Company under any
     such plan or arrangement and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no fact or
     circumstance exists that is reasonably likely to cause such disallowance to
     apply to any such amounts. The Company has not constituted either a
     "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the
     meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock
     qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (x) in the
     two years prior to the date of this Agreement or (y) in a distribution
     which could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related
     transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in
     conjunction with the Merger. As used in this Agreement, "taxes" shall
     include all Federal, state and local, domestic and foreign, income,
     property, sales, excise and other taxes, tariffs or governmental charges of
     any nature whatsoever, including any interest, penalties or additions with
     respect thereto, imposed by any Governmental Entity or any obligation to
     pay taxes imposed on any entity for which the Company is liable as a result
     of any indemnification provision or other contractual obligation.

          (o) Title to Properties.  (i) The Company has good and marketable
     title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its material properties and
     assets except for such as are no longer used or useful in the conduct of
     its businesses or as have been disposed of in the ordinary course of
     business and except for defects in title, easements, restrictive covenants
     and similar encumbrances that individually or in the aggregate would not
     materially interfere with its ability to conduct its business as presently
     conducted and as currently proposed by management of the Company to be
     conducted. All such material assets and properties, other than assets and
     properties in which the Company has a leasehold interest, are free and
     clear of all Liens, except for Liens that individually or in the aggregate
     would not materially interfere with the ability of the Company to conduct
     its business as presently conducted and as currently proposed by management
     of the Company to be conducted.

          (ii) The Company has complied with the terms of all material leases to
     which it is a party and under which it is in occupancy, and all such leases
     are in full force and effect, except for such noncompliance or failure to
     be in full force and effect that individually or in the aggregate has not
     had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
     The Company enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such
     leases in all material respects.

          (ii) No claims are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
     threatened that the Company is infringing (including with respect to the
     manufacture, use or sale by the Company of its commercial products) the
     rights of any person with regard to any Intellectual Property Right which,
     individually or in the aggregate, have had or could reasonably be expected
     to have a Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, no
     person or persons are infringing the rights of the Company with respect to
     any Intellectual Property Right in a manner which, individually or in the
     aggregate, has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material
     Adverse Effect.

          (iii) No claims are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
     threatened with regard to the Company's ownership of any of its
     Intellectual Property Rights which, individually or in the aggregate, have

          (iv) Section 3.01(p)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
     forth, as of the date hereof, a complete and accurate list of all patents,
     registered trademarks and applications therefor owned by or licensed to the
     Company. All patents and patent applications listed in Section 3.01(p)(iv)
     of the Company Disclosure Schedule are owned by the Company free and clear
     of all Liens. The patent applications listed in Section 3.01(p)(iv) of the
     Company Disclosure Schedule are pending and have not been abandoned, and
     have been and continue to be timely prosecuted. All patents, registered
     trademarks and applications therefor owned by or licensed to the Company
     have been duly registered and/or filed with or issued by each appropriate
     Governmental Entity in the jurisdiction indicated in Section 3.01(p)(iv) of
     the Company Disclosure Schedule, all necessary affidavits of continuing use
     have been filed, and all necessary maintenance fees have been timely paid
     to continue all such rights in effect. None of the patents listed in
     Section 3.01(p)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule has expired or has
     been declared invalid, in whole or in part, by any Governmental Entity.
     There are no ongoing interferences, oppositions, reissues, reexaminations
     or other proceedings involving any of the patents or patent applications
     listed in Section 3.01(p)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, including

     no published patents, patent applications, articles or other prior art
     references that could affect the validity of any patent listed in Section
     3.01(p)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Each of the patents and
     patent applications listed in Section 3.01(p)(iv) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule properly identifies each and every inventor of the claims thereof
     as determined in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which such
     patent is issued or such patent application is pending. Each inventor named
     on the patents and patent applications listed in Section 3.01(p)(iv) of the
     Company Disclosure Schedule has executed an agreement assigning his, her or
     its entire right, title and interest in and to such patent or patent
     application, and the inventions embodied and claimed therein, to the
     Company. Each inventor of the patents and patent applications listed in
     Section 3.01(p)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule has executed an
     agreement with the Company obligating such inventor to assign the entire
     right, title and interest in and to such patent or patent application, and
     inventions embodied and claimed therein, to the Company, and, to the
     Knowledge of the Company, no such inventor has any contractual or other
     obligation that would preclude any such assignment or otherwise conflict
     with the obligations of such inventor to the Company under such agreement
     with the Company.

          (v) Section 3.01(p)(v) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
     complete and accurate list of all options, rights, licenses or interests of
     any kind relating to Intellectual Property Rights (i) granted to the
     Company (other than software licenses for generally available software and
     except pursuant to employee proprietary inventions agreements (or similar
     employee agreements), non-disclosure agreements and consulting agreements
     entered into by the Company in the ordinary course of business), or (ii)
     granted by the Company to any other person.

          (vi) No material trade secret of the Company has been published or
     disclosed by the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, by any other
     person to any person except pursuant to licenses or contracts requiring
     such other persons to keep such trade secrets confidential.

                                      A-15

          (q) Voting Requirements.  The affirmative vote of a majority of the
     votes that holders of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are
     entitled to vote at the Stockholders' Meeting or any adjournment or
     postponement thereof to adopt this Agreement (the "Stockholder Approval")
     is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Company's
     capital stock necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve the
     transactions contemplated hereby.

          (r) State Takeover Statutes.  The Board of Directors of the Company
     has unanimously approved the terms of this Agreement and the Stockholder
     Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement, and such
     approval represents all the action necessary to render inapplicable to this
     Agreement, the Stockholder Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement, the
     provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL to the extent, if any, such Section
     would otherwise be applicable to this Agreement, the Stockholder Agreement,
     the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
     the Stockholder Agreement. To the Knowledge of the Company, no other state
     takeover statute or similar statute or regulation applies or purports to
     apply to this Agreement, the Stockholder Agreement, the Merger or the other
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement.

          (s) Brokers.  No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other
     person, other than Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., the fees and expenses
     of which will be paid by the Company, is entitled to any broker's,
     finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in
     connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
     arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company. The Company has delivered
     to Parent true and complete copies of all agreements under which any such
     fees or expenses are payable and all indemnification and other agreements
     related to the engagement of the persons to whom such fees are payable. The
     fees and expenses of any accountant, broker, financial advisor, legal
     counsel or other person retained by the Company in connection with this
     Agreement or the Stockholder Agreement or the transactions contemplated
     hereby or thereby incurred or to be incurred by the Company will not exceed
     the fees and expenses set forth in Section 3.01(s) of the Company
     Disclosure Schedule.

          (t) Opinion of Financial Advisor.  The Company has received the
     opinion of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. dated the date hereof, to the
     effect that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration is fair from a
     financial point of view to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, a
     signed copy of which opinion has been delivered to Parent.

          (u) Development, Distribution, Marketing, Supply and Manufacturing
     Agreements.  Section 3.01(u) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
     a complete and accurate list of all contracts or agreements (whether or not
     in written form), to which the Company is a party as of the date hereof or
     with respect to which the Company has any ongoing obligations as of the
     date hereof, in each case relating to the research, development,
     distribution, training, sale, license, marketing and supply of components
     for, and manufacturing by third parties of, the Company's products or
     products licensed by the Company, other than any such agreements or
     contracts that, individually, has aggregate future payment or other
     obligations of no greater than $75,000 and, in the aggregate, have future
     payment or other obligations of no greater than $150,000, none of which has
     a remaining term of greater than one year. The Company has made available
     to Parent true and complete copies of all such contracts.

          (v) Rights Agreement.  The Company has taken all actions necessary to
     cause the Rights Agreement, dated as of April 25, 1996, as amended, between
     the Company and Boston Equiserve Limited Partnership, formerly The First
     National Bank of Boston, as rights agent (the "Rights Agreement") to be
     amended to (i) render the Rights Agreement inapplicable to this Agreement,
     the Stockholder Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement, (ii) ensure
     that (y) none of Parent, Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent is an
     Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement) pursuant to the
     Rights Agreement and (z) a Distribution Date or a Shares Acquisition Date
     (as such terms are defined in

                                      A-16

     the Rights Agreement) does not occur, in either case of (y) and (z), solely
     by reason of the execution of this Agreement or the Stockholder Agreement
     or the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
     this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement and (iii) provide that the
     Final Expiration Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement) shall occur
     immediately prior to the Effective Time.

          (w) Regulatory Compliance.  (i) As to each product subject to the
     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended ("FDCA"), and the
     regulations of the Federal Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA")
     promulgated thereunder, or similar Legal Provisions in any foreign
     jurisdiction (each such product, a "Medical Device") that is manufactured,
     tested, distributed and/or marketed by the Company, such Medical Device is
     being manufactured, tested, distributed and/or marketed in compliance with
     all applicable requirements under FDCA, the FDA regulations promulgated
     thereunder, and such similar Legal Provisions, including those relating to
     investigational use, premarket clearance, good manufacturing practices,
     labeling, advertising, record keeping, filing of reports and security,
     except for failures to be in compliance which, individually or in the
     aggregate, have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a
     Material Adverse Effect. The Company has not received any notice or other
     communication from the FDA or any other Governmental Entity (A) contesting
     the premarket clearance or approval of, the uses of or the labeling and
     promotion of any of the Company's products or (B) otherwise alleging any
     violation of any Legal Provision by the Company.

          (ii) No Medical Devices have been recalled, withdrawn, suspended or
     discontinued by the Company in the United States or outside the United
     States (whether voluntarily or otherwise), other than any such recalls,
     withdrawals, suspensions or discontinuations that, individually or in the
     aggregate, have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a
     Material Adverse Effect. No proceedings in the United States and outside of
     the United States of which the Company has Knowledge (whether completed or
     pending) seeking the recall, withdrawal, suspension or seizure of any
     Medical Devices are pending against the Company, nor have any such
     proceedings been pending at any prior time.

          (iii) Neither the Company nor any officer, employee nor, to the
     Knowledge of the Company, agent of the Company, in each case acting on
     behalf of the Company, has made an untrue statement of a material fact or
     fraudulent statement to the FDA or any other Governmental Entity, failed to
     disclose a material fact required to be disclosed to the FDA or any other
     Governmental Entity, or committed an act, made a statement, or failed to
     make a statement that, at the time such disclosure was made, could
     reasonably be expected to provide a basis for the FDA to invoke its policy
     respecting "Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and
     Illegal Gratuities", set forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September 10, 1991)
     or for any other Governmental Entity to invoke any similar policy. Neither
     the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any officer, employee or
     agent of the Company, has been convicted of any crime or engaged in any
     conduct for which debarment is mandated by 21 U.S.C. sec. 335a(a) or any
     similar Legal Provision or authorized by 21 U.S.C. sec. 335a(b) or any
     similar Legal Provision.

          (iv) The Company has not received any written notice that the FDA or
     any other Governmental Entity has commenced, or threatened to initiate, any
     action to withdraw its approval or request the recall of any product of the
     Company, or commenced, or threatened to initiate, any action to enjoin
     production at any facility of the Company which has had or could reasonably
     be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 3.02.  Representations and Warranties of Parent and Sub.  Parent
and Sub represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

          (a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power.  Each of Parent and
     Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
     under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated and has all
     requisite corporate power and authority and possesses all governmental
     licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to
     use its corporate name and to

                                      A-17

     own, lease or otherwise hold and operate its properties and other assets
     and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the
     failure to have such governmental licenses, permits, authorizations or
     approvals, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and could not
     reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of
     Parent and Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
     standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
     ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification
     or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure
     to be so qualified or licensed individually or in the aggregate has not had
     and could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
     Effect. Parent has made available to the Company prior to the execution of
     this Agreement true and correct copies of its Restated Certificate of
     Incorporation and By-laws and the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws
     of Sub, in each case as amended to the date hereof.

          (b) Authority; Noncontravention.  Each of Parent and Sub has all
     requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
     Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Sub
     and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
     Parent and Sub have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action
     on the part of Parent and Sub and no other corporate proceedings on the
     part of Parent or Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
     consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement and the
     transactions contemplated hereby, including the issuance of shares of
     Parent Common Stock pursuant to Article II hereof, does not require the
     approval of the holders of any shares of capital stock of Parent. All
     outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock are (and all shares of Parent
     Common Stock which may be issued pursuant to this Agreement, when issued in
     accordance with this Agreement, will be) duly authorized, validly issued,
     fully paid and nonassessable and, in the case of shares of Parent Common
     Stock which may be issued pursuant to this Agreement, will not be subject
     to any restrictions on resale under the Securities Act, other than
     restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the Securities Act. This Agreement
     has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Sub, as applicable, and,
     assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company,
     constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Sub, as
     applicable, enforceable against Parent and Sub, as applicable, in
     accordance with its terms. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
     does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this
     Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of,
     or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or
     give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
     obligation or the loss of a material benefit under, or result in the
     creation of any Lien in or upon any of the properties or assets of Parent
     or Sub under (x) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of
     Parent or the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of Sub, (y) any loan
     or credit agreement, bond, debenture, note, mortgage, indenture, lease or
     other contract, agreement, obligation, commitment, arrangement,
     understanding, instrument, permit or license, whether oral or written, to
     which Parent or Sub is a party or any of their respective properties or
     other assets is subject or (z) subject to the governmental filings and
     other matters referred to in the following sentence, any (A) statute, law,
     ordinance, rule or regulation or (B) order, writ, injunction, decree,
     judgment or stipulation, in each case applicable to Parent or Sub or their
     respective properties or other assets, other than, in the case of clauses
     (y) and (z), any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, rights,
     losses or Liens that individually or in the aggregate have not had and
     could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
     No consent, approval, order or authorization of, action by or in respect
     of, or registration, declaration or filings with, any Governmental Entity
     is required by or with respect to Parent or Sub in connection with the
     execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Sub or the
     consummation by Parent and Sub of the Merger or the other transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement, except for (1) the filing of a premerger
     notification and report form by Parent under the HSR Act, (2) the filing
     with the SEC of (A) the Form S-4 and (B) any such reports under Section
     13(a), 13(d), 15(d) or 16(a) of the Exchange Act as may be required in
     connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement, (3) the filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger with
     the

                                      A-18

     Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, (4) filings with the NYSE and
     (5) such other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
     declarations and filings the failure of which to be obtained or made,
     individually or in the aggregate, has not had and could not reasonably be
     expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

          (c) Parent SEC Documents.  Parent has filed all reports, schedules,
     forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits and other
     information incorporated therein) with the SEC required to be filed by
     Parent since January 1, 1998 (the "Parent SEC Documents"). As of their
     respective dates, the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material
     respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
     as the case may be, applicable to such Parent SEC Documents, and except to
     the extent that information contained in any Parent SEC Document has been
     revised, superseded or updated by a later-filed Parent SEC Document, none
     of the Parent SEC Documents contains any untrue statement of a material
     fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
     necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
     circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

          (d) Information Supplied.  None of the information supplied or to be
     supplied by Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
     reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with
     the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented and at the time it
     becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
     therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
     circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or (ii) the Proxy
     Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the Company's
     stockholders and at the time of the Stockholders' Meeting, contain any
     untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
     required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
     therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
     misleading. The Form S-4 will comply as to form in all material respects
     with the requirements of the Securities Act, except that no representation
     or warranty is made by Parent or Sub with respect to statements made or
     incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the
     Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
     Form S-4.

          (e) Interim Operations of Sub.  Sub was formed solely for the purpose
     of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby, has engaged in no
     other business activities and has conducted its operations only as
     contemplated hereby.

          (f) Tax Matters.  Neither Parent, Sub nor any Affiliate of Parent has
     taken or agreed to take any action or knows of any fact or circumstance
     that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
     reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; provided,
     however, that the exercise of appraisal rights by any of the Company's
     stockholders as contemplated by Section 2.01(d) shall not constitute a
     breach of the foregoing representation.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                   COVENANTS RELATING TO CONDUCT OF BUSINESS

     (b) Other Actions.  The Company, Parent and Sub shall not take any action
that would, or that could reasonably be expected to, result in (i) any of the

and warranties that are not so qualified becoming untrue in any material respect
or (iii) any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI not being
satisfied.

     (c) Advice of Changes; Filings.  The Company and Parent shall promptly
advise the other party in writing of (i) any representation or warranty made by
it (and, in the case of Parent, made by Sub) contained in this Agreement that is
qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any
such representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure of it (and, in the case
of Parent, by Sub) to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies

this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall promptly provide the other copies
of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, other than the
portions of such filings that include confidential information not directly

     (d) Certain Tax Matters.  From the date of this Agreement and continuing

tax election without Parent's prior written consent; provided, that Parent shall
use reasonable efforts to timely respond to a written request by the Company to
make any such material tax election.

     SECTION 4.02.  No Solicitation.  (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any officer, director or employee of the Company or any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor,
agent or representative retained by the Company (collectively,
"Representatives") to, directly or indirectly through another person (i)
solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any other action intended to, or which
could reasonably be expected to, facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover
Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any person any information, or otherwise cooperate in any way with,
any Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any
Representative of the Company, whether or not such person is purporting to act
on behalf of the Company or otherwise, shall be a breach of this Section 4.02(a)
by the Company. The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore
with respect to any Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder
Approval, in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which
Takeover Proposal was unsolicited and made after the date hereof and did not
otherwise result from a breach of this Section 4.02(a), the Company may, if its
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel who may be the Company's independent legal counsel acting with respect
to this Agreement) that it is required to do so in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable law, and subject
to compliance with Section 4.02(c) and after giving Parent written notice of
such determination, (x) furnish information with respect to the Company to the
person

                                      A-22

making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives)
regarding such Takeover Proposal.

     The term "Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
person relating to, or that is reasonably likely to lead to, any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, of a business that constitutes 15% or more of the revenues, net
income, or the assets of the Company, or 15% or more of the Company Common
Stock, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in
any person beneficially owning 15% or more of the Company Common Stock, or any
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar transaction
involving the Company pursuant to which any person or the shareholders of any
person would own 15% or more of the Company or any resulting parent company of
the Company, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Stockholder Agreement.

     The term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide offer made by a third
party that if consummated would result in such person (or its shareholders)
owning, directly or indirectly, 75% or more of the shares of Company Common
Stock then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or
indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or 75% or more of the
assets of the Company, which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) (i) to be more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a
financial point of view than the Merger (taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the
financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer
or otherwise)) and (ii) that is reasonably capable of being completed, taking
into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal.

     (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i)(A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or propose to
withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval,
recommendation, or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any
such committee thereof of this Agreement or the Merger, or (B) recommend, adopt
or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Takeover
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a
"Company Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company to execute or enter into,
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or
related to, or that is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining
the Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in response
to a Superior Proposal that was unsolicited and made after the date hereof and
that did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 4.02, make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change if such Board of Directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel who may be the Company's
independent legal counsel acting with respect to this Agreement) that it is
required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company's
stockholders under applicable law; provided, however, that no Company Adverse
Recommendation Change may be made until after the fifth business day following
Parent's receipt of written notice (a "Notice of Adverse Recommendation") from
the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends
to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying the terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation and a new five
business day period). In determining whether to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Board of Directors of the Company shall take into
account any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent
in response to a Notice of Adverse Recommendation or otherwise.

     (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs
(a) and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall promptly advise Parent
orally and in writing of any Takeover Proposal or
                                      A-23

any inquiry with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to any
Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover
Proposal or inquiry (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the
person making any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall (i) keep
Parent fully informed of the status and material details (including any change
to the terms thereof) of any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide
to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies
of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to the Company
from any person that describes any of the terms or conditions of any Takeover
Proposal.

     (d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company from
(x) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (y) making any required
disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with outside counsel)
failure to so disclose would constitute a violation of applicable law; provided,
however, that in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or any
committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by
Section 4.02(b).

                                   ARTICLE V

     SECTION 5.01.  Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement;
Stockholders' Meeting. (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall prepare and the Company shall file with
the SEC the Proxy Statement and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Parent
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4 declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing
and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders as promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act.
Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any
jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or to file a general consent to
service of process) required to be taken under any applicable state securities
laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and
the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders
of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any
such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement.
If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors,
should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that
either such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company. The parties shall notify each other promptly of
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the
SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the
Form S-4 or for additional information and shall supply each other with copies
of all correspondence between any of their respective advisors and
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff on the other hand,
with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or the Merger.

     (b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, establish a record date following the date of this Agreement for,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the
"Stockholders' Meeting") solely for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder
Approval. Subject to Section 4.02(b), the Company shall, through its Board of
Directors, recommend to its stockholders approval and adoption of this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company's obligations pursuant

                                      A-24

to the first sentence of this Section 5.01(b) shall not be affected by (i) the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company
of any Takeover Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof of such Board of Directors' or
such committee's approval or recommendation of the Merger or this Agreement.

     SECTION 5.02.  Access to Information; Confidentiality.  The Company shall
afford to Parent, and to Parent's officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other representatives, reasonable access during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination
of this Agreement to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records and, during such period, the Company shall furnish
promptly to Parent (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement
and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements
of Federal or state securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Except for
disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the Secrecy Agreement dated as
of September 22, 1999, between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from
time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), Parent shall hold, and shall
cause it officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives and controlled Affiliates to hold, all information received from
the Company, directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.04 or
information provided or received by any party hereto pursuant to this Agreement
will affect any of the representations or warranties of the parties hereto
contained in this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to the obligations of
the parties hereto.

     SECTION 5.03.  Commercially Reasonable Efforts.  Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement,
including using commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i)
the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be
satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental
Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including
filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all steps as may
be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iv) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the Stockholder Agreement, or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including seeking to have any
stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
Entity vacated or reversed and (v) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement.
In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Board
of Directors shall (1) take all action necessary to ensure that no state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Stockholder Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement and
(2) if any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Stockholder Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement, take all action
necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on
this Agreement, the Stockholder Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent to agree to, or proffer to, divest
or hold separate any assets or any portion of any business of Parent or its
subsidiaries or the Company.

                                      A-25

     SECTION 5.04.  Stock Options.  (a) Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall assume any Stock Options in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, pursuant to the terms of the
Company's 1993 Stock Option Plan, 1996 Stock Option Plan and 1999 Supplemental
Stock Option Plan (collectively, and together with the Company ESPP, the
"Company Stock Plans"), (i) each outstanding Stock Plan Option shall
automatically accelerate so that each such Stock Plan Option shall, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, become fully exercisable for all of the shares of
Company Common Stock at the time subject to such Stock Plan Option and may be
exercised by the holder thereof for any or all of such shares as fully-vested
shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) upon the Effective Time, all outstanding
Stock Plan Options, to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time,
shall terminate and shall cease to be outstanding. In addition, as soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the
Company (or, if applicable, the person or persons with the requisite authority
under the Non-Plan Stock Options) shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other actions (including, if necessary, obtaining any required consents from
holders) as may be required to cause (i) each outstanding Non-Plan Stock Option
to be, immediately prior to the Effective Time, fully exercisable for all of the
shares of Company Common Stock at the time subject to such Non-Plan Stock
Option, and exercisable by the holder thereof for any or all of such shares as
fully-vested shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) upon the Effective Time,
all outstanding Non-Plan Stock Options, to the extent not exercised prior to the
Effective Time, shall terminate and shall cease to be outstanding.

     (b) The rights of participants in the Company's Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the "Company ESPP") with respect to any offering underway immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be determined in accordance with the
provisions of Section VII.G. of the Company ESPP as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement. Each share of Company Common Stock purchased under such offering
shall, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio, without issuance of certificates
representing issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to
participants under the Company ESPP. As of the Effective Time, the Company ESPP
shall be automatically terminated in accordance with Section IX.B.(iii) of the
Company ESPP.

     SECTION 5.05.  Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.  (a) Parent
agrees that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in
favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company as provided
in the Company Certificate, the Company By-laws or any indemnification agreement
between such directors or officers and the Company (in each case, as in effect
on the date hereof) shall be assumed in all respects by the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, without further action, as of the Effective Time and
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.

     (b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision
to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.05.

     (c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect
the Company's current officers' and directors' liability insurance in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each
person currently covered by the Company's officers' and directors' liability
insurance policy (a true and complete copy of which has been heretofore
delivered to Parent), on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided,
however, that Parent may substitute therefor policies of Parent containing terms
with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable in any material respect to
such directors and officers; provided further, however, that in satisfying its
obligation under this Section 5.05(c) Parent shall not be obligated to pay
aggregate premiums in excess of 200% of the amount paid by the Company in its
last full fiscal year (which premiums are hereby represented and warranted by
the Company to be $115,139), it
                                      A-26

being understood and agreed that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to
provide such coverage as may be obtained for such 200% amount.

     (d) The provisions of this Section 5.05 (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise.

     SECTION 5.06.  Fees and Expenses.  (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b)
of this Section 5.06, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the
Merger is consummated, except that each of Parent and the Company shall bear and
pay one-half of (i) the costs and expenses incurred in connection with filing,
printing and mailing the Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 and (ii) the filing
fees for the premerger notification and report forms under the HSR Act.

     (b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant
to Section 7.01(e) or (ii) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made to the
Company or shall have been made directly to the stockholders of the Company
generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known or any person shall have
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Takeover
Proposal, (B) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to either Section 7.01(b)(i) without a vote at the Stockholders'
Meeting having been taken or Section 7.01(b)(iii) and (C) within 12 months after
such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement to consummate,
or consummates, transactions contemplated by any Takeover Proposal, then the
Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $5.75 million (the "Termination Fee") by
wire transfer of same-day funds (x) in the case of a payment required by clause
(i) above, on the date of termination of this Agreement and (y) in the case of a
payment required by clause (ii) above, on the date of the first to occur of such
events referred to in clause (ii)(C).

consultation, except as may be required by applicable law, court process or by

employment after the Effective Time shall be provided base salary or hourly wage
rates and employee benefits which are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to those provided for such employees as of the date hereof. Neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation to issue, or adopt any plans
or arrangements providing for the issuance of, shares of capital stock,
warrants, options, stock appreciation rights or other rights in respect of any
shares of capital stock of any entity or any securities convertible or
exchangeable into such shares pursuant to any such plans or arrangements. Any
plans or arrangements of the Company providing for such issuance shall be
disregarded in determining whether employee benefits are substantially
comparable in the aggregate.

     (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize the service
of each employee of the Company who continues employment through the Effective
Time as if such service had been performed with Parent (i) for purposes of
eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual) under Parent's defined benefit
pension plan, (ii) for purposes of eligibility for vacation under Parent's
vacation program and (iii) for benefit accrual purposes under Parent's severance
