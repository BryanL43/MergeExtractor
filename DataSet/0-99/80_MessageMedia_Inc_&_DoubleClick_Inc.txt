                                                        [                ], 2001

Dear Stockholder:

    I am writing to you today about our proposed merger with DoubleClick Inc. We
believe that the merger will enhance stockholder value by resulting in a
combined company with the ability to provide a broader range of products and
services to a larger customer base.

    In the merger, each outstanding share of MessageMedia common stock will be
converted into 0.0436 of a share of DoubleClick common stock. DoubleClick will
issue approximately three million shares of its common stock in the merger.
DoubleClick common stock is traded on The Nasdaq National Market under the
trading symbol 'DCLK,' and closed at $[   ] per share on [                ],
2001. The merger and the amended merger agreement are described more fully in
this proxy statement/prospectus.

    The board of directors of MessageMedia has called a special meeting of
MessageMedia stockholders to be held on [          ], 2001 at 9:00 a.m., local
time, at the principal offices of MessageMedia, located at 371 Centennial
Parkway, Louisville, Colorado 80027, for the purpose of considering the
transaction. At the special stockholders' meeting, you will be asked to consider
and vote upon a proposal to adopt the amended merger agreement.

    Adoption of the proposal requires the affirmative vote, in person or by
proxy, of a majority of the outstanding shares of MessageMedia's common stock.
To adopt the amended merger agreement, you MUST vote 'FOR' the proposal by
following the instructions stated on the enclosed proxy card. If you do not vote
at all, your non-vote will, in effect, count as a vote against the amended
merger agreement and the merger.

    The close of business on [                ], 2001 is the record date for the
determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the
special stockholders' meeting, or any adjournment or postponement of that
meeting. Accordingly, only stockholders of record on that date are entitled to
notice of, and to vote at, the special stockholders' meeting and any
adjournments or postponements of that meeting.

    All stockholders are invited to attend the special stockholders' meeting in
person. Whether or not you plan to attend, in order that your shares may be
represented at the special stockholders' meeting, please complete, sign and date
the enclosed proxy card and return it in the enclosed envelope as soon as
possible. If you attend the special stockholders' meeting in person, you may, if
you wish, vote personally on all matters brought before the special
stockholders' meeting even if you have previously returned your proxy card.

    This proxy statement/prospectus provides detailed information about
DoubleClick, MessageMedia and the merger. Please give all of this information
your careful attention. IN PARTICULAR, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE
DISCUSSION IN THE SECTION ENTITLED 'RISK FACTORS' BEGINNING ON PAGE 12 OF THIS
PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS.

    The board of directors has retained Stephens Inc. as financial advisor.
Stephens Inc. has delivered to the board its written opinion dated as of
May 31, 2001 to the effect that, subject to certain assumptions and limitations,
the consideration to be received in the merger by the disinterested MessageMedia
stockholders is fair to those stockholders from a financial point of view.

    The board of directors believes that the merger is in the best interests of
MessageMedia and its stockholders and has therefore unanimously adopted the
amended merger agreement and recommends that all stockholders vote 'FOR'
adoption of the amended merger agreement.

                                          Sincerely,
                                          /s/ [                   ]

COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THIS TRANSACTION OR THE SECURITIES OF
DOUBLECLICK INC. TO BE ISSUED IN THE MERGER, OR DETERMINED IF THIS PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS IS ACCURATE OR COMPLETE. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY

THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 42)

    DoubleClick and MessageMedia have entered into a merger agreement, which was
subsequently amended, that provides for the merger of MessageMedia with and into
DoubleClick. In the merger, each outstanding share of MessageMedia common stock
will be exchanged for the right to receive 0.0436 of a share of DoubleClick
common stock. We urge you to read the merger agreement, which is included as
Appendix A, and the amendment to the merger agreement, which is included as
Appendix A-1, carefully and in their entirety. Throughout this proxy
statement/prospectus, we refer to the merger agreement, as amended by the
amendment, as the amended merger agreement.

UNANIMOUS RECOMMENDATION OF MESSAGEMEDIA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN FAVOR
OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 45)

    The board of directors of MessageMedia has adopted the amended merger
agreement and determined that the terms and conditions of the merger are fair
to, and in the best interests of, MessageMedia and its stockholders.
MessageMedia's board of directors unanimously recommends that MessageMedia
stockholders vote 'FOR' adoption of the amended merger agreement.

OPINION OF MESSAGEMEDIA'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR (SEE PAGE 47)

    In deciding to adopt the amended merger agreement, the MessageMedia board of
directors considered the opinion of its financial advisor, Stephens Inc.

    On May 30, 2001, Stephens delivered its oral opinion to the board of
directors of MessageMedia, which was subsequently confirmed in writing on May
31, 2001, that, as of May 31, 2001, the consideration to be received by the
disinterested MessageMedia stockholders in the merger was fair to such
stockholders from a financial point of view. The full text of the written
opinion of Stephens is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as
Appendix C. We encourage you to read this opinion carefully in its entirety for
a description of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered
and limitations on the review undertaken.

VOTE REQUIRED (SEE PAGE 41)

    The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
MessageMedia common stock is required to adopt the amended merger agreement.
MessageMedia stockholders are entitled to cast one vote per share of
MessageMedia common stock owned at the close of business on [            ],
2001. Pursuant to stockholder agreements in the form attached to this proxy
statement/prospectus as Appendix B [(and stockholder letters in the form
attached as Appendix B-1)], MessageMedia stockholders have agreed to vote
25,661,381 shares of MessageMedia common stock, or approximately [37.4%] of
MessageMedia's common stock outstanding as of [            ], 2001, for adoption
of the amended merger agreement. As of [            ], 2001, directors and
executive officers of MessageMedia and their affiliates beneficially owned an
aggregate of [          ] shares of MessageMedia common stock (exclusive of any
shares issuable upon the exercise of options or warrants) or approximately
[   ]% of the shares of MessageMedia common stock outstanding on such date. As
of [            ], 2001, directors and executive officers of DoubleClick did not
own any shares of MessageMedia common stock.

THE SPECIAL STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING (SEE PAGE 40)

    MessageMedia's special stockholders' meeting will be held at the principal
offices of MessageMedia, located at 371 Centennial Parkway, Louisville, Colorado
80027, at 9:00 a.m., local time, on [            ], 2001.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 50)

    When considering the recommendation of the MessageMedia board of directors,
you should be aware that some directors and officers of MessageMedia have
interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, yours. These
interests are discussed further in 'The Merger -- Interests of Certain Persons
in the Merger.'

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS (SEE PAGE 51)

    The merger has been structured with the intent that it qualify as a
tax-deferred 'reorganization' for United States federal income tax purposes. If
the merger qualifies as a reorganization, MessageMedia stockholders will not
recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes in the
merger. In the event that MessageMedia stockholders receive cash instead of
fractional shares, a MessageMedia stockholder will recognize gain or loss
determined as though the stockholder received the fractional

share of DoubleClick common stock and sold it for the cash received. It is a
condition to completion of the merger that MessageMedia and DoubleClick receive
legal opinions from their respective outside counsel that the merger will
constitute a tax-deferred reorganization. The opinions of counsel will not be
binding on the Internal Revenue Service and no ruling will be obtained from the
Internal Revenue Service regarding the tax consequences of the merger. If, for
any reason, the merger were not to qualify as a reorganization for federal
income tax purposes, MessageMedia stockholders would recognize taxable gain or
loss based on the difference between the value of the consideration received in
the merger and their tax basis in their MessageMedia common stock.

RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OF SHARES BY AFFILIATES (SEE PAGE 53)

    All shares of DoubleClick common stock that MessageMedia stockholders
receive in connection with the merger will be freely transferable unless the
holder is considered an 'affiliate' of either DoubleClick or MessageMedia for
purposes of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Shares of DoubleClick common
stock held by these affiliates may be sold only under a registration statement
or an exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 62)

    The respective obligations of the parties to complete the merger are subject
to the prior satisfaction or waiver of conditions specified in the amended
merger agreement. If either DoubleClick or MessageMedia waives any conditions,
we will consider the facts and circumstances at that time and determine whether
completion of the merger requires a resolicitation of proxies from MessageMedia
stockholders.

TERMINATION OF THE AMENDED MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 63)

    The amended merger agreement may be terminated under circumstances that are
described in 'The Amended Merger Agreement and Related Agreements -- Termination
of the Amended Merger Agreement.'

TERMINATION FEE (SEE PAGE 64)

    MessageMedia has agreed to pay DoubleClick a fee of $1.654 million in cash
if the amended merger agreement terminates under circumstances that are
described under 'The Amended Merger Agreement and Related Agreements -- Payment
of Fees and Expenses.'

RESTRICTIONS ON ALTERNATE TRANSACTIONS (SEE PAGE 59)

    The amended merger agreement prohibits MessageMedia from soliciting or
participating in discussions with third parties about transactions alternative
to the merger, except as discussed in 'The Amended Merger Agreement and Related
Agreements -- No Solicitation of Transactions.'

REGULATORY MATTERS (SEE PAGE 51)

    Currently, neither DoubleClick nor MessageMedia is required to file any
information with the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice under the provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in connection with the merger and the
transactions contemplated by the amended merger agreement.

    DoubleClick and MessageMedia are not aware of any other governmental
approvals or actions that are required to complete the merger other than
compliance with applicable corporate law of Delaware.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (SEE PAGE 53)

    DoubleClick will account for the merger under the purchase method of
accounting, which means that DoubleClick will allocate the purchase price to the
fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, and any
excess of the cost over that amount will be recorded as goodwill and will be
amortized over its estimated useful life, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

NO DISSENTERS' RIGHTS (SEE PAGE 53)

dissenters' rights in the merger.

               UNAUDITED PRO FORMA SUMMARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION

    The following unaudited pro forma summary financial information of
DoubleClick has been prepared to illustrate the estimated effects of:

     the assumed acquisition by DoubleClick of all the outstanding shares of
     MesssageMedia in exchange for 2,992,373 shares of DoubleClick common stock
     and the assumption by DoubleClick of MessageMedia options and warrants
     which, under the merger, convert into options and warrants to acquire
     409,751 shares of DoubleClick common stock;

     the April 23, 2001 acquisition by DoubleClick of all the outstanding shares
     of FloNetwork Inc. in exchange for approximately $11.4 million in cash,
     2,770,943 shares of DoubleClick common stock and the assumption by
     DoubleClick of FloNetwork options and warrants which, under the merger of
     those two companies, converted into options and warrants to acquire 430,152
     shares of DoubleClick common stock; and

     the February 2, 2001 acquisition by DoubleClick of all the outstanding
     shares of @plan.inc in exchange for approximately $39.1 million in cash,
     3,206,474 shares of DoubleClick common stock and the assumption by
     DoubleClick of @plan options and warrants which, under the merger of those
     two companies, converted into options and warrants to acquire 1,213,614
     shares of DoubleClick common stock.

    Pro forma amounts have been derived by applying pro forma adjustments to the
historical consolidated financial information of DoubleClick, MessageMedia,
FloNetwork and @plan.

ACQUISITION OF MESSAGEMEDIA

    The purchase price of MessageMedia has been estimated based on the average
market price of DoubleClick common stock, as quoted on The Nasdaq National
Market, for the day immediately prior to, the day of and the day immediately
after, the announcement of the merger, plus the fair value of options and
warrants assumed, which was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model. The estimated purchase price does not include the effect of direct
acquisition costs. The final cost of the acquisition will be a different amount.

    The excess of the estimated purchase price over the book value of net assets
acquired has been preliminarily allocated to goodwill and assigned a useful life
of three years. The ultimate allocation of the purchase price will depend on the
results of fair value appraisals. DoubleClick believes that the effect of the
ultimate allocation will not differ materially from that assumed in the
following unaudited pro forma financial data.

    The unaudited pro forma summary statements of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and the three month period ended March 31, 2001 have been
prepared as if the merger had occurred on January 1, 2000. The unaudited pro
forma summary balance sheet as of March 31, 2001 has been prepared as if the
merger had occurred on March 31, 2001. The pro forma adjustments are described
in the notes appearing elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.

ACQUISITION OF FLONETWORK

    On April 23, 2001, DoubleClick completed its acquisition of FloNetwork, a
privately-held Canadian provider of email marketing technology services. The
purchase price of FloNetwork has been calculated based on the average market
price of DoubleClick common stock, as quoted on The Nasdaq National Market, for
the day immediately prior to, the day of and the day immediately after, the day
the number of shares and the amount of cash consideration due to FloNetwork
shareholders became fixed pursuant to the agreement under which
FloNetwork was acquired, plus the fair value of options and warrants assumed,
which was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

    The excess of the purchase price over the recorded amount of net assets
acquired has been preliminarily allocated to goodwill and is being amortized
over three years. The ultimate allocation of the purchase price will depend on
the results of fair value appraisals. DoubleClick believes that, as a

result of these fair value appraisals, portions of the excess of the purchase
price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired may be allocated to
purchased technology and in-process research and development. Accordingly, to
the extent that a portion of the excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of net tangible assets acquired is assigned to acquired in-process
research and development and immediately expensed, operating results may differ
materially from those presented in the unaudited pro forma summary financial
statements.

    The unaudited pro forma summary statements of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and the three month period ended March 31, 2001 have been
prepared as if the FloNetwork acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2000. The
unaudited pro forma summary balance sheet as of March 31, 2001 has been prepared
as if the acquisition had occurred on March 31, 2001. The pro forma adjustments
are described in the notes appearing elsewhere in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

ACQUISITION OF @PLAN

    On February 2, 2001, DoubleClick completed its acquisition of @plan, a
leading provider of online target market research planning systems. The purchase
price of @plan has been determined based on the average market price of
DoubleClick common stock, as quoted on The Nasdaq National Market, for the day
immediately prior to and the day of the final determination of the number of
shares and the amount of cash consideration due to @plan shareholders pursuant
to the merger agreement under which @plan was acquired, plus the fair value of
options and warrants assumed, which was calculated using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
the net assets acquired has been allocated to goodwill and is being amortized
over three years.

    The unaudited pro forma summary statements of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and the three month period ended March 31, 2001 have been
prepared as if the @plan acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2000. No pro
forma balance sheet information has been provided as @plan's net assets are
reflected in the financial position of DoubleClick as of March 31, 2001. The pro
forma adjustments are described in the notes appearing elsewhere in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

    Certain assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets of
MessageMedia and FloNetwork have been reclassified to conform to the line item
presentation in the pro forma summary balance sheet. Certain costs and other
deductions in the consolidated statements of operations of MessageMedia,
FloNetwork and @plan have been reclassified to conform to the line item
presentation in the pro forma summary statements of operations.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

    The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for illustrative
purposes only and should not be considered indicative of the actual results that
would have been achieved had the acquisitions described above been consummated
on the dates indicated and does not purport to indicate balance sheet data or
results of operations as of any future date or any future period. The unaudited
pro forma summary financial information should be read in conjuction with the
unaudited pro forma condensed financial information, the historical financial
statements of DoubleClick and MessageMedia, and the related notes thereto
incorporated by reference into and/or included elsewhere in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

                                  RISK FACTORS

    By voting in favor of the amended merger agreement, MessageMedia
stockholders will be choosing to invest in DoubleClick common stock. An
investment in DoubleClick common stock involves a high degree of risk. In
addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into
this proxy statement/prospectus, you should carefully consider the following
risk factors in deciding whether to vote for the merger. If any of the following
risks actually occurs, the business and prospects of MessageMedia or DoubleClick
may be seriously harmed. In such case, the trading price of DoubleClick common
stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.

RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER

MESSAGEMEDIA STOCKHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE 0.0436 OF A SHARE OF DOUBLECLICK COMMON
STOCK, DESPITE CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF MESSAGEMEDIA OR DOUBLECLICK COMMON
STOCK BETWEEN NOW AND THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

    Upon completion of the merger, each share of MessageMedia common stock will
be exchanged for 0.0436 of a share of DoubleClick common stock. This exchange
ratio will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either DoubleClick
or MessageMedia common stock and neither company is permitted to terminate the
amended merger agreement solely because of changes in the market price of either
company's common stock. Consequently, the specific dollar value of the
DoubleClick common stock to be received by MessageMedia stockholders will depend
on the market value of the DoubleClick common stock at the time of completion of
the merger and may decrease from the date that MessageMedia stockholders submit
their proxies. MessageMedia stockholders are urged to obtain recent market
quotations for DoubleClick common stock and MessageMedia common stock.
DoubleClick common stock has historically experienced significant volatility and
we cannot predict or give any assurances as to the market price of the
DoubleClick common stock at any time before or after the merger.

THE MERGER MAY GO FORWARD EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A CHANGE THAT IS MATERIALLY
ADVERSE TO THE BUSINESS, ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR FINANCIAL CONDITION OF
DOUBLECLICK OR MESSAGEMEDIA.

    In general, either party can refuse to complete the merger if there is a
material adverse change affecting the other party before the closing of the
merger. However, certain of such changes, including a change in general economic
conditions or changes affecting the industry generally in which DoubleClick or
MessageMedia operate, an adverse change related to any change in accounting
requirements or principles or any change in applicable laws, rules or
regulations or in the interpretation of such accounting requirements or
principles, or a decrease in the market price or trading volume of the
DoubleClick common stock or the MessageMedia common stock or litigation relating
to such decrease, will not prevent the merger from going forward, even if they
would have a material adverse effect on DoubleClick or MessageMedia.

    Furthermore, DoubleClick would not be able to terminate the merger solely
because of:

     the delisting of the MessageMedia common stock from The Nasdaq National
     Market or litigation relating to such delisting;

     the fact that MessageMedia does not meet the revenue predictions in certain
     of MessageMedia's internal projections;

     any litigation or loss by MessageMedia of current or prospective customers,
     employees, suppliers or distributors, or any reductions in its sales or
     revenues, that arose from the announcement or pendency of the merger; or

     any loss of MessageMedia customers to DoubleClick or DoubleClick Email
     Canada Inc.

    If adverse changes occur and DoubleClick and MessageMedia are still required
to complete the merger, DoubleClick's stock price may suffer. This in turn may
reduce the value of the merger to DoubleClick stockholders and MessageMedia
stockholders.

DOUBLECLICK AND MESSAGEMEDIA MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE BENEFITS THEY EXPECT FROM THE
MERGER.

    DoubleClick and MessageMedia entered into the amended merger agreement with
the expectation that the merger will result in significant benefits to the
combined company. Achieving the benefits of the merger depends on the timely,
efficient and successful execution of a number of post-merger events. Key events
include:

     integrating the operations and personnel of the two companies;

     offering the existing products and services of each company to the other
     company's customers; and

     developing new products and services that utilize the assets of both
     companies.

    We will need to overcome significant issues, however, to realize any
benefits or synergies from the merger. The successful execution of these
post-merger events will involve considerable risk and may not be successful.

    Operations and personnel. DoubleClick  is currently formulating its plan
for the integration of the operations and personnel of MessageMedia into
DoubleClick's existing business. DoubleClick's failure to complete the
integration successfully could result in the loss of key personnel and
customers.

    Products and services. DoubleClick initially intends to offer each
company's products and services to the customers of the other company. There
can be no assurance that either company's customers will have any interest in
the other company's products and services. The failure of such cross-marketing
efforts would diminish the synergies expected to be realized by the merger.

    In addition, after the merger, DoubleClick intends to develop new products
and services that combine the assets of both the DoubleClick and MessageMedia
businesses. To date, the companies have not thoroughly investigated the
technological, market-driven or other obstacles in developing and marketing
these new products and services in a timely and efficient way. There can be no
assurance that DoubleClick will be able to overcome these obstacles in
developing new products and services, or that there will be a market for the new
products or services developed by DoubleClick after the merger.

    In general, DoubleClick and MessageMedia cannot offer any assurances that
they can successfully integrate or realize the anticipated benefits of the
merger. Their failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the
combined company's business, financial condition and operating results or could
result in the loss of key personnel or customers. In addition, the attention and
effort devoted to the integration of the two companies will significantly divert
management's attention from other important issues and could seriously harm the
combined company.

THE MERGER COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT COMBINED FINANCIAL RESULTS.

    If the benefits of the merger do not exceed the costs associated with the
merger, including any dilution to DoubleClick's stockholders resulting from the
issuance of DoubleClick shares in connection with the merger, DoubleClick's
financial results, including earnings per share, could be adversely affected.

THE MARKET PRICE OF DOUBLECLICK COMMON STOCK MAY DECLINE AS A RESULT OF THE
MERGER.

    The market price of DoubleClick common stock may decline as a result of the
merger if:

     the integration of DoubleClick and MessageMedia is unsuccessful;

     DoubleClick does not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as
     rapidly as, or to the extent anticipated by, financial or industry
     analysts; or

     the effect of the merger on DoubleClick's financial results is not
     consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.

DOUBLECLICK MUST MANAGE THE INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES SUCCESSFULLY IN
ORDER TO ACHIEVE DESIRED RESULTS.

    As a part of DoubleClick's business strategy, DoubleClick expects to enter
into a number of business combinations and acquisitions. Acquisitions are
accompanied by a number of risks, including:

     the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired
     companies;

     the potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of
     management of DoubleClick and the acquired companies;

     the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into
     DoubleClick's products and services;

     unanticipated expenses related to technology and other integration;

     difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and
     policies;

     the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of
     any integration of new management personnel; and

     potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses.

    The combined company may not succeed in addressing these risks or other
problems encountered in connection with the merger or such other business
combinations and acquisitions.

MESSAGEMEDIA'S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST THAT MAY
INFLUENCE THEM TO SUPPORT OR APPROVE THE AMENDED MERGER AGREEMENT.

    The directors and officers of MessageMedia participate in the following
arrangements, which provide them with interests in the merger that are different
from, or in addition to, those of the MessageMedia stockholders:

     As of [      ], 2001, the officers and directors of MessageMedia owned
     stock options to purchase an aggregate of [5,408,417] shares of
     MessageMedia common stock, [3,584,154] of which were not vested. If the
     merger is completed, all [1,406,250] of the stock options unvested as of
     [      ], 2001 owned by MessageMedia's President and Chief Executive
     Officer will automatically become vested and exercisable and, pursuant to
     change of control agreements between MessageMedia and certain of its
     other officers and key employees, the vesting of the remaining [2,334,065]
     stock options held by these officers and key employees unvested as
     of [      ], 2001 would be accelerated by 12 months if the merger
     closes and such persons are involuntarily terminated or voluntarily
     terminate their employment for a permitted reason within one month before
     or 12 months after the closing of the merger.

     MessageMedia officers have agreements, including the change of control
     agreements described above, pursuant to which, if such officers are
     involuntarily terminated or if they terminate their employment for a
     permitted reason, such officers would receive benefits including severance
     payments.

     MessageMedia may grant transaction bonuses to certain employees (including
     MessageMedia officers) involved in effectuating the merger, in an amount
     not to exceed $200,000 in the aggregate.

     MessageMedia's President and Chief Executive Officer owes $200,000 to
     MessageMedia, which amount the MessageMedia board of directors has agreed
     to forgive if the merger is consummated.

     DoubleClick has agreed to indemnify each present and former MessageMedia
     officer and director against liabilities arising out of such person's
     services as an officer or director of MessageMedia. In addition,
     DoubleClick will maintain officers' and directors' liability insurance to
     cover any such liabilities for the next six years.

     Because the number of shares of DoubleClick common stock outstanding is
     significantly larger than the number of shares of MessageMedia common stock
     outstanding, officers, directors and affiliates of MessageMedia who receive
     shares of DoubleClick common stock in the merger may

     be allowed to sell or transfer a greater number of shares in a single
     transaction than would be possible prior to the merger pursuant to the
     volume restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act.

    For the above reasons, the directors and officers of MessageMedia could be
more likely to vote to approve the amended merger agreement than if they did not
have these interests. MessageMedia stockholders should consider whether these
interests may have influenced these directors and officers to support or
recommend the merger.

FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE MERGER COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT MESSAGEMEDIA'S STOCK
PRICE AND FUTURE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS.

    If the merger is not completed for any reason, MessageMedia may be subject
to a number of material risks, including the following:

     MessageMedia may be required to pay DoubleClick a fee of $1.654 million;

     the price of MessageMedia common stock may decline to the extent that the
     current market price of MessageMedia common stock reflects a market
     assumption that the merger will be completed; and

     costs related to the merger, such as legal, accounting and financial
     advisor fees, must be paid even if the merger is not completed.

    In addition, MessageMedia customers and suppliers may, in response to the
announcement of the merger, delay or defer decisions concerning MessageMedia.
Any delay or deferral in those decisions by MessageMedia customers or suppliers
could have a material adverse effect on MessageMedia, regardless of whether the
merger is ultimately completed. Similarly, current and prospective MessageMedia
employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with DoubleClick
until DoubleClick's strategies with regard to MessageMedia are announced or
executed. This may adversely affect MessageMedia's ability to attract and retain
key management, sales, marketing and technical personnel.

    Further, if the merger is terminated and MessageMedia's board of directors
determines to seek another merger or business combination, there can be no
assurance that it will be able to find a partner willing to pay an equivalent or
more attractive price than the price to be paid in the merger. In addition,
while the amended merger agreement is in effect, subject to compliance with
applicable securities laws and fulfillment of the fiduciary duties of
MessageMedia's board of directors, MessageMedia is prohibited from soliciting,
initiating, encouraging or entering into extraordinary transactions, such as a
merger, sale of assets or other business combination, with any other party.

RISKS RELATED TO DOUBLECLICK

    In addition to the risks relating to the merger discussed above, DoubleClick
is subject to its own specific risks relating to its business model, strategy
and the legal, regulatory and business environment, including those set forth
below.

                 RISKS RELATING TO DOUBLECLICK AND ITS BUSINESS

DOUBLECLICK'S LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY MAKES EVALUATING DOUBLECLICK'S BUSINESS
DIFFICULT.

    DoubleClick was incorporated in January 1996 and has a limited operating
history. An investor in DoubleClick's common stock must consider the risks and
difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving
industries, including the digital marketing industry. DoubleClick's risks
include:

     ability to sustain historical revenue growth rates;

     ability to manage DoubleClick's operations;

     competition;

     attracting, retaining and motivating qualified personnel;

     maintaining DoubleClick's current and developing new, strategic
     relationships with Web publishers;

     ability to anticipate and adapt to the changing Internet advertising and
     direct marketing industries;

     ability to develop and introduce new products and services, and continue to
     develop and upgrade technology;

     attracting and retaining a large number of advertisers from a variety of
     industries; and

     relying on the DoubleClick networks.

    DoubleClick also depends on the growing use of the Internet for advertising,
commerce and communication, and on general economic conditions. DoubleClick
cannot assure you that DoubleClick's business strategy will be successful or
that DoubleClick will successfully address these risks. If DoubleClick is
unsuccessful in addressing these risks, DoubleClick's revenues may decline or
may not grow in accordance with its business model and may fall short of
expectations of market analysts and investors, which could negatively affect the
price of DoubleClick's stock.

DOUBLECLICK HAS A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND ANTICIPATES CONTINUED LOSSES.

    DoubleClick has incurred net losses each year since inception, including net
losses of $156.0 million and $55.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2000
and 1999, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2001, DoubleClick
incurred a net loss of $60.4 million and, as of March 31, 2001, DoubleClick's
accumulated deficit was $329.3 million. DoubleClick has not achieved
profitability on an annual basis and expects to incur operating losses in the
future. DoubleClick expects to continue to incur significant operating and
capital expenditures and, as a result, DoubleClick will need to generate
significant revenue to achieve and maintain profitability. DoubleClick cannot
assure you that DoubleClick will generate sufficient revenue to achieve or
sustain profitability. Even if DoubleClick does achieve profitability,
DoubleClick cannot assure you that it can sustain or increase profitability on a
quarterly or annual basis in the future. If revenue does not meet DoubleClick's
expectations, or if operating expenses exceed what DoubleClick anticipates or
cannot be reduced accordingly, DoubleClick's business, results of operations and
financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.

DOUBLECLICK'S BUSINESS MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LAWSUITS RELATED
TO PRIVACY AND DOUBLECLICK'S BUSINESS PRACTICES.

    DoubleClick is a defendant in several pending lawsuits alleging, among other
things, that DoubleClick unlawfully obtains and uses Internet users' personal
information and that DoubleClick's use of cookies violates various laws.
DoubleClick is the subject of an inquiry involving the attorneys general of
several states relating to DoubleClick's practices in the collection,
maintenance and use of information about, and DoubleClick's disclosure of these
information practices to, Internet users. DoubleClick may in the future receive
additional regulatory inquiries and DoubleClick intends to cooperate fully.
Class action litigation and regulatory inquiries of these types are often
expensive and time consuming and their outcome is uncertain.

    DoubleClick cannot quantify the amount of monetary or human resources that
DoubleClick will be required to use to defend itself in these proceedings.
DoubleClick may need to spend significant amounts on its legal defense, senior
management may be required to divert their attention from other portions of
DoubleClick's business, new product launches may be deferred or canceled as a
result of these proceedings, and DoubleClick may be required to make changes to
DoubleClick's present and planned products or services, any of which could
materially and adversely affect DoubleClick's business, financial condition and
results of operations. If, as a result of any of these proceedings, a judgment
is rendered or a decree is entered against DoubleClick, it may materially and
adversely affect DoubleClick's business, financial condition and results of
operations.

DOUBLECLICK DERIVES A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS REVENUE FROM ADVERTISEMENTS IT
DELIVERS TO WEB SITES AND THE CONTINUED DECREASE IN TRAFFIC LEVELS COULD HARM
DOUBLECLICK'S BUSINESS.

    DoubleClick derives a large portion of its revenue from advertisements it
delivers to Web sites on its DoubleClick networks and from the technology and
services it provides to Web publishers, advertisers and agencies. DoubleClick
expects that its DoubleClick networks and its technology services will continue
to account for a significant portion of its revenue for the foreseeable future.
DoubleClick's contracts with its customers are generally short-term. DoubleClick
cannot assure you that its customers will remain associated with the DoubleClick
networks or continue to use DoubleClick's technology and other services, that
the Web sites of its customers will not continue to decrease or fail to maintain
consistent or increasing levels of traffic over time, that the number of ad
units on its customers' Web sites will not diminish over time, or that
DoubleClick will be able to replace in a timely or effective manner departing
customers with new customers with comparable traffic patterns, mix of ad
impressions or user demographics. DoubleClick's failure to successfully market
its products and develop and sustain long-term relationships with its customers,
the loss of one or more customers that account for a significant portion of
DoubleClick's revenue, the failure of its customers' Web sites to maintain
consistent or increasing levels of traffic or number of ad units, or the failure
to keep pace with the introduction of new technological developments would
materially and adversely affect DoubleClick's business, results of operations
and financial condition.

DOUBLECLICK'S ADVERTISING CUSTOMERS AND THE COMPANIES WITH WHICH DOUBLECLICK HAS
OTHER BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS MAY EXPERIENCE ADVERSE BUSINESS CONDITIONS THAT
COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DOUBLECLICK'S BUSINESS.

    Some of DoubleClick's customers may experience difficulty in supporting
their current operations and implementing their business plans. These customers
may reduce their spending on DoubleClick's products and services, or may not be
able to discharge their payment and other obligations to DoubleClick. The
non-payment or late payment of amounts due to DoubleClick from its customers
could negatively impact DoubleClick's financial condition. These circumstances
are influenced by general economic and industry conditions and could have a
material adverse impact on DoubleClick's business, financial condition and
results of operations. In addition to intense competition, the overall market
for Internet advertising has been characterized in recent quarters by increasing
softness of demand, the reduction or cancellation of advertising contracts, an
increased risk of uncollectible receivables from advertisers and the reduction
of Internet advertising budgets, especially by Internet-related companies.
DoubleClick's customers that are Internet-related companies may experience
difficulty raising capital, or may be anticipating such difficulties and,
therefore, may elect to scale back the resources they devote to advertising,
including on DoubleClick's system. Other companies in the Internet industry have
depleted their available capital and could cease operations or file for
bankruptcy protection. If the current environment for Internet advertising does
not improve, DoubleClick's business, results of operations and financial
condition could be materially adversely affected.

DOUBLECLICK'S QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT
FLUCTUATIONS AND YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON THEM AS AN INDICATION OF FUTURE
OPERATING PERFORMANCE.

    DoubleClick's revenue and results of operations may fluctuate significantly
in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond
DoubleClick's control. These factors include:

     advertiser, Web publisher and direct marketer acceptance and demand for
     DoubleClick's solutions;

     Internet user traffic levels;

     number and size of ad units per page on DoubleClick's customers' Web sites;

     changes in fees paid by advertisers;

     changes in service fees payable by us to Web publishers in DoubleClick's
     networks;

     the introduction of new Internet advertising products or services by us or
     DoubleClick's competitors;

     variations in the levels of capital or operating expenditures and other
     costs relating to the expansion of DoubleClick's operations; and

     general industry and economic conditions.

    For the foreseeable future, DoubleClick's revenue from DoubleClick
TechSolutions and DoubleClick Media will also remain dependent on user traffic
levels and advertising activity on the DoubleClick networks. This future revenue
is difficult to forecast. DoubleClick's operating expenses will include
upgrading and enhancing DoubleClick's DART technology, expanding DoubleClick's
product and service offerings, marketing and supporting DoubleClick's solutions
and supporting DoubleClick's sales and marketing operations. DoubleClick may be
unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue
shortfall. If DoubleClick has a shortfall in revenue in relation to its
expenses, or if its expenses exceed revenue, then DoubleClick's business,
results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely
affected. These results would likely affect the market price of DoubleClick's
common stock in a manner which may be unrelated to DoubleClick's long-term
operating performance.

    As a result, DoubleClick believes that period-to-period comparisons of
DoubleClick's results of operations may not be meaningful. You should not rely
on past periods as indicators of future performance.

RAPID CHANGES IN DOUBLECLICK'S BUSINESS COULD STRAIN DOUBLECLICK'S MANAGERIAL,
OPERATIONAL, FINANCIAL AND INFORMATION SYSTEM RESOURCES.

    In recent years, DoubleClick has experienced significant growth and other
changes that have placed considerable demands on DoubleClick's managerial,
operational and financial resources. DoubleClick continues to increase the scope
of DoubleClick's product and service offerings both domestically and
internationally and to deploy DoubleClick's resources in accordance with
changing business conditions and opportunities. To continue to successfully
implement DoubleClick's business plan in DoubleClick's rapidly evolving industry
requires an effective planning and management process. DoubleClick expects that
it will need to continue to improve its financial and managerial controls and
reporting systems and procedures and will need to continue to train and manage
its workforce. DoubleClick cannot assure you that management will be effective
in attracting and retaining additional qualified personnel, integrating acquired
businesses or otherwise responding to new business conditions. DoubleClick also
cannot assure you that its information systems, procedures or controls will be
adequate to support DoubleClick's operations or that DoubleClick's management
will be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to offer DoubleClick's
products and services and implement DoubleClick's business plan successfully.
DoubleClick's future performance may also depend on DoubleClick's effective
integration of acquired businesses. Even if successful, this integration may
take a significant period of time and expense and may place a significant strain
on DoubleClick's resources. DoubleClick's inability to effectively respond to
changing business conditions could materially and adversely affect DoubleClick's
business, financial condition and results of operations.

DOUBLECLICK'S BUSINESS MAY SUFFER IF DOUBLECLICK IS UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT ITS
BUSINESS MODEL SUCCESSFULLY.

    A significant part of DoubleClick's business model is to generate revenue by
providing digital marketing solutions to advertisers, ad agencies and Web
publishers. The profit potential for this business model is unproven. To be
successful, digital marketing will need to achieve broad acceptance by
advertisers, ad agencies and Web publishers. DoubleClick's ability to generate
significant revenue from DoubleClick's customers will depend, in part, on
DoubleClick's ability to contract with Web publishers that have Web sites with
adequate available ad space inventory and with advertisers that have continuing
plans for Internet advertising. Further, the Web sites in DoubleClick's networks
must generate sufficient user traffic with demographic characteristics
attractive to DoubleClick's advertisers. DoubleClick is affected by general
industry conditions governing the supply and demand of Internet advertising. The
intense competition among Internet advertising sellers has led to the creation
of a number of pricing alternatives for Internet advertising. These alternatives
make it difficult for

DoubleClick to project future levels of advertising revenue and applicable gross
margin that can be sustained by DoubleClick or the Internet advertising industry
in general.

    Intensive marketing and sales efforts may be necessary to educate
prospective advertisers regarding the uses and benefits of, and to generate
demand for, DoubleClick's products and services. Enterprises may be reluctant or
slow to adopt a new approach that may replace, limit or compete with their
existing systems. In addition, since online direct marketing is emerging as a
new and distinct business apart from online advertising, potential adopters of
online direct marketing services will increasingly demand functionality tailored
to their specific requirements. DoubleClick may be unable to meet the demands of
these customers.

    Acceptance of DoubleClick's new solutions will depend on the continued
development of Internet commerce, communication and advertising, and demand for
DoubleClick's solutions. DoubleClick cannot assure you that there will be a
demand for DoubleClick's new solutions or that any demand would be sustainable.

DISRUPTION OF DOUBLECLICK'S SERVICES OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION DUE TO UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS OR FAILURES COULD HARM DOUBLECLICK'S
BUSINESS.

    DoubleClick's DART technology resides in DoubleClick's data centers in New
York City, New Jersey, Virginia, California and Colorado, and in Europe, Asia
and Latin America. Continuing and uninterrupted performance of DoubleClick's
technology is critical to DoubleClick's success. Customers may become
dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts DoubleClick's ability to
provide DoubleClick's services to them, including failures affecting
DoubleClick's ability to deliver advertisements without significant delay to the
viewer. Sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of
DoubleClick's solutions to advertisers, ad agencies and Web publishers and
result in contract terminations, fee rebates and makegoods, thereby reducing
revenue. Slower response time or system failures may also result from straining
the capacity of DoubleClick's deployed software or hardware due to an increase
in the volume of advertising delivered through DoubleClick's servers. To the
extent that DoubleClick does not effectively address any capacity constraints or
system failures, DoubleClick's business, results of operations and financial
condition could be materially and adversely affected.

    DoubleClick's operations are dependent on DoubleClick's ability to protect
DoubleClick's computer systems against damage from fire, power loss, water
damage, telecommunications failures, vandalism and other malicious acts, and
similar unexpected adverse events. In addition, interruptions in DoubleClick's
solutions could result from the failure of DoubleClick's telecommunications
providers to provide the necessary data communications capacity in the time
frame DoubleClick requires. Despite precautions DoubleClick has taken,
unanticipated problems affecting DoubleClick's systems have from time to time in
the past caused, and in the future could cause, interruptions in the delivery of
DoubleClick's solutions. DoubleClick's business, results of operations and
financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any damage or
failure that interrupts or delays DoubleClick's operations.

    DoubleClick currently retains highly confidential information of its
customers in a secure database server. Although DoubleClick observes security
and access measures throughout DoubleClick's operations, DoubleClick cannot
assure you that it will be able to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining
access to this database server. Any unauthorized access to DoubleClick's
servers, or abuse by DoubleClick's employees, could result in the theft of
confidential customer information.

COMPETITION IN INTERNET ADVERTISING, DIRECT MARKETING AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND
SERVICES IS INTENSE AND LIKELY TO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE AND DOUBLECLICK MAY NOT
BE ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY.

    The market for digital marketing products and services is very competitive.
DoubleClick expects this competition to continue to increase because there are
low barriers to entry. Also, industry consolidation may lead to stronger, better
capitalized entities against which DoubleClick must compete.

    DoubleClick believes that its ability to compete depends on many factors
both within and beyond DoubleClick's control, including the following:

     the timing and acceptance of new solutions and enhancements to existing
     solutions developed either by DoubleClick or DoubleClick's competitors;

     customer service and support efforts;

     DoubleClick's ability to adapt and scale its technology, and develop and
     introduce new technologies, as customer needs change and grow;

     sales and marketing efforts;

     the features, ease of use, performance, price and reliability of solutions
     developed either by DoubleClick or DoubleClick's competitors; and

     the relative impact of general economic and industry conditions on either
     DoubleClick or DoubleClick's competitors.

    DoubleClick competes directly or indirectly with companies in the following
categories:

     large Web publishers, Web portals and Internet advertising networks that
     offer advertising inventory;

     providers of software and service bureau ad delivery solutions for Web
     publishers and advertisers;

     email services companies, Internet service providers and other companies in
     the email services business;

     direct mail and email list providers, and providers of information products
     and marketing research services to the direct marketing industry;

     Web ratings companies, advertisement performance measurement companies,
     providers of Web advertising management, online research and consulting
     services and providers of syndicated market research in traditional
     publishing; and

     others, such as providers of customer relationship management services,
     content aggregation companies, companies engaged in advertising sales
     networks, advertising agencies and other companies that facilitate digital
     marketing.

    Many of DoubleClick's existing competitors, as well as a number of potential
new competitors, have longer operating histories, greater name recognition,
larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical and
marketing resources than DoubleClick. These factors may allow them to respond
more quickly than DoubleClick can to new or emerging technologies and changes in
customer requirements. It may also allow them to devote greater resources than
DoubleClick can to the development, promotion and sale of their products and
services. These competitors may also engage in more extensive research and
development, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, adopt more
aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and
potential employees, strategic partners, advertisers, direct marketers and Web
publishers. DoubleClick cannot assure you that its competitors will not develop
products or services that are equal or superior to DoubleClick's solutions or
that achieve greater acceptance than DoubleClick's solutions. In addition,
current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative
relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of
their products or services to address the needs of DoubleClick's prospective
advertising, ad agency and Web publisher customers. As a result, it is possible
that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.
Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and
loss of market share. DoubleClick cannot assure you that it will be able to
compete successfully or that competitive pressures will not materially and
adversely affect DoubleClick's business, results of operations or financial
condition.

DOUBLECLICK MAY NOT COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WITH TRADITIONAL ADVERTISING MEDIA FOR
ADVERTISING DOLLARS.

    Companies doing business on the Internet, including DoubleClick, must also
compete with television, radio, cable and print (traditional advertising media)
for a share of advertisers' total advertising budgets. Advertisers may be
reluctant to devote a significant portion of their advertising budget to
Internet advertising if they perceive the Internet to be a limited or
ineffective advertising medium. In addition, in response to adverse economic or
business conditions, many advertisers reduce their advertising and marketing
spending. Such a reduction in advertising or marketing spending could materially
and adversely affect DoubleClick's business, results of operations or financial
condition.

DOUBLECLICK'S REVENUE IS SUBJECT TO SEASONAL AND CYCLICAL FLUCTUATIONS.

    DoubleClick believes that its business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.
Advertisers generally place fewer advertisements during the first and third
calendar quarters of each year, which directly affects DoubleClick's DoubleClick
Media and DoubleClick TechSolutions businesses and the direct marketing industry
generally mails substantially more marketing materials in the third calendar
quarter, which directly affects DoubleClick's DoubleClick Data business.
Further, Internet user traffic typically drops during the summer months, which
reduces the amount of advertising to sell and deliver. Expenditures by
advertisers and direct marketers also tend to vary in cycles that reflect
overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns.
DoubleClick's revenue has in the past and may in the future be materially and
adversely affected by a decline in the economic prospects of DoubleClick's
customers or in the economy or industry in which DoubleClick or any of its
customers participates in general, which could alter DoubleClick's current or
prospective customers' spending priorities or budget cycles or change
DoubleClick's sales cycle.

    Due to the risks discussed in this section, you should not rely on
quarter-to-quarter comparisons of DoubleClick's results of operations as an
indication of future performance. It is possible that in some future periods
DoubleClick's results of operations may be below the expectations of public
market analysts and investors. In this event, the price of DoubleClick's common
stock may fall.

DOUBLECLICK MAY NOT BE ABLE SUCCESSFULLY TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS OF OR INVESTMENTS
IN OTHER COMPANIES.

    DoubleClick may acquire or make investments in other complementary
businesses, products, services or technologies. From time to time DoubleClick
has had discussions with other companies regarding its acquiring, or investing
in, their businesses, products, services or technologies. DoubleClick cannot
assure you that it will be able to identify other suitable acquisition or
investment candidates. Even if DoubleClick does identify suitable candidates,
DoubleClick cannot assure you that it will be able to make other acquisitions or
investments on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Even if DoubleClick
agrees to buy a company, DoubleClick cannot assure you that it will be
successful in consummating the purchase. Reasons for failing to consummate a
purchase could include DoubleClick's refusal to increase the agreed upon
purchase price to match an offer made by a subsequent competing bidder. If
DoubleClick buys a company, DoubleClick could have difficulty in integrating
that company's personnel and operations. In addition, the key personnel of the
acquired company may decide not to work for DoubleClick. If DoubleClick acquires
different types of businesses, DoubleClick could have difficulty in integrating
the acquired products, services, technologies or personnel into DoubleClick's
operations. These difficulties could disrupt DoubleClick's ongoing business,
distract DoubleClick's management and employees, increase DoubleClick's expenses
and adversely affect DoubleClick's results of operations due to accounting
requirements such as amortization of goodwill. Furthermore, DoubleClick may
incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions. The
issuance of equity securities could be dilutive to DoubleClick's existing
stockholders.

IF DOUBLECLICK FAILS TO SUCCESSFULLY CROSS-MARKET ITS PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS OF
BUSINESSES DOUBLECLICK ACQUIRES, OR TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS TO SERVE THOSE AND
DOUBLECLICK'S EXISTING CUSTOMERS, DOUBLECLICK MAY NOT INCREASE OR MAINTAIN ITS
CUSTOMER BASE OR ITS REVENUE.

    DoubleClick offers to its collective customers the respective products and
services historically offered by DoubleClick and companies DoubleClick has
acquired. DoubleClick cannot assure you that

any company's customers will have any interest in the other companies' products
and services. The failure of DoubleClick's cross-marketing efforts may diminish
the benefits DoubleClick realizes from these acquisitions. In addition,
DoubleClick intends to develop new products and services that combine the
knowledge and resources of DoubleClick and the businesses DoubleClick acquires.
DoubleClick cannot assure you that these products or services will be developed
or, if developed, will be successful or that DoubleClick can successfully
integrate or realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions. As a
result, DoubleClick may not be able to increase or maintain DoubleClick's
customer base. DoubleClick cannot assure you that it will be able to overcome
the obstacles in developing new products and services, or that there will be a
demand for the new products or services developed by DoubleClick after the
acquisitions. An inability to overcome these obstacles or a failure of demand to
develop could materially and adversely affect DoubleClick's business, financial
condition and results of operations or could result in loss of key personnel.

DOUBLECLICK DEPENDS ON THIRD-PARTY INTERNET AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS
OVER WHOM DOUBLECLICK HAS NO CONTROL TO OPERATE DOUBLECLICK'S SERVICES.
INTERRUPTIONS IN DOUBLECLICK'S SERVICES CAUSED BY ONE OF THESE PROVIDERS COULD
HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON REVENUE.

    DoubleClick depends heavily on several third-party providers of Internet and
related telecommunication services, including of hosting and co-location
facilities, in operating DoubleClick's products and services. These companies
may not continue to provide services to DoubleClick without disruptions in
service, at the current cost or at all. Although DoubleClick believes that it
could obtain these services from other sources if need be, the costs associated
with any transition to a new service provider would be substantial, requiring
DoubleClick to reengineer its computer systems and telecommunications
infrastructure to accommodate a new service provider. This process would be both
expensive and time-consuming. In addition, failure of DoubleClick's Internet and
related telecommunications providers to provide the data communications capacity
in the time frame required by DoubleClick could cause interruptions in the
services DoubleClick provides. Despite precautions taken by DoubleClick,
unanticipated problems affecting DoubleClick's computer and telecommunications
systems in the future could cause interruptions in the delivery of DoubleClick's
services, causing a loss of revenue and potential loss of customers.

DOUBLECLICK IS DEPENDENT ON KEY PERSONNEL AND ON EMPLOYEE RETENTION AND
RECRUITING FOR DOUBLECLICK'S FUTURE SUCCESS.

    DoubleClick's future success depends to a significant extent on the
continued service of DoubleClick's key technical, sales and senior management
personnel. DoubleClick does not have employment agreements with most of these
executives. The loss of the services of one or more of DoubleClick's key
employees could materially and adversely affect DoubleClick's business, results
of operations and financial condition. DoubleClick's future success also depends
on DoubleClick's continuing to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled
employees. There is significant competition for qualified employees in
DoubleClick's industry. DoubleClick may be unable to retain DoubleClick's key
employees or attract, assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in
the future. DoubleClick has from time to time in the past experienced, and
DoubleClick expects to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in
hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications.

IF DOUBLECLICK FAILS TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT DOUBLECLICK'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
OR FACES A CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT BY A THIRD PARTY,
DOUBLECLICK COULD LOSE ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR BE LIABLE FOR
DAMAGES.

    DoubleClick's success and ability to effectively compete are substantially
dependent on the protection of DoubleClick's proprietary technologies and
DoubleClick's trademarks, which DoubleClick protects through a combination of
patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, unfair competition and contract law.
Despite DoubleClick's diligent efforts, DoubleClick cannot assure you that any
of DoubleClick's proprietary rights will be viable or of value in the future.

    In September 1999, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued to
DoubleClick a patent that covers DoubleClick's DART technology. DoubleClick owns
other patents, and has patent applications

pending, for its technology. DoubleClick cannot assure you that patents applied
for will be issued or that patents issued or acquired by DoubleClick now or in
the future will be valid and enforceable, or provide DoubleClick with any
meaningful protection.

    DoubleClick also has rights in the trademarks that it uses to market
DoubleClick's solutions. These trademarks include DOUBLECLICK'r', DART'r',
DARTMAIL'r' and ABACUS'r'. DoubleClick has applied to register DoubleClick's
trademarks in the United States and internationally. DoubleClick cannot assure
you that any of DoubleClick's current or future trademark applications will be
approved. Even if they are approved, these trademarks may be successfully
challenged by others or invalidated. If DoubleClick's trademark registrations
are not approved because third parties own these trademarks, DoubleClick's use
of these trademarks will be restricted unless DoubleClick enters into
arrangements with these parties which may be unavailable on commercially
reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, DoubleClick has licensed, and may
license in the future, DoubleClick's trademarks, trade dress and similar
proprietary rights to third parties. While DoubleClick endeavors to ensure that
the quality of DoubleClick's brands are maintained by DoubleClick's licensees,
DoubleClick's licensees may take actions that could materially and adversely
affect the value of DoubleClick's proprietary rights and reputation.

    In order to secure and protect DoubleClick's proprietary rights, DoubleClick
generally enters into confidentiality, proprietary rights and license
agreements, as appropriate, with DoubleClick's employees, consultants and
business partners, and generally controls access to and distribution of
DoubleClick's technologies, documentation and other proprietary information.
Despite these efforts, DoubleClick cannot be certain that the steps DoubleClick
takes to prevent unauthorized use of DoubleClick's proprietary rights are
sufficient to prevent misappropriation of DoubleClick's solutions or
technologies, particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement
practices may not protect DoubleClick's proprietary rights as fully as in the
United States. In addition, DoubleClick cannot assure you that DoubleClick will
be able to adequately enforce the contractual arrangements that it has entered
into to protect DoubleClick's proprietary technologies.

    Furthermore, third parties may assert infringement claims against
DoubleClick, which could adversely affect DoubleClick's reputation and the value
of DoubleClick's proprietary rights. From time to time DoubleClick has been, and
DoubleClick expects to continue to be, subject to claims in the ordinary course
of DoubleClick's business, including claims of alleged infringement of the
patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by
DoubleClick or DoubleClick's customers. In particular, DoubleClick does not
conduct exhaustive patent searches to determine whether DoubleClick's technology
infringes patents held by others. In addition, the protection of proprietary
rights in Internet-related industries is inherently uncertain due to the rapidly
evolving technological environment. As such, there may be numerous patent
applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed, that provide
for technologies similar to DoubleClick's.

    Third party infringement claims and any resultant litigation, should it
occur, could subject DoubleClick to significant liability for damages or
restrict DoubleClick from using DoubleClick's intellectual property. Even if
DoubleClick prevails, litigation could be time-consuming and expensive to defend
and could result in the diversion of management's time and attention. Any claims
from third parties may also result in limitations on DoubleClick's ability to
use the intellectual property subject to these claims unless DoubleClick is able
to enter into royalty, licensing or other similar agreements with the third
parties asserting these claims. Such agreements, if required, may be unavailable
on terms acceptable to DoubleClick, or at all. If a successful claim of
infringement is brought against DoubleClick and DoubleClick fails to develop
non-infringing technology or to license the infringed or similar technology on a
timely basis, it could materially adversely affect DoubleClick's business,
financial condition and results of operations.

DOUBLECLICK'S RIGHT TO KEEP AND USE INFORMATION COLLECTED IN DOUBLECLICK'S
DATABASES MAY BE CHALLENGED IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
DOUBLECLICK'S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

    DoubleClick collects and compiles information in databases for the product
offerings of all DoubleClick's businesses. Individuals have claimed and may
claim in the future that DoubleClick's

collection of this information is illegal. Although DoubleClick believes that it
has the right to use and compile the information in these databases, DoubleClick
cannot assure you that DoubleClick's ability to do so will remain lawful, that
any trade secret, copyright or other intellectual property protection will be
available for DoubleClick's databases, or that statutory protection that is or
becomes available for databases will enhance DoubleClick's rights. In addition,
others may claim rights to the information in DoubleClick's databases. Further,
pursuant to DoubleClick's contracts with Web publishers using DoubleClick's
solutions, DoubleClick is obligated to keep certain information regarding each
Web publisher confidential and, therefore, may be restricted from further using
that information in DoubleClick's businesses.

DOUBLECLICK MUST ADAPT TO TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS OR
DOUBLECLICK WILL NOT BE COMPETITIVE.

    The digital marketing business is characterized by rapidly changing
technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product and service
introductions and changing customer demands. DoubleClick's future success will
depend on DoubleClick's ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and to
enhance existing solutions and develop and introduce a variety of new solutions
and services to address DoubleClick's customers' changing demands. DoubleClick
may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design,
development, introduction or marketing of DoubleClick's solutions and services.
In addition, DoubleClick's new solutions or enhancements must meet the
requirements of DoubleClick's current and prospective customers and must achieve
significant acceptance. Material delays in introducing new solutions and
enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of DoubleClick's solutions
and purchase those of DoubleClick's competitors. DoubleClick's failure to
successfully design, develop, test and introduce new services, or the failure of
DoubleClick's recently introduced services to achieve acceptance, could prevent
DoubleClick from maintaining existing customer relationships, gaining new
customers or expanding DoubleClick's business and could materially and adversely
affect DoubleClick's business, financial condition and results of operations.

DOUBLECLICK'S BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF DOUBLECLICK FAILS
SUCCESSFULLY TO MANAGE ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND SALES AND MARKETING
EFFORTS.

    DoubleClick has operations in a number of countries. DoubleClick has limited
experience in developing localized versions of DoubleClick's solutions and in
marketing, selling and distributing DoubleClick's solutions internationally.
DoubleClick sells its products and services through DoubleClick's directly and
indirectly owned subsidiaries in Australia, the Benelux countries, Canada,
France, Germany, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Scandinavia and the United Kingdom.
DoubleClick also operates its media business through business partners in Japan
and Asia (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, China and Singapore) and generally operates
its technology business through its directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries in
these jurisdictions. A great deal of DoubleClick's success in these markets is
directly dependent on the success of DoubleClick's business partners and their
dedication of sufficient resources to DoubleClick's relationship.

    DoubleClick's international operations are subject to other inherent risks,
including:

     the high cost of maintaining international operations;

     uncertain demand for DoubleClick's products and services;

     the impact of recessions in economies outside the United States;

     changes in regulatory requirements;

     more restrictive privacy regulation;

     reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;

     potentially adverse tax consequences;

     difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;

     political and economic instability;

     fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and

     seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage.

    These risks may have a material and adverse impact on the business, results
of operations and financial condition of DoubleClick's operations in a
particular country and could result in a decision by DoubleClick to reduce or
discontinue operations in that country. The combined impact of these risks in
each country may also materially and adversely affect the business, results of
operations and financial condition of DoubleClick as a whole.

DOUBLECLICK HAS INCURRED SIGNIFICANT DEBT OBLIGATIONS WHICH COULD HARM
DOUBLECLICK'S BUSINESS.

    DoubleClick incurred $250 million of indebtedness in March 1999 from the
sale of DoubleClick's 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006.
DoubleClick's ratio of long-term debt to total equity was approximately 32.0% as
of March 31, 2001. The degree to which DoubleClick is leveraged could materially
and adversely affect DoubleClick's ability to obtain additional financing and
could make DoubleClick more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive
pressures. DoubleClick's ability to meet its debt service obligations will
depend on DoubleClick's future performance, which will be subject to financial,
business and other factors affecting DoubleClick's operations, many of which are
beyond DoubleClick's control.

EFFECTS OF ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS COULD INHIBIT THE ACQUISITION OF
DOUBLECLICK.

    Some of the provisions of DoubleClick's certificate of incorporation,
DoubleClick's bylaws and Delaware law could, together or separately:

     discourage potential acquisition proposals;

     delay or prevent a change in control;

     impede the ability of DoubleClick's stockholders to change the composition
     of DoubleClick's board of directors in any one year; or

     limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for
     shares of DoubleClick's common stock.

DOUBLECLICK'S STOCK PRICE MAY EXPERIENCE EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS.

    The market price of DoubleClick's common stock has fluctuated in the past
and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide
fluctuations. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and
volume fluctuations. The market prices of the securities of Internet-related
companies have been especially volatile. Investors may be unable to resell their
shares of DoubleClick's common stock at or above their purchase price.

IF DOUBLECLICK'S STOCK PRICE IS VOLATILE, DOUBLECLICK MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO
SECURITIES LITIGATION WHICH IS EXPENSIVE AND COULD RESULT IN A DIVERSION OF
RESOURCES.

    In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a
particular company's securities, securities class action litigation has often
been brought against that company. Many companies in DoubleClick's industry have
been subject to this type of litigation in the past. DoubleClick may also become
involved in this type of litigation. Litigation is often expensive and diverts
management's attention and resources, which could materially and adversely
affect DoubleClick's business, financial condition and results of operations.

FUTURE SALES OF DOUBLECLICK'S COMMON STOCK MAY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF
DOUBLECLICK'S COMMON STOCK.

    As of March 31, 2001, DoubleClick had 128,894,872 shares of common stock
outstanding, excluding 21,944,597 shares subject to options outstanding as of
such date under DoubleClick's stock option plans that are exercisable at prices
ranging from $0.03 to $124.56 per share. Additionally, certain holders of

DoubleClick's common stock have registration rights with respect to their
shares. DoubleClick intends to file one or more registration statements in
compliance with these registration rights. DoubleClick cannot predict the
effect, if any, that future sales of common stock or the availability of shares
of common stock for future sale, will have on the market price of DoubleClick's
common stock prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of
common stock (including shares included in such registration statements, issued
upon the exercise of stock options or issued upon the conversion of
DoubleClick's convertible subordinated notes), or the perception that such sales
could occur, may materially and adversely affect prevailing market prices for
DoubleClick's common stock.

                    RISKS RELATED TO DOUBLECLICK'S INDUSTRY

DOUBLECLICK'S BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF DEMAND FOR INTERNET
ADVERTISING FAILS TO GROW AS PREDICTED OR DIMINISHES.

    DoubleClick's future success is highly dependent on an increase in the use
of the Internet as an advertising medium. The Internet advertising industry is
new and rapidly evolving and it cannot yet be compared with traditional
advertising media to gauge its effectiveness. As a result, demand and acceptance
for Internet advertising solutions is uncertain. Many of DoubleClick's current
or potential advertising customers have limited experience using the Internet
for advertising purposes and they have allocated only a limited portion of their
advertising budgets to Internet advertising. The adoption of Internet
advertising, particularly by those entities that have historically relied upon
traditional media for advertising, requires the acceptance of a new way of
conducting business, exchanging information and advertising products and
services. These customers may find Internet advertising to be less effective for
promoting their products and services relative to traditional advertising media.
In addition, some of DoubleClick's current and potential Web publisher customers
have little experience in generating revenue from the sale of advertising space
on their Web sites. DoubleClick cannot assure you that current or potential
advertising customers will allocate a portion of their advertising budget to
Internet advertising or that the demand for Internet advertising will continue
to develop to sufficiently support Internet advertising as a significant
advertising medium. If the demand for Internet advertising decreases or develops
more slowly than DoubleClick expects, then DoubleClick's business, results of
operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

    There are currently no generally accepted standards or tools for the
measurement of the effectiveness of Internet advertising or the planning of
advertising purchases, and generally accepted standard measurements and tools
may need to be developed to support and promote Internet advertising as a
significant advertising medium. DoubleClick's advertising customers may
challenge or refuse to accept DoubleClick's or third-party's measurements of
advertisement delivery results, or the market research information that
DoubleClick provides. DoubleClick's customers may not accept any errors in such
measurements. In addition, the accuracy of database information used to target
advertisements is essential to the effectiveness of Internet advertising that
may be developed in the future. The information in DoubleClick's database, like
any database, may contain inaccuracies which DoubleClick's customers may not
accept.

    A significant portion of DoubleClick's revenue is derived from the delivery
of advertisements placed on Web sites which are designed to contain the features
and measuring capabilities requested by advertisers. If advertisers determine
that those ads are ineffective or unattractive as an advertising medium or if
DoubleClick is unable to deliver the features or measuring capabilities
requested by advertisers, the long-term growth of DoubleClick's online
advertising business could be limited and DoubleClick's revenue could decline.
There are also `filter' software programs that limit or prevent advertising from
being delivered to a user's computer. The commercial viability of Internet
advertising and DoubleClick's business, results of operations and financial
condition, would be materially and adversely affected by Web users' widespread
adoption of this software.

CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATION COULD DECREASE DOUBLECLICK'S REVENUE AND
INCREASE DOUBLECLICK'S COSTS.

    Laws applicable to Internet communications, e-commerce, digital advertising,
data protection and direct marketing are becoming more prevalent. Any
legislation enacted or regulation issued could dampen the growth and acceptance
of the digital marketing industry in general and of DoubleClick's offerings in
particular. Existing and proposed legislation in the United States, Europe
(following the directive of the European Union), Canada and Japan may impose
limits on DoubleClick's collection and use of certain kinds of information about
individuals, whether collected offline or online. Various U.S. state and foreign
governments may also attempt to regulate DoubleClick's transmissions or levy
sales or other taxes relating to DoubleClick's activities.

    Moreover, the laws governing the Internet remain largely unsettled, even in
areas where there has been some legislative action. It may take years to
determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual
property, data protection, libel and taxation apply to the Internet and Internet
advertising. In addition, the growth and development of Internet commerce may
prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws, both in the United
States and abroad, that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting
business over the Internet.

    DoubleClick's business, results of operations and financial condition could
be materially and adversely affected by the adoption or modification of laws or
regulations relating to DoubleClick's businesses.

CHANGES IN LAWS RELATING TO DATA COLLECTION AND USE PRACTICES AND THE PRIVACY OF
INTERNET USERS AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS COULD HARM DOUBLECLICK'S BUSINESS.

    New limitations on the collection and use of information relating to
Internet users are currently being considered by legislatures and regulatory
agencies in the United States and internationally. DoubleClick is unable to
predict whether any particular proposal will pass, or the nature of the
limitations in those proposals that do pass. Since many of the proposals are in
their development stage, DoubleClick cannot yet determine the impact these may
have on DoubleClick's business. In addition, it is possible that changes to
existing law, including new interpretations of existing law, could have a
material and adverse impact on DoubleClick's business, financial condition and
results of operations.

    The following are examples of proposals currently being considered in the
United States and internationally:

     Legislation has been proposed in some jurisdictions to regulate the use of
     cookie technology. DoubleClick's technology uses cookies for ad targeting
     and reporting, among other things and DoubleClick may be required to change
     its technology in order to comply with the new laws. It is possible that
     the changes required for compliance are commercially unfeasible, or that
     DoubleClick is simply unable to comply and, therefore, may be required to
     discontinue the relevant business practice.

     Data protection officials in certain European countries have voiced the
     opinion that an Internet protocol, or IP, address is
     personally-identifiable information. In those countries in which this
     opinion prevails, the applicable national data protection law could be
     interpreted to subject DoubleClick to a more restrictive regulatory regime.
     Although DoubleClick believes its current policies and procedures would
     meet these more restrictive standards, DoubleClick cannot assure you that
     the applicable authorities would make the same determination. The cost of
     such compliance could be material and DoubleClick may not be able to comply
     with the applicable national regulations in a timely or cost-effective
     manner. Legislation has been proposed to prohibit the sending of
     `unsolicited commercial e-mail' or `spam.' DoubleClick has a consent-based
     e-mail delivery and list services business that DoubleClick believes should
     not, as a matter of policy, be affected by this kind of legislation.
     However, it is possible that legislation will be passed that requires
     DoubleClick to change its current practices, or subject DoubleClick to
     increased possibility of legal liability for its practices.

     Legislation is under consideration that would regulate the practice of
     online preference marketing, as practiced by DoubleClick and other Network
     Advertising Initiative member

     companies. Such legislation, if passed, could require DoubleClick to change
     or discontinue its plans for online preference marketing services. The
     changes DoubleClick is required to make could diminish the market
     acceptance of DoubleClick's offerings.

     The Federal Trade Commission is currently reviewing the need to regulate
     the manner in which offline information about consumers is collected and
     used by businesses. The value of the Abacus database, and the future
     viability of the DoubleClick Data business, could be adversely affected by
     legislation or regulation that limits the manner in which offline
     information about consumers is collected and used.

    These and other circumstances, which may lead to changes in the existing
law, could have a material and adverse impact on DoubleClick's business,
financial condition and results of operations.

    In addition, DoubleClick is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative
and the Direct Marketing Association, both industry self-regulatory
organizations. Although DoubleClick's compliance with the these self-regulatory
principles to date has not had a material adverse effect on DoubleClick,
DoubleClick cannot assure you that these organizations will not adopt
additional, more burdensome guidelines, which could materially and adversely
affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of
DoubleClick.

DOUBLECLICK'S BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY PRODUCTS OFFERED BY THIRD
PARTIES.

    DoubleClick's business may be adversely affected by the adoption by computer
users of technologies that harm the performance of DoubleClick's products and
services. For example, computer users may use software designed to filter or
prevent the delivery of Internet advertising, or Internet browsers set to block
the use of cookies. DoubleClick cannot assure you that the number of computer
users who employ these or other similar technologies will not increase, thereby
diminishing the efficacy of DoubleClick's products and services. In the case
that one or more of these technologies are widely adopted, DoubleClick's
business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and
adversely affected.

DOUBLECLICK'S BUSINESS MAY SUFFER IF THE WEB INFRASTRUCTURE IS UNABLE TO
EFFECTIVELY SUPPORT THE GROWTH IN DEMAND PLACED ON IT.

    DoubleClick's success will depend, in large part, upon the maintenance of
the Web infrastructure, such as a reliable network backbone with the necessary
speed, data capacity and security and timely development of enabling products
such as high speed modems, for providing reliable Web access and services and
improved content. DoubleClick cannot assure you that the Web infrastructure will
continue to effectively support the demands placed on it as the Web continues to
experience increased numbers of users, frequency of use or increased bandwidth
requirements of users. Even if the necessary infrastructure or technologies are
developed, DoubleClick may have to spend considerable amounts to adapt
DoubleClick's solutions accordingly. Furthermore, the Web has experienced a
variety of outages and other delays due to damage to portions of its
infrastructure. These outages and delays could impact the Web sites of Web
publishers using DoubleClick's solutions and the level of user traffic on Web
sites on DoubleClick's DoubleClick networks.

DOUBLECLICK DATA IS DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESS OF THE DIRECT MARKETING INDUSTRY
FOR ITS FUTURE SUCCESS.

    The future success of DoubleClick Data is dependent in large part on the
continued demand for DoubleClick's services from the direct marketing industry,
including the catalog industry, as well as the continued willingness of catalog
operators to contribute their data to DoubleClick. Most of DoubleClick's Abacus
customers are large consumer merchandise catalog operators in the United States.
A significant downturn in the direct marketing industry generally, including the
catalog industry, or withdrawal by a substantial number of catalog operators
from the Abacus Alliance, would have a material adverse effect on DoubleClick's
business, financial condition and results of operations. Many industry experts
predict that electronic commerce, including the purchase of merchandise and the
exchange of information via the Internet or other media, will increase
significantly in the future. To the

extent this increase occurs, companies that now rely on catalogs or other direct
marketing avenues to market their products may reallocate resources toward these
new direct marketing channels and away from catalog-related marketing or other
direct marketing avenues, which could adversely affect demand for some
DoubleClick Data services. In addition, the effectiveness of direct mail as a
marketing tool may decrease as a result of consumer saturation and increased
consumer resistance to direct mail in general.

INCREASES IN POSTAL RATES AND PAPER PRICES COULD HARM DOUBLECLICK DATA.

    The direct marketing activities of DoubleClick's Abacus Alliance customers
are adversely affected by postal rate increases, especially increases that are
imposed without sufficient advance notice to allow adjustments to be made to
marketing budgets. Higher postal rates may result in fewer mailings of direct
marketing materials, with a corresponding decline in the need for some of the
direct marketing services offered by DoubleClick. Increased postal rates can
also lead to pressure from DoubleClick's customers to reduce DoubleClick's
prices for its services in order to offset any postal rate increase. Higher
paper prices may also cause catalog companies to conduct fewer or smaller
mailings which could cause a corresponding decline in the need for DoubleClick's
services. DoubleClick's customers may aggressively seek price reductions for
DoubleClick's services to offset any increased materials cost. Any of these
occurrences could materially and adversely affect the business, financial
condition and results of operations of DoubleClick's Abacus business.

RISKS RELATED TO MESSAGEMEDIA

    In addition to the risks relating to the merger and DoubleClick discussed
above, MessageMedia is subject to its own specific risks relating to its
business model, strategy and the legal, regulatory and business environment,
including those set forth below.

MESSAGEMEDIA HAS A HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES AND FUTURE LOSSES ARE LIKELY.

    MessageMedia had an accumulated deficit of approximately $191.7 million as
of March 31, 2001. MessageMedia has not achieved profitability and expects to
continue to incur operating losses through the end of 2001 MessageMedia intends
to continue to invest in research and development and strategic marketing
activities. Accordingly, MessageMedia expects to continue to incur significant
operating expenditures and, as a result, will need to generate significant
revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. Although MessageMedia's revenues
have grown in some but not all of the recent quarters, it cannot assure you that
it will achieve sufficient revenues for profitability. Even if MessageMedia does
achieve profitability, it cannot assure you that it can sustain or increase
profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If revenues grow
slower than MessageMedia anticipates, or if operating expenses or restructuring
reserves exceed its expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly,
MessageMedia's business, results of operations and financial condition will be
materially and adversely affected.

MESSAGEMEDIA ANTICIPATES FLUCTUATIONS IN ITS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS, WHICH
COULD CAUSE ITS STOCK PRICE TO FALL.

    MessageMedia expects that its future operating results will fluctuate
significantly, both in absolute terms and relative to analyst and investor
expectations, which could cause its stock price to fall. These fluctuations may
be due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond MessageMedia's control.
Some of the factors that may cause fluctuations include the following:

     market response to MessageMedia's e-messaging solutions;

     difficulties in the integration of existing technologies and the
     development or deployment of new products or services;

     the timing and rate at which MessageMedia increases its expenses to support
     projected growth;

     fluctuating market demand for MessageMedia's products and services;

     product introductions and service offerings by MessageMedia's competitors;

     the mix of the products and services provided by MessageMedia; and

     the cost of compliance with applicable government regulations, including
     privacy legislation.

    MessageMedia's revenue for the foreseeable future will remain dependent on
sales of e-messaging solutions, the fees that MessageMedia charges for its
services and license fees for software products. These future revenues are
difficult to forecast. In addition, although MessageMedia has taken measures to
significantly reduce expenses, MessageMedia may be unable to adjust its internal
operating expenses quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall. If
MessageMedia has a shortfall in revenue in relation to its expenses, or if its
expenses precede increased revenue, MessageMedia's business, results of
operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.
This would likely affect the market price of MessageMedia's common stock in a
manner that may be unrelated to MessageMedia's long-term operating performance.

    MessageMedia believes that marketing and advertising sales in traditional
media, such as television and radio, generally are lower in the first calendar
quarter of each year. Seasonal or cyclical patterns may develop in
MessageMedia's industry if MessageMedia's market makes the transition from an
emerging to a more developed medium. MessageMedia's revenue may also be affected
by seasonal and cyclical patterns in Internet spending if they emerge.

    MessageMedia believes that period-to-period comparisons of MessageMedia's
operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as an
indication of MessageMedia's future performance. Due to the factors MessageMedia
has listed above and other factors, it is likely that MessageMedia's future
operating results will at times not meet the expectations of market analysts or
investors. If

MessageMedia's operating results fail to meet expectations, the price of
MessageMedia's common stock could fall.

MESSAGEMEDIA'S STOCK PRICE HAS BEEN VOLATILE IN THE PAST AND MAY BE VOLATILE IN
THE FUTURE, DUE TO REASONS OTHER THAN ITS ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS.

    The stock market in general, and MessageMedia's common stock in particular,
have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been
unrelated or disproportionate to MessageMedia's operating performance. The
trading price of MessageMedia's common stock could fluctuate in response to
factors such as:

     changes in recommendations of securities analysts;

     announcements of technological innovations or new services or products;

     publicity regarding actual or potential results with respect to
     technologies, services or products under development;

     disputes or other developments concerning proprietary rights, including
     copyright and litigation matters; and

     limited investment analyst coverage.

MESSAGEMEDIA IS AT RISK OF SECURITIES CLASS ACTION LITIGATION DUE TO ITS
EXPECTED STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY.

    In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought
against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their
securities. MessageMedia may in the future be the target of similar litigation.
Securities litigation could harm MessageMedia's reputation, result in
substantial costs and divert MessageMedia's management's attention and
resources, regardless of the merits or outcome of the case.

MESSAGEMEDIA'S COMMON STOCK MAY BE DELISTED FROM THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET,
RESULTING IN A LIMITED PUBLIC MARKET FOR ITS COMMON STOCK.

    MessageMedia's common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq National
Market under the symbol 'MESG.' On March 6, 2001, MessageMedia received a notice
from The Nasdaq National Market indicating that MessageMedia's common stock had
failed to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 over the last 30 consecutive
trading days. Under the rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc., MessageMedia had until June 4, 2001 to comply with the continued listing
requirements. Otherwise, MessageMedia's common stock would be subject to
delisting.

    MessageMedia was not able to demonstrate compliance with the continued
listing requirements of The Nasdaq National Market on or before June 4, 2001.
Consequently, MessageMedia received a written notification from The Nasdaq
National Market on June 5, 2001, indicating that MessageMedia's common stock
failed to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 over the previous 30 consecutive
trading days and over the 90 day probationary period. The letter stated that
MessageMedia's common stock would be delisted from The Nasdaq National Market at
the opening of business on June 13, 2001. On June 8, 2001, MessageMedia sent a
letter to The Nasdaq National Market requesting a written hearing to review the
delisting determination, which request stayed the delisting of MessageMedia's
common stock pending The Nasdaq National Market's ultimate decision. The written
hearing is scheduled for July 12, 2001.

    If MessageMedia's common stock is not listed on The Nasdaq National Market,
trading, if any, would be conducted in the over-the-counter market in the
so-called 'pink sheets' or the OTC Bulletin Board, which was established
for securities that do not meet the listing requirements of The Nasdaq National
Market. Consequently, selling MessageMedia's common stock would be more
difficult because smaller quantities of shares could be bought and sold,
transactions could be delayed and security analysts' and news media's coverage
of MessageMedia may be reduced. These factors could result in lower prices and
larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for shares of MessageMedia's common

stock. Such delisting by The Nasdaq National Market could also greatly impair
MessageMedia's ability to raise capital, if needed, through equity or debt
financing.

    In addition, if MessageMedia's common stock is not listed on The Nasdaq
National Market, MessageMedia may become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. That rule imposes additional sales
practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell low-priced securities to
persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors.
For transactions covered by this rule, a broker-dealer must make a special
suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser's
written consent to the transaction prior to sale. Consequently, the rule may
affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell MessageMedia's common stock and
affect the ability of holders to sell their shares of MessageMedia's common
stock in the secondary market.

    The regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission define a 'penny
stock' to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per
share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain
exceptions. The penny stock restrictions will not apply to MessageMedia's common
stock if it is listed on The Nasdaq National Market and MessageMedia provides
certain price and volume information on a current and continuing basis, or meets
required minimum net tangible assets or average revenue criteria. There can be
no assurance that the shares of MessageMedia's common stock will qualify for
exemption from these restrictions. If MessageMedia's common stock becomes
subject to the penny stock rules, the market liquidity for the shares could be
adversely affected.

MESSAGEMEDIA CANNOT PREDICT ITS FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS AND IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
SECURE ADDITIONAL FINANCING.

    It may be necessary for MessageMedia to raise additional capital in the
future in order to execute its business plan, develop or enhance its products
and services, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive
pressures. Any required additional financing might not be available on terms
favorable to MessageMedia, or at all. Although MessageMedia is not permitted
under the terms of the amended merger agreement to raise additional funds by
issuing equity or debt securities unless DoubleClick agrees, if DoubleClick does
agree, or if the merger does not close and MessageMedia attempts to raise
additional funds, you may experience significant dilution of your ownership
interest and such securities may have rights senior to your rights. If
additional financing is not available when required or is not available on
acceptable terms, MessageMedia may be unable to fund its operations, which would
have a material adverse effect on MessageMedia's business, financial condition
and results of operations.

MESSAGEMEDIA'S BUSINESS IS DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE BECAUSE MESSAGEMEDIA HAS A
LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY.

    An investor in MessageMedia's common stock must consider the risks and
difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly
evolving markets, including the e-messaging and e-intelligence markets. These
risks include MessageMedia's:

     ability to achieve and maintain revenue growth rates;

     need to successfully integrate past and any future acquisitions;

     competition;

     ability to offer products and services, including MessageMedia's
     information distribution, email marketing and e-commerce messaging
     offerings, that achieve broad market acceptance;

     ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel;

     ability to maintain MessageMedia's current, and develop new, strategic
     relationships;

     ability to anticipate and adapt to the changing e-messaging market; and

     ability to attract and retain a large number of customers from a variety of
     industries.

    MessageMedia also depends on the growing use of the Internet for marketing,
advertising, commerce and communications. MessageMedia cannot assure you that
its business strategy will be successful or that it will successfully address
these risks. If MessageMedia does not successfully address these risks, its
business could be seriously harmed.

    MessageMedia's markets are relatively new and unproven and its success
depends on market acceptance and the effectiveness of its e-messaging and
e-intelligence solutions. If MessageMedia's solutions are not adopted by market
participants, MessageMedia's revenue growth will suffer.

    Demand and market acceptance for Internet e-messaging solutions is
uncertain. MessageMedia's future success is highly dependent on an increase in
the use of the Internet as a marketing, advertising and communications medium.
The adoption of these Internet services, particularly by those entities that
historically have relied upon traditional media for marketing and advertising,
requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business, exchanging
information and marketing products and services. Many of MessageMedia's current
or potential customers have little or no experience using the Internet for
marketing and advertising purposes, and they have allocated only a limited
portion of their budgets to e-messaging. If MessageMedia fails to meet
customers' demands, the use of its e-messaging services may decline over time
and MessageMedia's business would suffer.

SUBSTANTIAL SALES OF MESSAGEMEDIA'S COMMON STOCK BY ITS LARGE STOCKHOLDERS COULD
CAUSE MESSAGEMEDIA'S STOCK PRICE TO FALL.

    A limited number of stockholders hold a large portion of MessageMedia's
common stock. To the extent MessageMedia's large stockholders sell substantial
amounts of MessageMedia's common stock in the public market, the market price of
MessageMedia's common stock could fall. A private placement transaction
completed by MessageMedia in February 2001 increased both the number of its
securities that will become available for resale to the public and the number of
its securities held by several of MessageMedia's larger stockholders. In this
instance, MessageMedia issued 7,746,479 shares of its common stock to affiliates
of SOFTBANK Venture Capital, who together constitute MessageMedia's largest
stockholder, 704,225 shares to affiliates of Pequot Capital Management, Inc.,
and 2,816,902 shares to Rebar LLC. These investors may demand that MessageMedia
effect the registration of these shares, after which they may be sold in the
public markets without restriction.

MESSAGEMEDIA'S FAILURE TO ENHANCE ITS EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND
INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ON A TIMELY BASIS COULD CAUSE ITS REVENUES
TO FALL.

    MessageMedia is continually developing significant enhancements for its
e-messaging solutions and products. Any delay or difficulty associated with the
introduction of these enhancements could significantly harm MessageMedia's
business, results of operations and financial condition. MessageMedia also may
not be able to develop the underlying core technologies necessary to create new
products or enhancements, or to license those products from third parties, which
could cause its revenues to decline.

MESSAGEMEDIA NEEDS TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AND MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO DO SO, WHICH COULD HARM MESSAGEMEDIA'S BUSINESS.

    MessageMedia's success depends on the continued service of MessageMedia's
key senior management personnel, in particular, A. Laurence Jones,
MessageMedia's President and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of any member of
MessageMedia's senior management team could have a material adverse effect on
its future operating results. MessageMedia's future success also depends on its
continuing ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees.
MessageMedia faces significant competition for individuals with the skills and
experience required to perform in required roles and may not be able to attract
or retain such individuals in the future.

IF MESSAGEMEDIA FAILS TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE CHANGES TO ITS OPERATIONS, ITS
BUSINESS COULD SUFFER.

    MessageMedia continues to adjust the scope of its operations and manage
adjustments to the size of its workforce. Rapid changes to its business have
placed and may continue to place a significant strain on MessageMedia's
management systems and resources. MessageMedia expects that it will need
to continue to improve its financial and managerial controls and reporting
systems and procedures, and will need to continue to train and manage its
workforce. MessageMedia's business, results of operations and financial
condition will be harmed if MessageMedia is unable to effectively manage
its operations.

MESSAGEMEDIA DEPENDS ON THIRD-PARTY INTERNET AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS
OVER WHOM MESSAGEMEDIA HAS NO CONTROL TO OPERATE ITS E-MESSAGING PLATFORM.
INTERRUPTIONS IN MESSAGEMEDIA'S SERVICES CAUSED BY ONE OF THESE PROVIDERS COULD
HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON MESSAGEMEDIA'S REVENUE.

    MessageMedia depends heavily on several third-party providers of Internet
and related telecommunication services, including hosting and co-location
companies, in operating MessageMedia's e-marketing platform. These companies may
not continue to provide services to MessageMedia without disruptions in service,
at the current cost or at all. Although MessageMedia believes that it could
obtain these services from other sources if need be, the costs associated with
any transition to a new service provider would be substantial, requiring
MessageMedia to reengineer its computer systems and telecommunications
infrastructure to accommodate a new service provider. This process would be both
expensive and time-consuming.

    In addition, failure of MessageMedia's Internet and related
telecommunications providers to provide the data communications capacity in the
time frame required by MessageMedia could cause interruptions in the services
MessageMedia provides. Despite precautions taken by MessageMedia, unanticipated
problems affecting MessageMedia's computer and telecommunications systems in the
future could cause interruptions in the delivery of its e-messaging and
e-intelligence services, causing a loss of revenue and potential loss of
customers.

MESSAGEMEDIA RELIES ON A FEW CUSTOMERS FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS REVENUE.
LOSING A SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER COULD SUBSTANTIALLY DIMINISH MESSAGEMEDIA'S
REVENUE.

    A significant portion of MessageMedia's revenues are generated by a limited
number of customers. MessageMedia expects that it will continue to depend on
large contracts with a small number of significant customers, which can cause
its revenue and earnings to fluctuate between quarters based on the timing of
these contracts. None of MessageMedia's customers has any obligation to purchase
additional products or services from MessageMedia above current contractual
minimums. Consequently, if MessageMedia fails to develop relationships with
significant new customers, its business and financial condition will suffer.

COMPETITION IN MESSAGEMEDIA'S INDUSTRY IS INTENSE AND MESSAGEMEDIA'S BUSINESS
COULD BE HARMED IF IT DOES NOT COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

    The market for MessageMedia's products and services is intensely
competitive. There are no substantial barriers to entry into MessageMedia's
business and MessageMedia expects that established and new entities will enter
the market for e-messaging solutions.

    MessageMedia's principal competitors are in the e-messaging services arena,
and it may experience additional competition from Internet service providers and
other large established businesses that may enter the market for e-messaging
services. MessageMedia competes for customers based on service levels, product
offerings and price.

    The Internet, in general, and MessageMedia's e-messaging solutions, in
particular, also must compete for a share of advertisers' total advertising
budgets with traditional advertising media such as television, radio, cable and
print. Consequently, MessageMedia competes with advertising and direct marketing
agencies. To the extent that e-messaging is perceived to be a limited or
ineffective advertising medium, companies may be reluctant to devote a
significant portion of their advertising budget to

MessageMedia's e-messaging solutions, which could limit the growth of
e-messaging and negatively affect MessageMedia's business.

    MessageMedia also expects that competition may increase as a result of
industry consolidation. Potential competitors may choose to enter the market for
e-messaging solutions by acquiring one or more of MessageMedia's existing
competitors or by forming strategic alliances with such competitors. In
addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish
cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the
ability of their products or services to address the needs of MessageMedia's
potential customers. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or
alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. Increased
competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of
market share, any of which would harm MessageMedia's business, results of
operations and financial condition.

    Many of MessageMedia's current and potential competitors have longer
operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, more
diversified lines of products and services and significantly greater resources
than MessageMedia does. These competitors may be able to undertake more
extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make
more attractive offers to potential customers. In addition, many of
MessageMedia's current or potential competitors have broad distribution channels
that may result in better access to end-users or purchasers. As a result of the
above factors, MessageMedia cannot assure you that MessageMedia will compete
effectively with current or future competitors or that competitive pressures
will not have a material adverse effect on MessageMedia's business, financial
condition and results of operations.

THE MARKETS FOR MESSAGEMEDIA'S PRODUCTS ARE UNDEVELOPED AND RAPIDLY CHANGING,
WHICH MAKES AN INVESTMENT IN MESSAGEMEDIA RISKY.

    The Internet e-messaging markets are characterized by rapidly changing
technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product and service
introductions, changing customer demands and increasing numbers of service
providers. MessageMedia's products and services are designed around current
technical standards and its revenue depends on continued industry acceptance of
these standards. While MessageMedia intends to provide compatibility with the
most popular industry standards, widespread adoption of a proprietary or closed
standard could prevent MessageMedia from doing so. The standards on which
MessageMedia's products and services are or will be based may not be accepted by
the industry.

    New market entrants have introduced or are developing products and services
for use on the Internet that compete with MessageMedia's products. The products,
services or technologies developed by others may render MessageMedia's products
and services uncompetitive or obsolete. Accordingly, MessageMedia's future
success will depend on its ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies,
enhance existing solutions, and develop and introduce a variety of new solutions
to address new industry standards and its customers' changing demands.
MessageMedia may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the
successful design, development, introduction or marketing of its solutions. In
addition, MessageMedia's new solutions or enhancements must meet the
requirements of its current and prospective customers and achieve significant
market acceptance. Material delays in introducing new solutions and enhancements
may cause customers to forego purchases of MessageMedia's solutions and purchase
those of its competitors.

    The degree to which MessageMedia's e-messaging platform is accepted and used
in the marketplace will depend on continued growth in the use of email as a
primary means of communications by businesses and consumers. An increase in the
use of e-messaging also will depend on market acceptance of email as a method
for targeted marketing of products and services. MessageMedia's ability to
successfully differentiate its services from random mass emailing products and
services which have encountered substantial resistance from consumers will also
be important. Businesses that already have invested substantial resources in
traditional or other methods of conducting business may be reluctant to adopt
new commercial methods or strategies that may limit or compete with their
existing businesses. Individuals with established patterns of purchasing goods
and services may be reluctant to alter those patterns.

MESSAGEMEDIA FACES RISKS OF DEFECTS AND DEVELOPMENT DELAYS IN ITS PRODUCTS AND
SERVICES, WHICH COULD HARM ITS REVENUE GROWTH.

    Products and services based on sophisticated software and computing systems
often encounter development delays. MessageMedia's underlying software may
contain hidden errors and failures when introduced or when usage increases.
MessageMedia may experience delays in the development of the software and
computing systems underlying its services. Despite testing that MessageMedia and
its customers conduct, MessageMedia may not locate errors if they occur. Also,
MessageMedia may experience development delays. These occurrences could harm
MessageMedia's reputation and revenue growth.

ANY SYSTEM FAILURE MAY HARM MESSAGEMEDIA'S BUSINESS OR REPUTATION.

    The continuing and uninterrupted performance of MessageMedia's computer
systems and MessageMedia's customers' computer systems is critical to
MessageMedia's ability to provide outsourced services. Sustained or repeated
system failures would reduce the attractiveness of MessageMedia's solutions to
its customers and could harm MessageMedia's business reputation. Slower response
time or system failures may also result from straining the capacity of
MessageMedia's deployed software or hardware due to increased volume of
e-messages delivered through its servers. To the extent that MessageMedia does
not effectively address any capacity constraints or system failures,
MessageMedia's business, results of operations and financial condition would be
materially and adversely affected.

    MessageMedia's operations are dependent in part upon its ability to protect
its operating systems against physical damage from fire, floods, earthquakes,
power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. MessageMedia does
not currently have redundant, multiple site capacity in the event of any such
occurrence. Despite the implementation of network security measures by
MessageMedia, its servers also are potentially vulnerable to computer viruses,
break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with its computer
systems. The occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions,
delays or cessations in service to users of MessageMedia's products and
services, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial
condition and results of operations.

MESSAGEMEDIA FACES SECURITY RISKS AND POTENTIAL LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH
MISAPPROPRIATION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, WHICH COULD HARM MESSAGEMEDIA'S
BUSINESS.

    MessageMedia currently retains highly confidential customer information in a
secure database server. MessageMedia cannot assure you, however, that it will be
able to prevent unauthorized access to and use of this database server. Any
unauthorized access to or use of MessageMedia's servers could result in the
theft of confidential customer information such as email addresses. It also is
possible that one of MessageMedia's employees could attempt to misuse
confidential customer information, exposing MessageMedia to liability.
MessageMedia uses disclaimers and limitation of warranty provisions in its
customer agreements in an attempt to limit its liability to its customers,
including liability arising out of systems failure. However, such provisions may
not be enforceable or effective in limiting MessageMedia's exposure to damage
claims.

MESSAGEMEDIA'S MEANS OF PROTECTING ITS PROPRIETARY RIGHTS MAY BE INADEQUATE AND
ITS COMPETITORS MAY DEVELOP SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY.

    MessageMedia relies on a combination of trade secret, copyright and
trademark laws, nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and
technical measures to protect its proprietary rights. MessageMedia believes
that, due to the rapid pace of technological innovation for Internet products,
however, MessageMedia's ability to establish and maintain a position of
technology leadership in the industry depends more on the skills of its
development personnel than upon the legal protections afforded its existing
technology. Trade secret, copyright and trademark protections may not be
adequate to safeguard the proprietary software underlying MessageMedia's
products and services. MessageMedia may not have adequate remedies for any
breach and its trade secrets may otherwise become known. Moreover,
notwithstanding MessageMedia's efforts to protect its intellectual property,
competitors may

be able to develop functionally equivalent e-messaging technologies without
infringing any of MessageMedia's intellectual property rights. Despite
MessageMedia's efforts to protect its proprietary rights, unauthorized parties
may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use products or technology that it
considers proprietary and third parties may attempt to develop similar
technology independently. In addition, effective protection of intellectual
property rights may be unavailable or limited in certain countries. Accordingly,
MessageMedia's means of protecting its proprietary rights may not be adequate
and its competitors may independently develop similar technology.

    MessageMedia enters into confidentiality and license agreements with its
employees, consultants and corporate partners and controls access to and
distribution of MessageMedia's technologies, documentation and other proprietary
information. Despite MessageMedia's efforts to protect its proprietary rights
from unauthorized use or disclosure, parties may attempt to disclose, obtain or
use MessageMedia's solutions or technologies. MessageMedia cannot assure you
that the steps it has taken will prevent misappropriation of its solutions or
technologies, particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement
practices may not protect MessageMedia's proprietary rights as fully as in the
United States.

    MessageMedia has licensed, and it may license in the future, elements of its
trademarks, trade dress and similar proprietary rights to third parties. While
MessageMedia attempts to ensure that the quality of its brand is maintained by
these business partners, such partners may take actions that could materially
and adversely affect the value of MessageMedia's proprietary rights or its
reputation. In addition, MessageMedia currently licenses certain software and
communication systems from third parties.

    MessageMedia's failure to maintain these licenses, or to find replacements
for such technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, could have a material
adverse effect on MessageMedia's business, results of operations and financial
condition.

MESSAGEMEDIA HAS IN THE PAST, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE, BECOME INVOLVED IN PATENT
OR TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS THAT RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT DRAIN ON
MESSAGEMEDIA'S RESOURCES AND PREVENT ITS MANAGEMENT TEAM FROM FOCUSING ON MORE
PROFITABLE TASKS.

    As the volume of Internet commerce increases, and the number of products and
service providers that support Internet commerce increases, MessageMedia
believes that Internet commerce technology providers may become increasingly
subject to infringement claims. MessageMedia has been subject to claims of
alleged infringement of intellectual property rights in the past and may become
involved in additional claims in the future. In addition, MessageMedia may
initiate claims of litigation against third parties for infringement of its
proprietary rights or to establish the validity of its proprietary rights. Any
such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly
litigation, disrupt or delay the enhancement or shipment of MessageMedia's
products and services or require MessageMedia to enter into royalty or licensing
agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be
available on terms acceptable or favorable to MessageMedia, which could have a
material adverse effect on MessageMedia's business, financial condition and
results of operations. Litigation to determine the validity of any claims could
result in significant expense to MessageMedia and divert the efforts of
MessageMedia's technical and management personnel from productive tasks, whether
or not such litigation is determined in MessageMedia's favor. In addition,
patent litigation often gives rise to counterclaims by the defendants, which
could include challenges to the validity of patents held by MessageMedia. In the
event of an adverse ruling in any such litigation, MessageMedia may be required
to pay substantial damages, discontinue the use and sale of infringing products,
expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or obtain
licenses to infringing technology. MessageMedia's failure to develop or license
a substitute technology could have a material adverse effect on MessageMedia's
business.

MESSAGEMEDIA MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO INCREASED GOVERNMENT REGULATION, WHICH COULD
MAKE ITS BUSINESS MORE COSTLY TO OPERATE OR DECREASE THE DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS
AND SERVICES.

    Laws and regulations directly applicable to Internet communications,
commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent. MessageMedia believes that
it is not currently subject to direct regulation

by any governmental agency in the United States, other than regulations that are
generally applicable to all businesses and newly enacted laws prohibiting the
sending of 'spam' and laws intended to protect minors. A number of legislative
and regulatory proposals are under consideration by federal and state lawmakers
and regulatory bodies and may be adopted with respect to the Internet. Some of
the issues that such laws or regulations may cover include user privacy,
obscenity, fraud, pricing and characteristics and quality of products and
services. The adoption of any such laws or regulations may hinder the growth of
the Internet, which could in turn decrease the projected demand for
MessageMedia's products and services or increase its cost of doing business.
Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing U.S. and international
laws governing issues such as property ownership, copyright, trade secret,
libel, taxation and personal privacy is uncertain and developing. Any new
application or interpretation of existing laws could have a material adverse
effect on MessageMedia's business.

                       THE SPECIAL STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING

GENERAL

    We are furnishing this proxy statement/prospectus to holders of MessageMedia
common stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies by MessageMedia's
board of directors for use at MessageMedia's special stockholders' meeting to be
held on [            ], 2001, and any adjournment or postponement of that
meeting.

    This proxy statement/prospectus is first being mailed to MessageMedia
stockholders on or about [            ], 2001. This proxy statement/prospectus
is also being furnished to MessageMedia's stockholders as a prospectus in
connection with the issuance by DoubleClick of shares of DoubleClick common
stock as contemplated by the amended merger agreement.

DATE, TIME AND PLACE

    MessageMedia's special stockholders' meeting will be held on [            ],
2001 at 9:00 a.m., local time, at MessageMedia's principal offices, located at
371 Centennial Parkway, Louisville, Colorado 80027.

MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE SPECIAL STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING

    At the MessageMedia special stockholders' meeting, and any adjournment or
postponement of the special stockholders' meeting, MessageMedia stockholders
will be asked to:

     consider and vote upon the adoption of the amended merger agreement;

     grant MessageMedia's board of directors discretionary authority to adjourn
     the special stockholders' meeting to solicit additional votes for adoption
     of the agreement; and

     transact such other business as may properly come before the special
     stockholders' meeting.

RECORD DATE

    MessageMedia's board of directors has fixed the close of business on
[            ], 2001 as the record date for determination of MessageMedia's
stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the special stockholders'
meeting.

VOTING OF PROXIES

    MessageMedia requests that its stockholders complete, date and sign the
accompanying proxy and promptly return it in the accompanying envelope or
otherwise mail it to MessageMedia. Brokers holding shares in 'street name' may
vote the shares only if the stockholder provides instructions on how to vote.
Brokers will provide instructions to beneficial owners on how to direct the
broker to vote the shares. All properly executed proxies that MessageMedia
receives prior to the vote at the special stockholders' meeting and that are not
revoked will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on the
proxies or, if no direction is indicated, to adopt the amended merger agreement.
MessageMedia's board of directors does not currently intend to bring any other
business before the special stockholders' meeting and MessageMedia's board of
directors currently is not aware of any other matters to be brought before the
special stockholders' meeting. If other business properly comes before the
special stockholders' meeting, the proxies will be voted in accordance with the
judgment of the proxyholders.

    A stockholder may revoke his or her proxy at any time prior to its use:

     by delivering to the Secretary of MessageMedia a signed notice of
     revocation or a later-dated, signed proxy; or

     by attending the special stockholders' meeting and voting in person.

    Attendance at the special stockholders' meeting does not in itself
constitute the revocation of a proxy.

VOTE REQUIRED

    As of the close of business on [            ], 2001, there were [        ]
shares of MessageMedia common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. The
approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of MessageMedia
common stock outstanding as of this date is required to adopt the amended merger
agreement. MessageMedia stockholders have one vote per share of MessageMedia
common stock owned on the record date.

    As of [            ], 2001, directors and executive officers of MessageMedia
and their affiliates beneficially owned an aggregate of [        ] shares of
MessageMedia common stock (exclusive of any shares issuable upon the exercise of
options or warrants), or approximately [  ]% of the shares of MessageMedia
common stock outstanding on such date. Pursuant to stockholder agreements in the
form attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix B [(and stockholder
letters in the form attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as
Appendix B-1)], MessageMedia stockholders have agreed to vote 25,661,381 shares
of MessageMedia common stock (or approximately [37.4]% of MessageMedia's common
stock outstanding as of [            ], 2001) for adoption of the amended merger
agreement. As of [            ], 2001, directors and executive officers of
DoubleClick did not own any shares of MessageMedia common stock. See 'The
Merger -- Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger.'

QUORUM; ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES

    The required quorum for the transaction of business at the MessageMedia
special stockholders' meeting is a majority of the shares of MessageMedia common
stock issued and outstanding on the record date. Abstentions and broker
non-votes each will be included in determining the number of shares present at
the meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. Because
adoption of the amended merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the outstanding shares of MessageMedia common stock entitled to
vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes
against adoption of the amended merger agreement. In addition, the failure of a
MessageMedia stockholder to return a proxy or otherwise vote will have the
effect of a vote against adoption of the amended merger agreement. Brokers
holding shares for beneficial owners cannot vote on the actions proposed in this
proxy statement/prospectus without the owners' specific instructions.
Accordingly, MessageMedia stockholders are urged to return the enclosed proxy
card marked to indicate their vote.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES AND EXPENSES

    In addition to solicitation by mail, the directors, officers and employees
of MessageMedia may solicit proxies from MessageMedia's stockholders by
telephone, facsimile or in person. No additional compensation will be paid to
directors, officers or employees of MessageMedia for any solicitations.
Brokerage houses, nominees, fiduciaries and other custodians will be requested
to forward soliciting materials to beneficial owners and will be reimbursed for
their reasonable expenses incurred in sending proxy materials to beneficial
owners. The expenses of soliciting proxies, including expenses related to the
printing and mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus, are being shared
equally by DoubleClick and MessageMedia.

                                   THE MERGER

    This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes material aspects of
the proposed merger. While we believe that the description covers the material
terms of the merger and the related transactions, this summary may not contain
all of the information that is important to you. MessageMedia stockholders
should read the entire amended merger agreement and the other documents we refer
to carefully and in their entirety for a more complete understanding of the
merger.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

    During the first week of January 2001, Court Cunningham, DoubleClick's Vice
President and General Manager of DARTMail Technology, called A. Laurence Jones,
MessageMedia's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mary Beth Loesch,
MessageMedia's Senior Vice President Corporate Development, to set up a meeting
on January 8, 2001 to discuss ways in which DoubleClick and MessageMedia could
potentially work together. At this meeting, Mr. Cunningham provided a high level
overview of DoubleClick's strategy in email marketing.

    On January 18, 2001, Mr. Cunningham and David Rosenblatt, DoubleClick's
President of Technology, Data and Research, called Mr. Jones and Ms. Loesch to
express DoubleClick's interest in continuing discussions with MessageMedia.

    On February 6, 2001, during a regularly scheduled meeting of the
MessageMedia board of directors, the board discussed strategic options for
MessageMedia, including a business combination with DoubleClick. After the
meeting, Gerald Poch, Co-Chairman of the MessageMedia board of directors, called
Kevin Ryan, DoubleClick's Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Jones called Mr.
Cunningham. The parties agreed to schedule a subsequent meeting with several
senior executives of each company.

    On February 21, 2001, Messrs. Ryan, Rosenblatt and Cunningham, Jeffrey
Epstein, Executive Vice President of DoubleClick, Jonathan Shapiro,
DoubleClick's Senior Vice President of Strategy, Jennifer Haggerty, Director of
Corporate Development at DoubleClick and Steven Cohn, an analyst in the
Corporate Development group of DoubleClick, met at DoubleClick's New York
offices with Messrs. Poch and Jones and Ms. Loesch to discuss the operations and
business strategies of MessageMedia and DoubleClick.

    Based on the previous day's discussions, on February 22, 2001, Mses.
Haggerty and Loesch executed a mutual confidentiality agreement on behalf of
DoubleClick and MessageMedia.

    On March 16, 2001, Ms. Haggerty discussed the preliminary terms of a
potential acquisition of MessageMedia with Mr. Poch and separately with Ms.
Loesch.

    On March 20, 2001, Mr. Cunningham and Scott Knoll, DoubleClick's Vice
President of Operations, Global TechSolutions, met at MessageMedia's offices in
Louisville, Colorado with Mr. Jones, Ms. Loesch and Prabhuling Patel,
MessageMedia's Senior Vice President and General Manager of Online Marketing and
Communications. At this meeting, Mr. Cunningham and Mr. Knoll learned more about
MessageMedia's products and services.

    On March 23, 2001, Jeremy Palley, an associate in the Corporate Development
group of DoubleClick, called Ms. Loesch and made a verbal non-binding offer for
DoubleClick to acquire MessageMedia in a stock-for-stock exchange. Following
this discussion, Ms. Haggerty submitted a non-binding indication of interest and
term sheet to Ms. Loesch.

    On March 27, 2001, the MessageMedia board of directors met to discuss a
potential combination with DoubleClick. Between March 27 and March 30, 2001, a
series of telephone conversations took place between senior representatives of
DoubleClick and MessageMedia to discuss the terms of a potential business
combination. On March 30, 2001, MessageMedia and DoubleClick determined that the
stage of their discussions justified commencing mutual due diligence and the
negotiation of definitive documentation, all subject to the approval of each
company's board of directors. On March 30, 2001, MessageMedia entered into a
limited duration exclusivity agreement with DoubleClick.

    On April 2 and April 3, 2001, a team from DoubleClick and attorneys from
Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP, DoubleClick's legal counsel, met with
representatives from MessageMedia and with

attorneys from Cooley Godward LLP, MessageMedia's legal counsel, at the offices
of Cooley Godward in Broomfield, Colorado. The purpose of these meetings was to
conduct business, financial and legal due diligence.

    On April 5, 2001, Mr. Ryan telephoned Mr. Jones, and Ms. Haggerty telephoned
Ms. Loesch, to inform them that DoubleClick was not interested in pursuing a
business combination with MessageMedia based on then current business
conditions, and the parties terminated the exclusivity agreement. On April 11,
2001, Ms. Haggerty confirmed with Ms. Loesch that DoubleClick was not interested
in pursuing a transaction with MessageMedia.

    On April 12, 2001, the MessageMedia board of directors met during a
regularly scheduled meeting and engaged Stephens Inc. to act as MessageMedia's
financial advisor, including advising the board as to financial and strategic
alternatives. In late April 2001, Stephens solicited indications of interest for
the acquisition of MessageMedia and received indications of interest from a
number of parties. On May 2, 2001, MessageMedia received a call from an
enterprise web solutions company's financial advisor expressing such company's
interest in acquiring MessageMedia. MessageMedia executives and their financial
advisors met with this company and its financial advisors on May 11, 2001 at
MessageMedia's offices in Louisville, Colorado. On May 15, 2001, MessageMedia
executives and their financial advisors again met with this company to discuss
terms of a potential business combination.

    On May 16, 2001, the MessageMedia board of directors met to discuss the
proposed transaction with the enterprise web solutions company and the status
of other firms that had expressed an interest in acquiring MessageMedia to
Stephens during its marketing process. The discussion focused on the strategic
fit of the potential acquirers, such as cross-selling opportunities, the
strength of the potential acquirers' financial condition, the ability to
increase the scale and scope of the operations of the combined entity and
efficiencies that could be achieved through a combination. The board of
directors authorized Mr. Jones to continue discussions with the enterprise web
solutions company and also to contact DoubleClick before entering into an
exclusive arrangement with the enterprise web solutions company.

    Following the May 16, 2001 MessageMedia board meeting, Mr. Jones placed
calls to Messrs. Ryan and Epstein at DoubleClick to determine whether
DoubleClick would be interested in acquiring MessageMedia. On May 17, 2001, Mr.
Jones, Ms. Loesch, William Buchholz, MessageMedia's Senior Vice President,
Finance and Administration, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, and Pat
Hayes, MessageMedia's Director Financial Planning, had a telephone conference
call with Mr. Cunningham and William Mills, DoubleClick's Vice President of
Corporate Development, to provide an update on the MessageMedia business.

    On May 18, 2001, Ms. Haggerty and Mr. Cunningham called Ms. Loesch to
further discuss the update on the MessageMedia business and the potential terms
of a business combination. Ms. Haggerty then delivered a non-binding term sheet
to Ms. Loesch which reflected the terms discussed. Over the next few days,
representatives from DoubleClick and MessageMedia held a series of telephone
conversations to discuss the potential terms of a business combination.

    On May 21, 2001, Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison delivered an initial draft of
the merger agreement to MessageMedia and Cooley Godward. That same day,
representatives of DoubleClick, Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison, Cooley Godward and
MessageMedia resumed business, financial and legal due diligence of MessageMedia
and DoubleClick at the Broomfield, Colorado offices of Cooley Godward. The due
diligence inspections included numerous discussions between senior management of
both companies regarding various business, financial, operational and technical
issues involved in combining the companies.

    On May 24, 2001, Messrs. Ryan, Epstein, Rosenblatt and Cunningham, Ms.
Haggerty, Elizabeth Wang, Vice President and General Counsel of DoubleClick,
Bruce Dalziel, Vice President of Finance and Operations, Tech, Data and Research
at DoubleClick and Benjamin Naftalis, an analyst in the Corporate Development
group of DoubleClick, discussed the proposed transaction at a meeting of
DoubleClick's board of directors. DoubleClick's board engaged in a full
discussion of the terms of the proposed merger, including the strategic benefits
of the combination, financial and legal analyses, the terms and conditions of
the proposed merger agreement and the analyses and opinion of DoubleClick's

management. Following the discussion, the DoubleClick board of directors
approved the terms of the merger, including the issuance of DoubleClick common
stock in the merger, and authorized management to continue to negotiate the
final terms of the merger agreement and related agreements. That same day,
MessageMedia's management determined that a combination with DoubleClick
represented the most attractive strategic alternative then available to
MessageMedia, and DoubleClick and MessageMedia entered into a second limited
duration exclusivity agreement. Representatives of DoubleClick and
MessageMedia then began to negotiate the merger agreement. These discussions
continued that week and throughout the next week.

    Beginning May 30, 2001, the parties convened at the Broomfield, Colorado
offices of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison to finalize the documentation of the
merger.

    On May 30, 2001, the MessageMedia board of directors held a special meeting
to discuss the proposed business combination. Attorneys from Cooley Godward
reviewed the principal terms of the merger agreement and the related agreements
with the board. MessageMedia's management, legal counsel and financial advisors
reported on the results of their due diligence reviews of DoubleClick. Stephens
then made a presentation to the MessageMedia board of directors regarding the
financial analyses it performed in connection with its opinion and stated orally
that Stephens was prepared to render a written opinion to the effect that, based
on the assumptions made, matters considered and limits of its review set forth
in its opinion, the share exchange ratio in the merger was fair to
MessageMedia's disinterested stockholders from a financial point of view.
Following a discussion, the MessageMedia board of directors stated that it was
prepared to approve the final terms of the merger agreement and related
agreements, subject to the resolution of several transaction issues. The meeting
was adjourned until May 31, 2001.

    On May 31, 2001, the MessageMedia board of directors (with Messrs. Diamond
and Duryea absent) reconvened the special meeting begun on May 30, 2001, and
MessageMedia's management, legal counsel and financial advisors updated the
MessageMedia board of directors on negotiations and related transaction issues.
Following the discussion, all members of the MessageMedia board of directors who
were present at the special meeting approved the terms of the merger agreement
and related agreements. All of MessageMedia's directors subsequently approved
the terms of the merger agreement in a unanimous written consent.

    On June 1, 2001, the merger agreement was signed and DoubleClick and
MessageMedia jointly announced the agreement to merge.

    DoubleClick subsequently decided to exercise its right, contained in
the merger agreement, to change the method of effecting the business combination
between DoubleClick and MessageMedia in order to minimize the risk of the merger
not qualifying as a tax-deferred 'reorganization' for United States federal
income tax purposes, as the parties originally intended. After discussions,
DoubleClick and MessageMedia determined that it would be advisable and in the
best interests of their respective companies and stockholders to merge
MessageMedia with and into DoubleClick, instead of merging Atlas Acquisition
Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of DoubleClick, with and into MessageMedia. On
June 26, 2001, DoubleClick, MessageMedia and Atlas Acquisition Corp. signed an
amendment to the merger agreement to reflect the change in structure.

DOUBLECLICK'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

    The DoubleClick board of directors unanimously determined that the merger is
fair to, and in the best interest of, DoubleClick and its stockholders.

    This determination was based on several potential benefits of the merger
that the DoubleClick board believes will contribute to DoubleClick's success,
including:

     the ability to enhance DoubleClick's email technology business by making
     more innovative products available to more customers;

     the ability of DoubleClick to sell MessageMedia's products and services
     through DoubleClick's substantially larger sales network and large customer
     base, and to sell its own products and services to MessageMedia's
     customers;

     the quality and loyalty of MessageMedia's customer base;

     the perceived value of MessageMedia's business relative to the value of the
     merger consideration;

     MessageMedia's skilled workforce; and

     the ability of DoubleClick to enhance MessageMedia's products and services
     with added features and better meet the needs of MessageMedia's existing
     and future customer base.

    The DoubleClick board of directors reviewed a number of factors in
evaluating the merger, including, but not limited to, the following:

     information concerning DoubleClick's and MessageMedia's respective
     businesses, customers, prospects, strategic business plans, financial
     performance and condition, results of operations, technology positions,
     management and competitive positions;

     the due diligence investigation of MessageMedia conducted by DoubleClick's
     management and legal advisors;

     DoubleClick management's view of the positive results of combining the
     operations and businesses of DoubleClick and MessageMedia;

     the current financial market conditions and historical stock market prices,
     volatility and trading information of MessageMedia and DoubleClick; and

     the impact of the merger on DoubleClick's customers and employees.

    During the course of its deliberations concerning the merger, the
DoubleClick board also identified and considered a variety of potentially
negative factors that could materialize as a result of the merger, including the
following:

     the risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger might not be
     realized;

     the possibility that the merger might not be completed;

     risks related to retaining key MessageMedia employees;

     risks related to retaining key MessageMedia customers;

     the effect of the public announcement of the merger on MessageMedia's
     business, including its employees and customers; and

     the uncertainty concerning the liabilities of MessageMedia
     Europe, B.V.

    The DoubleClick board of directors concluded that these factors were
outweighed by the potential benefits to be gained by the merger. In view of the
wide variety of factors, both positive and negative, considered by the
DoubleClick board of directors, the directors did not find it practical to, and
did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors
discussed above.

MESSAGEMEDIA'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER; UNANIMOUS RECOMMENDATION OF
MESSAGEMEDIA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER

    The MessageMedia board of directors determined to enter into the merger
agreement and to recommend that MessageMedia stockholders approve the merger
agreement in pursuit of MessageMedia's strategy to join with a company with a
strong commitment to the email marketing business.

    The decision of the MessageMedia board of directors was the result of its
careful consideration of a range of strategic alternatives, including potential
business combinations with DoubleClick and other companies, in the pursuit of
its long-term business strategy.

    The MessageMedia board of directors' primary consideration was to identify
and secure the alternative that would provide the best strategic fit for
MessageMedia and to provide long-term stockholder value to MessageMedia
stockholders. In this regard, the MessageMedia board of directors concluded that
a combination with DoubleClick represents the best transaction among other

alternatives considered by the MessageMedia board of directors. In reaching this
determination, the MessageMedia board of directors considered the following
factors:

     the price per share implied by the exchange ratio in the merger, based on
     DoubleClick's 10-day average closing stock price ending May 31, 2001, which
     the MessageMedia board of directors determined represents: (A) a premium of
     40% over the closing price of MessageMedia common stock as of the last
     trading day prior to the announcement of the merger and (B) a premium of
     42% over the average closing price of MessageMedia common stock in the 10
     trading days prior to the announcement of the merger;

     the exchange ratio in the merger and the implied per share price, which
     compares favorably according to a number of applicable valuation
     methodologies, including the analysis of companies comparable to
     MessageMedia and transactions comparable to the merger used by Stephens in
     connection with providing its fairness opinion to the MessageMedia board of
     directors; and

     the opinion of Stephens delivered in writing on May 31, 2001, that as of
     May 31, 2001, and subject to assumptions made, matters considered and
     limitations on the review set forth in its opinion, the share exchange
     ratio in the merger is fair to MessageMedia's disinterested stockholders
     from a financial point of view. Please see ' -- Opinion of MessageMedia's
     Financial Advisor.'

    The MessageMedia board of directors also believes that the merger will
provide the opportunity for the combined company to:

     sell MessageMedia's products and services through DoubleClick's
     substantially larger sales network and large customer base, and sell
     DoubleClick's products and services to MessageMedia's customers;

     increase the scale and scope of the messaging business of the combined
     company; and

     achieve certain cost synergies and economies of scope and scale by
     eliminating duplicative costs.

    In reviewing its alternatives and making its determination to approve the
merger, the MessageMedia board of directors reviewed:

     the results of the due diligence review by MessageMedia's management, legal
     advisors and financial advisors regarding DoubleClick's business,
     operations, technology and financial and competitive position;

     the financial strength of DoubleClick;

     the expected notice from The Nasdaq National Market as to the delisting of
     MessageMedia's common stock;

     possible expansion opportunities for the combined company and the ability
     for the combined company to realize cost-reduction opportunities;

     the current and prospective business environment in which MessageMedia
     operates; and

     the competitive environment.

    The MessageMedia board of directors also reviewed with its legal advisors:

     the terms and conditions of the merger agreement;

     the terms and conditions of the stockholder agreements;

     the events triggering payment of the termination fee; and

     the limitations on the ability of MessageMedia to negotiate with other
     companies regarding an alternative transaction and the potential effect
     these provisions would have on MessageMedia receiving alternative proposals
     that could be superior to the merger with DoubleClick.

    The MessageMedia board of directors also considered a number of potentially
negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger, including:

     the risk that, because the exchange ratio will not be adjusted for changes
     in the market price of either DoubleClick common stock or MessageMedia
     common stock, the per share value of the

     consideration to be received by MessageMedia stockholders might be
     significantly less than the price per share implied by the exchange ratio
     immediately prior to the announcement of the merger;

     the risk that the merger might not be consummated;

     the potential loss of revenues and business opportunities by MessageMedia
     caused by the announcement of the merger;

     the possibility of management disruption associated with the merger and
     integrating the operations of the companies and the risk that, despite the
     efforts of the combined company, the services of key management and
     technical personnel of MessageMedia might not continue with the combined
     company;

     the risk that the benefits sought to be achieved by the merger will not be
     realized; and

     other applicable risks described in this proxy statement/prospectus under
     'Risk Factors.'

    The MessageMedia board of directors did not quantify or otherwise assign
relative weights to the specific factors discussed above. After carefully
evaluating these factors, both positive and negative, the MessageMedia board of
directors determined that the merger is in the best interests of MessageMedia
and its stockholders and unanimously recommends that MessageMedia stockholders
vote for approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the
merger.

    In considering the recommendation of the MessageMedia board of directors
with respect to the amended merger agreement, MessageMedia stockholders should
be aware that MessageMedia's directors and officers have interests in the merger
that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of MessageMedia
stockholders generally. Please see ' -- Interests of Certain Persons in the
Merger.'

OPINION OF MESSAGEMEDIA'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

    The MessageMedia board of directors retained Stephens Inc. to advise it
with respect to financial and strategic alternatives. The management of
MessageMedia recommended Stephens to its board of directors after interviewing
three candidates to be its financial advisor. Stephens was selected based on
its in-depth knowledge of the industry in which MessageMedia operates and
relationship with potential buyers.

    Stephens delivered a written opinion, dated May 31, 2001, to the
MessageMedia board of directors to the effect that, as of such date and subject
to the qualifications set forth therein, the consideration to be received by
disinterested MessageMedia stockholders in the merger was fair from a
financial point of view to them. A 'disinterested stockholder' is a holder
of MessageMedia's common stock other than a director, officer or employee of
MessageMedia, or any holder of ten percent or more of the outstanding shares
of MessageMedia common stock (assuming the exercise of convertible securities
beneficially owned by the holder).

    No limitations were imposed by MessageMedia's board of directors on Stephens
with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in
furnishing its opinion. The exchange ratio was determined through negotiations
between the management of DoubleClick and MessageMedia. Although Stephens did
assist the management of MessageMedia in these negotiations, it was not asked by
MessageMedia to propose or recommend, and did not propose or recommend, any
specific exchange ratio as the appropriate exchange ratio for the merger.

    The full text of the fairness opinion of Stephens, dated May 31, 2001, which
sets forth the assumptions made, general procedures followed, factors considered
and limitations on the review undertaken by Stephens in rendering its opinion,
is attached as Appendix C to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated
herein by reference. You should read this opinion in its entirety.

    Stephens has consented to the use of its fairness opinion as an appendix to
this proxy statement/prospectus. Stephens provided the fairness opinion to the
board of directors of MessageMedia for its information and the fairness opinion
is directed only to the fairness from a

financial point of view of the offer price and does not constitute a
recommendation to any stockholder of MessageMedia as to how any stockholder
should vote on the merger or any matter related thereto. The summary of the
fairness opinion set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the full text of the fairness opinion.

    In arriving at the fairness opinion, Stephens:

     analyzed certain publicly available financial statements and reports
     regarding MessageMedia;

     analyzed certain internal financial statements and other financial and
     operating data (including financial projections for the year ended
     December 31, 2001) concerning MessageMedia prepared by management of
     MessageMedia;

     analyzed, on a pro forma basis, the effect of the merger;

     reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for shares of common
     stock of MessageMedia and DoubleClick;

     compared the financial performance of MessageMedia and DoubleClick and the
     prices and trading activity of shares of common stock of MessageMedia and
     DoubleClick with that of certain other comparable publicly-traded companies
     and their securities;

     reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other
     mergers that Stephens deemed to be relevant;

     reviewed the merger agreement and related documents;

     discussed with management of MessageMedia the operations of, and future
     business prospects for, MessageMedia and the anticipated financial
     consequences of the merger to MessageMedia;

     assisted in deliberations regarding the material terms of the merger and
     the negotiations with DoubleClick; and

     performed other analyses and investigations and took into account other
     matters that Stephens deemed appropriate.

    In preparing the fairness opinion, Stephens assumed and relied on the
accuracy and completeness of all information supplied or reviewed by it in
connection with its analysis of the merger and has further relied on the
assurances of management of MessageMedia that they are not aware of any facts
that would make this information inaccurate or misleading. Stephens has not
assumed any responsibility for independently verifying this information and has
not undertaken an independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or
liabilities of MessageMedia or DoubleClick or been furnished with any evaluation
or appraisal, nor conducted a physical inspection of the properties or
facilities of MessageMedia or DoubleClick. With respect to the financial
projections furnished to, or discussed with, Stephens by MessageMedia, Stephens
assumed that the financial projections were reasonably prepared and reflected
the best currently available estimates and judgment as to the expected future
financial performance of MessageMedia. Stephens expressed no opinion as to these
financial projections or the assumptions on which they were based.

    For purposes of rendering the fairness opinion, Stephens assumed, in all
respects material to its analysis, that the representations and warranties of
each party to the merger agreement and all related documents and instruments
contained therein were true and correct, that each party to these documents
would perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by
each party under these documents and that all conditions to the consummation of
the merger would be satisfied without waiver thereof. Stephens assumed that in
the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or other consents or approvals
(contractual or otherwise) for the merger, no restrictions, including any
divestiture requirements or amendments or modification, would be imposed that
would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the merger.

    Stephens was not asked to consider, and the fairness opinion does not in any
manner address, the price at which MessageMedia or DoubleClick would trade
following either the announcement or consummation of the merger. The fairness
opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions as they
existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of the opinion.

    When Stephens delivered its written fairness opinion, it took into account
that the number of shares of DoubleClick common stock to be received in
exchange for each outstanding share of MessageMedia common stock, plus the
amount of assumed debt of MessageMedia less the amount of assumed cash of
MessageMedia is approximately $42.4 million, representing 1.3x and 1.2x
MessageMedia's revenues for the calendar year 2000 and projected calendar
year 2001, respectively.

    The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by
Stephens in connection with the preparation of its fairness opinion dated May
31, 2001.

    Stock Price History. To provide contextual data and comparative market data,
Stephens examined the history of the trading prices for both MessageMedia common
stock and DoubleClick common stock for the one-year period ending May 25, 2001.
Stephens reviewed the daily closing prices of MessageMedia common stock and
compared the performance of the price of MessageMedia common stock to that of
the NASDAQ Composite Index and an index of the share prices of five selected
publicly traded companies that Stephens believed to be appropriate for
comparison to corresponding financial information and operating data of
MessageMedia, specifically, ClickAction, Inc., Digital Impact, Inc., DoubleClick
Inc., Engage Inc. and Kana Communications, Inc. (collectively, the 'Public
Comparables'). Stephens also reviewed the daily closing prices of DoubleClick
common stock and compared the performance of the price of DoubleClick common
stock to that of the NASDAQ Composite Index and an index of the share prices of
six publicly traded comparable companies, specifically, AvenueA, Inc., Engage
Inc., L90 Inc., Mediaplex, 24/7 Media, Inc. and ValueClick, Inc. This
information was presented solely to provide the board of directors of
MessageMedia with background information regarding the prices of MessageMedia
common stock and DoubleClick common stock over the periods indicated.

    Publicly Traded Company Analysis. Stephens analyzed certain publicly
available financial information, operating data and projected financial
performance (per research analyst estimates) of the Public Comparables.
Stephens' analysis yielded ratios of market value of common equity plus total
outstanding debt less total outstanding cash ('Enterprise Value') to the
calendar 2000 revenues ranging from 0.3x to 2.9x, with a median of 1.0x, and
Enterprise Value to projected calendar 2001 revenues ranging from 0.1x to 3.2x,
with a median of 0.6x.

    Stephens derived a range of implied trading values of MessageMedia common
stock of $0.30 to $0.60 based on a ratio of Enterprise Value to 2000 calendar
revenues, which implies an exchange ratio range of .0212 to .0424 and a range of
$0.25 to $0.51 per share based on a ratio of Enterprise Value to projected 2001
calendar revenues, which implies an exchange ratio range of .0177 to .0360.

    Precedent Transaction Analysis. Stephens analyzed the financial terms, to
the extent publicly available, of two transactions comparable to that of the
proposed DoubleClick and MessageMedia combination, which were announced since
December 26, 2000. The selected transactions were Chordiant Software, Inc.'s
acquisition of Prime Response, Inc. and SEAT Pagine Gialle SpA's acquisition of
NetCreations, Inc. (collectively, the 'Transaction Comparables'). Stephens'
analysis of the Transaction Comparables yielded ratios of Enterprise Value to
the latest twelve month ('LTM') revenues of 0.4x and 1.4x and Enterprise Value
to projected next twelve month ('NTM') revenues of 0.2x.

    Stephens derived a range of implied value of MessageMedia common stock of
$0.22 to $0.88 based on a ratio of Enterprise Value to LTM revenues, which
implies an exchange ratio range of .0155 to .0622, and a range of $0.10 to $0.65
per share based on a ratio of Enterprise Value to NTM revenues, which implies an
exchange ratio range of .0071 to .0459.

    Offer Premium Analysis. Stephens compared the offer prices, to the extent
publicly available, of transactions publicly announced from May 22, 2000 to
May 22, 2001, with a transaction size ranging from $25 million to $100 million
to the closing prices one-day, one-week and one-month prior to the announcement
of the respective transaction. Stephens' analysis of the offer premiums yielded
a median range of 28% to 36%. Stephens derived a range of implied value of
MessageMedia common stock of $.50 to $0.59 using an offer premium range of 20%
to 40%, which implies an exchange ratio range of .0353 to .0417.

    The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of
the analyses performed by Stephens but describes, in summary form, the principal
elements of the presentation

made by Stephens to the MessageMedia board of directors on May 30, 2001. The
preparation of a fairness opinion involves various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore,
such an opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. Each of the
analyses conducted by Stephens was carried out in order to provide a different
perspective on the transaction and to add to the total mix of information
available. Stephens did not form a conclusion as to whether any individual
analysis, considered in isolation, supported or failed to support an opinion as
to the fairness of the merger from a financial point of view. Rather, in
reaching its conclusion, Stephens considered the results of the analyses in
light of each other and ultimately reached its opinion based on the analyses
taken as a whole. Accordingly, notwithstanding the separate factors summarized
above, Stephens has indicated to MessageMedia that it believes that
consideration of some of the analyses and factors considered, without
considering all analyses and factors, could create an incomplete or inaccurate
view of the evaluation process underlying the opinion. The analyses performed by
Stephens are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such
analyses.

    Fees. Stephens will receive a fee for its services to MessageMedia. Pursuant
to a letter agreement between MessageMedia and Stephens, MessageMedia agreed to
pay Stephens, upon the rendering of a fairness opinion, a fee of $150,000 for
such services. In addition, MessageMedia engaged Stephens as its financial
advisor in connection with the proposed transaction and has agreed, if the
merger is consummated, to pay Stephens additional compensation (reduced by the
$150,000 fee paid for the fairness opinion) for such services to be calculated
based on the transaction value of the proposed merger. It is estimated that the
aggregate fee will be no more than $750,000. Stephens will also be reimbursed
for its out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses for its
legal counsel up to $25,000 in the aggregate. In addition, MessageMedia has
agreed to indemnify Stephens for certain liabilities related to or arising out
of the engagement.

    As part of Stephens' investment banking business, it regularly issues
fairness opinions and is continually engaged in the valuation of companies and
their securities in connection with business reorganizations, private
placements, negotiated underwritings, mergers and acquisitions and valuations
for estate, corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of business,
Stephens and its affiliates at any time may hold long or short positions and may
trade or otherwise effect transactions as principal or for the accounts of
customers, in debt or equity securities or options on securities of MessageMedia
and DoubleClick.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

    In considering the recommendation of the MessageMedia board of directors,
MessageMedia stockholders should be aware that certain officers and directors of
MessageMedia have interests in the merger that differ from, or are in addition
to, those of MessageMedia stockholders generally. The MessageMedia board was
aware of these potential conflicts and considered them.

    As of [            ], 2001, the officers and directors of MessageMedia owned
stock options to purchase an aggregate of [5,408,417] shares of MessageMedia
common stock, at exercise prices ranging from $[14.875] to $[0.030] per share,
[3,584,154] of which were not vested. If the merger is completed, all
[1,406,250] of the stock options unvested as of [         ], 2001 owned by
MessageMedia's President and Chief Executive Officer will automatically become
vested and exercisable. The vesting schedules for the remaining unvested options
do not accelerate upon consummation of the merger because they will be assumed
by DoubleClick. However, pursuant to change of control agreements recently
entered into between MessageMedia and certain of its other officers and key
employees, each such person would be entitled to 12 months of accelerated
vesting of the options to purchase shares of MessageMedia common stock owned
by such person if the merger closes and such person is involuntarily terminated
or voluntarily terminates his or her employment for a permitted reason within
one month before or 12 months after the closing of the merger. The vesting of
the remaining [2,334,065] stock options held by these officers and key
employees unvested as of [         ], 2001 may be accelerated pursuant to
these change of control agreements.

    MessageMedia officers have agreements, including the change of control
agreements described above, pursuant to which, if such officers are
involuntarily terminated or if they terminate their employment for a permitted
reason, such officers would receive benefits including severance payments.

    MessageMedia may grant transaction bonuses to certain employees (including
MessageMedia officers) involved in effectuating the merger, in an amount not to
exceed $200,000 in the aggregate.

    MessageMedia's President and Chief Executive Officer owes $200,000 to
MessageMedia, which amount the MessageMedia board of directors has agreed to
forgive if the merger is consummated.

    Because the number of shares of DoubleClick common stock outstanding is
significantly larger than the number of shares of MessageMedia common stock
outstanding, affiliates of MessageMedia, including its officers and directors,
who receive shares of DoubleClick common stock in the merger may be allowed to
sell or transfer a greater number of shares in a single transaction than would
be possible prior to the merger pursuant to the volume restrictions of Rule 144
of the Securities Act.

    The amended merger agreement provides that, from and after the effective
time, DoubleClick will indemnify and provide advancement of expenses to each
person who is or was a director or officer of MessageMedia or any of its
subsidiaries at or at any time prior to the effective time of the merger, to the
same extent such persons are indemnified or have the right to the advancement of
expenses as of the date of the merger agreement by MessageMedia pursuant to
MessageMedia's certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date
of the merger agreement. DoubleClick will also fulfill the obligations of
MessageMedia pursuant to any indemnification agreements between MessageMedia and
any of the indemnified parties in effect immediately prior to the date of the
merger agreement. In addition, the amended merger agreement provides that for a
period of six years after the effective time, DoubleClick will pay up to 150% of
the $310,000 annual premium currently paid by MessageMedia to maintain
directors' and officers' liability insurance covering persons who are covered by
MessageMedia's directors' and officers' insurance policy. See 'The Amended
Merger Agreement and Related Agreements -- Director and Officer Indemnification
and Insurance.'

REGULATORY MATTERS

    Currently, neither DoubleClick nor MessageMedia is required to file any
information with the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice under the provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in connection with the merger and the
transactions contemplated by the amended merger agreement.

    DoubleClick and MessageMedia are not aware of any other governmental
approvals or actions that are required to complete the merger other than
compliance with applicable corporate law of Delaware. Should any approval or
action be required, DoubleClick and MessageMedia currently plan to seek the
approval or take any necessary action. Failure to obtain the approval or take
any necessary action is not anticipated to have a material effect on the merger.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

    Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison, counsel to DoubleClick, and Cooley Godward,
counsel to MessageMedia, are of the opinion that the following discussion
accurately describes the material federal income tax considerations generally
applicable to MessageMedia stockholders in connection with the exchange of
shares of MessageMedia common stock for DoubleClick common stock pursuant to the
amended merger agreement. This discussion is based on currently existing
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, existing and proposed United States
Treasury Regulations thereunder and current administrative rulings and court
decisions, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.
Any such change could alter the tax consequences to MessageMedia stockholders as
described herein.

    MessageMedia stockholders should be aware that this discussion does not deal
with all federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to particular
MessageMedia stockholders in light of their particular circumstances, such as
stockholders who:

     are financial institutions, dealers in securities, tax-exempt organizations
     or insurance companies;

     are foreign persons;

     hold MessageMedia common stock which constitutes qualified small business
     stock for purposes of Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code;

     do not hold their MessageMedia common stock as capital assets;

     acquired their shares in connection with stock option or stock purchase
     plans or in other compensatory transactions; or

     acquired their shares as part of an integrated investment such as a hedge,
     straddle, constructive sale, conversion transaction or other risk reduction
     transaction.

    In addition, the following discussion does not address the tax consequences
of the merger under foreign, state or local tax laws, the tax consequences of
transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to, or concurrently with, the
merger (whether or not any such transactions are undertaken in connection with
the merger), including any transaction in which shares of MessageMedia common
stock are acquired or shares of DoubleClick common stock are disposed of, or the
tax consequences of the assumption by DoubleClick of MessageMedia stock options.

    ACCORDINGLY, MESSAGEMEDIA STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX
ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING
THE APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES.

    It is a condition to the consummation of the merger that DoubleClick and
MessageMedia receive the opinions of their respective counsel, Brobeck, Phleger
& Harrison and Cooley Godward, that the merger will constitute a
'reorganization' under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. These
opinions will be rendered on the basis of certain facts, representations and
assumptions set forth or referred to in the opinions, including representations
contained in certificates of officers of DoubleClick and MessageMedia. These
opinions of counsel will neither bind the Internal Revenue Service or the courts
nor preclude the Internal Revenue Service from successfully arguing a contrary
position in court. No ruling has been, or will be, sought from the Internal
Revenue Service as to the United States federal income tax consequences of the
merger.

    If the merger qualifies as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code, the merger will result in the following federal income
tax consequences to MessageMedia stockholders described above:

     a holder of MessageMedia common stock will not recognize gain or loss to
     the extent the holder receives DoubleClick common stock in exchange for
     their MessageMedia common stock (except to the extent of any cash received
     in lieu of fractional shares of DoubleClick common stock);

     a holder of MessageMedia common stock who receives cash in lieu of a
     fractional share of DoubleClick common stock will recognize capital gain or
     loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash
     received and the holder's tax basis allocable to the fractional share;

     the aggregate tax basis of the DoubleClick common stock received in the
     merger by a MessageMedia stockholder will be the same as the aggregate tax
     basis of the MessageMedia common stock surrendered in exchange for that
     DoubleClick common stock reduced by any tax basis allocable to any
     fractional share interest for which cash is received; and

     the holding period of the DoubleClick common stock received in the merger
     by a MessageMedia stockholder will include the period during which the
     stockholder held the MessageMedia common stock surrendered in exchange for
     that DoubleClick common stock.

    A successful Internal Revenue Service challenge to the reorganization status
of the merger would result in MessageMedia stockholders recognizing taxable gain
or loss with respect to each share of MessageMedia common stock surrendered
equal to the difference between each stockholder's basis in such share and the
fair market value, as of the effective time of the merger, of the DoubleClick
common stock received in exchange therefor. In such event, a stockholder's
aggregate basis in the DoubleClick common stock so received would equal such
fair market value and the stockholder's holding period for such stock would
begin the day after the merger.

    There are other tax-related issues that you should be aware of such as:

     Reporting Requirements. Each MessageMedia stockholder that receives
     DoubleClick common stock in the merger will be required to file a statement
     with his or her federal income tax return

     providing his or her basis in the MessageMedia stock surrendered and the
     fair market value of the DoubleClick common stock and any cash received in
     the merger and to retain permanent records of these-facts relating to the
     merger.

     Backup Withholding. Unless an exemption applies under applicable law and
     regulations, the exchange agent is required to withhold, and will withhold,
     31% of any cash payments to a MessageMedia stockholder in the merger unless
     the stockholder provides the appropriate form as described below.
     Therefore, each MessageMedia stockholder should complete and sign the
     Substitute Form W-9 included as part of the letter of transmittal to be
     sent to each MessageMedia stockholder, so as to provide the information,
     including the stockholder's taxpayer identification number and
     certification necessary to avoid backup withholding, unless an applicable
     exemption exists and is proved in a manner satisfactory to DoubleClick and
     the exchange agent.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

    DoubleClick will account for the merger under the purchase method of
accounting, which means that DoubleClick will allocate the purchase price to the
fair value of net tangible assets acquired and to intangible assets, which
includes goodwill. Based on a preliminary allocation of the purchase price,
DoubleClick expects to allocate approximately 30% of the purchase price to the
fair value of net tangible assets acquired and approximately 70% to the fair
value of intangible assets, including goodwill to be amortized by DoubleClick
over their estimated useful lives, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The ultimate allocation of the purchase price will depend
on the results of the fair value appraisals. Under the tentative conclusions on
the transition and effective date provisions reached by the Finanicial
Accounting Standard Board in its Exposure Draft, Business Combinations and
Intangible Assets -- Accounting for Goodwill, goodwill acquired in transactions
completed after June 30, 2001 will not be amortized. If this standard is adopted
as currently drafted, DoubleClick's operating results will not reflect any
goodwill amortization expense related to the merger, which is expected to be
completed during the third quarter of 2001.

NO DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

    Stockholders of MessageMedia are not entitled to exercise dissenters' or
appraisal rights as a result of the merger or to demand cash payment for their
shares under Delaware law.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF MESSAGEMEDIA'S COMMON STOCK FOLLOWING THE MERGER

    If the merger is completed, MessageMedia's common stock will be delisted
from The Nasdaq National Market, assuming MessageMedia's common stock is then
listed on such market, and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.

RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OF SHARES BY AFFILIATES

    The shares of DoubleClick common stock to be issued in connection with the
merger will be registered under the Securities Act and will be freely
transferable under the Securities Act, except for shares of DoubleClick common
stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an affiliate of DoubleClick or
MessageMedia under the Securities Act. Persons who may be deemed to be
affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by or
are under common control of DoubleClick or MessageMedia, as the case may be, and
may include some of the officers, directors or principal stockholders of
DoubleClick or MessageMedia. Affiliates may not sell their shares of DoubleClick
common stock acquired in connection with the merger except pursuant to:

     an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
     resale of those shares;

     an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or

     another applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

    DoubleClick's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this proxy
statement/prospectus forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of
DoubleClick common stock to be received by affiliates in the merger.

OPERATIONS FOLLOWING THE MERGER

    DoubleClick is currently formulating its plan for the integration of
the operations and personnel of MessageMedia into DoubleClick's existing
business. The current DoubleClick officers and directors will continue to
be the officers and directors of the combined company.

    The stockholders of MessageMedia will become stockholders of DoubleClick and
their rights as stockholders will be governed by DoubleClick's amended and
restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, DoubleClick's amended and
restated bylaws and the laws of the State of Delaware.

              THE AMENDED MERGER AGREEMENT AND RELATED AGREEMENTS

    The following is a brief summary of the material provisions of the merger
agreement, as amended by the amendment to the merger agreement, copies of which
are attached as Appendix A and Appendix A-1 to this proxy statement/prospectus
and incorporated herein by reference. We urge you to read the amended merger
agreement in its entirety for a more complete description of the merger. In the
event of any discrepancy between the terms of the amended merger agreement or
other agreements and the following summary, the amended merger agreement and
other agreements will control.

THE MERGER

    MessageMedia will merge with and into DoubleClick, following the adoption of
the amended merger agreement by the MessageMedia stockholders, and the
satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to the merger.

EFFECTIVE TIME

    At the time of the closing of the merger, the parties will cause the merger
to become effective by filing a certificate of merger with the Delaware
Secretary of State. DoubleClick and MessageMedia are working toward completing
the merger as soon as possible and expect to complete the merger during the
third quarter of 2001.

DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY AFTER THE MERGER

    The directors and officers of the combined company will be the current
directors and officers, respectively, of DoubleClick.

CONVERSION OF MESSAGEMEDIA SHARES IN THE MERGER

    At the effective time, each outstanding share of MessageMedia common stock
will automatically be converted into the right to receive 0.0436 of a share of
DoubleClick common stock.

    The number of shares of DoubleClick common stock issuable in the merger will
be proportionately adjusted as appropriate for any stock split, stock dividend
or similar event with respect to MessageMedia common stock or DoubleClick common
stock effected between the date of the merger agreement and the completion of
the merger. The exchange ratio will also be proportionately adjusted if the
number of outstanding shares of MessageMedia common stock (calculated in
accordance with the treasury method under United States generally accepted
accounting principles) is greater than the number set forth in the merger
agreement, except as otherwise permitted in the amended merger agreement, in
order to provide to DoubleClick and MessageMedia the same economic effect as
contemplated by the amended merger agreement prior to such increase.

NO FRACTIONAL SHARES

    No fractional shares of DoubleClick common stock will be issued in
connection with the merger. Instead you will receive an amount of cash, in lieu
of a fraction of a share of DoubleClick common stock, equal to the product of
such fraction (after taking into account all shares that you hold as of the
effective time of the merger) multiplied by the closing price of a share of
DoubleClick common stock on The Nasdaq National Market on the business day
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, rounded to the nearest
whole cent.

MESSAGEMEDIA STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

    At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase
shares of MessageMedia common stock and each outstanding warrant to purchase
shares of MessageMedia common stock will be assumed by DoubleClick. Each
MessageMedia stock option or warrant assumed by DoubleClick will

continue to have the same terms, and be subject to the same conditions, that
were applicable to the option or warrant immediately prior to the effective
time, except that:

     each MessageMedia stock option or warrant will be exercisable for shares of
     DoubleClick common stock, and the number of shares of DoubleClick common
     stock issuable upon exercise of any given option or warrant will be
     determined by multiplying the number of shares of MessageMedia common stock
     underlying such option or warrant by 0.0436, rounded down, if necessary, to
     the nearest whole share; and

     the per share exercise price of any given option or warrant will be
     determined by dividing the exercise price of the option or warrant
     immediately prior to the effective time by 0.0436, rounded up, if
     necessary, to the nearest whole cent.

    Adjustments with respect to any options that are 'incentive stock options'
(as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) will be effected in a manner
consistent with the requirements of that code.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

    Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding
purchase right pursuant to MessageMedia's employee stock purchase plan will be
exercised to purchase MessageMedia common stock at the price per share and in
accordance with the terms set forth in the employee stock purchase plan, and
each share of MessageMedia common stock so purchased will be considered issued
and outstanding and will be converted into the right to receive 0.0436 of a
share of DoubleClick common stock. The employee stock purchase plan will
terminate at the effective time of the merger and no further purchase rights
will be granted thereafter.

THE EXCHANGE AGENT

    As of the effective time, DoubleClick is required to deposit with American
Stock Transfer & Trust Company or another bank or trust company certificates
representing the shares of DoubleClick common stock to be exchanged for shares
of MessageMedia common stock and cash to be paid in lieu of issuing fractional
shares.

EXCHANGE OF MESSAGEMEDIA STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR DOUBLECLICK STOCK CERTIFICATES

    Promptly after the effective time, the exchange agent will mail to
MessageMedia stockholders a letter of transmittal and instructions for
surrendering MessageMedia stock certificates in exchange for DoubleClick stock
certificates (and cash in lieu of fractional shares). MessageMedia stockholders
should not submit stock certificates for exchange until receipt of the letter of
transmittal and instructions.

DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES

    MessageMedia stockholders are not entitled to receive any dividends or other
distributions on DoubleClick common stock with a record date after the merger is
completed until surrender of MessageMedia stock certificates.

     perform certain other actions as set out in greater detail in the amended
     merger agreement.

NO SOLICITATION OF TRANSACTIONS

    Until the amended merger agreement is terminated, MessageMedia has agreed
not to, directly or indirectly:

     solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal
     or offer that constitutes or could lead to a company competing transaction;

     enter into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiate with any person
     in furtherance of such inquiries or obtain a company competing transaction;
     or

     agree to or endorse any company competing transaction, or authorize or
     permit any of its representatives to take any such action.

    However, MessageMedia may comply with the securities laws with regard to a
tender or exchange offer not made in violation of these prohibitions or, if
presented with a company superior proposal, may provide information in
connection with and negotiate the company superior proposal in accordance with
the fiduciary duties of MessageMedia's board of directors.

    Further, MessageMedia is required to notify DoubleClick orally and in
writing within 24 hours after any of MessageMedia's Chief Executive Officer,
Chief Financial Officer or Senior Vice President, Corporate Development receives
any proposal or offer, or promptly after any inquiry or contact with any person
with respect thereto, regarding a company competing transaction, including the
identity of the person making the proposal, offer, inquiry or contact and the
terms of the company competing transaction. MessageMedia must keep DoubleClick
apprised, on a current basis, of the status of the company competing transaction
and of any modifications to the terms. In addition, MessageMedia must notify
DoubleClick promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) orally and in writing if
at any time MessageMedia's board of directors determines that it believes such
proposal is a company superior proposal. In connection with any potential
company competing transaction, prior to furnishing any information or entering
into any discussions or negotiations with any person making a proposal,
MessageMedia will provide to DoubleClick prompt oral and written notice (and in
any event within 24

hours) to the effect that MessageMedia is furnishing information to, or entering
into discussions or negotiations with, such person and MessageMedia will keep
DoubleClick promptly informed of the status of the terms and conditions of any
such discussions or negotiations. Prior to accepting a company competing
proposal, MessageMedia must provide DoubleClick with 24 hours' oral and written
notice of such intention.

    MessageMedia has agreed to immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or negotiations with any parties with respect to a company
competing transaction and will not release any person from or waive any
provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party.

    A 'company competing transaction' is defined in the amended merger agreement
as any of the following involving MessageMedia (other than the merger):

     any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
     recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
     (other than, with respect to the termination fee payable in the event
     either MessageMedia or DoubleClick terminates the amended merger agreement
     because the merger has not been consummated before October 31, 2001 or the
     amended merger agreement and the merger failed to receive the requisite
     votes for approval at MessageMedia's special stockholders' meeting, and
     within twelve months after such termination, MessageMedia enters into a
     definitive agreement relating to a company competing transaction or
     consummates a company competing transaction, if MessageMedia acquires
     another person and the shares of MessageMedia common stock issued to the
     equityholders of such other person constitute less than 50% of the capital
     stock of the successor company in such transaction);

     any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of 20% or more of
     the assets of MessageMedia and its subsidiaries in a single transaction or
     series of related transactions;

     any tender offer or exchange offer for 20% or more of the outstanding
     voting securities of MessageMedia or the filing of a registration statement
     under the Securities Act in connection therewith;

     any person having acquired beneficial ownership or the right to acquire
     beneficial ownership of, or any group having been formed which beneficially
     owns, or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of
     the outstanding voting securities of MessageMedia;

     any solicitation in opposition to the approval of the amended merger
     agreement by the stockholders of MessageMedia; or

     any public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of the
     foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.

    A 'company superior proposal' is defined in the amended merger agreement as
a company competing transaction that:

     MessageMedia's board of directors shall have concluded in good faith, after
     consultation with independent outside counsel of nationally recognized
     reputation, that taking such action is necessary to prevent MessageMedia's
     board of directors from violating its fiduciary duties;

     if any cash consideration is involved, shall not be subject to any
     financing contingency and with respect to which MessageMedia's board of
     directors shall have determined in the proper exercise of its fiduciary
     duties that the acquiring party is capable of consummating such company
     competing transaction on the terms proposed; and

     MessageMedia's board of directors shall have determined (based on the
     advice of MessageMedia's independent financial advisors of nationally
     recognized reputation) in the proper exercise of its fiduciary duties that
     such company competing transaction provides greater value to MessageMedia's
     stockholders than the merger (and MessageMedia's independent financial
     advisors opine in writing that such company competing transaction is
     superior from a financial point of view).

    The agreements related to MessageMedia's non-solicitation of transactions
contained in the amended merger agreement are complicated and not easily
summarized. We urge you to carefully read the provisions of the amended merger
agreement captioned 'No Solicitation of Transactions.'

DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

    The amended merger agreement provides that:

     DoubleClick will indemnify and hold harmless, and will provide advancement
     of expenses to, each person who is or was a director or officer of
     MessageMedia or any of its subsidiaries at or at any time prior to the
     effective time of the merger to the same extent such persons are
     indemnified or have the right to the advancement of expenses as of the date
     of the merger agreement by MessageMedia pursuant to MessageMedia's
     certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date of the
     merger agreement. DoubleClick will also fulfill the obligations of
     MessageMedia pursuant to any indemnification agreements (including
     MessageMedia's certificate of incorporation and bylaws) between
     MessageMedia and any of the indemnified persons in effect immediately prior
     to the date of the merger agreement;

     in the event that DoubleClick or any of its successors or assigns
     consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
     continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
     merger, or transfers a material amount of its properties and assets to any
     person in a single transaction or a series of transactions, then and in
     each such case, DoubleClick will make or cause to be made proper provision
     so that the successors and assigns of DoubleClick assume the
     indemnification obligations described above for the benefit of the
     indemnified parties and have at least substantially equal financial ability
     as MessageMedia (immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
     contemplated by this proxy statement/prospectus) to satisfy the obligations
     of the parties pursuant to the amended merger agreement as a condition to
     any such future merger, consolidation or transfer becoming effective; and

     for six years after the effective time of the merger, DoubleClick will
     maintain in effect the directors' and officers' liability insurance
     policies maintained by MessageMedia. DoubleClick is not required to pay
     premiums in excess of 150% of the annual premium currently paid by
     MessageMedia for such coverage, which annual premium is $310,000. If the
     premium for such coverage exceeds $465,000, DoubleClick will purchase a
     policy with the greatest coverage available for $465,000.

BENEFIT PLANS AND ARRANGEMENTS

    After the effective time of the merger, DoubleClick will honor and satisfy
all obligations and liabilities with respect to MessageMedia's benefit plans
other than its employee stock purchase plan. However, DoubleClick will not be
required to continue any particular MessageMedia benefit plan after the
effective time and any MessageMedia benefit plan may be amended or terminated or
may be merged with any DoubleClick benefit plans in accordance with its terms
and applicable law so long as employees of MessageMedia who are employed by
DoubleClick are provided benefits and coverage that are the same or
substantially the same as that provided by DoubleClick to similarly situated
employees. To the extent permitted under the law, each employee of MessageMedia
or its subsidiaries will be given credit for all service with MessageMedia or
its subsidiaries (or service credited by MessageMedia or its subsidiaries) under
all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained by
DoubleClick (other than sabbatical benefits, for which employees of MessageMedia
or its subsidiaries will not receive any such past service credit) in which they
participate or in which they become participants for purposes of eligibility and
vesting. All benefits and service credits are subject to insurance carriers,
outsider providers or the like being able to provide the benefits on terms
reasonably acceptable to DoubleClick and there shall be no duplication of
benefits. Furthermore, DoubleClick or any of its subsidiaries is entitled to
make any change required by law.

    As requested by DoubleClick, MessageMedia will take all actions necessary
and appropriate to terminate any MessageMedia benefit plan that is a 401(k) plan
as of the last day of the payroll period

immediately preceding the closing date of the merger and will make no further
contribution to any 401(k) plan.

    After the effective time of the merger, DoubleClick will also honor in
accordance with their terms all existing employment, severance, consulting and
salary continuation agreements between MessageMedia or any of its subsidiaries
and any current or former executive officer or director of MessageMedia or any
of its subsidiaries, subject to any modifications to such agreements agreed to
by such executive officers or directors and DoubleClick.

additional conditions:

     each of the representations and warranties of DoubleClick contained in the
     merger agreement must be true, complete and correct in all respects, both

     failures to be true, complete and correct which do not, in the aggregate,

     there must not have been any material adverse effect relating to
     MessageMedia since the date of the merger agreement;

     DoubleClick must have received an opinion of its tax counsel, Brobeck,
     Phleger & Harrison, to the effect that the merger will constitute a
     reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
     Code; and

     MessageMedia must have properly completed and filed certain tax returns and
     paid in full all such taxes shown as due thereon.

TERMINATION OF THE AMENDED MERGER AGREEMENT

    The amended merger agreement may be terminated and the merger may be
abandoned at any time before the completion of the merger, notwithstanding the
approval and adoption of the amended merger agreement by MessageMedia's
stockholders, as summarized below:

     by mutual written consent of the boards of directors of each of
     MessageMedia and DoubleClick;

     by either MessageMedia or DoubleClick, if, without the fault of the
     terminating party, the merger has not been consummated on or before October
     31, 2001;

     by either MessageMedia or DoubleClick, if any governmental order, writ,
     injunction or decree preventing the consummation of the merger has been
     entered by any court of competent jurisdiction and has become final and
     nonappealable; or

     by MessageMedia or DoubleClick, if the amended merger agreement and the
     merger fail to receive the requisite votes for approval at the MessageMedia
     special stockholders' meeting.

    Furthermore, the amended merger agreement may be terminated by DoubleClick
if any of the following occur:

     the board of directors of MessageMedia withdraws, modifies or changes its
     recommendation of the amended merger agreement or the merger in a manner
     adverse to DoubleClick or its stockholders or resolves to do so;

     the board of directors of MessageMedia recommends a company competing
     transaction to the stockholders of MessageMedia;

     MessageMedia fails to comply in all material respects with provisions in
     the amended merger agreement dealing with non-solicitation of transactions
     or the MessageMedia stockholders' meeting;

     a party to a stockholder agreement and a stockholder letter described below
     (other than DoubleClick) fails to vote in favor of the merger in accordance
     with the stockholder agreement and the stockholder letter or fails to
     comply with the provisions of the stockholder agreements relating to
     company competing transactions;

     a company competing transaction is announced or publicly known and the
     board of directors of MessageMedia:

         --  fails to recommend against acceptance of such company competing
             transaction by its stockholders (including by taking no position,
             or indicating its inability to take a position, with respect to the
             acceptance of a company competing transaction involving a tender
             offer or exchange offer by its stockholders) within five business
             days of delivery of a DoubleClick written request for such action,
             or

         --  fails to reconfirm its approval and recommendation of the amended
             merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby within
             five business days of the first announcement or other public
             knowledge of such proposal for a company competing transaction;

     the board of directors of MessageMedia determines that a company competing
     transaction is a company superior proposal, determines to provide
     information in connection with, and/or to negotiate, such company superior
     proposal, and does not reconfirm its approval and recommendation of the
     amended merger agreement and does not recommend against acceptance of such
     company superior proposal by its stockholders;

     the board of directors of MessageMedia resolves to do any of the foregoing;
     or

     MessageMedia has breached any of its representations, warranties,
     covenants or agreements set forth in the amended merger agreement, or a
     representation or warranty of MessageMedia becomes untrue, incomplete or
     incorrect, in either case such that the conditions to the obligation of
     DoubleClick to close set forth in the amended merger agreement would not be
     satisfied, and MessageMedia fails to cure such breach within 20 days after
     receipt by MessageMedia of a written notice from DoubleClick of such
     breach.

    Furthermore, the amended merger agreement may be terminated by MessageMedia
if DoubleClick has breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in the amended merger agreement, or a representation or
warranty of DoubleClick becomes untrue, incomplete or incorrect, in either
case such that the conditions to the obligation of MessageMedia to close set
forth in the amended merger agreement would not be satisfied, and DoubleClick
fails to cure such breach within 20 days after receipt by DoubleClick of a
written notice from MessageMedia of such breach.

PAYMENT OF FEES AND EXPENSES

    Except as described below, all expenses incurred in connection with the
amended merger agreement and the merger will be paid by the party incurring such
expenses, whether or not the merger is consummated, except that DoubleClick and
MessageMedia each will pay one-half of all expenses incurred in connection with
printing, filing and mailing the registration statement, of which this proxy
statement/prospectus is a part, and all Securities and Exchange Commission and
other regulatory filing fees incurred in connection with such documents and any
fees required to be paid under U.S. antitrust laws.

    MessageMedia will pay DoubleClick an amount equal to $1.654 million in the
event that:

     DoubleClick terminates the amended merger agreement because MessageMedia
     has breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
     agreements set forth in the amended merger agreement, or a representation
     or warranty of MessageMedia becomes untrue, incomplete or incorrect, in
     either case such that the conditions to the obligation of DoubleClick to
     close set forth in the amended merger agreement would not be satisfied,
     and MessageMedia fails to cure such breach within 20 days after
     receipt by MessageMedia of a written notice from DoubleClick of such
     breach;

     DoubleClick terminates the amended merger agreement following the
     occurrence of any of the following events:

         --  the board of directors of MessageMedia withdraws, modifies or
             changes its recommendation of the amended merger agreement or the
             merger in a manner adverse to DoubleClick or its stockholders or
             resolves to do so;

         --  the board of directors of MessageMedia recommends a company
             competing transaction to the stockholders of MessageMedia;

         --  MessageMedia fails to comply in all material respects with

             non-solicitation of transactions and the MessageMedia stockholders'
             meeting;

         --  a party to a stockholder agreement and a stockholder letter
             described below (other than DoubleClick) fails to vote in favor of
             the merger in accordance with the stockholder agreement and the
             stockholder letter or fails to comply with the provisions of the
             stockholder agreements relating to company competing transactions;

         --  a company competing transaction is announced or publicly known and
             the board of directors of MessageMedia:

            fails to recommend against acceptance of such company competing
            transaction by its stockholders (including by taking no position, or
            indicating its inability to take a position, with respect to the
            acceptance of a company competing transaction involving a tender
            offer or exchange offer by its stockholders) within five business
            days of delivery of DoubleClick's written request for such action,
            or

            fails to reconfirm its approval and recommendation of the amended
            merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby within
            five business days of the first announcement or other public
            knowledge of such proposal for a company competing transaction;

         --  the board of directors of MessageMedia determines that a company
             competing transaction is a company superior proposal, determines to
             provide information in connection with, and/or to negotiate, such
             company superior proposal, and does not reconfirm its approval and
             recommendation of the amended merger agreement and does not
             recommend against acceptance of such company superior proposal by
             its stockholders; or

         --  the board of directors of MessageMedia resolves to take any of the
             foregoing actions;

     either MessageMedia or DoubleClick terminates the amended merger agreement,
     without the fault of the terminating party, because the merger has not been
     consummated on or before October 31, 2001 and at or prior to the time of
     such termination, either there shall have been proposed or publicly
     announced (A) a company competing transaction or (B) within twelve months
     after such termination, MessageMedia shall enter into a definitive
     agreement with respect to any company competing transaction or any company
     competing transaction involving MessageMedia shall be consummated; or

     either MessageMedia or DoubleClick terminates the amended merger agreement
     because the amended merger agreement and the merger fail to receive the
     requisite votes for approval at the MessageMedia special stockholders'
     meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof and at or prior to the
     time of such termination, either there shall have been proposed or publicly
     announced (A) a company competing transaction or (B) within twelve months
     after such termination, MessageMedia shall enter into a definitive
     agreement with respect to any company competing transaction or any company
     competing transaction involving MessageMedia shall be consummated.

EXTENSION, WAIVER AND AMENDMENT OF THE AMENDED MERGER AGREEMENT

    At any time prior to the completion of the merger, either DoubleClick or
MessageMedia may extend the time for or waive compliance with the performance of
any obligation or other act of the

other party, waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties
contained in the amended merger agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
to the amended merger agreement and waive compliance by the other party with any
of the agreements or conditions contained in the amended merger agreement.

    The amended merger agreement may be amended by DoubleClick and MessageMedia
at any time prior to the completion of the merger. However, after the approval
of the amended merger agreement by MessageMedia's stockholders, no amendment may
be made that changes the amount or type of consideration into which MessageMedia
common stock will be converted pursuant to the amended merger agreement.

RELATED AGREEMENTS

Equity Fund, Inc., A. Laurence Jones, Bradley A. Feld, Dennis J. Cagan, Howard
S. Diamond, Gerald A. Poch and R. Terry Duryea, as stockholders of MessageMedia,
entered into stockholder agreements and irrevocable proxies with DoubleClick.
[In connection with the execution of the amendment to the merger agreement, each
of these MessageMedia stockholders entered into stockholder letters pursuant to
which each reaffirmed all of its obligations under the stockholder agreements,
and each granted DoubleClick irrevocable proxies that superceded the original
proxies.] The stockholder agreements, [as affirmed by the stockholder letters,

[        ], 2001, at every meeting of the stockholders of MessageMedia at which
the merger is considered or voted upon and at every adjournment of such meetings
and on every action or approval by written resolution of the stockholders of
MessageMedia with respect to the merger, in favor of approval and adoption of
the amended merger agreement and of the merger. In addition, each such
stockholder agreed not to violate the provisions of the amended merger agreement
that relate to soliciting a competing transaction. The MessageMedia stockholders
who are parties to the stockholder agreements, [as affirmed by the stockholder
letters,] and irrevocable proxies retained the right to vote their shares of
MessageMedia common stock on all matters other than those identified in the
stockholder agreements. None of the stockholders who are parties to the
stockholder agreements and stockholder letters with DoubleClick was paid
additional consideration in connection with the execution of such documents.
These agreements terminate upon the earlier to occur of the termination of the
amended merger agreement or the effective time of the merger. The form of
stockholder agreement and stockholder letter are attached as Appendix B and
Appendix B-1 to this proxy statement/prospectus and we urge you to read them
for a more complete description of the agreements.

              UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

    The following unaudited pro forma condensed financial statements of
DoubleClick have been prepared to illustrate the estimated effects of:

     the assumed acquisition by DoubleClick of all the outstanding shares of
     MesssageMedia in exchange for 2,992,373 shares of DoubleClick common stock
     and the assumption by DoubleClick of MessageMedia options and warrants
     which, under the merger, convert into options and warrants to acquire
     409,751 shares of DoubleClick common stock;

     the April 23, 2001 acquisition by DoubleClick of all the outstanding shares
     of FloNetwork Inc. in exchange for approximately $11.4 million in cash,
     2,770,943 shares of DoubleClick common stock and the assumption by
     DoubleClick of FloNetwork options and warrants which, under the merger of
     those two companies, converted into options and warrants to acquire 430,152
     shares of DoubleClick common stock; and

     the February 2, 2001 acquisition by DoubleClick of all the outstanding
     shares of @plan.inc in exchange for approximately $39.1 million in cash,
     3,206,474 shares of DoubleClick common stock and the assumption by
     DoubleClick of @plan options and warrants which, under the merger of those
     two companies, converted into options and warrants to acquire 1,213,614
     shares of DoubleClick common stock.

    Pro forma amounts have been derived by applying pro forma adjustments to the
historical consolidated financial information of DoubleClick, MessageMedia,
FloNetwork and @plan.

ACQUISITION OF MESSAGEMEDIA

    The purchase price of MessageMedia has been estimated based on the average
market price of DoubleClick common stock, as quoted on The Nasdaq National
Market, for the day immediately prior to, the day of and the day immediately
after, the announcement of the merger, plus the fair value of options and
warrants assumed, which was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model. The estimated purchase price does not include the effect of direct
acquisition costs. The final cost of the acquisition will be a different amount.

    The excess of the estimated purchase price over the book value of net assets
acquired has been preliminarily allocated to goodwill and assigned a useful life
of three years. The ultimate allocation of the purchase price will depend on the
results of fair value appraisals. DoubleClick believes that the effect of the
ultimate allocation will not differ materially from that assumed in the
following unaudited pro forma financial data.

    The unaudited pro forma condensed statements of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2000 and the three month period ended March 31, 2001 have
been prepared as if the merger had occurred on January 1, 2000. The unaudited
pro forma condensed balance sheet as of March 31, 2001 has been prepared as if
the merger had occurred on March 31, 2001. The pro forma adjustments are
described in the accompanying notes.

ACQUISITION OF FLONETWORK

    On April 23, 2001, DoubleClick completed its acquisition of FloNetwork, a
privately-held Canadian provider of email marketing technology services. The
purchase price of FloNetwork has been calculated based on the average market
price of DoubleClick common stock, as quoted on The Nasdaq National Market, for
the day immediately prior to, the day of and the day immediately after, the day
the number of shares and the amount of cash consideration due to FloNetwork
shareholders became fixed pursuant to the agreement under which FloNetwork was
acquired, plus the fair value of options and warrants assumed, which was
determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

    The excess of the purchase price over the recorded amount of net assets
acquired has been preliminarily allocated to goodwill and is being amortized
over three years. The ultimate allocation of the purchase price will depend on
the results of fair value appraisals. DoubleClick believes that, as a result of
these fair value appraisals, portions of the excess of the purchase price over
the fair value of net tangible assets acquired may be allocated to purchased
technology and in-process research and

development. Accordingly, to the extent that a portion of the excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired is assigned
to acquired in-process research and development and immediately expensed,
operating results may differ materially from those presented in the pro forma
statements.

    The unaudited pro forma condensed statements of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2000 and the three month period ended March 31, 2001 have
been prepared as if the FloNetwork acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2000.
The unaudited pro forma condensed balance sheet as of March 31, 2001 has been
prepared as if the acquisition had occurred on March 31, 2001. The pro forma
adjustments are described in the accompanying notes.

ACQUISITION OF @PLAN

    On February 2, 2001, DoubleClick completed its acquisition of @plan, a
leading provider of online target market research planning systems. The purchase
price of @plan has been determined based on the average market price of
DoubleClick common stock, as quoted on The Nasdaq National Market, for the day
immediately prior to and the day of the final determination of the number of
shares and the amount of cash consideration due to @plan shareholders pursuant
to the merger agreement under which @plan was acquired, plus the fair value of
options and warrants assumed, which was calculated using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
the net assets acquired has been allocated to goodwill and is being amortized
over three years.

    The unaudited pro forma condensed statements of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2000 and the three month period ended March 31, 2001 have
been prepared as if the @plan acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2000. No
pro forma balance sheet information has been provided as @plan's net assets are
reflected in the financial position of DoubleClick as of March 31, 2001. The pro
forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

    Certain assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets of
MessageMedia and FloNetwork have been reclassified to conform to the line item
presentation in the pro forma condensed balance sheet. Certain costs and other
deductions in the consolidated statements of operations of MessageMedia,
FloNetwork and @plan have been reclassified to conform to the line item
presentation in the pro forma condensed statements of operations.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

    The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for illustrative
purposes only and should not be considered indicative of the actual results that
would have been achieved had the acquisitions described above been consummated
on the dates indicated and does not purport to indicate balance sheet data or
results of operations as of any future date or any future period. The unaudited
pro forma financial information should be read in conjuction with the historical
financial statements of DoubleClick and MessageMedia, and the related notes
thereto incorporated by reference into and/or included elsewhere in this proxy

   subsequently recognized over the award's remaining vesting period.

   The book value of the net assets acquired reflects: (1) the forgiveness of a
   $200 thousand loan receivable from MessageMedia's President and Chief
   Executive Officer upon the consummation of the merger and (2) the elimination

    expense related to its acquisition of MessageMedia should this standard be
    adopted as currently drafted.

    MessageMedia was originally incorporated in the state of Wyoming on
March 11, 1994, under the name of First Virtual Holdings Incorporated.
It was reincorporated in the state of Delaware on January 12, 1996. From
inception through 1998, its revenues principally were derived from its
Internet payment system and related services. In June 1998, MessageMedia
was recapitalized by SOFTBANK Corp. and affiliates through a series of
transactions resulting in their acquisition of 19.1 million shares of
MessageMedia common stock. In July 1998, MessageMedia made a strategic
decision to focus exclusively on e-messaging and related services, leveraging
the expertise of its key technical personnel and its existing proprietary
technology from the Internet payment system, which was phased out. In
December 1998, MessageMedia changed its name from First Virtual Holdings
Incorporated to MessageMedia, Inc. in connection with its acquisitions of
two e-messaging companies, Email Publishing, Inc., also known as Epub, and
Distributed Bits, L.L.C. also known as Dbits. As a result of the acquisitions,
EPub and DBits became wholly owned subsidiaries of MessageMedia. These
acquisitions enabled MessageMedia to expand its suite of e-messaging services.
In August 1999, MessageMedia acquired two additional e-messaging companies,
Revnet Systems, Inc., also known as Revnet, and Decisive Technology Corporation,
also known as Decisive, to further broaden its comprehensive suite of
e-messaging solutions and its customer base. All of these acquisitions were
accounted for as purchase transactions. A summary of these acquisitions follows:

     EPub was a leading provider of outsourced email message delivery services
     to businesses and organizations. On December 9, 1998, MessageMedia acquired
     all of the common stock of Epub in exchange for 5,582,676 shares of
     MessageMedia common stock and assumed all of their options and warrants in
     exchange for approximately 417,324 additional shares of MessageMedia common
     stock.

     Dbits was a development state company developing customer email management
     systems and solutions. On December 11, 1998, MessageMedia acquired all
     equity interests in DBits in

     exchange for 1,305,320 shares of MessageMedia common stock and warrants to
     purchase an additional 500,000 shares of MessageMedia common stock.

     Revnet was a leading developer and supplier of software solutions providing
     businesses and organizations with 'in-house' email message delivery
     capability. Revnet also provided outsourced email message delivery
     services. On August 9, 1999, MessageMedia acquired all of the common stock
     of Revnet in exchange for 3,262,120 shares of MessageMedia common stock and
     assumed all of their options and warrants in exchange for approximately

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

    Email marketing has its basis in traditional direct marketing principles.
For decades, direct marketers have used traditional mail to communicate with
their customers. The purpose of the direct mail pieces was to give customers
promotional information, offers and incentives that would encourage them to
purchase particular products. Direct marketers soon realized that email could be
used to supplant or enhance traditional methods. Email can be used to
effectively interact with customers and for a variety of purposes other than
purchase incentives.

    Permission-based Email can be a Highly Strategic Tool for Online Business.
Permission-based, or 'opt-in,' email is a highly reliable, cost-effective and
timely way for businesses to create a personal, two-way dialogue with their
customers. The complexity and functionality of commercial email is changing
dramatically. For example, email can be used for a variety of highly strategic
functions such as marketing, customer service and transaction confirmations.
Email functions can also be quickly customized or adapted to allow businesses to
target and shape their communications to meet the rapidly changing needs of
their customers. As businesses and consumers grow more comfortable with
conducting commerce over the Internet, email volume associated with business
communication and e-commerce is expected to grow even more quickly. As the cost
benefits and flexibility of email are more widely recognized, MessageMedia
expects businesses to more rapidly embrace email as a strategic tool for
building customer relationships and responding to large volumes of inbound email
communications.

    Changing Business Environment and Need to Foster Customer Relationships. The
dramatic growth of the Internet and the proliferation of email in the last five
years have changed the way businesses and customers interact. Prior to the
advent of email, businesses relied primarily on in-person interaction and
physical proximity to the customer as well as techniques such as direct mail and
telemarketing to foster customer relationships. Such methods, however, vary in
their degree of effectiveness and are often characterized by high costs and slow
response times.

    Email marketing is effective, fast and inexpensive. Response rates of 15% or
more are common and marketers receive immediate feedback from customers. Email
marketing costs may be 90% less than traditional direct marketing costs.
Moreover, many companies use email as a strategic tool to drive Web site
traffic, facilitate transactions and test new offers.

    As a result, businesses are increasingly in need of strategic applications
that enable them to expand their customer base, foster customer loyalty and
provide personalized, one-to-one communication. According to a Yankee Group
research report (Internet Market Strategies, December 2000), 'The

forecast for related email marketing services will grow from approximately $100
million by the end of 2000 to almost $3 billion by the end of 2004. This is a
compound growth rate of 140%.'

    Complexity of E-messaging Supports Comprehensive Outsourced Services. To
create strong and effective e-messaging programs, businesses will need a broad
range of technology and strategic expertise to adapt and implement effective
solutions in today's rapidly changing business and regulatory environment.
MessageMedia believes this will lead to an increase in the outsourcing of
e-messaging applications. In order to effectively leverage e-messaging as a key
competitive tool, businesses not only must be able to gather information about
customer preferences and needs, but employ systems that are robust enough to
seamlessly and quickly respond to such data.

    The implementation of effective e-messaging systems requires substantial
hardware, software and technical and administrative resources. As email grows in
volume and sophistication, the resources and expertise required to
cost-effectively implement, enhance and scale e-messaging applications increases
exponentially. Given the complexities of these strategic and technical problems
and the need to deploy a solution quickly and cost-effectively, businesses
increasingly are looking to outsource their e-messaging services to 'one-stop'
outsourced providers. In general, as the level of complexity increases,
outsourcing becomes a more attractive option.

MESSAGEMEDIA'S KEY CAPABILITIES

    MessageMedia currently offers the following:

     Account Management and Customer Services -- Through MessageMedia's
     professional staff of account management and customer service
     representatives, MessageMedia delivers e-messaging services specifically
     tailored to each customer's business objectives. Each customer is assigned
     an account management team comprised of an account director and one or more
     customer services representatives, who act as the customer's primary point
     of contact for all relationship and campaign management issues. They work
     with the customer to develop an e-messaging calendar, create a
     specification of campaign needs, develop the necessary web interfaces,
     customize the customer database through which MessageMedia maintains,
     imports and manipulates data, implement project plans and manage
     pre-production and production testing, campaign roll-out and post-mailing
     analysis. Additionally, MessageMedia's customer services professionals have
     extensive experience in the development and delivery of effective customer
     communications programs.

     Outbound Messaging -- MessageMedia manages all logistics of e-messaging
     delivery, from time-scheduled outbound message distribution to highly
     interactive and event-driven communications, such as confirming an Internet
     consumer purchase. E-messages with personalized content can be precisely
     targeted to segments of MessageMedia's customers' emailing list.
     MessageMedia's technology determines which format the email reader uses in
     order to maximize the visual impact of the sender's message. MessageMedia
     provides reliable, large-scale delivery of messages, personalized and
     customized to each of its customer's customers in an e-messaging campaign,
     as well as sophisticated error-handling and 'bounce' processing to ensure a
     clean and current customer emailing list. MessageMedia's outbound messaging
     capabilities include the ability to include rich media (audio and video) in
     the email messages being sent by customers.

     Inbound Messaging -- MessageMedia manages all logistics of response
     processing from customers of its customers, including response validation,
     response tracking, performance of customer defined actions and automated
     database updates. MessageMedia's response-handling capabilities enable its
     customers to engage in interactive, two-way marketing campaigns, entirely
     using email. The ability to process and respond to customers' inquiries
     improves the quality of the customer relationship by ensuring
     MessageMedia's customer's ability to hear, acknowledge and respond to such
     requests in a personalized manner.

     e-Survey -- MessageMedia provides its customers with a wide array of email
     based survey services. These services range from the development of the
     permission profiling questions that may be asked in the permission center
     to periodic and on-going transaction surveys to measure customer
     satisfaction to surveys directed at a specific target audience, question or
     problem.

     MessageMedia employs quantitative methods professionals with extensive
     experience in the design, development and deployment of surveys in both the
     conventional and e-survey delivery modes. These professionals also have
     extensive data analysis and data modeling experience that is used by
     customers in the targeting and database segmentation aspects of their
     outbound e-messaging campaigns.

     Database Services -- MessageMedia tracks and reviews the success of current
     and past e-messaging campaigns and can deliver multiple offers to
     separately defined customer groups. This allows MessageMedia's customer to
     identify what worked and what did not and adaptively update and manage
     their campaigns in a proactive manner. All messaging activity is
     automatically tracked and logged into MessageMedia's database, creating a
     clear history of all customer actions to aid in resolution of individual
     requests as well as total campaign analysis. This detailed customer record
     provides a wealth of information and enables customers to fine-tune their
     direct marketing efforts and increase the return on investment in the next
     campaign. Additionally, customers often bring other data from their legacy
     systems to their e-messaging database maintained by MessageMedia so that
     this additional data may be used to more effectively segment and target
     their customer communications.

MESSAGEMEDIA'S SERVICES AND SOFTWARE OFFERINGS

    MessageMedia offers a broad range of solution sets including complete

makes it easy for customers to migrate between MessageMedia's three solution
sets and allows them to choose the level of self-service that meets their
specific needs.

    Outsourced Services. MessageMedia's outsourced services are offered in a
full or partial service bureau model depending on MessageMedia's customer's need
for self-service. The full service model M(3) Connect includes dedicated account
management and customized services. Professional account managers share their
breadth of email marketing expertise in developing customer acquisition,
retention and growth strategies. Customers also have the option of choosing
additional services from a continuum of value-added offerings.

    M(3) Connect is a full-service outsourced solution to create and deliver

MessageMedia helps customers develop effective survey methodologies,
questionnaire content and sampling, analysis and reporting plans.

    MessageMedia's outsourced services are targeted towards six major industry
groups: Internet service providers and portals, publishing, retail/e-tail,
technology, financial services and the travel and entertainment industry. In
each of these industry groups, MessageMedia has developed an understanding of
the unique marketing requirements and can customize e-marketing and
communications programs that meet the challenges unique to each specific
industry.

    Hosted Software and Services. MessageMedia's hosted software solution,
UnityMail Express, provides customers complete end-user control without the
installation, set-up and maintenance associated with implementing software
in-house. This solution has defined functionality and a finite set of services.
UnityMail Express allows customers to take advantage of advanced email marketing
technology without buying software or maintaining email list servers. Customers
pay monthly recurring charges based on messaging volume.

    MessageMedia's hosted services offering is a partial service bureau model

M(3) Connect.

    Licensed Software. MessageMedia's licensed software solution is called
UnityMail. UnityMail integrates relational databases into advanced email list
servers, allowing the development of one-to-one relationships with customers.
UnityMail performs standard email delivery, bounce management, discussion lists,

MessageMedia's software products, MessageMedia provides help desk support 24
hours a day, seven days a week. Additionally, MessageMedia provides
installation, training and integration services on a billable hours basis.

    Additionally, for customers with small databases and the need for limited
email marketing functionality, MessageMedia offers MailKing, an entry-level
PC-based email distribution software package. MailKing is priced at $199.95 for
single copy purchases.

COMPETITION

    MessageMedia's principal competitors are in the e-messaging services arena,
and MessageMedia may experience additional competition from Internet
service providers and other large established businesses that may enter the
market for e-messaging services. MessageMedia competes for customers based on
service levels, product offerings and price.

    Internet marketing companies, in general, and MessageMedia's e-messaging
solutions, in particular, also must compete for a share of advertisers' total
advertising budgets with traditional advertising media such as television,
radio, cable and print. Consequently, MessageMedia competes with advertising and
direct marketing agencies. To the extent that e-messaging is perceived to be a
limited or ineffective

advertising medium, companies may be reluctant to devote a significant portion
of their advertising budget to MessageMedia's e-messaging solutions, which could
limit the growth of e-messaging and negatively affect MessageMedia's business.

    MessageMedia also expects that competition may increase as a result of
industry consolidation. Potential competitors may choose to enter the market for
e-messaging solutions by acquiring one or more of MessageMedia's existing
competitors or by forming strategic alliances with such competitors. In
addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish
cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the
ability of their products or services to address the needs of MessageMedia's
potential customers. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or
alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. Increased
competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of
market share, any of which would harm MessageMedia's business, results of
operations and financial condition.

SALES

    MessageMedia's sales efforts are currently conducted through a regionally
based, direct sales force. MessageMedia's sales force typically markets its
solutions to the senior level marketing personnel and senior corporate
management within potential customer organizations. MessageMedia has worked
with a number of 'blue chip' customers who have agreed to help facilitate
MessageMedia's sales efforts by acting as customer references.

    MessageMedia maintains a separate group of regionally based sales
professionals that are responsible for selling its packaged software
applications, principally UnityMail.

    MessageMedia's regionally based, direct sales force is focused on attracting
new customers. MessageMedia's existing customers are supported by the account
management and customer services organization. This group is responsible for
working with current customers on their communications and dialog programs, for
retaining these customers and for increasing the usage of MessageMedia's
services by these customers. MessageMedia's account management and customer
services professionals are highly effective at managing relationships and
selling additional services to existing customers when the need arises.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING

    MessageMedia's research, development and engineering activities are focused
primarily on the design, development and enhancement of e-messaging services, as
well as on increasing the capacity and reliability of existing products and
services. MessageMedia has devoted a significant portion of its resources to
research, development and engineering programs. MessageMedia's research,
development and engineering expenses were $1.4 million for the three month
period ended March 31, 2001, and $6.2 million, $4.9 million and $4.8 million for
the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. MessageMedia
believes that significant research, development and engineering expenditures
will be required in order for it to remain competitive. Accordingly,
MessageMedia expects that research, development and engineering expenses will
continue to constitute a significant portion of its overall expenses in the
future.

    MessageMedia's ability to design, develop, test and support new software
products and enhancements on a timely basis is critical to MessageMedia's future
success. There can be no assurance that MessageMedia will be successful in
developing and marketing new software products and enhancements that meet
changing customer needs and respond to such technological changes or evolving
industry standards. MessageMedia's current services are designed around certain
widely used and accepted standards, including the MIME and SMTP email standards,
and integrate process-based security using email confirmation. Current and
future use of MessageMedia's services will depend, in part, on industry
acceptance of such standards and practices as they apply to the Internet and
Internet commerce.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

    On March 13, 2000, MessageMedia entered into a definitive agreement with
@viso Limited, a strategic partnership between Vivendi and SOFTBANK Corp., to
create MessageMedia Europe, B.V., a

joint venture between MessageMedia and @viso. MessageMedia owns 51% and @viso
owns 49% of the joint venture. The initial capitalization of the joint venture
was funded with $14.8 million during the second quarter of 2000. MessageMedia
Europe B.V. is consolidated into MessageMedia's financial statements. On May 9,
2001, MessageMedia and @viso agreed to effect an orderly liquidation of the
joint venture. Pursuant to that agreement, the parties released each other from
all claims, liabilities and demands relating to, among other things, the
formation and operation of the joint venture. The initial capital to effect the
liquidation of the joint venture was provided by @viso, and MessageMedia issued
two promissory notes to @viso in the aggregate principal amount of $4.5 million.
Upon the closing of the merger, the notes will be immediately due and payable to
@viso. Furthermore, upon the closing of the merger, a payment of up to $562,500
must be made to @viso as a change of control premium. Upon the closing of the
merger, satisfaction of the two promissory notes and payment of the change of
control premium will become obligations of DoubleClick. SOFTBANK Corp.
indirectly owns 50% of the interest in @viso and approximately 17% of the
outstanding common stock of MessageMedia. SOFTBANK Corp. is not represented on
the MessageMedia board of directors.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

    A number of states have adopted laws restricting the distribution of
unsolicited commercial emails, or Spam. MessageMedia actively monitors such
legislation and regulatory development to minimize the risk of its participation
in activities that violate anti-Spam legislation. Additionally, a number of
legislative and regulatory proposals are under consideration by federal and
state lawmakers and regulatory bodies and may be adopted with respect to the
Internet. Some of the issues that such laws or regulations may cover include
user privacy, obscenity, fraud, pricing and characteristics and quality of
products and services. The adoption of any such laws or regulations may decrease
the growth of the Internet, which could in turn decrease the projected demand
for MessageMedia's products and services or increase its cost of doing business.
Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing U.S. and international
laws governing issues such as property ownership, copyright, trade secret,
libel, taxation and personal privacy is uncertain and developing. Any new
legislation or regulation, or application or interpretation of existing laws,
could have a material adverse effect on MessageMedia's business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects.

EMPLOYEES

    As of May 31, 2001, MessageMedia employed 205 employees, all of whom were
employed on a full time basis. Of these 205 employees, 34 were in research,
development and engineering, 92 were in operations, 51 were in marketing and
sales and 28 were in administration.

PROPERTIES

    MessageMedia's corporate facilities consist of approximately 73,485 square
feet of leased space in Louisville, Colorado and 33,805 square feet in Superior,
Colorado. The Louisville facility lease expires on October 14, 2010 and the
Superior facility lease expires on April 30, 2005. MessageMedia leases space in
Denver, Colorado for its computer processing center. In connection with the
December 1998 acquisition of EPub, MessageMedia acquired a facility lease
consisting of approximately 6,500 square feet of leased space in Boulder,
Colorado. This facility lease expires on June 30, 2002. Additionally,
MessageMedia leases facilities in Huntsville, Alabama, New York, New York,
Chicago, Illinois and San Francisco, California.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    MessageMedia is not subject to any material legal proceedings.

     communications and easily integrate more advanced e-messaging and database
     applications.

    MessageMedia's software solutions provide customers with:

     a complete solution for email marketing and email communications that
     integrates with relational databases such as Oracle or SQL Server;

     functions such as targeted email (filtering and data segmentation),
     personalized email, dynamic content editing and trackable URLs and campaign
     sequencing; and

     typical email list server functions such as reliable high throughput email
     delivery, bounce management, discussion lists, announcement lists and easy
     unsubscribes.

    In December 1998, MessageMedia acquired Distributed Bits LLC, or DBits, and
Email Publishing Inc., or Epub. DBits was a development stage company developing
customer email management systems and solutions and Epub was a leading provider
of outsourced email message delivery services. In August 1999, MessageMedia
acquired Revnet Systems, Inc., or Revnet, and Decisive Technology Corporation,
or Decisive. Revnet was a leading developer and supplier of software solutions
providing businesses and organizations with 'in-house' email message delivery
capability and outsourced email message delivery services. Decisive was a
leading provider of online e-intelligence solutions such as surveys.

    On March 13, 2000, MessageMedia entered into a definitive agreement with
@viso Limited, a strategic partnership between Vivendi and SOFTBANK Corp., to
create MessageMedia Europe B.V., a joint venture between MessageMedia and @viso.
MessageMedia owns 51% and @viso owns 49% of the joint venture. The initial
capitalization of the joint venture was funded with $14.8 million during the
second quarter of 2000. MessageMedia Europe B.V. is consolidated into
MessageMedia's financial statements. On May 9, 2001, MessageMedia and @viso
agreed to effect an orderly liquidation of the joint venture. Pursuant to that
agreement, the parties released each other from all claims, liabilities and
demands relating to, among other things, the formation and operation of the
joint venture. The initial capital to effect the liquidation of the joint
venture was provided by @viso, and MessageMedia issued two promissory notes to
@viso in the aggregate principal amount of $4.5 million. Upon the closing of the
merger, the notes will be immediately due and payable to @viso. Furthermore,
upon the closing of the merger, a payment of up to $562,500 must be made to
@viso as a change of control premium. Upon the closing of the merger,
satisfaction of the two promissory notes and payment of the change of
control premium will become obligations of DoubleClick. SOFTBANK Corp.
indirectly owns 50% of the interest in @viso and approximately 17% of the
outstanding common stock of MessageMedia. SOFTBANK Corp. is not represented on
the MessageMedia board of directors.

    In the fourth quarter of 2000, MessageMedia recorded a charge of $7.0
million for restructuring. An assessment of the adequacy of this restructuring
charge will be completed during the second quarter of 2001. Any adjustment to
the reserve will be recorded in the second quarter of 2001.

    MessageMedia has incurred net operating losses in each quarter since
inception. As of March 31, 2001, MessageMedia had an accumulated deficit of
approximately $191.7 million. There can be no assurance that MessageMedia's
future revenues will increase or not decrease. In addition, since MessageMedia
expects to introduce new functionality of its services and explore opportunities
to merge with or acquire complementary businesses and technologies, MessageMedia
expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable
future.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2000 AND MARCH 31, 2001

    Revenues. MessageMedia derives its revenues from outsourced services,
software products and related support services. MessageMedia's outsourced
services include information distribution, email marketing and messaging
services. MessageMedia's software products provide e-messaging capabilities for
customers desiring their own 'in-house' solution. For the three months ended
March 31, 2001, revenues increased to approximately $8.7 million compared to
approximately $7.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2000. This
increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of customers
using MessageMedia's software products and services in the United States and an
increase in messaging and software services generated by MessageMedia Europe,
B.V.

    Cost of Revenues. The cost of revenues for the messaging and software
service businesses consists of salaries, benefits, consulting fees and
operational costs related to providing MessageMedia's services and software.

    For the three months ended March 31, 2001, the cost of revenues increased to
approximately $3.8 million compared to approximately $2.9 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2000. This increase is primarily attributable to
increased headcount required to service MessageMedia's growing customer base,
the related growth in the number of mailings and e-messaging volume and the
incremental increase in cost of revenues as a result of the startup of
MessageMedia Europe, B.V.

    Operating Expenses. MessageMedia's operating expenses consist of marketing
and sales, research, development and engineering and general and administrative
expenses. For the three months ended March 31, 2001, operating expenses
decreased to $8.1 million, compared to approximately $10.3 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2000. This decrease is primarily due to cost cutting
measures, including a reduction in labor force of approximately 125 employees
implemented in December 2000.

    Marketing and sales expenses. Marketing and sales expenses, which include
salaries, wages, consulting fees, advertising, trade shows, travel and other
marketing expenses, decreased to approximately $3.0 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2001, compared to approximately $5.5 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2000. This decrease is primarily due to a reassessment of
marketing needs and a corresponding reduction in marketing activities for the
fiscal year 2001.

    Research, development and engineering expenses. Research, development and
engineering expenses, which include salaries, wages and consulting fees to
support the development, enhancement and maintenance of MessageMedia's products
and services, increased to approximately $1.4 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2001, compared to approximately $1.3 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2000. This increase is primarily due to expenses incurred in
relation to the ongoing engineering efforts related to the development of a more
robust messaging platform.

    General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses
consist primarily of salaries, wages, professional and consulting fees, facility
costs and other expenses associated with the general management and
administration of MessageMedia. General and administrative expenses increased to
approximately $3.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001, compared
to $3.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2000. This increase is
primarily due to additional facility

costs associated with the relocation of the corporate function and messaging
business unit within Colorado.

    EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as loss from operations before depreciation and
amortization. For the three months ended March 31, 2001, EBITDA loss decreased
to approximately ($3.3) million from ($6.2) million for the three months ended
March 31, 2000. This decrease is primarily due to the effect of cost cutting
measures, including a reduction in labor force of approximately 125 employees,
implemented in December 2000.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000, DECEMBER 31, 1999 AND DECEMBER 31, 1998

    Revenues. Prior to July 1998, MessageMedia derived its revenue from its
First Virtual Internet Payment System ('FVIPS') and related services. In
August 1998, MessageMedia phased out the operations of the FVIPS and launched
its e-messaging services. In December 1998, MessageMedia acquired DBits and
EPub, and in August 1999, MessageMedia acquired Revnet and Decisive. Revenue for
the periods presented was earned as detailed in the table below (in thousands):

                                                    -------   -------   ------

    For the year ended December 31, 2000, revenues increased to approximately
$33.6 million compared to approximately $10.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the
number of customers using MessageMedia's products and services, increased
e-messaging volume, an incremental increase in revenue as a result of the
Decisive and Revnet acquisitions and the startup of MessageMedia Europe, B.V.

    For the year ended December 31, 1999, revenues increased to approximately
$10.0 million compared to approximately $1.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 1998. This increase is primarily due to the change in
MessageMedia's business strategy from an internet payment system product to
e-messaging and software products. In August 1998, MessageMedia began its
e-messaging services, which is now its primary business, and phased out its
FVIPS operations. The increase in revenue was also due to increases in the
number of customers using MessageMedia's services, increased e-messaging volume
and an incremental increase in revenue as a result of the EPub, Revnet and
Decisive acquisitions.

    Cost of Revenues. The cost of revenues for e-messaging solutions consists of
salaries, benefits, consulting fees and operational costs related to providing
MessageMedia's outsourced services. Cost of revenues for software licenses
consists of software packaging and distribution costs. The cost of revenues from
FVIPS consisted of fees paid to third parties for processing transactions, costs
of setting up new accounts and communication expenses related to providing
services from the FVIPS. MessageMedia incurred cost of revenues from messaging
services, software products and FVIPS, as detailed in the table below:

                                                       YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

                                                       -------   ------   ---

    For the year ended December 31, 2000, the cost of revenues increased to
approximately $17.3 million compared to approximately $4.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 1999. This increase is primarily attributable to increased
headcount required to service MessageMedia's growing customer base, the related
growth in the number of mailings and e-messaging volume and the incremental

increase in cost of revenues as a result of the startup of MessageMedia Europe,
B.V. and the acquisitions of Decisive and Revnet.

    For the year ended December 31, 1999, the cost of revenues increased to
approximately $4.6 million compared to approximately $98,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1998. This increase is primarily attributable to increased
headcount required to service MessageMedia's growing customer base, the related
growth in the number of mailings and e-messaging volumes and the Decisive and
Revnet acquisitions.

    Operating Expenses. MessageMedia's operating expenses consists of marketing
and sales, research, development and engineering and general and administrative
expenses. Overall operating expenses increased for the year ended December 31,
2000 compared to the year ended December 31, 1999 due to increased headcount and
related expenses and MessageMedia's startup of MessageMedia Europe, B.V., which
began operations in March 2000. Operating expenses increased for the year ended
December 31, 1999 compared to the year ended December 31, 1998 also due to
increased headcount and related expenses. Additionally, MessageMedia's
acquisitions of EPub and DBits were completed in December 1998 and
MessageMedia's acquisitions of Revnet and Decisive were completed in August of
1999, therefore their operating results were not included in the comparable
period in 1998.

    If the merger is not consummated, MessageMedia expects operating expenses to
continue to be substantial as development and enhancement of technological
capabilities associated with its e-messaging solutions and software services
continue, as it explores opportunities to merge with or acquire complementary
businesses or technologies and as it adds employees to service its growing
customer base.

    Marketing and sales expenses. Marketing and sales expenses, which include
salaries, wages, consulting fees, advertising, trade shows, travel and other
marketing expenses, increased to approximately $21.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000, compared to approximately $9.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999. This increase is primarily due to growth in headcount in
sales, customer services and marketing staff as a result of increased sales
efforts related to MessageMedia's new e-messaging and e-intelligence solutions
and an incremental increase in headcount from the Decisive and Revnet
acquisitions and the startup of MessageMedia Europe, B.V. Additionally,
advertising and promotional spending increased as a result of promoting
MessageMedia's new services and products in both the United States and Europe.

    For the year ended December 31, 1999, marketing and sales expenses increased
to approximately $9.7 million compared to approximately $1.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 1998. This increase is primarily due to growth in
domestic sales, customer services and marketing headcount, and increased
advertising and promotional spending. Marketing and sales expense for the year
ended December 31, 1999 includes a one-time charge of approximately $855,000 in
compensation expense from acceleration of stock options. This compensation
expense relates to an employment agreement with a former officer, which included
an option vesting acceleration clause that was triggered upon MessageMedia
obtaining certain sales contracts and/or certain sales levels.

    Research, development and engineering expenses. Research, development and
engineering expenses, which include salaries, wages and consulting fees to
support the development, enhancement and maintenance of MessageMedia's products
and services, increased to approximately $6.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000, compared to approximately $4.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999. This increase is due to growth in headcount and related
compensation expense associated with MessageMedia's ongoing research,
development and engineering efforts.

    For the year ended December 31, 1999, research, development and engineering
expenses increased to approximately $4.9 million, compared to approximately $4.8
million for the year ended December 31, 1998. This increase is due to growth in
headcount and related compensation expense.

    General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses
consist primarily of salaries, wages, professional and consulting fees and other
expenses associated with the general management and administration of
MessageMedia. General and administrative expenses increased to approximately
$20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to $7.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase is primarily due to increases in
MessageMedia's

administrative staff and related compensation expense as a result of
MessageMedia's growth. Additionally, there was an incremental increase in
headcount and related expenses due to MessageMedia's acquisitions of Revnet and
Decisive and the startup of MessageMedia Europe, B.V.

    General and administrative expenses increased to approximately $7.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to $4.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 1998. This increase is primarily due to growth in headcount and
related compensation expense and general and administrative expenses associated
with the Revnet and Decisive acquisitions.

    Restructuring charges. In the fourth quarter of 2000, MessageMedia recorded
a charge of $7.0 million as a result of its decision to eliminate its e-services
line of business and reduce overhead by centralizing its Colorado offices to one
facility and reducing occupancy costs in its Chicago and San Francisco sales
offices. The restructuring charge includes $2.0 million in facilities related
expenses, $1.1 million in e-services contract terminations, $1.5 million of
employee severance and related expenses and $2.4 million in asset impairment
charges for e-services software and costs related to closing MessageMedia's
facilities.

    In the first quarter of 1999, MessageMedia recorded a charge of $1.0 million
as a result of its decision to relocate its corporate headquarters from San
Diego, California to a new facility in Boulder, Colorado. This decision was made
to create efficiencies in MessageMedia's e-messaging services operations, reduce
overhead by centralizing its offices to one facility and eliminate duplication
of efforts from similar positions in the separate offices. The merger
integration and restructuring activity of MessageMedia, DBits and EPub included
a company-wide staff reduction, which resulted in approximately $632,000 of
employee severance pay and other related expenses and approximately $393,000 in
moving expenses and costs related to closing the San Diego facility.

    In the second quarter of 1998, MessageMedia recorded a restructuring charge
of approximately $812,000 as a result of its decision to focus its efforts on
the messaging platform, initiate efforts to cease operations of its FVIPS and
better align its cost structure with expected revenue projections. The
restructuring activity included the elimination of job responsibilities company
wide, resulting in approximately $545,000 of employee severance pay and other
related expenses and approximately $267,000 of expenses related to relocating
its corporate office and termination fees for cancellation of certain contracts
related to FVIPS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2000 AND MARCH 31, 2001

    At March 31, 2001, MessageMedia had $14.0 million in cash and cash
equivalents, including $4.5 million in restricted cash. Of the $14.0 million,
$12.3 million was held by MessageMedia and $1.7 million by MessageMedia Europe,
B.V.

    On December 29, 2000, MessageMedia received a $3.0 million bank loan from
Wells Fargo and on February 22, 2001, MessageMedia raised $8.0 million in
funding from a private placement of MessageMedia's common stock to SOFTBANK
Venture Capital, Pequot Capital Management and Rebar LLC. Historically,
MessageMedia has experienced recurring losses and has been unable to generate
sufficient working capital needed to meet its cash needs. During 2000,
MessageMedia began restructuring its organization to reduce its expenditures on
infrastructure, including rent, salaries and other service expenses related to
its e-services division. There can be no assurance that the restructuring

of its organization will achieve the desired results or that revenues will
increase to the level necessary to generate positive cash flow from operations.
However, MessageMedia believes that the additional capital raised through the
February 2001 private placement will be sufficient to allow it to maintain its
operations at least through December 31, 2001. In addition, if MessageMedia is
unable to grow its revenues or obtain additional funding, it intends to further
limit expenditures in the areas of marketing, advertising, product development,
purchases of furniture and fixtures, salaries, bonuses and commissions.

    Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $8.9 million and
$8.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectfully.
Net operating cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2001 were
primarily attributable to net losses, increases in minority interest, settlement
of accounts payable and payment of restructuring charges offset by non-cash
charges for depreciation and amortization. Net operating cash flows for the
three months ended March 31, 2000 were primarily attributable to net losses
offset by non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization, as well as
increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses.

    Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $733,000 and $4.5
million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectfully.
Investing activities related to additions of furniture, computer equipment and
software.

    Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $7.6 million and
$3.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectfully.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31,
2001 related primarily to proceeds from the February 22, 2001 private placement
of MessageMedia's common stock to SOFTBANK Venture Capital, Pequot Capital
Management and Rebar LLC. Net cash provided by financing activities for the
three months ended March 31, 2000 related primarily to proceeds received from
the exercise of stock options.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000, DECEMBER 31, 1999 AND DECEMBER 31, 1998

    At December 31, 2000, MessageMedia had $15.8 million in cash and cash
equivalents, including $4.5 million in restricted cash. Of the $15.8 million,
$11.1 million was in the United States and $4.7 million in MessageMedia Europe,
B.V.

    Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $31.5 million, $19.0
million and $11.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998
respectively. Net operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2000 were
primarily attributable to net losses, and increases in minority interest and
accounts receivable, partially offset by non-cash charges for depreciation and
amortization, and increases in the restructuring reserve, accounts payable,
other accrued liabilities, and the write-off of furniture, equipment, and
software. Net operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 1999 resulted
from net losses, an increase in accounts receivable, and a decrease in other
accrued liabilities, offset by depreciation and amortization, and a decrease in
accrued compensation. Net operating cash flows for the year ended December 31,
1998 were primarily due to net losses offset by depreciation and amortization.

    Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $16.3 million, $1.7
million and $422,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. Investing activities related to additions to furniture, computer
equipment and software. For the year ended December 31, 1999, asset additions
were partially offset by cash acquired through the Revnet and Decisive
acquisitions.

    Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $21.5 million,
$54.0 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended
December 31, 2000 related primarily to proceeds from MessageMedia Europe, B.V.,
the exercise of stock options, and proceeds from the Wells Fargo bank loan. The
net cash flow from financing activities in 1999 primarily resulted from proceeds
from issuance of common stock as a result of two separate private placements of
equity in March 1999 and October 1999, and proceeds from the exercise of stock
options. Net cash flow from financing and activities in 1998 was primarily due
to proceeds from issuing common stock in a private placement and borrowings from
stockholders.

                       COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHTS

    DoubleClick and MessageMedia are both organized under the laws of the State
of Delaware and subject to the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation
Law, or the DGCL. Any differences, therefore, in the rights of holders of
DoubleClick capital stock and MessageMedia capital stock arise primarily from
differences in their respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws. After
the effective time of the merger, the rights of MessageMedia stockholders will
be determined by reference to DoubleClick's amended and restated certificate of
incorporation, as amended, and bylaws. The following is a summary of the
material differences in the rights of the stockholders of MessageMedia and the
rights of the stockholders of DoubleClick and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the DGCL and the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of
DoubleClick and MessageMedia.

NUMBER OF DIRECTORS; ELECTION AND REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

    DoubleClick may have not less than five nor more than fifteen directors. The
exact number of directors of DoubleClick is determined by its bylaws and is
currently eight persons. The board of directors of DoubleClick is divided into
three classes, each as nearly equal in number as possible, with one class being
elected annually to a three year term. A director may only be removed for cause
and only by the holders of more than two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote
at an election of directors.

    The number of directors of MessageMedia is determined by its bylaws and is
currently nine persons. Each director is elected annually to serve until the
annual meeting of stockholders held in the following fiscal year. A director may
be removed, either with or without cause, at any time, only by the holders of a
majority of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors.

MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    Special meetings of DoubleClick's board of directors may be called by
DoubleClick's President on two days' notice to each director by mail or 48
hours' notice to each director personally or by telegram. Upon the written
request of two directors (or, if there is only one director on the board, the
sole director), the President or Secretary must call a special meeting in the
same manner.

    Special meetings of MessageMedia's board of directors may be called by the
Chairman of the Board or by the President, any Vice President, the Secretary or
any two directors of MessageMedia. Advance notice of at least four days must be
given, if given by mail, or at least 48 hours, if given personally, by telephone
or by telegram.

ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS; SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

    The annual meeting of DoubleClick stockholders must be held on a date and at
a place fixed by the board of directors of DoubleClick. A special stockholders'
meeting may be called at any time by DoubleClick's President and must be called
by its President or Secretary at the request of two-thirds of the board of
directors. DoubleClick stockholders do not have the right to call a special
stockholders' meeting.

    The annual meeting of MessageMedia stockholders must be held on a date and
at a time designated by the board of directors of MessageMedia. In the absence
of such designation, the annual meeting of MessageMedia stockholders shall be
held on the twenty-first of March in each year at 9:00 a.m. A special
stockholders' meeting may be called at any time by the MessageMedia board of
directors, by a duly designated committee of the board of director with express
authority to call such a meeting or by one or more MessageMedia stockholders
holding shares in the aggregate entitled to cast not less than ten percent of
the votes cast at that meeting.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

    DoubleClick's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended,
provides that a DoubleClick stockholder wishing to bring business before the
annual stockholders' meeting must provide timely notice to DoubleClick's
Secretary at its principal executive offices. To be timely, the notice must be
received between 120 days and 150 days prior to the first anniversary of the
date of the proxy statement for the preceding year's annual meeting. If,
however, the date of the annual stockholders' meeting is more than 30 days
before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, or if no proxy
statement was delivered to the stockholders for the previous year's annual
meeting, notice

must be given between 90 and 60 days before the annual meeting or no later than
10 days following the day on which DoubleClick first made a public announcement
of the meeting date. If the number of directors to be elected to the DoubleClick
board is increased and DoubleClick has not made a public announcement naming all
of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased board at
least 70 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's
annual meeting (or, if the annual meeting is held more than 30 days before or
60 days after such anniversary date, at least 70 days prior to such annual
meeting), a notice would be timely with respect to nominees for any new
positions created by such increase, if it is received by DoubleClick's Secretary
no later than 10 days following the day on which DoubleClick makes such public
announcement. At a special meeting to elect directors to the board, a
stockholder who provides notice that is received by DoubleClick's Secretary
between 90 and 60 days before the date of the special meeting, or 90 days before
the date of the special meeting and 10 days after the date on which DoubleClick
makes a special announcement of the special meeting and the nominees proposed to
be elected.

    The stockholder's written notice must include:

     the name and record address of the stockholder;

     the number of shares owned beneficially or of record by the stockholder;
     and

     a brief description of the business to be discussed and the reasons why it
     should be discussed at the annual meeting.

    Although MessageMedia's amended and restated certificate of incorporation,
as amended, and bylaws are silent on the issue, under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, a stockholder wishing to bring business before the annual
stockholders' meeting must provide timely notice to MessageMedia's principal
executive offices not less than 120 days before the date that MessageMedia's
proxy statement was released to stockholders in connection with the previous
year's annual meeting. However, if there was no meeting the previous year, or if
the date of this year's annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 days
from the date of the previous year's meeting, then the deadline is a reasonable
time before MessageMedia begins to print and mail its proxy materials.

AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS

    DoubleClick's bylaws may be repealed, altered, amended or rescinded by the
vote of at least two-thirds of the board of directors or of the outstanding
shares entitled to vote in an election of directors, voting as one class, cast
at a meeting of stockholders called for that purpose.

    MessageMedia's bylaws may be adopted, amended or repealed by the vote of
only a majority of the board of directors or of the outstanding shares entitled
to vote in an election of directors.

                INCORPORATION OF CERTAIN DOCUMENTS BY REFERENCE

                                  (UNAUDITED)

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

    The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States (GAAP) for interim financial information and with instructions to
Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all
of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting
principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a
fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three-month
period ended March 31, 2001 are not necessarily indicative of the results that
may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2001.

    The balance sheet at December 31, 2000 has been derived from the audited
financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information
and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete
financial statements.

    For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and
footnotes thereto included in this proxy statement/prospectus.

2. JOINT VENTURE

    On March 13, 2000, we entered into a definitive agreement with @viso Limited
('@viso'), a strategic partnership between Vivendi and SOFTBANK Corp.
('SOFTBANK'), to create MessageMedia Europe B.V., Inc., a joint venture between
MessageMedia and @viso. Under terms of the joint venture agreement, we own 51%
and @viso owns 49% of MessageMedia Europe. The initial capitalization of the
joint venture was funded with $14.8 million during the second quarter. The
financial results of MessageMedia Europe are consolidated into our financial
statements. For the three months ended March 31, 2001, MessageMedia Europe
recorded revenue of approximately $841,000 and a loss after minority interest of
approximately $1.4 million. Our March 31, 2001 condensed consolidated balance
sheet includes total assets, including cash, of $10.1 million for MessageMedia
Europe.

    Recently, we and @viso initiated an evaluation of the strategic direction of
MessageMedia Europe and are considering potential alternatives to its current
business plan. Because we are only in the preliminary stages of evaluating
options, any potential change to the business of MessageMedia Europe cannot
presently be assessed, and there can be no assurance that the ultimate decision
of @viso and MessageMedia will not have a material adverse affect upon our
business.

3. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

    Other comprehensive income on the March 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000
balance sheets consists of a foreign currency translation loss related to
MessageMedia Europe of $114,000 and $296,000, respectfully.

4. BUSINESS SEGMENTS

    We analyze our business operations under two reportable segments based on
the definitions of segments provided under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 131: messaging and software and related services. We do not have
any intersegment revenue, and we evaluate segment performance based on gross
profit.

5. RESTRUCTURE CHARGE

    In the fourth quarter of the year 2000, we recorded a charge of $7.0 million
as a result of the decision to eliminate the e-services line of business, and
reduce overhead by centralizing our Colorado offices to one facility, and
reducing our occupancy costs in our Chicago and San Francisco sales offices. The
restructuring charge includes $2.0 million in facilities related expenses, $1.1
million in e-services contract terminations, $1.5 million of employee severance
and related expenses for 125 employees, and $2.4 million in asset impairment
charges for e-services software and costs related to closing our facilities.

    Under the 2000 restructure plan, we have made total payments, disposals and
reversals as follows (in thousands):

                                                                                         BALANCE AT

    We estimate that most of the future cash expenditures related to this plan
will be made by December 31, 2001.

6. CHANGES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE

    On February 22, 2001, we sold 11,267,606 shares of our common stock to seven
accredited investors, including affiliates of SOFTBANK Venture Capital, Pequot
Capital Management, Inc. and Rebar, LLC, for an aggregate purchase price of
$8,000,000.26. The sale of the common stock was not registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in reliance on Section 4(2) and/or
Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The securities were not offered or sold by
any form of general solicitation and the purchasers represented their intention
to acquire the securities for investment purposes only and not with a view
toward the distribution thereof. No earlier than May 22, 2001, we will file a
Registration Statement on Form S-3 covering the resale of such securities if
requested by the purchasers.

7. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

    As part of our continuing focus on cost containment, on April 17, 2001, we
reduced our domestic headcount by 21 percent. We anticipate that this reduction
in headcount will reduce our U.S. quarterly operating expenses during the third
quarter of 2001.

    An assessment of the adequacy of the 2000 restructure plan will be
completed during the second quarter of 2001. Any adjustment to the reserve
will be recorded in the second quarter of 2001.

     On May 9, 2001, MessageMedia and @viso agreed to effect an orderly
liquidation of MessageMedia Europe, B.V. Pursuant to that agreement, the
parties released each other from all claims, liabilities and demands relating
to, among other things, the formation and operation of the joint venture.
The initial capital to effect the liquidation of the joint venture was
provided by @viso, and MessageMedia issued two promissory notes to @viso in
the aggregate principal amount of $4.5 million. The promissory notes
and accrued interest at 10% per annum mature in December 2003, or become
immediately due and payable upon a change in control. The liquidation of
MessageMedia Europe, B.V. is expected to result in no loss to MessageMedia.

               REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors
MESSAGEMEDIA, INC.

    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
MessageMedia, Inc. as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial
statements are the responsibility of MessageMedia's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of MessageMedia,
Inc. at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.

    As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, MessageMedia changed its
method of recognizing revenue in 2000.
