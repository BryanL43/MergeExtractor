                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q: WHAT IS THE MERGER?

A: In the merger, Interland will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Micron
   Electronics. Based on the capitalization of Micron Electronics and Interland
   as of March 31, 2001 and assuming no adjustments to the exchange ratio, the
   shareholders of Interland will receive a number of shares of Micron
   Electronics common stock representing approximately 30% of Micron
   Electronics' outstanding common stock, subject to adjustment under the
   circumstances described below.

Q: WHAT WILL INTERLAND'S SHAREHOLDERS RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A: Interland's shareholders will receive 0.8610 shares of Micron Electronics
   common stock for each share of Interland common stock they own, subject to
   adjustment under the circumstances described below. Micron Electronics will
   not issue fractional shares of stock. Therefore, Interland's shareholders
   will receive cash based on the market price of Micron Electronics common
   stock on the day prior to the effectiveness of the merger instead of any
   fractional share. For example, if the exchange ratio remains 0.8610, a holder
   of 100 shares of Interland common stock will receive 86 shares of Micron
   Electronics common stock and an amount of cash equal to 0.1 times the market
   price of a share of Micron Electronics common stock on the day prior to the
   effectiveness of the merger.

   The total number of shares of Micron Electronics common stock to be issued
   for each share of Interland common stock will not be adjusted based upon
   changes in the value of the shares of Micron Electronics or Interland common
   stock. As a result, the dollar value of the shares that Interland's
   shareholders will receive in the merger will not be known prior to the time
   of the merger and may go up or down as the market price of Micron Electronics
   common stock goes up or down. The merger agreement cannot be terminated based
   solely on changes in the value of Interland or Micron Electronics common
   stock.

Q: WILL THE EXCHANGE RATIO FOR INTERLAND SHAREHOLDERS BE ADJUSTED?

A: The exchange ratio cannot be decreased. The exchange ratio could be increased
   if Micron Electronics has less than $200.0 million in cash and cash
   equivalents, including any amounts to be received by Micron Electronics for
   tax refunds, on the date of the closing of the merger, less the amount of any
   reserves for liabilities unrelated to Micron Electronics' HostPro business.
   The amount of any loan made to Interland by Micron Electronics under the
   bridge loan described in this document will count towards this $200.0 million
   amount for purposes of determining whether the exchange ratio will be
   increased. Annex D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus describes how the
   level of Micron Electronics' cash and cash equivalents, less any reserves and
   bridge loans, at the closing could affect the exchange ratio.

Q: DO THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF INTERLAND AND MICRON ELECTRONICS RECOMMEND
   VOTING IN FAVOR OF THE PROPOSALS DESCRIBED IN THIS DOCUMENT?

A: Yes. After careful consideration, Interland's board of directors recommends
   that its shareholders vote in favor of the merger agreement and the proposed
   merger. Likewise, after careful consideration, Micron Electronics' board of
   directors recommends that its shareholders vote in favor of the issuance of
   Micron Electronics common stock in the merger, the amendments to its articles
   of incorporation, the amendments to its bylaws, the increase in the size of
   the board of directors and the election of the three new directors.

   For a more complete description of the recommendations of the boards of
   directors of both companies, see the sections entitled "The Merger and
   Related Transactions -- Micron Electronics' reasons for the merger" on page
   48, "-- Recommendation of the Micron Electronics board of directors" on page
   49, "-- Interland's reasons for the merger" on page 50 and "-- Recommendation
   of the Interland board of directors" on page 52.

Q: WHAT IS HAPPENING TO MICRON ELECTRONICS' PC SYSTEMS BUSINESS?

A: On April 30, 2001, Micron Electronics entered into a definitive agreement to
   sell its PC Systems business to GTG PC Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of the
   Gores Technology Group. Under the terms of the agreement, GTG PC will receive
   assets and assume liabilities of the PC Systems business, and Micron
   Electronics will also make a $70.0 million cash contribution to the business.
   Micron Electronics is required to meet certain working capital requirements
   based on the net assets and liabilities to be transferred to GTG PC. An
   additional capital contribution may be required if Micron Electronics does
   not meet these working capital requirements.

   For a more complete description of the sale of the PC Systems business to GTG
   PC, see the section entitled "Recent Development with Respect to Micron
   Electronics" on page 118.

Q: WHAT IS HAPPENING TO MICRON ELECTRONICS' SPECTEK BUSINESS?

A: On April 5, 2001, Micron Electronics sold its SpecTek component recovery
   business and other real property and intellectual property assets, to Micron
   Technology, Inc., the parent company of Micron Electronics. Micron Technology
   was entitled to purchase the SpecTek business under an existing component
   recovery agreement, originally entered into by the parties in September 1999
   and amended in November 2000.

Q: WILL MICRON ELECTRONICS' SHAREHOLDERS BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE ANY
   CONSIDERATION IN THE MERGER OR ANY OTHER CASH PAYMENTS AND WHEN?

A: Micron Electronics shareholders will not receive any consideration in the
   merger, but will continue to own their shares of Micron Electronics common
   stock after the merger.

   It is possible that Micron Electronics shareholders may receive a cash
   payment after the closing of the merger. To the extent that Micron
   Electronics has a specified amount of excess cash at the merger closing or
   receives net proceeds from the sale of its PC Systems business within three
   years after the closing of the sale of the PC Systems business, the Micron
   Electronics shareholders of record as of the close of trading on the closing
   date for the merger may be entitled to receive pro rata cash payments.
   However, any excess cash and net sales proceeds must be held in escrow for
   six months after the closing of the merger to fund liabilities that are
   unrelated to the HostPro business. The right to receive any cash payments is
   granted to these persons individually, is not transferable and will not
   attach to or trade with the common stock of Micron Electronics. The Interland
   shareholders will not receive any of those cash payments.

   A number of other factors may affect whether funds will be available to make
   these payments. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
   Micron Electronics does not currently expect that a cash payment will be
   made. For a more complete description of the possible cash payments, see the
   section entitled "The Merger and Related Transactions -- Potential cash
   payment to Micron Electronics' shareholders" on page 71.

Q: ARE THERE RISKS I SHOULD CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHETHER TO VOTE FOR THE MERGER?

A: Yes. For example, the number of shares of Micron Electronics common stock
   that Interland shareholders will receive will not be adjusted based on
   changes in the market price of Micron Electronics or Interland common stock
   before the completion of the merger. We urge you to obtain current market
   quotations of Micron Electronics common stock and Interland common stock.

   In evaluating the merger, you should also carefully consider this and other
   factors discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page
   20.

Q: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A: Mail your signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as
   possible so that your shares may be represented at your meeting. If you do
   not include instructions on how to vote your properly signed proxy, your
   shares will be voted "FOR" approval of the merger and approval and adoption
   of the merger agreement (for Interland's shareholders) or "FOR" approval of
   the issuance of shares of Micron Electronics common stock in the merger, the
   amendment to the Micron Electronics articles of incorporation, the amendments
   to the bylaws, the increase in the size of the Micron Electronics board of
   directors and the election of the three additional Micron Electronics
   directors (for Micron Electronics' shareholders).

   For a more complete description of voting at the meetings, see the sections
   entitled "The Micron Electronics Special Meeting -- Voting of proxies" on
   page 40 and "The Interland Special Meeting -- Voting of proxies" on page 42.

Q: WHAT DO I DO IF I WANT TO CHANGE MY VOTE?

A: If you want to change your vote, send the secretary of Micron Electronics or
   Interland, as appropriate, a later-dated, signed proxy card before your
   meeting or attend your meeting in person. You may also revoke your proxy by
   sending written notice to the secretary of Micron Electronics or Interland,
   as appropriate, before your meeting.

   For a more complete description of how to change your vote, see the sections
   entitled "The Micron Electronics Special Meeting -- Voting of proxies" on
   page 40 and "The Interland Special Meeting -- Voting of proxies" on page 42.

Q: IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
   SHARES FOR ME?

A: Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to
   vote by following the information provided to you by your broker.

   For a more complete description of how to vote your shares, see the sections
   entitled "The Micron Electronics Special Meeting -- Voting of proxies" on
   page 40 and "The Interland Special Meeting -- Voting of proxies" on page 42.

Q: I AM AN INTERLAND SHAREHOLDER, SHOULD I SEND IN MY INTERLAND STOCK
CERTIFICATES NOW?

A: No. After the merger is completed, Micron Electronics will send all Interland
   shareholders written instructions for exchanging their Interland stock
   certificates for Micron Electronics stock certificates.

Q: WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A: We are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. We hope
   to complete the merger during the third quarter of calendar year 2001.

   For a more complete description of the conditions to the merger, see the
   section entitled "The Merger Agreement -- Conditions to closing the merger"
   on page 82.

Q: WILL I RECOGNIZE A GAIN OR LOSS IN THE MERGER ON THE CONVERSION OF MY
INTERLAND SHARES?

A: We expect that if the merger is completed, Interland shareholders will not
   recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes on the
   conversion of their shares in the merger, except that Interland's
   shareholders will recognize gain or loss with respect to cash received
   instead of fractional shares. However, Interland's shareholders are urged to
   consult their own tax advisors to determine their particular tax
   consequences.

   For a more complete description of the tax consequences of the merger, see
   the section entitled "The Merger and Related Transactions -- Material United
   States federal income tax consequences of the merger" on page 72.

Q: AM I ENTITLED TO DISSENTERS' OR APPRAISAL RIGHTS?

A: No. Under Georgia law, holders of Interland common stock are not entitled to
   dissenters' or appraisal rights in the merger. Under Minnesota law, holders
   of Micron Electronics common stock are not entitled to dissenters' or
   appraisal rights with respect to the merger.

Q: WHOM SHOULD I CALL WITH QUESTIONS?

A: Interland's shareholders should call Interland Investor Relations at (877)
   216-3820 with any questions about the merger. Micron Electronics'
   shareholders should call Micron Electronics Investor Relations (213) 251-6502
   at with any questions about the merger.

   You may also obtain additional information about Micron Electronics from
   documents it files with the Securities and Exchange Commission by following
   the instructions in the section entitled "Where You Can Find More
   Information" on page 1.

     Micron Electronics, through its HostPro subsidiary, is a leading Web
hosting company that offers a broad range of business-to-business Internet
products and services, including managed dedicated hosting services, co-location
and connectivity services, electronic commerce services, application hosting,
and other Web hosting products.

     Micron Electronics operates state-of-the-art data centers in Los Angeles,
California; Seattle, Washington; Moses Lake, Washington; Boca Raton, Florida;
and Boise, Idaho, that provide Web and application hosting products and services
specifically designed to meet the needs of small-and medium-sized businesses.
Micron Electronics manages more than 114,000 paid hosted Web sites and more than
57,000 paid hosting accounts.

     Micron Electronics historically operated in three business segments: PC
Systems, SpecTek and HostPro. The primary products of the PC Systems business
included a range of desktop and notebook computer systems, multiprocessor
network servers and hardware services. SpecTek processed and marketed various
grades of memory products in either component or module form for specific
applications. HostPro focused on the Internet access and Web hosting products
and services.

     The operations of SpecTek were transferred to Micron Technology, Micron
Electronics' parent company, on April 5, 2001. On April 30, 2001, Micron
Electronics entered into a definitive agreement to sell its PC Systems business
to GTG PC Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of the Gores Technology Group. As a result
of the disposition of the SpecTek business and following the expected
disposition of the PC Systems business, the operations of HostPro will
constitute the business of Micron Electronics.

     Interland provides a broad range of Web and applications hosting, managed
services and other related Web-based business solutions specifically designed to
meet the needs of small to medium-sized businesses. Interland's Web hosting
services include the computer hardware, software, network technology and systems
management necessary to support its customers' Web sites. Through application
hosting services, Interland deploys, configures and supports various software
applications that customers can access over the Internet. Interland's managed
services include system administration, data backup and recovery, and network
monitoring.

     Interland's Web hosting business began in September 1997 and as of March
31, 2001 had approximately 54,000 customer accounts. During this time, Interland
has developed key strategic relationships with Microsoft, Verizon, and VeriSign,
all of which have made equity investments in Interland. In addition, Interland
has a private label distribution relationship with Road Runner. Interland also
has strong business relationships with leading technology providers including
Cisco, Cobalt Networks, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Red Hat, Internet Security
Systems, Veritas and Open Wave.

     Interland bases its hosting services mainly on the Microsoft NT and Red Hat
Linux operating systems. Interland generally sells services to customers under
fully pre-paid contracts that are typically between three months and two years
in length. Interland's operations are currently carried out in a single data
center located in Atlanta, Georgia. This data center is located in close
proximity to the major access points of Internet connectivity providers.

                           SUMMARY OF THE TRANSACTION

THE MERGER

     In the merger, Interland and a wholly owned subsidiary of Micron
Electronics will merge, and as a result, Interland will survive the merger and
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Micron Electronics. At the closing of the
merger Micron Electronics' name will be changed to Interland, Inc.

     The merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus
as Annex A. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully.

NO OTHER NEGOTIATIONS

     Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated,
Interland has agreed, with limited exceptions, not to take any direct or
indirect action with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, as defined on page 81
of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

     If Interland receives an unsolicited, written, bona fide Acquisition
Proposal that its board of directors reasonably concludes may constitute a
Superior Offer, as defined on page 81 of this document, based on written advice
of a financial advisor of national standing, Interland may furnish non-public
information regarding itself and may enter into discussions with the person or
group who has made the Acquisition Proposal if it provides written notice to
Micron Electronics and follows other specified procedures. These procedures
include the conclusion of Interland's board of directors that, after
consultation with its outside counsel, action is required in order to comply
with its fiduciary obligations to Interland's shareholders. Interland has agreed
to inform Micron Electronics promptly as to any Acquisition Proposal or request
for non-public information or inquiry that it reasonably believes would lead to
an Acquisition Proposal. Interland has also agreed to inform Micron Electronics
of the status and details of any Acquisition Proposal.

     The merger agreement permits the board of directors of Interland to change
its recommendation to vote in favor of the merger if it receives a Superior
Offer and Micron Electronics does not respond with a corresponding offer at
least as favorable as the Superior Offer.

     For a more complete description of these limitations on each of our actions
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, please refer to the sections entitled
"The Merger Agreement -- No other negotiations," on page 80, "-- Termination of
the merger agreement" on page 84 and "-- Termination fee" on page 86 of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and the corresponding sections of the merger
agreement.

CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

     The completion of the merger depends upon both companies meeting a number
of conditions, including:

     - Interland's shareholders must approve the merger and approve and adopt
       the merger agreement;

     - Micron Electronics' shareholders must approve the issuance of the shares
       of Micron Electronics common stock to be issued in the merger, as well as
       the amendment to Micron Electronics' articles of incorporation and
       bylaws, the increase in the size of the Micron Electronics board of
       directors and the election of the three directors described in this joint
       proxy statement/prospectus;

     - no governmental entity shall have enacted a law, regulation or order that
       has the effect of making the merger illegal;

     - the representations and warranties of each of us in the merger agreement
       must be true and correct;

     - we must have complied in all material respects with our agreements in the
       merger agreement;

     - no material adverse effect with respect to the HostPro business or
       Interland shall have occurred;

     - all consents and approvals, which if not obtained would have a material
       adverse effect on the combined company and its subsidiaries, must have
       been obtained; and

     - the employment agreement by and between Micron Electronics and Kenneth
       Gavranovic dated April 22, 2001 will be in effect. Mr. Gavranovic will
       become the vice chairman and chief technical officer of the combined

       agreement; or

     - if the conditions to completion of the merger would not be satisfied (1)
       because of a breach of an agreement in the merger agreement by the other,

          INTERLAND'S SELECTED CONSOLIDATED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA

     The following selected consolidated historical financial data of Interland
as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the consolidated statements of operations
data for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, are derived from
Interland's audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, which have been audited by Arthur Andersen
LLP, independent public accountants. The consolidated statement of operations
data for the period from inception (September 18, 1997) to December 31, 1997 are
derived from Interland's consolidated financial statements not appearing in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, which have been audited by Arthur Andersen,
LLP, independent public accountants. The consolidated statements of operations
data for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, and the consolidated
balance sheet data as of March 31, 2001, are derived from unaudited consolidated
financial statements. Interland prepared the unaudited information on the same
basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and included all
adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that Interland
considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and
operating results as of this date and for these periods. These historical
results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in any future
period, and results for the three months ended March 31, 2001 are not
necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year.

(1) Adjusted EBITDA consists of net loss excluding interest income (expense),
    net, and depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to exclude
    non-cash stock compensation expense and non-cash operating expenses incurred
    as a result of the issuance of equity securities in connection with
    strategic relationships in the total amount of $0, $3.6 million and $6.1
    million for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively,
    and $1.4 million and $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2000
    and 2001, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent funds available
    for discretionary use and is not intended to represent cash flow from
    operations as measured under generally accepted accounting principles.
    Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or
    net cash used in operating activities, but may be useful to investors as an
    indication of operating performance. Interland's calculations of Adjusted
    EBITDA may not be consistent with similarly titled calculations used by
    other companies.

      Book value per equivalent Interland common share(2).....       $ 2.88

- -------------------------
(1) The historical book value per share is computed by dividing shareholders'
    equity by the number of shares of common stock outstanding at August 31,
    2000 and March 1, 2001 for Micron Electronics and at December 31, 2000 and
    March 31, 2001 for Interland. The combined pro forma book value per share is
    computed by dividing pro forma shareholders' equity by the pro forma number
    of shares of common stock outstanding at March 1, 2001 of 137.6 million.

(2) The Interland equivalent pro forma combined per share amounts are calculated
    by multiplying the combined pro forma share amounts by the assumed exchange
    ratio of 0.861.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     The merger involves a high degree of risk. Also, by voting in favor of the
merger, Interland's shareholders will be choosing to invest in Micron
Electronics common stock. An investment in Micron Electronics common stock
involves a high degree of risk. Both Micron Electronics' and Interland's
shareholders should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition
to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this
document, in deciding whether to vote for the merger. The risks described below
are not the only risks Micron Electronics and Interland face. Additional risks
that either company is unaware of or that it currently believes are immaterial
may become important factors that affect the combined company's business. Any of
these risks could result in serious harm to the combined company's business,
operating results and financial condition. The trading price of Micron
Electronics common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may
lose all or part of your investment.

     This document contains and incorporates by reference forward-looking
statements within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current
expectations that involve a number of uncertainties. Actual results could differ
materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see
the section entitled "Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information" on page
156.

                      RISKS RELATED TO THE PROPOSED MERGER

CHANGES IN THE TRADING PRICE OF MICRON ELECTRONICS COMMON STOCK OR INTERLAND
COMMON STOCK WILL NOT AFFECT THE EXCHANGE RATIO.

     The exchange ratio will not be adjusted for fluctuations in the trading
price of Micron Electronics common stock or Interland common stock. As a result,
the specific dollar value of Micron Electronics common stock that Interland
shareholders will receive upon the completion of the merger will depend on the
market value of Micron Electronics common stock at the time of the merger. The
share price of Micron Electronics common stock is subject to price fluctuations
in the market and has experienced significant volatility. Micron Electronics
cannot predict the market price for its common stock at any time before or after
the merger closes. You are strongly encouraged to obtain current market
quotations of Micron Electronics and Interland common stock, which are quoted on
the Nasdaq National Market.

IF MICRON ELECTRONICS DOES NOT MAINTAIN SPECIFIED CASH BALANCES, THE EXCHANGE
RATIO FOR THE SHARES OF INTERLAND TO BE EXCHANGED IN THE MERGER WILL BE ADJUSTED
OR THE MERGER COULD BE TERMINATED.

     The exchange ratio of 0.8610 shares of Micron Electronics common stock for
each outstanding share of Interland common stock will be increased if the cash
and cash equivalents of Micron Electronics, less any reserves related to Micron
Electronics' PC Systems or SpecTek businesses -- the Net Available Cash -- are
less than $200.0 million at the time of the merger closing. The exchange ratio
could increase to as high as 2.3676 shares of Micron Electronics common stock
for each share of Interland common stock, if the Net Available Cash balance
drops below $10.0 million. A schedule of the possible adjustments to the
exchange ratio has been included as Annex D to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. If the exchange ratio is increased, holders of Interland
stock would receive more shares of Micron Electronics stock in the merger, which
would dilute the current holders of Micron Electronics common stock.

     In addition, if the Net Available Cash amount is less than $100.0 million
at the merger closing, then Interland will have the right to terminate the
merger agreement. However, this termination right may not be exercised by
Interland if it has been advanced more than $10.0 million by Micron Electronics
under a bridge loan and security agreement entered into in connection with the
merger agreement.

MICRON ELECTRONICS DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT ITS SHAREHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE
A DISTRIBUTION OF CASH.

     The merger agreement provides that to the extent that Micron Electronics
has cash and cash equivalents greater than $200.0 million, less specified
liabilities at the time of the closing of the merger, the record holders of
Micron Electronics common stock as of the close of trading on the closing date
of

the merger may be entitled to receive pro rata payments of that cash. Micron
Electronics does not currently expect that any distribution will be made. In
addition, the merger agreement provides that those holders may also be entitled
to receive distributions of any net proceeds to Micron Electronics from the sale
of its PC Systems business. Micron Electronics may under specified circumstances
share in proceeds received, if any, after payment of specified liabilities or
reserves by GTG PC if GTG PC sells or liquidates that business within three
years of the closing of the sale to GTG PC. Micron Electronics cannot assure you
that any distribution to Micron Electronics' shareholders will be made from
these proceeds. Even if Micron Electronics has excess cash or if there are any
proceeds from the sale of the PC Systems business, the distribution of these
funds is subject to a number of restrictions. The former Interland shareholders
will not be entitled to receive any of these cash distributions. See "The Merger
and Related Transactions -- Potential cash payment to Micron Electronics'
shareholders" on page 71 for a further description of this payment right.

IF THE COSTS OF DISPOSING OF MICRON ELECTRONICS' NON-HOSTING BUSINESSES, OR IF
MICRON ELECTRONICS' UNKNOWN COSTS AND LIABILITIES AFTER THE MERGER ARE GREATER
THAN ESTIMATED, THE SHAREHOLDERS OF INTERLAND COULD BE DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMED
BY ANY DISTRIBUTION OF CASH OR SALES PROCEEDS BY MICRON ELECTRONICS TO ITS
CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS.

     Any cash that may be received by Micron Electronics shareholders will
depend upon estimates of the costs of disposing of the PC Systems business and
of other costs associated with, or liabilities related to, the portions of
Micron Electronics' business other than its Web hosting business. These costs
and liabilities will include estimates and will be based on generally accepted
accounting principles, and the actual costs incurred by Micron Electronics after
the merger may differ, perhaps significantly, from these estimates. The current
Interland shareholders will not participate in any of these cash distributions.
If Micron Electronics underestimates these costs and makes cash payments to the
Micron Electronics shareholders based on these underestimated costs, the
Interland shareholders could be disproportionately harmed.

IF MICRON ELECTRONICS DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THE OPERATIONS AND
PERSONNEL OF INTERLAND IN A TIMELY MANNER, THIS WILL DISRUPT THE COMBINED
COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT ITS OPERATING RESULTS.

     Micron Electronics' acquisition of Interland involves risks related to the
integration and management of Interland's operations and personnel with those of
HostPro. The integration of Micron Electronics and Interland will be a complex,
time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt the businesses of both
companies if not completed in a timely and efficient manner. After the merger,
the combined company must operate as a combined organization utilizing common
information and telecommunication systems, operating procedures, financial
controls and human resources practices.

     Micron Electronics and Interland may encounter substantial difficulties,
costs and delays involved in integrating their operations, including:

     - potential incompatibility of business cultures;

     - perceived adverse changes in business focus;

     - potential conflicts in marketing or other important relationships;

     - potential operating inefficiencies and increased costs associated with
       having and integrating different information and telecommunications
       systems currently used by each of HostPro and Interland;

     - potential decline in the level of customer service and customer
       satisfaction; and

     - the loss of key employees and diversion of the attention of management
       from other ongoing business concerns.

     Micron Electronics' headquarters are located in Boise, Idaho, while
Interland's headquarters are located in Atlanta, Georgia. The combined company
will be headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Micron Electronics' integration of
Interland's operations and personnel may be difficult due to the geographic

distance between the two companies. In addition, Micron Electronics has
completed a number of acquisitions of hosting companies and is still in the
process of completing the integration of these businesses. This could make the
integration of Micron Electronics and Interland more difficult. If this
integration effort is not successful, then results of operations could be
adversely affected, employee morale could decline, key employees could leave and
customers could cancel existing orders or choose not to place new ones. In
addition, the attention and effort devoted to the integration of the two
companies will significantly divert management's attention from other important
issues, such as expansion of the combined company's customer base, which could
negatively affect the business and operating results of the combined company.

THE BENEFITS OF THE MERGER MAY BE LOWER THAN EXPECTED AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED
WITH THE MERGER COULD BE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED, WHICH COULD HARM THE FINANCIAL
RESULTS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY AND CAUSE A DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF MICRON
ELECTRONICS COMMON STOCK.

     Micron Electronics and Interland expect to realize cost reductions due to
synergies created by merging the two companies in areas such as integration and
expansion of nationwide technical support capabilities over a larger customer
base, integration of information and telecommunication systems, marketing the
larger combined business, elimination of excess data center capacity and
economies of scale for the combined company's telecommunications costs. Although
Micron Electronics and Interland expect that they will realize cost synergies
with the merger, we cannot state the amount with any certainty. Micron
Electronics and Interland estimate that they will incur direct transaction costs
of approximately $7.7 million associated with the merger. Micron Electronics
expects to incur additional costs associated with the consolidation and
integration of the companies' products and operations. Micron Electronics cannot
accurately estimate these costs at this time. If the total costs of the merger
and related consolidation and integration exceed estimates, or if the cost
synergies of the merger are less than expected, the financial results of the
combined company would suffer. Any shortfall in anticipated operating results of
the combined company could cause the market price of Micron Electronics common
stock to decline. In addition, the market price of Micron Electronics common
stock could decline significantly if Micron Electronics does not experience the
business benefits of the merger as quickly or in as great an amount as
securities analysts expect.

THE MERGER COULD HARM KEY CUSTOMER AND THIRD-PARTY RELATIONSHIPS.

     The proposed merger could harm relationships with customers and other third
parties with whom HostPro and Interland do business. For example, the
continuance of HostPro's and Interland's customer relationships is generally
based on continued customer goodwill and satisfaction rather than long-term
orders or other contractual commitments. Customers might postpone or cancel
sales orders for the combined company's services if they perceive that customer
services and support would decline as a result of the merger. Any changes in
customer relationships could harm the combined company's business. HostPro's and
Interland's customers and other third parties may, in response to the
announcement of the merger, delay or defer decisions concerning using the
combined company as their service provider.

MICRON ELECTRONICS WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING CHARGES RELATING TO THE
ACQUISITION OF INTERLAND, WHICH WILL DELAY PROJECTED ACHIEVEMENT OF
PROFITABILITY FOR THE WEB HOSTING BUSINESS.

     Micron Electronics will account for the acquisition of Interland using the
purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method, the purchase price of
Interland will be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from
Interland. As a result, based on an approximate purchase price of $125.2
million, Micron Electronics expects to record approximately $80.2 million of
intangible assets and goodwill from the Interland acquisition on its balance
sheet, which will result in annual amortization expense of approximately $25.9
million in fiscal 2002. These charges will delay projected achievement of
profitability for the combined company.

MICRON ELECTRONICS PRO FORMA ACCOUNTING FOR THE INTERLAND MERGER MAY CHANGE.

     Micron Electronics has allocated the total estimated purchase price for the
Interland merger on a preliminary basis for pro forma presentation purposes to
assets and liabilities based on Micron Electronics' current best estimates of
the fair value of these assets and liabilities, with the excess costs over the
net assets acquired allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. This
allocation is subject to change pending a final analysis of the fair values of
the assets acquired and reported liabilities assumed. The impact of these
changes could, for example, reduce the combined company's reported future
earnings or otherwise have a material, negative impact on Micron Electronics'
future results of operations.

THE MERGER COULD RESULT IN EMPLOYEES AT MICRON ELECTRONICS AND INTERLAND
DECIDING TO LEAVE THEIR EMPLOYMENT BEFORE AND AFTER COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

     After the merger, integration of the businesses of HostPro and Interland
could result in changes in the culture and operations of both companies that
could cause the combined company to lose key employees. The success of the
combined company will depend in part upon its ability to attract and retain
highly skilled technical, managerial and sales and marketing personnel. The loss
of key employees at any Interland or HostPro office could adversely impact
Interland's or HostPro's overall financial results, which could have a negative
impact on the operating results of the combined company after the merger.
Competition for such personnel is intense. After the merger, the combined
company may not be able to hire or retain the necessary personnel to complete
the integration process and implement its business strategy. In addition, the
combined company may need to pay higher compensation for employees than it
currently expects.

IF MEMBERS OF HOSTPRO'S OR INTERLAND'S MANAGEMENT LEAVE, THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS
OF THE MERGER MAY NOT BE REALIZED AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMBINED
COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS.

     The combined company will be managed by top executives from Micron
Electronics, HostPro and Interland. Success of the merger will depend, in
significant part, on the continued services of HostPro's and Interland's senior
management personnel and of its key technical and sales personnel. Micron
Electronics and Interland experience strong competition for these personnel in
the Web hosting industry, and Interland and HostPro have lost some senior
management and sales personnel to competitors. If members of the combined
company's anticipated management were to terminate their employment with HostPro
or Interland, the ability of the combined company to manage its business and
workforce after the merger would be harmed and its operations could be
disrupted, and the benefits that the combined company anticipates from the
merger could be prevented or deferred. While Micron Electronics and Interland
have employment agreements with some members of their senior management, they
cannot assure you that any incentives included as part of these agreements will
be sufficient to retain these employees.

FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE MERGER COULD HARM MICRON ELECTRONICS' AND INTERLAND'S
STOCK PRICES AND EACH COMPANY'S FUTURE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS.

     The merger is subject to several closing conditions, including approval by
Interland's and Micron Electronics' shareholders, and we cannot assure you that
the merger will be successfully completed. In the event that the merger is not
successfully completed, Interland and Micron Electronics may be subject to a
number of material risks, including the following:

     - Interland may be required to pay Micron Electronics a termination fee of
       up to $5.6 million if Micron Electronics or Interland terminates the
       merger agreement because Interland breached the agreement;

     - Micron Electronics may be required to pay Interland a termination fee of
       up to $3.5 million, if Interland or Micron Electronics terminates the
       merger agreement because Micron Electronics' shareholders have not
       approved the proposals to be voted upon by them at the Micron Electronics
       special meeting;

     - If Interland borrows under the bridge loan and security agreement, it
       will be required to immediately repay loans of up to $20.0 million that
       may be borrowed from Micron Electronics if the merger closing does not
       occur;

     - the trading price of Micron Electronics common stock may decline to the
       extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that
       the merger will be completed; and

     - costs related to the proposed merger, such as legal, accounting and
       financial advisory fees and employee retention bonuses, must be paid by
       each of the parties, even if the merger is not completed.

     If the merger is not completed, either company may be unable to restore the
status of its business as it existed prior to the announcement of the merger.
Furthermore, if the merger is not completed and Interland's board of directors
determines to seek another merger or business combination, it may not be able to
find a partner willing to pay an equivalent or more attractive price than that
which would have been paid in the merger with Micron Electronics.

HOSTPRO CUSTOMERS MAY REACT ADVERSELY TO MICRON ELECTRONICS' PLANS TO CHANGE THE
NAME OF ITS WEB HOSTING BUSINESS AND THE COMBINED COMPANY TO "INTERLAND."

     To the extent that existing customers of HostPro identify with the
"HostPro" brand name or do not identify with the "Interland" brand name, those
customers could choose to terminate their relationships with HostPro. A
significant loss of customers could adversely affect the operating results of
the combined company.

                     RISKS RELATED TO THE COMBINED COMPANY

HOSTPRO AND INTERLAND HAVE INCURRED LOSSES SINCE INCEPTION, AND WE EXPECT THE
COMBINED COMPANY TO INCUR LOSSES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

     Both HostPro and Interland incurred net losses and losses from operations
for each period from inception through the first six months of fiscal 2001. As
of March 1, 2001, HostPro had accumulated net losses of approximately $43.0
million, and as of March 31, 2000, Interland had accumulated net losses of
approximately $103.1 million. Neither company has achieved profitability to
date, and we do not expect the combined company to generate positive cash flow
from operations for at least one year. Operating expenses could increase as a
result of expanding and adapting network infrastructure, increasing sales and
marketing efforts, broadening customer support capabilities, integrating the
Interland and HostPro businesses and expanding administrative resources in
anticipation of future growth. To the extent that increases in expenses are not
offset by increased revenues, the results of operations and financial condition
of the combined business would be materially adversely affected. Even if the
combined company achieves profitability, it may not be able to sustain or
increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.

MICRON ELECTRONICS' HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION WILL NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE
OF ITS FUTURE RESULTS.

     Given Micron Electronics' plans to sell its non-hosting businesses, its
historical financial information contained in previous filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission will not be representative of its future
operating results. Including the operations of the non-hosting
businesses -- which are now classified as discontinued operations in Micron
Electronics' financial statements -- HostPro's revenues represented less than 3%
for fiscal 2000, and less than 5% for the second quarter of fiscal 2001, of
Micron Electronics' total revenues. HostPro's costs and expenses, which are
reflected in Micron Electronics' financial statements as continuing operations
of Micron Electronics, include allocations of infrastructure costs

associated with HostPro's use of or benefit from centralized corporate services
provided by Micron Electronics, including:

     - information technology;

     - telecommunications;

     - accounting, tax and treasury;

     - human resources;

     - legal; and

     - insurance.

     Accordingly, the historical financial information of HostPro included or
incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus does not
necessarily reflect what HostPro's financial position, results of operations and
cash flows would have been had HostPro been a separate entity during the periods
presented. As a result, you should not rely upon this historical financial
information as an indication of the future financial results of the HostPro
business or the combined company.

HOSTPRO AND INTERLAND HAVE LIMITED OPERATING HISTORIES AND THEIR BUSINESS MODELS
ARE STILL EVOLVING, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE THE PROSPECTS OF THE
COMBINED ENTITY AND THE BENEFITS OF THE MERGER TO MICRON ELECTRONICS AND
INTERLAND.

     HostPro's and Interland's limited operating histories make evaluating their
business operations and prospects difficult. HostPro was grown, in part, through
the acquisition of four separate hosting and Internet service provider companies
during the period from August 1999 through March 2000. Interland commenced
operations in September 1997. HostPro's and Interland's range of service
offerings have changed since their inception and their business models are still
new and developing. Because some of HostPro's and Interland's services are new,
the market for them is uncertain. As a result, the revenue and income potential
of the combined company's business and the potential benefits of the merger may
be difficult to evaluate.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE AND ITS FUTURE
REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY ARE UNCERTAIN.

     HostPro's and Interland's past operating results have been subject to
fluctuations, on a quarterly and an annual basis. The combined company may also
experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results
due to a wide variety of factors. Because of these fluctuations, comparisons of
operating results from period to period are not necessarily meaningful and
should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance. Factors that
may cause operating results to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:

     - demand for and market acceptance of the combined company's services;

     - introductions of new products or services or enhancements by the combined
       company and its competitors;

     - technical difficulties or system downtime affecting the Internet
       generally or the combined company's hosting operations specifically;

     - the mix of products and services sold by the combined company or its
       competitors;

     - customer retention;

     - the timing and success of the combined company's advertising and
       marketing efforts and introductions of new services to customers of the
       combined company's resellers;

     - the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures, including construction
       costs relating to the expansion of operations;

     - increased competition in the Web hosting and applications hosting
       markets;

     - changes in the combined company's pricing policies and the pricing
       policies of its competitors;

     - gains or losses of key strategic relationships; and

     - other general and industry-specific economic factors.

     The combined company cannot provide any assurances about the extent to
which it will be successful in achieving any plans to increase the size of its
customer base, the amount of services it offers or the amount, if any, of
increase in revenues it will experience during the next fiscal year, or beyond.
In addition, a relatively large portion of the combined company's expenses will
be fixed in the short-term, and therefore its results of operations will be
particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues. Also, if the combined
company is unable to continue using third-party products in its services
offerings in the future, its service development costs could increase
significantly.

THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL OPERATE IN A NEW AND EVOLVING MARKET WITH UNCERTAIN
PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN GROWTH IN ITS CUSTOMER BASE.

     The market for Web hosting and applications hosting services for small-and
medium-sized businesses has only recently begun to develop and is evolving
rapidly. The combined company's future growth, if any, will depend upon the
willingness of small- and medium-sized businesses to outsource Web hosting and
applications hosting services, its ability to increase its average revenue per
customer and its ability to retain customers. The market for the combined
company's services may not develop further, consumers may not widely adopt its
services and significant numbers of businesses or organizations may not use the
Internet for commerce and communication. If this market fails to develop further
or develops more slowly than expected, or if the combined company's services do
not achieve broader market acceptance, it will not be able to grow its customer
base. In addition, the combined company must be able to differentiate itself
from its competition through its service offerings and brand recognition. These
activities may be more expensive than the combined company anticipates, and it
may not be successful in differentiating itself, achieving market acceptance of
its services or selling additional services to its existing customer base.

THE STOCK PRICE OF THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY BE VOLATILE.

     The market price of Micron Electronics' common stock has experienced a
significant decline in recent months. The price has been and is likely to
continue to be highly volatile due to several factors, such as:

     - the combined company does not experience the benefits of the merger as
       quickly as anticipated, or at all, or the costs of or operational
       difficulties arising from the merger are greater than anticipated;

     - the impact of the merger on the combined company's financial results is
       not in line with the expectations of financial analysts;

     - variations in actual and anticipated operating results;

     - changes in earnings estimates by analysts;

     - variations in actual and anticipated operating results of customers or
       competitors;

     - material reductions in spending by customers;

     - announcements by the combined company or its competitors regarding new
       products and services introductions;

     - the volatility inherent in stocks within the sectors within which the
       combined company conducts business;

     - general decline in economic conditions; and

     - reductions in the volume of trading in the combined company's common
       stock.

     The occurrence of any of these factors could have an immediate and
significant adverse effect on the trading price of the common stock of the
combined company in any given period. In addition, stock markets, particularly
the Nasdaq National Market, have experienced extreme price and volume
fluctuations, and the market prices of securities of technology companies,
especially Internet-related companies, have declined significantly in recent
months. Some of these declines have been unrelated to the operating performance
of such companies. Fluctuations or declines such as these could continue to
affect the market price of Micron Electronics' common stock in the future.
Substantial sales of Micron Electronics' common stock could also cause the stock
price to decline.

     In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted
against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This
type of litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert Micron
Electronics' management's attention and resources.

THE CUSTOMER BASE OF THE COMBINED COMPANY INCLUDES A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF
BUSINESSES THAT CURRENTLY FACE INCREASING DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING FUNDING TO
SUPPORT THEIR OPERATIONS.

     Many of Micron Electronics' and Interland's customers are businesses,
including Internet-based businesses, that have traditionally been initially
funded by venture capital firms and then through public securities offerings.
Funding alternatives for these businesses have become more limited than in the
past. Many of these customers have ceased or reduced their operations, and it
has become increasingly difficult for the combined company to collect revenues
from these businesses. If the market for technology and Internet-based
businesses is not supported by the private and public investors who have funded
these customers, the combined company faces the risk that these customers may
cease, curtail or limit Web site operations. If this continues to occur, the
combined company could experience a loss of revenue associated with these
customers and will then have to increase sales to other businesses using the
Internet in order to preserve and grow revenue. If the combined company is
successful in increasing sales to other businesses, it will incur the expenses
associated with these new customers, such as sales and marketing expenses,
including commissions, and implementation costs. As a result, to preserve and
grow revenue, the combined company will have to increase sales by substantially
more than the amount of lost revenue.

MICRON ELECTRONICS' TRANSITION TO A COMPANY FOCUSED SOLELY ON WEB HOSTING
REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT TRANSITION FROM ITS HISTORIC BUSINESS, AND MICRON
ELECTRONICS' DISPOSAL OF ITS NON-HOSTING BUSINESSES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS
OPERATING RESULTS.

     On March 23, 2001, Micron Electronics announced plans to sell its
non-hosting businesses. Micron Electronics' plans to become a company focused
solely on the Web hosting industry represent a significant transition from the
business it has conducted to date. This transition will result in an approximate
reduction of 82% in the number of Micron Electronics' employees and a
significant reduction in the levels of revenues and operating income
historically experienced by Micron Electronics. Micron Electronics cannot assure
you that it will be able to complete this transition successfully. Efforts to
fulfill this planned transition have placed, and are expected to continue to
place, a significant strain on Micron Electronics' management team and have
diverted, and are expected to continue to divert, the attention of management
from the day-to-day operations of its businesses, including the Web hosting
business. Micron Electronics' plans to dispose of the PC Systems business have
resulted in customer uncertainty with respect to the future availability of
products and services currently provided by that business, which may adversely
affect continued demand for those products and services, Micron Electronics'
results of its discontinued operations and the expected loss associated with the
disposition of the PC Systems business.

IF MICRON ELECTRONICS FAILS TO COMPLETE THE SALE OF ITS PC SYSTEMS BUSINESS, THE
COMBINED COMPANY MAY INCUR A LARGER LOSS THAN PLANNED.

     Micron Electronics has entered into an agreement with GTG PC Holdings, LLC
to sell its PC Systems business. It is a condition of the merger that Micron
Electronics enter into an agreement to enter into a definitive agreement to sell
or commence winding down this business. If the sale of the PC Systems business
to GTG PC fails to close, the combined company's assets and liabilities would be
adversely

affected. The loss on disposal of the PC Systems business segment including
operating losses through the disposal date, net of estimated income tax
benefits, is estimated to be $170.5 million. Losses on the disposal of the PC
Systems business may exceed this estimate. If losses associated with the
disposition of this business exceed these estimates, Micron Electronics'
operating results would be adversely affected.

MICRON ELECTRONICS COULD INCUR LIABILITIES IN THE FUTURE RELATING TO ITS PC
SYSTEMS BUSINESS.

     Micron Electronics could incur liabilities relating to its PC Systems
business under the terms of its agreement to the sell that business to GTG PC
Holdings. Micron Electronics will retain specified liabilities, including
liabilities for taxes arising prior to the closing of the transaction,
litigation arising prior to the closing date, some of which are described in
this "risk factors" section, as well as liabilities for some accounts payable
and other agreements. Micron Electronics is also obligated to indemnify the
purchaser and its affiliated entities for any breaches of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in the agreement for a period of two years, or
the applicable statute of limitations for some liabilities. This indemnification
obligation could be as high as $10.0 million or, in some limited circumstances,
$30.0 million. Accordingly, in the future, the combined company could be
required to make payments with respect to the PC Systems business, which could
adversely affect the future results of operations of the combined company.

MICRON ELECTRONICS MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES FOR SALES AND USE TAXES.

     During the third quarter of 1997, Micron Electronics began to collect and
remit applicable sales or use taxes in nearly all states. It is a party to
agreements with nearly all states, which generally limit its liability, if any,
for non-remittance of sales and use taxes prior to such agreements' effective
dates. Micron Electronics previously accrued a liability for the estimated
settlement cost of issues related to sales and use taxes not covered by these
agreements. The combined company's management believes the resolution of any
matters relating to the non-remittance of sales or use taxes will not materially
affect its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
This potential liability will remain with Micron Electronics even though it has
agreed to sell its PC Systems business.

HOSTPRO'S OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE MAY INCREASE AS A RESULT
OF THE SALE OF THE PC SYSTEMS BUSINESS.

     HostPro currently relies on the PC Systems business to provide some of its
internal operating systems, such as internal network and telephone support,
payroll systems and accounting systems. A portion of the costs of operating
these systems has been allocated to HostPro for financial reporting purposes.
These systems will be transferred in connection with the PC Systems business,
and, as a result, HostPro will be required to obtain alternative sources for
these systems, following a transition period during which the PC Systems
business will continue to provide support. If these transition services do not
extend until HostPro is able to integrate its systems with those of Interland,
or if HostPro is otherwise required to obtain comparable services at higher
costs, its operating results could be adversely affected.

THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY NOT EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE ITS STRATEGY AND AS A RESULT,
OTHERS MAY SEIZE THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY THAT IT HAS IDENTIFIED.

     If the combined company fails to execute its strategy in a timely or
effective manner, its competitors may be able to seize the opportunity it has
identified to address the Web hosting needs of small- and medium-sized
businesses. The combined company's business strategy is complex and requires
that it successfully and simultaneously complete many tasks, and the failure to
complete any one of these may jeopardize its strategy as a whole. Execution of
its strategy may be more difficult because the management

team for the combined company will not have worked together as a team prior to
the merger closing. In order to be successful, the combined company will need
to:

     - market its services and build its brand name effectively;

     - provide reliable and cost-effective services that can be expanded to meet
       the demands of its customers;

     - develop new products and services;

     - continue to grow its infrastructure to accommodate additional customers
       and increased use of its network bandwidth;

     - expand its channels of distribution and its international operations;

     - continue to respond to competitive developments;

     - influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other changes;
       and

     - attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.

MICRON TECHNOLOGY WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDER OF THE COMBINED COMPANY
FOLLOWING THE MERGER AND WILL THEREFORE BE ABLE TO EXERT SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE
OVER MATTERS REQUIRING SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL AND COULD AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF
THE STOCK OF THE COMBINED COMPANY IF IT WERE TO SELL A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ITS
SHARES.

     As of March 15, 2001, Micron Technology owned approximately 61% of Micron
Electronics' outstanding common stock. After the completion of the planned
merger, Micron Technology will own approximately 43% of the outstanding common
stock of Micron Electronics. In addition, two of Micron Electronics' current
directors are also directors of Micron Technology, including Steven R. Appleton,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Micron Technology. Under the terms of
agreements with Micron Electronics, Micron Technology has agreed, among other
things, not to sell any of its shares for a period of at least nine months
following the merger. In addition, Micron Electronics has rights to repurchase
shares owned by Micron Technology up to the number that would reduce Micron
Technology's ownership to 25% of Micron Electronics' outstanding shares. So long
as Micron Technology continues to own a substantial portion of Micron
Electronics' outstanding common stock, Micron Technology will have the ability
to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval,
including the election of directors, and potentially could control the
management and corporate policies of the combined company. The level of Micron
Technology's ownership of Micron Electronics' common stock may also limit the
combined company's ability to complete future equity financing.

THE COMBINED COMPANY FACES INTENSE COMPETITION.

     The Web hosting and applications hosting markets are highly competitive and
are becoming more so. There are few substantial barriers to entry, and the
combined company expects that it will face additional competition from existing
competitors and new market entrants in the future. The combined company may not
have the resources, expertise or other competitive factors to compete
successfully in the future. Many of the combined company's competitors may have
substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger
customer bases, longer operating histories, greater name recognition and more
established relationships in the industry than it does. As a result, these
competitors may be able to:

     - develop and expand their network infrastructures and service offerings
       more rapidly;

     - adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer
       requirements more quickly;

     - take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily; and

     - devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their services and
       adopt more aggressive pricing policies than the combined company can.

     In an effort to gain market share, some of the combined company's
competitors have offered, and may in the future offer, Web hosting services
similar to Micron Electronics and Interland at lower prices or with incentives
not matched by the combined company, including free start-up and domain name
registration, periods of free service, low-priced Internet access or free
software. In addition, some of the combined company's competitors may be able to
provide customers with additional benefits, including reduced communications
costs, which could reduce the overall costs of their services relative to the
combined company. The combined company may not be able to reduce the pricing of
its services or offer incentives in response to the actions of its competitors
without harming its business. Because of the fierce competition in the Web
hosting and applications hosting industry, the number of competitors could lead
to a surplus in service providers, leading to further reductions in the prices
of services. Micron Electronics and Interland also believe that the market in
which the combined company competes is likely to consolidate further in the near
future, which could result in increased price and other competition that could
damage its business.

     Current and potential competitors in the market include Web hosting service
providers, applications hosting providers, Internet service providers,
telecommunications companies, large information technology firms that provide a
wide array of information technology services and computer hardware suppliers.
The combined company's competitors may operate in one or more of these areas and
include companies such as Concentric Network Corporation, an XO Communications,
Inc. company, Data Return Corp., Digex Corporation, Digital Island, EarthLink,
Inc., Exodus Communications, Inc., Interliant, NTT Verio Inc., and Navisite,
Inc. In addition, large diversified companies such as Intel Corporation, Dell
Computer Corporation, International Business Machines Corporation and AT&T
Corporation have entered or indicated their intent to enter into some of these
markets, which will intensify the competition.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MARKET ITS SERVICES COULD BE
SUBSTANTIALLY IMPAIRED IF IT IS UNABLE TO DEPLOY NEW INTERNET APPLICATIONS OR IF
NEW INTERNET APPLICATIONS DEPLOYED BY IT PROVE TO BE UNRELIABLE, DEFECTIVE OR
INCOMPATIBLE.

     The combined company cannot assure you that it will not experience
difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development,
introduction or marketing of Internet application services in the future. The
combined company may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent
the successful development, introduction or marketing of these services. If any
newly introduced Internet applications suffer from reliability, quality or
compatibility problems, market acceptance of the combined company's services
could be greatly hindered and its ability to attract new customers could be
adversely affected. The combined company cannot assure you that new applications
deployed by it will be free from any reliability, quality or compatibility
problems. If the combined company incurs increased costs or is unable, for
technical or other reasons, to host and manage new Internet applications or
enhancements of existing applications, its ability to successfully market its
services could be substantially impaired. In addition, we cannot assure you that
any new services or applications will be accepted by customers.

IMPAIRMENT OF THE COMBINED COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD
NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE REPUTATION OF ITS BUSINESS OR COULD ALLOW COMPETITORS TO
MINIMIZE ANY ADVANTAGE THAT THE COMBINED COMPANY'S PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY MAY
GIVE TO US.

     Micron Electronics and Interland rely on a combination of copyright,
trademark, service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to
establish and protect proprietary rights in their services. In particular,
Interland relies on trademark laws to protect its rights in the name "Interland"
which will be the name of the combined company following the merger. Interland
has filed trademark registration applications in the U.S. that even if granted,
may not fully protect the combined company's ability to use these trademarks in
all areas of the U.S. In addition, Interland has spent, and expects to continue
to invest in the future, significant amounts to build brand recognition of the
Interland name. The combined company could lose the return on this significant
marketing investment if it were to lose or be restricted in the use of the
Interland name to market its services. Third parties may object to its use of
some of its trademarks, service marks, trade names, slogans or other devices,
which could require that those indicia be

changed or altered. Currently, neither Micron Electronics nor Interland have
patented technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering the
Web hosting market that they serve. While they believe that they may file patent
applications on particular aspects of their technology, they cannot be sure that
they will receive any patents. Micron Electronics and Interland have entered
into confidentiality and other agreements with their employees and contractors,
including agreements in which the employees and contractors assign their rights
in inventions to the respective companies. Micron Electronics and Interland have
also entered into nondisclosure agreements with their suppliers, distributors
and some customers in order to limit access to and disclosure of their
proprietary information. These contractual arrangements or the other steps they
have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prove sufficient to
prevent illegal use of their technology or to deter independent third-party
development of similar technologies.

     Policing unauthorized use of products, methods of operation or trademarks
and fully protecting our proprietary rights is difficult, and Micron Electronics
and Interland cannot guarantee that the steps they have taken to protect their
proprietary rights will be adequate. Further, Micron Electronics is currently,
and may in the future, be involved in legal disputes relating to the validity or
alleged infringement of its, or of a third party's, intellectual property
rights, including suits related to the PC Systems business. Micron Electronics
and Interland expect that participants in the Web hosting market will be
increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of services and
competitors in the combined company's industry segment grows. Intellectual
property litigation is typically extremely costly and can be disruptive to the
combined company's business operations by diverting the attention and energies
of management and key technical personnel. In addition, any adverse decisions
could subject the combined company to significant liabilities, require it to
seek licenses from others, prevent it from manufacturing, using, licensing or
selling particular products and services, or cause severe disruptions to its
operations or the markets in which it competes, any one of which could
dramatically impact its business and results of operations.

     The laws of some foreign countries may not protect the combined company's
services or intellectual property rights to the same extent, as do the laws of
the United States. For example, there may be potential conflicts with the use of
the Interland name in other countries. Micron Electronics and Interland do not
know what the impact of being unable to use the Interland name in other
countries may be, although this inability may cause the combined company to
incur significant additional expenses to build brand recognition in those
countries.

THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL FACE RISKS RELATING TO MICRON ELECTRONICS' EXISTING
LITIGATION.

     Micron Electronics is defending a consumer class action lawsuit filed in
the Federal District Court of Minnesota based on the alleged sale of defective
computers. No class has been certified in the case. The case involves a claim
that Micron Electronics sold computer products with a defect that may cause
errors when information is written to a floppy disk. Substantially similar
lawsuits have been filed against other major computer manufacturers. The case is
currently in the early stages of discovery, and Micron Electronics is therefore
unable to estimate total expenses, possible loss or range of loss that may
ultimately be connected with the matter. This potential liability will remain
with Micron Electronics even though it has agreed to sell the PC Systems
business.

     Periodically, Micron Electronics is made aware that technology it uses may
infringe on intellectual property rights held by others. Resolution of these
claims could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations and
could require changes in the products or processes of the combined company.

IF THE COMBINED COMPANY ACQUIRES ADDITIONAL COMPANIES, PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES,
IT MAY FACE RISKS SIMILAR TO THOSE THAT MICRON ELECTRONICS CURRENTLY FACES IN
CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER.

     As part of Micron Electronics' strategy to grow its HostPro business, it
has made a number of acquisitions and investments, and the combined company may
continue to pursue acquisitions of businesses or assets that it believes are
complementary to its business. The combined company will be required to record
material goodwill and other intangible assets in the likely event the purchase
price of the acquired businesses exceeds the fair value of the net assets
acquired. This has resulted in significant amortization

charges that may increase in future periods as the combined company continues
Micron Electronics' acquisition strategy. The acquired businesses may not
achieve the revenues and earnings anticipated to be achieved by the combined
company. If the combined company acquires another company, it will likely face
the same risks, uncertainties and disruptions as discussed above with respect to
Micron Electronics' merger with Interland. For example, the combined company may
not be able to successfully assimilate the additional personnel, operations,
acquired technology and products into its business. Furthermore, the combined
company may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any
additional future acquisitions or investments, the issuance of which could be
dilutive to existing shareholders. As a result, there could be a material
adverse effect on its future financial condition and results of operations.
Micron Electronics and Interland cannot assure you of the timing or size of
future acquisitions, or the effect future acquisitions may have on the combined
company's operating results.

IF MICRON ELECTRONICS' RECENT WEB HOSTING ACQUISITIONS ARE NOT PERCEIVED AS
SUCCESSFUL, THIS MIGHT CAUSE A DECLINE IN ITS STOCK PRICE.

     Micron Electronics recently acquired several companies in order to develop
and expand its Web hosting business, including LightRealm, Worldwide
International Publishing Corporation, NetLimited, Inc. and Micron Internet
Services. Many of these companies are in the early stages of their development
and have unproven business models. The combined company might not realize the
anticipated benefits of these or other acquisitions to the extent that it
anticipates, or at all. If the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions are
not achieved, the combined company's stock price could decline.

INTERLAND'S RECENT GROWTH STRAINED ITS RESOURCES, AND CHALLENGED ITS ABILITY TO
MANAGE GROWTH AND MAINTAIN THE QUALITY OF ITS SERVICES AND OPERATIONS AND
CONTROL ITS COSTS EFFECTIVELY, AND THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL FACE SIMILAR
CHALLENGES.

     Interland has been experiencing a period of rapid expansion of its customer
base and number of employees. This growth has placed a significant strain on the
financial, management, operational and other resources of Interland. If the
growth rate of the combined company continues at this pace, it will likely
strain the resources of the combined company. In addition, the combined company
will face the challenge of managing relationships with a growing number of third
parties with whom Interland developed relationships to complement its service
offerings and increase its indirect sales efforts. If this growth continues, the
combined company's ability to manage its further growth effectively will require
it to:

     - enhance management information systems and forecasting procedures;

     - further develop its operating, administrative, financial, billing, and
       accounting systems and controls;

     - maintain close coordination among its engineering, accounting, finance,
       marketing, sales and operations organizations;

     - expand the training and managing of its employee base; and

     - expand its finance, administrative and operations staff.

     The failure to manage its growth effectively could adversely affect the
quality of its services, business and financial condition. The combined company
may not be able to maintain the quality of its operations, to control its costs
and to expand its internal systems in order to support its desired growth.

IF THE COMBINED COMPANY IS UNABLE TO EXPAND ITS NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE CAPACITY,
THEN IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MEET INCREASING DEMAND, AND COULD LOSE CUSTOMERS AND
MAY BE UNABLE TO SUSTAIN OR INCREASE ITS REVENUES.

     The combined company must continue to expand and adapt its network
infrastructure to meet the increase in the number of users and the amount of
information they wish to transport and to meet changing customer requirements.
The expansion and adaptation of the combined company's telecommunications and
hosting facility infrastructure will require substantial financial, operational
and management

resources as it negotiates for access to telecommunications systems with
existing and other network infrastructure suppliers. Significant and rapid
expansion of its network due to increased usage will place additional stress
upon its network hardware, traffic management systems and hosting facilities.
The ability of the combined company's network to connect and manage a
substantially larger number of customers at high transmission speeds is as yet
unknown. In addition, the combined company's ability to expand its network while
maintaining superior performance is unknown. As customers' bandwidth usage
increases, the combined company will need to make additional investments in its
infrastructure to maintain adequate data transmissions speeds, the availability
of which may be limited and the cost of which may be significant. Additional
network capacity may not be available from third-party suppliers as it is needed
by the combined company. As a result, its network may not be able to achieve or
maintain a sufficiently high capacity of data transmission, especially if
customer usage increases. Any failure on its part to achieve or maintain
high-capacity data transmission could significantly reduce consumer demand for
its services and adversely affect its business.

IF THE COMBINED COMPANY IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS
NETWORK CAPACITY AT REASONABLE COSTS, IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES AT
PRICES ACCEPTABLE TO ITS CUSTOMERS, THEREBY REDUCING DEMAND FOR ITS SERVICES.

     The success of the combined company will depend upon the capacity, ease of
expansion, reliability and security of its network infrastructure, including the
capacity leased from its telecommunications network suppliers. HostPro's and
Interland's network currently delivers service through Cable & Wireless, McLeod,
Qwest, Electric Lightwave, Genuity, Worldcom, Level 3, XO, Sprint and Touch
America. Some of these suppliers are also competitors. Its operating results
depend, in part, upon the pricing and availability of telecommunications network
capacity from a limited number of providers. If capacity is not available to the
combined company as its customers' usage increases, its network may not be able
to achieve or maintain sufficiently high data transmission capacity, reliability
or performance. In addition, its business would suffer if its network suppliers
increased the prices for their services and the combined company were unable to
pass along any increased costs to its customers. Any failure on the combined
company's part or the part of our third-party suppliers to achieve or maintain
high data transmission capacity, reliability or performance could significantly
reduce customer demand for its services, damage its business reputation and
increase its costs.

THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL DEPEND ON ITS RESELLER SALES CHANNEL TO MARKET AND
SELL MANY OF ITS SERVICES. THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL NOT CONTROL ITS RESELLERS,
AND IF IT FAILS TO DEVELOP OR MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS WITH RESELLERS, IT MAY NOT
ACHIEVE THE GROWTH IN CUSTOMERS AND REVENUES THAT IT EXPECTS.

     An element of the strategy for growth of the combined company is to further
develop the use of third parties who resell Interland's and HostPro's services.
Many of these resellers are Web development or Web consulting companies that
also sell Interland's and HostPro's Web hosting services, but that generally do
not have established customer bases to which they can market the combined
company's services. While neither HostPro nor Interland is currently dependent
on any one reseller to generate a significant level of business, both companies
have benefited from business generated by the reseller channel. Although HostPro
and Interland attempt to provide their resellers with incentives such as price
discounts on services that the resellers seek to resell at a profit, the failure
of the combined company's services to be commercially accepted in some markets,
whether as a result of a reseller's performance or otherwise, could cause
Interland's and HostPro's current resellers to discontinue their relationships
with the combined company, and we may not be successful in establishing
additional reseller relationships as needed.

THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL BE SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY
STANDARDS.

     In the Web and applications hosting industry, service providers must keep
pace with evolving technologies in order to offer relevant, sophisticated
services on a timely basis to meet rapidly changing customer demands. The
combined company's future success will depend, in part, upon its ability to
offer services that incorporate leading technologies, address the increasingly
sophisticated and varied needs of its

current and prospective Web and applications hosting customers and respond to
technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely
and cost-effective basis. The market for Web hosting services is characterized
by rapidly changing and unproven technologies, evolving industry standards,
changes in customer needs, emerging competition and frequent introductions of
new services. To be successful, the combined company must continually improve
the performance, features and reliability of its services, including our
proprietary technologies, and modify its business strategies accordingly. The
combined company could also incur substantial costs if it needs to modify its
services or infrastructure in order to adapt to these changes. Technological
advances may have the effect of encouraging some current or future customers to
rely on in-house personnel and equipment to furnish the services that HostPro
and Interland currently provide. If it is unable to maintain the compatibility
of its services with products offered by its vendors, it could lose or fail to
attract customers.

     The combined company's management believes that its ability to compete
successfully also depends upon the continued compatibility of its services with
products offered by various vendors. Enhanced or newly developed third-party
products may not be compatible with our infrastructure, and such products may
not adequately address the needs of its customers. Although the combined company
currently intends to support emerging standards, industry standards may not be
established, and, even if they are established, it may not be able to conform to
these new standards in a timely fashion in order to maintain a competitive
position in the market. The combined company's failure to conform to the
prevailing standard, or the failure of a common standard to emerge, could cause
the combined company to lose customers or fail to attract new customers. In
addition, products, services or technologies developed by others could render
the combined company's services noncompetitive or obsolete.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S ABILITY TO ATTRACT CUSTOMERS IS DEPENDENT ON THE RELIABLE
PERFORMANCE AND GROWTH OF USE OF THE INTERNET.

     Use of the Internet for retrieving, sharing and transferring information
among businesses, consumers, suppliers and partners has recently begun to
increase rapidly. The adoption of the Internet for information retrieval and
exchange, commerce and communications, particularly by those enterprises that
have historically relied upon alternative means of information gathering,
commerce and communications, generally requires the adoption of a new medium of
conducting business and exchanging information. If the Internet as a commercial
or business medium fails to develop further or develops more slowly than
expected, the combined company would not be able to grow its customer base as
quickly as desired and its customers would be less likely to require more
complex, higher revenue services from it.

     As a Web and applications hosting company, the success of the combined
company will depend in large part on continued growth in the use of the
Internet. The lack of continued growth in the usage of the Internet would
adversely affect its business because it would not gain additional customers and
its existing customers might not have any further use for our services. Internet
usage and growth may be inhibited for a number of reasons, such as:

     - inadequate network infrastructure;

     - security concerns;

     - uncertainty of legal and regulatory issues concerning the use of the
       Internet;

     - inconsistent quality of service;

     - lack of availability of cost-effective, reliable, high-speed service; and

     - failure of Internet use to expand internationally.

     If Internet usage grows, the Internet infrastructure may not be able to
support the demands placed on it by this growth, or its performance and
reliability may decline. For example, Web sites have experienced interruptions
in service as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the
Internet network infrastructure. If these outages or delays occur frequently,
use of the Internet as a commercial or business medium could in the future grow
more slowly or decline.

THE COMBINED COMPANY IS VULNERABLE TO SYSTEM FAILURES, WHICH COULD HARM ITS
REPUTATION, CAUSE ITS CUSTOMERS TO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES, AND CAUSE
ITS CUSTOMERS TO SEEK ANOTHER PROVIDER FOR SERVICES.

     The combined company must be able to operate the systems that manage its
network around the clock without interruption. The combined company's operations
will depend upon its ability to protect its network infrastructure, equipment
and customer files against damage from human error, fire, earthquakes,
hurricanes, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, sabotage,
intentional acts of vandalism and similar events. Although both HostPro and
Interland have attempted to build redundancy into their networks, their networks
are currently subject to various points of failure. For example, a problem with
one of their routers, or devices that move information from one computer network
to another, or switches could cause an interruption in the services they provide
to a portion of their customers. In the past, both HostPro and Interland have
experienced periodic interruptions in service. In addition, failure of any of
their telecommunications providers to provide the data communications capacity
they require, as a result of human error, a natural disaster or other
operational disruption, could result in interruptions in services. Any future
interruptions could:

     - cause customers or end users to seek damages for losses incurred;

     - require the combined company to replace existing equipment or add
       redundant facilities;

     - damage the reputation of the combined company for reliable service;

     - cause existing customers to cancel their contracts; or

     - make it more difficult for the combined company to attract new customers.

     Both HostPro and Interland offer some of their customers a 99.9% service
level warranty. Under these policies, Interland and HostPro guarantee that those
customers' Web sites will be available at least 99.9% of the time in each
calendar month for as long as the customer is using its Web hosting services. If
the combined company were to experience widespread system failures, it could
incur significant costs under those warranties.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S DATA CENTERS AND NETWORKS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO SECURITY
BREACHES.

     A significant barrier to electronic commerce and communications is the need
for secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Some
of both HostPro's and Interland's services rely on security technology licensed
from third parties that provides the encryption and authentication necessary to
effect the secure transmission of confidential information. Despite the design
and implementation of a variety of network security measures by both HostPro and
Interland, unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidental or intentional
actions and other disruptions could occur. In the past, both HostPro and
Interland have experienced, and in the future the combined company may
experience, delays or interruptions in service as a result of the accidental or
intentional actions of Internet users, current and former employees or others.
In addition, inappropriate use of the network by third parties could also
potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information, such as credit
card and bank account numbers stored in our computer systems. These security
problems could result in our liability and could also cause the loss of existing
customers and potential customers. In addition, third parties could interfere
with the operation of our customers' Web sites through intentional attacks
including causing an overload of traffic to these Web sites.

     Although the combined company intends to continue to implement
industry-standard security measures, third parties may be able to overcome any
measures that we implement. The costs required to eliminate computer viruses and
alleviate other security problems could be prohibitively expensive and the
efforts to address such problems could result in interruptions, delays or
cessation of service to our customers, and harm our reputation and growth.
Concerns over the security of Internet transactions and the privacy of users may
also inhibit the growth of the Internet, especially as a means of conducting
commercial transactions.

DISRUPTION OF THE COMBINED COMPANY'S SERVICES CAUSED BY UNKNOWN SOFTWARE DEFECTS
COULD HARM ITS BUSINESS AND REPUTATION.

     The service offerings of both HostPro and Interland depend on complex
software, including proprietary software tools and software licensed from third
parties. Complex software often contains defects, particularly when first
introduced or when new versions are released. The combined company may not
discover software defects that affect its new or current services or
enhancements until after they are deployed. Although neither HostPro nor
Interland have experienced any material software defects to date, it is possible
that defects may occur in the software. These defects could cause service
interruptions, which could damage its reputation or increase its service costs,
cause it to lose revenue, delay market acceptance or divert its development
resources.

PROVIDING SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS WITH CRITICAL WEB SITES AND WEB-BASED
APPLICATIONS COULD POTENTIALLY EXPOSE THE COMBINED COMPANY TO LAWSUITS FOR
CUSTOMERS' LOST PROFITS OR OTHER DAMAGES.

     Because the Web hosting and applications hosting services of HostPro and
Interland are critical to many of their customers' businesses, any significant
interruption in the services provided by the combined company could result in
lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to both HostPro's and
Interland's customers as well as negative publicity and additional expenditures
to correct the problem for the combined company. Although the standard terms and
conditions of both HostPro's and Interland's customer contracts disclaim
liability for any such damages, a customer could still bring a lawsuit against
them claiming lost profits or other consequential damages as the result of a
service interruption or other Web site or application problems that the customer
may attribute to them. A court might not enforce any limitations on HostPro's or
Interland's liability, and the outcome of any lawsuit would depend on the
specific facts of the case and legal and policy considerations even if the
combined company believes it would have meritorious defenses to any such claims.
In these cases, the combined company could be liable for substantial damage
awards. Damage awards might exceed its liability insurance by unknown but
significant amounts, which would seriously harm its business.

THE COMBINED COMPANY COULD FACE LIABILITY FOR INFORMATION DISTRIBUTED THROUGH
ITS NETWORK.

     The law relating to the liability of on-line services companies for
information carried on or distributed through their networks is currently
unsettled. On-line services companies could be subject to claims under both
United States and foreign law for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark
infringement, violation of securities laws or other theories based on the nature
and content of the materials distributed through their networks. Several private
lawsuits seeking to impose such liability upon other entities are currently
pending against other companies. In addition, organizations and individuals have
sent unsolicited commercial e-mails from servers hosted by service providers to
massive numbers of people, typically to advertise products or services. This
practice, known as "spamming," can lead to complaints against service providers
that enable such activities, particularly where recipients view the materials
received as offensive. The combined company may, in the future, receive letters
from recipients of information transmitted by its customers objecting to such
transmission. Although the combined company prohibits its customers by contract
from spamming, it cannot assure you that its customers will not engage in this
practice, which could subject it to claims for damages.

     In addition, the combined company may become subject to proposed
legislation that would impose liability for or prohibit the transmission over
the Internet of some types of information. Other countries may also enact
legislation or take action that could impose liability on the combined company
or cause it not to be able to operate in those countries. The imposition upon it
and other on-line services of potential liability for information carried on or
distributed through its systems could require the combined company to implement
measures to reduce its exposure to this liability, which may require it to
expend substantial resources, or to discontinue service offerings. The increased
attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and
legislative proposals also could affect the growth of Internet use.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S BUSINESS MAY BE IMPACTED BY GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND
LEGAL UNCERTAINTIES.

     Only a small body of laws and regulations currently applies specifically to
access to, or commerce on, the Internet. Due to the increasing popularity and
use of the Internet, however, laws and regulations with respect to the Internet
may be adopted at federal, state and local levels, covering issues such as user
privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, characteristics and quality of products
and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights, information
security and the convergence of traditional telecommunications services with
Internet communications. The combined company cannot fully predict the nature of
future legislation and the manner in which government authorities may interpret
and enforce. As a result, the combined company and its customers could be
subject to potential liability under future legislation, which in turn could
have a material adverse effect on the combined company's business. For example,
if legislation were adopted in the U.S. or internationally that makes
transacting business over the Internet less favorable or otherwise curtails the
growth of the Internet, the combined company's business would suffer. The
adoption of laws or regulations might decrease the growth of the Internet, which
in turn could decrease the demand for the combined company's services or
increase the cost of doing business or in some other manner harm its business.

     In addition, applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing
issues such as property ownership, copyright and other intellectual property
issues, taxation, libel, obscenity and personal privacy is uncertain. These laws
generally pre-date the advent of the Internet and related technologies and, as a
result, do not consider or address the unique issues of the Internet and related
technologies. Changes to laws intended to address these issues could create
uncertainty in the marketplace that could reduce demand for the combined
company's services or increase the cost of doing business as a result of costs
of litigation or increased service delivery costs, or could in some other manner
have a material adverse effect on its business.

     In addition, because the combined company's services are available over the
Internet virtually worldwide, and because it will facilitate sales by customers
to end users located in multiple states and foreign countries, jurisdictions may
claim that the combined company is required to qualify to do business as a
foreign corporation in those states or that it have a permanent establishment in
the foreign country.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS.

     HostPro and Interland derived approximately 18% and 9% of their revenues
from international sales for the quarter ended March 1, 2001 and March 31, 2001.
International sales will most likely represent a significant percentage of the
combined company's revenues. International business is subject to a number of
special risks, including:

     - different regulatory requirements;

     - different privacy, censorship and liability standards and regulations;

     - less protective intellectual property laws;

     - different technology standards;

     - unexpected changes in, or imposition of, regulatory requirements;

     - tariffs and other barriers and restrictions;

     - general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability,

     - hostilities among countries and changes in diplomatic and trade
       relationships; and

     - other factors beyond the control of the combined company.

SUBSTANTIAL FUTURE SALES OF SHARES BY SHAREHOLDERS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR
STOCK PRICE.

     If shareholders of the combined company sell substantial amounts of Micron
Electronics common stock in the public market after the merger, the market price
of Micron Electronics common stock could

decline. Under the shareholder agreement, Mr. Kocher and some Interland
shareholders agreed not to sell their shares of Micron Electronics common stock,
representing approximately 12% of the outstanding common stock of the combined
company, assuming an exchange ratio of 0.8610, for a period of nine months after
the closing of the merger, subject to limited exceptions. Additionally, Micron
Technology, who will own approximately 43% of the outstanding common stock of
the combined company, assuming an exchange ratio of 0.8610, agreed not to sell
any shares of Micron Electronics common stock beneficially held by it for a
period of nine months after the closing of the merger, subject to limited
exceptions. As a result, after these lockup provisions expire, approximately 55%
of the outstanding common stock of the combined company, assuming an exchange
ratio of 0.8610, will be eligible for sale in the public market subject to
volume limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Furthermore, these
shareholders will have the right to require the combined company to register
their shares for sale pursuant to an existing registration rights agreement.

                     THE MICRON ELECTRONICS SPECIAL MEETING

DATE, TIME, PLACE AND PURPOSE OF MICRON ELECTRONICS' MEETING

     A special meeting of shareholders of Micron Electronics will be held at the
               at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on             , 2001. At the
meeting, shareholders at the close of business on             , 2001 will be
asked to:

          1. Approve the issuance of shares of Micron Electronics common stock
     in the merger. The merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this joint
     proxy statement/prospectus.

          2. Approve an amendment to Micron Electronics' articles of
     incorporation increasing the authorized number of shares of capital stock
     to 200,000,000 and changing the name Micron Electronics, Inc. to
     "Interland, Inc." upon the closing of the merger. The proposed amendment is
     attached as Annex F to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

          3. Approve an amendment to Micron Electronics' bylaws to:

           - provide that all directors shall hold office for a period of at
             least two years after the closing of the merger;

           - permit the removal of directors only for "cause" during the two
             year period following the closing of the merger;

           - effective after the expiration of the two-year period after the
             closing of the merger, change the term of all directors to an
             indefinite term, and permit their removal with or without cause;
             and

           - authorize the board of directors to decrease the size of the board
             in the future.

        The proposed amendment is attached as Annex G to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

          4. Increase the size of the Micron Electronics board of directors to
     eight (8) members.

          5. Elect three additional directors to the Micron Electronics board of
     directors. Micron Electronics will present the following nominees for
     election as directors:

                                  Kenneth Gavranovic
                                  Gregg A. Mockenhaupt
                                  [Additional nominee to be added by amendment]

          6. Transact any other business that may properly come before the
     meeting or any adjournment.

RECORD DATE AND OUTSTANDING SHARES

     Only holders of record of Micron Electronics common stock at the close of
business on the record date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the
meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were
shares of Micron Electronics common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, held
of record by approximately       shareholders, although Micron Electronics has
been informed that there are in excess of       beneficial owners.

VOTE REQUIRED

     Holders of Micron Electronics' common stock are entitled to one vote for
each share held as of the record date. Approval of each of the proposals
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present, in person or
by proxy, at the meeting. Under the voting agreement, Micron Technology agreed
to vote its shares, which constitute approximately 61% of Micron Electronics'
outstanding common stock as of the record date, in favor of the proposals.

SHARE OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT AND PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS

     On the record date, directors, executive officers and affiliates of Micron
Electronics as a group beneficially owned            shares of Micron
Electronics common stock. These shares constituted approximately    % of all of
the outstanding Micron Electronics common stock as of the record date.

VOTES NEEDED FOR A QUORUM, EFFECT OF ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES

     A majority of all votes eligible to be cast will be required to establish a
quorum for the transaction of business at the meeting. Shares that are voted
"FOR", "AGAINST", "WITHHOLD" or "ABSTAIN" are treated as being present at the
meeting for the purpose of establishing a quorum and are also treated as shares
entitled to vote at the meeting with respect to a matter. Abstentions will have
the same effect as voting against a proposal. Broker non-votes will be counted
for the purpose of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the
transaction of business, but these non-votes will not be counted for the purpose
of determining the number of votes cast with respect to the particular proposal
on which a broker has expressly not voted. Thus, a broker non-vote will not
affect the outcome of the voting on a proposal.

EXPENSES OF PROXY SOLICITATION

     Micron Electronics will pay the expenses of soliciting proxies to be voted
at the meeting. Following the original mailing of the proxies and other
soliciting materials, Micron Electronics or its agents may also solicit proxies
by mail, telephone, telegraph or in person. Following the original mailing of
the proxies and other soliciting materials, Micron Electronics will request that
brokers, custodians, nominees and other record holders of Micron Electronics
shares forward copies of the proxy and other soliciting materials to persons for
whom they hold shares and request authority for the exercise of proxies. In
these cases, Micron Electronics will reimburse the record holders for their
reasonable expenses if they ask Micron Electronics to do so.

Can Find More Information" on page 1.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     Early in 2000, management of Interland and Micron Electronics had engaged
in informal general discussions. In November 2000, Interland reinitiated those
discussions, regarding the possibility of a strategic relationship between the
two companies. On December 15, 2000, Micron Electronics and Interland entered
into a confidentiality agreement.

     During the last two weeks of December 2000 and throughout the month of
January 2001, discussions continued, primarily between the chief executive
officers of the companies, regarding a potential business combination between
the two companies.

     At a meeting of the Interland board of directors on January 16, 2001,
strategic alternatives were discussed, including potential additional
investments by current strategic partners. At the meeting, representatives of
Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., financial advisor to Interland, made a presentation to
the Interland board of directors regarding current equity market conditions,
which generally indicated that raising additional capital would be difficult at
best for the foreseeable future. The Interland board was also advised by
Interland's legal counsel, Kilpatrick Stockton LLP, of its fiduciary duties in
considering a merger with Micron Electronics. Immediately after this board
meeting, the executive management of Interland and Micron Electronics
intensified their discussions regarding a potential combination.

     On January 17, 2001, in Los Angeles, California, executive officers of
Micron Electronics met with executive officers of Interland to discuss a
possible business combination.

     On January 22, 2001, a telephonic meeting was held with executive officers
and the financial advisors and legal counsel of both Micron Electronics and
Interland during which the broad strategic goals of a potential business
combination of the two companies were discussed. It was resolved at this meeting
to schedule a meeting of the parties to further investigate and discuss the
potential business combination.

     On January 23, 2001, the Micron Electronics board of directors held a
meeting by teleconference during which they discussed the potential Interland
transaction and authorized Micron Electronics' executive management to proceed
with further analysis and due diligence. The Micron Electronics' board was also
advised by Micron Electronics' legal counsel, Fenwick & West LLP and Dorsey &
Whitney LLP, of its fiduciary duties in considering the merger with Interland.

     On January 24, 2001, in Dallas, Texas, Messrs. Kocher, Cavender, and
Stewart of Micron Electronics and representatives of CIBC World Markets Corp.,
financial advisor to Micron Electronics, met with Messrs. Gavranovic, Gill and
Covington of Interland, and representatives of Bear Stearns to discuss the terms
of a potential business combination between Micron Electronics and Interland. At
this meeting, the executives of both companies made detailed presentations
regarding their areas of operation. In addition, the structure, economic terms
and other material conditions of a potential combination were discussed in a
preliminary manner. This meeting concluded without agreement between the parties
with respect to price or other financial terms.

     The status of discussions with Micron Electronics, including the results of
this meeting, were reported to the Interland board of directors at its meeting
on January 31, 2001. After receiving this report and discussing the general
financial condition and strategic direction of the company, the Interland board
of directors approved the formal engagement of Bear Stearns as its financial
advisor to identify and evaluate, and conduct an appropriate search for,
strategic transactions for the company.

     In the period from just prior to the January 31, 2001 Interland board
meeting until the execution of the merger agreement with Micron Electronics,
Bear Stearns assisted Interland in developing a list of prospective purchasers
of, or investors in, Interland and then contacted those entities, and in some
cases engaged in discussions regarding the possibility of a strategic
transaction with Interland. By March 1, 2001, Bear Stearns or officers of
Interland had made contact with 21 parties other than Micron Electronics,
provided confidential information regarding Interland to 11 of these other
parties and engaged in discussions with two of these other parties regarding a
potential transaction.

     On February 1, 2001, the Micron Electronics board of directors held a
meeting by teleconference and discussed the possibility of entering into a
transaction with Interland, including discussions regarding the appropriate
valuation ranges for Interland, and approved the delivery of a non-binding
preliminary letter of interest to Interland.

     A preliminary letter of interest was received by Interland from Micron
Electronics during the first week of February 2001, but several of its proposed
material terms were unacceptable to Interland. A revised letter of interest was
presented to Interland during the second week of February. Although the parties
had not reached agreement on many of the material terms addressed in the revised
letter, management of both parties agreed that it was appropriate for both to
continue with more thorough due diligence while attempting to resolve the issues
on which there continued to be disagreement. During the latter half of February
2001, both companies engaged in extensive legal, operational and financial due
diligence investigations of the other.

     On February 14, 2001, the Micron Electronics board of directors held a
regularly scheduled meeting and discussed further the possibility of entering
into a transaction with Interland. The Micron Electronics board discussed
prospects for maintaining cash at designated levels at the time of the
anticipated closing of any merger with Interland and the possibility that the
proposed exchange ratio would be adjusted if cash and cash equivalents fell
below a specified level. The Micron Electronics board also discussed the
advisability of a contingent distribution of cash to Micron Electronics
shareholders in the event net cash as of the merger closing or Net Proceeds from
any sale of the PC Systems business exceeded specified levels and the means of
adjusting that value fairly if Micron Electronics' cash as of the merger closing
was less than projected.

     On February 20, 2001, in Atlanta, Georgia, a group of the executive
officers of Micron Electronics and representatives of CIBC World Markets met
with a group of the officers of Interland and representatives of Bear Stearns,
to discuss the terms for a potential business combination between Micron
Electronics and Interland. This meeting concluded without agreement between the
parties with respect to price or other financial terms.

     From February 20 through 21, 2001, Micron Electronics' human resources,
technical and legal personnel, Micron Electronics' outside legal counsel and
accounting advisor as well as representatives of CIBC World Markets, conducted a
due diligence investigation of Interland in Atlanta. From February 21 through
24, 2001, a group of officers of Interland, representatives of Interland's legal
counsel and accounting advisor and representatives of Bear Stearns, conducted a
due diligence investigation of Micron Electronics in Boise, and Nampa, Idaho. On
February 26 and 27, 2001, executive officers of Interland and representatives of
Bear Stearns conducted a due diligence investigation of the HostPro business in
Seattle, Washington and Los Angeles, California.

     On March 2, 5, and 6, 2001, Messrs. Kocher and Cavender from Micron
Electronics and Mr. Gill and Ms. Stevens from Interland discussed the value of
potential cost reductions and other benefits arising

from the proposed transaction. These discussions concluded without further
discussion between the parties with respect to price or other financial terms.

     A first draft of the merger agreement was delivered by Micron Electronics
to Interland on February 27, 2001, containing details on many of the merger
terms that had previously been discussed between the parties. Between February
27 and March 11, 2001, executive officers of Interland and Interland's financial
and legal advisors continued to negotiate and discuss points of disagreement
with Micron Electronics and its legal and financial advisors, resolving many
open issues.

     At a special meeting of the Interland board of directors on the evening of
Sunday, March 11, 2001, management, legal counsel and the financial advisors to
Interland reported on the material terms of the merger agreement and the
significant points of negotiations between the parties that remained unresolved
at that time. Bear Stearns and members of Interland management also updated the
Interland board of directors on the status of the company's strategic
alternatives, including the possibility of raising capital from strategic
partners. While it was reported that some of Interland's strategic partners had
indicated a general interest in potentially making additional, noncontrol
investments in Interland, these discussions were at a preliminary stage and
would take substantial additional time to bring to closure. Bear Stearns and
management updated the Interland board of directors on the status of contacts
with prospective strategic partners.

     They also reported on an oral indication of interest in a merger with
Interland that had been expressed by one of the entities contacted by Bear
Stearns. It was agreed that the indication of interest from this other company
should be pursued and that Interland should cooperate in every reasonable manner
to provide the information needed to allow this entity to decide whether to make
a formal offer.

     From March 16 through 22, 2001, Micron Electronics and Interland were
engaged in negotiations on key transaction terms and documents. During this
period, issues under discussion included Micron Electronics' concerns about: the
method of calculating and adjusting the proposed exchange ratio; Interland's
request for a covenant or closing condition giving comfort that Micron
Electronics would sell or exit, or announce its intention to sell or exit, its
PC Systems business prior to the merger closing; the calculation of any
distributions of the Net Proceeds from the sale of the PC Systems business that
could be made to the shareholders of Micron Electronics; details of the
pre-closing bridge loan requested by Interland and the interplay of the loan
provisions with the merger agreement; the composition and structure of the board
of directors of the combined company; and the acceleration of vesting as to some
Interland options.

     Management of Interland and its financial advisors met with representatives
of the other company on March 16, 2001, to discuss the financial condition of
Interland and a potential combination of the two companies. On March 20, 2001,
the other company delivered to Interland a written indication of interest to
engage in a merger pursuant to which each Interland share of common stock would
be exchanged for common stock of the other company valued based on a trailing
30-day market average, which was equal to approximately $2.20 per Interland
share as of March 21, 2001. The offer was expressly conditioned upon completion
of business, legal, and accounting due diligence by the other company, which its
chief executive officer had orally indicated would take at least 10 days. The
indication of interest was expressly nonbinding. Interland, in consultation with
its legal counsel and financial advisors, communicated on the day of receipt of
this letter with the chief executive officer of the other company to inquire as
to whether the due diligence investigation period could be shortened and as to
whether the price that was discussed in the letter could be increased. The
response was that the price mentioned in the letter not only would not be
increased but was subject to downward revision if the stock price of the other
company eroded between that time and the time of the signing of a definitive
agreement and that the due diligence period would more likely significantly
exceed the estimate of 10 days that had been previously communicated.

     At the same time, Interland confirmed with the chief executive officer of
Micron Electronics its understanding that Micron Electronics' position was that
a delay in reaching agreement about a proposed business combination beyond March
23, 2001 would result in Micron Electronics terminating all discussions.
Interland considered this comment in the context of the overall negotiations and
concluded

that to give the other company the time needed for a full due diligence
investigation would raise a substantial possibility that Micron Electronics
would terminate discussions with Interland. Even more importantly, Interland
believed that it was very uncertain that a binding agreement with the other
company would ever be entered into. This belief was based in part on Interland's
prior dealings with the other company. These factors caused management of
Interland to tentatively conclude, subject to confirmation by its board of
directors, that it would not be in its shareholders' best interests to risk
losing the Micron Electronics transaction, which had been more fully
investigated by both sides and was on the verge of being signed, in order to
give the other company more time to perform its due diligence investigation and
possibly negotiate a potential merger.

     The Micron Electronics board of directors met on March 22, 2001, to discuss
various aspects of the proposed transaction with Interland, including the
principal transaction terms and other issues that had not yet been resolved
during the course of the negotiations. During the meeting, the Micron
Electronics board of directors also reviewed management's and counsel's due
diligence reports on Interland, received a presentation from CIBC World Markets
on the financial aspects of the proposed transaction. Following this
presentation, CIBC World Markets delivered its oral opinion to the Micron
Electronics board of directors, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, to
the effect that, as of that date and based upon qualifications, assumptions and
other matters set forth in the written opinion, the proposed exchange ratio of
0.8610 provided for in the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of Micron Electronics common stock. Based upon these
discussions, the board of directors authorized Micron Electronics' management to
proceed with the proposed transaction, specifying an exchange ratio of 0.8610
shares of Micron Electronics common stock for each share of Interland common
stock, subject to adjustment under specified circumstances. The parties and
their respective legal representatives continued to negotiate over the next
several hours to resolve open issues, including details regarding the potential
cash payment to the Micron Electronics shareholders, the adjustment of the
exchange ratio if Micron Electronics were to be unable to maintain cash at
designated levels at the time of the anticipated closing of any merger with
Interland, closing conditions, and some of the specific terms of the transaction
documents. Micron Electronics' board of directors then reconvened and approved
the final terms of the merger agreement and the related transaction agreements.
Also during this period, Micron Electronics and Ken Gavranovic negotiated the
terms of an employment agreement to become effective if the merger closes.

     On March 22, 2001, the Interland board of directors also met to consider
the proposed transaction with Micron Electronics. This meeting reconvened in the
early morning hours of Friday, March 23, 2001. At the meeting, the Interland
board was given an update on negotiations with Micron Electronics regarding the
merger agreement and related agreements and the material terms of these
documents were reviewed. In addition, the Interland board reviewed management's
and counsel's due diligence reports on Micron Electronics.

     At the same meeting, Bear Stearns representatives gave updates to the
Interland board of directors regarding the efforts undertaken to contact
potentially interested parties and how these communications had not resulted in
any real possibility of an alternative transaction. The discussions with the
other company and its written indication of interest were reported to and
discussed by Interland's board of directors. Bear Stearns then made a
presentation to the Interland board of directors regarding the proposed
transaction and addressed issues associated with potential alternative
strategies for Interland. Following this presentation, Bear Stearns delivered
its oral opinion to the Interland board of directors, which was subsequently
confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of that date and based upon certain
other qualifications, assumptions, limitations and other matters which would be
set forth in the written opinion, the exchange ratio provided for in the merger
agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to Interland's common
shareholders.

     Micron Electronics and Interland then executed the merger agreement and the
related agreements at approximately 6:30 a.m., Eastern time, and shortly
thereafter publicly announced the proposed merger.

MICRON ELECTRONICS' REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     The board of directors of Micron Electronics has determined that the
issuance of shares of Micron Electronics provided for in the merger is fair to,
and in the best interests of, Micron Electronics and its shareholders.
Accordingly, the Micron Electronics board recommends that its shareholders vote
for the issuance of the Micron Electronics common stock in the merger, for the
amendment to its articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized
shares of common stock and change the name of Micron Electronics to Interland,
Inc., and for the amendment of its bylaws, to increase the size of the Micron
Electronics' board of directors to eight members and to elect three new
directors.

     Micron Electronics' board consulted with Micron Electronics' senior
management as well as its legal counsel and financial advisors in reaching its
decision. The following are among the reasons why the Micron Electronics' board
believes that the merger will benefit Micron Electronics:

     - the acquisition of Interland will provide the opportunity to strengthen
       HostPro's position within the small and medium enterprise market. The
       combination of the two companies will enable the combined company to
       become a leading provider of business-class hosting to this market, with
       one of the broadest portfolios of managed hosting and value-added
       services;

     - Micron Electronics had begun the process of transforming itself from a
       traditional PC manufacturer to an Internet-focused company over two years
       ago. The merger will enable Micron Electronics to focus its resources on
       the growth opportunities of the Web hosting business rather than the
       mature PC Systems business.

     - the addition of Interland's Atlanta data center will provide the combined
       company with a nationwide infrastructure. A data center presence on both
       the east and west coasts, along with nationwide technical support
       capabilities, will enable the combined company to provide more services
       to customers, such as content mirroring, facilities disaster recovery,
       and the ability to expand hours of customer service operations;

     - Interland has developed strategic distribution channel relationships with
       companies such as Verizon, International Profit Associates and Road
       Runner. These channel partners, along with broader product offerings,
       will provide the combined company an opportunity to accelerate sales
       growth;

     - the belief that the combined company can take advantage of the benefits
       of an integrated management team, streamlined operations and strengthened
       infrastructure; and

     - management's belief that the consolidation of the hosting industry will
       enable businesses with substantial resources and scale to effectively
       compete in the future in cost structure and service offerings.

     In the course of its deliberations, the Micron Electronics board, with
Micron Electronics senior management, reviewed and considered a number of other
factors relevant to the merger. In particular, the Micron Electronics board
considered, among other things:

     - information concerning the parties' respective businesses, prospects,
       financial performance and condition, operations and present and planned
       service offerings;

     - prospects of increasing revenues after the merger;

     - the costs expected to be incurred in connection with the merger, in
       future quarters, including merger-related costs and potential costs or
       charges to combine operations;

     - reports from senior management as to the results of the due diligence
       investigation of Interland and as to the merits, risks and strategic
       importance of the merger;

     - current market conditions and historical trading information with respect
       to both companies' common stock;

     - the opinion of CIBC World Markets delivered March 22, 2001, that, as of
       such date, the exchange ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to
       the holders of Micron Electronics common stock;

     - comparable merger transactions; and

     - the terms and conditions of the merger agreement taken as a whole.

     The Micron Electronics board also considered a variety of potentially
negative factors in deliberating the merits of the proposed merger, including
but not limited to:

     - the uncertainty of Interland's future revenues;

     - the potential dilutive effect of the issuance of Micron Electronics stock
       in the merger;

     - the risk that relationships with customers would be disrupted in
       implementing the merger and the potential detrimental impact on revenues;

     - risks associated with the closing condition that Micron Electronics enter
       an agreement to sell or begin to exit its PC Systems business prior to
       the merger closing, particularly in light of the amount of historic
       revenues contributed by the PC Systems business to Micron Electronics;

     - risks of making the pre-closing bridge loan to Interland, especially if
       the merger fails to close;

     - the risk of an upward adjustment to the exchange ratio in favor of
       Interland if there is a shortfall in Micron Electronics' projected cash
       at the merger closing;

     - the risk that the contemplated cash distribution to Micron Electronics'
       shareholders resulting from net Excess Cash at the merger closing or
       receipt of Net Proceeds from a sale of the PC Systems business would be
       zero;

     - the difficulty of managing separate operations at different geographic
       locations;

     - the risk that key technical and management personnel of Interland might
       not be retained after the merger;

     - the possibility that some of the benefits sought to be obtained through
       the merger may not be realized; and

     - the other risks described under "Risk Factors" above.

     The Micron Electronics board of directors concluded that, on balance, the
potential benefits to Micron Electronics and its shareholders of the merger
outweighed the risks associated with the merger.

     The Micron Electronics board of directors does not intend the discussion of
information and factors that it considered to be exhaustive, but believes the
discussion includes the material factors that it considered. In view of the
complexity and wide variety of information and factors, both positive and
negative, that it considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger,
the Micron Electronics board of directors did not find it practicable to, and
did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to, the specific factors
considered in reaching its determination. In addition, individual members of the
Micron Electronics board of directors may have given different weight to
different factors.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE MICRON ELECTRONICS BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MICRON ELECTRONICS BELIEVES THAT THE MERGER AND
THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE ISSUANCE OF THE SHARES OF MICRON ELECTRONICS COMMON
STOCK IN THE MERGER, THE AMENDMENT OF THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS,
THE INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE MICRON ELECTRONICS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE
ELECTION OF THE NOMINEES FOR DIRECTOR ARE ADVISABLE AND FAIR TO, AND IN THE BEST
INTERESTS OF, MICRON ELECTRONICS AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE
MERGER, THE MICRON ELECTRONICS' BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS
THAT THEY VOTE "FOR" THE PROPOSALS DESCRIBED IN THIS JOINT PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS.

     In considering the recommendation of the Micron Electronics board of
directors with respect to the proposals, you should be aware that some directors
and officers of Micron Electronics have interests in the merger that are
different from, or are in addition to, the interests of Micron Electronics
shareholders generally. Please see the section entitled "The Merger and Related
Transactions -- Interests of certain persons in the merger" on page 68.

INTERLAND'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     In the latter half of 2000, dramatic changes in the capital markets made
debt and equity financing more difficult to obtain, particularly for Internet
and technology-based companies such as Interland. Interland's growth strategy
from its founding had been to build market share as quickly as possible, which
entailed incurring significant operating losses. The impact of operating losses
on Interland's cash position is demonstrated by its cash position of $96.4
million on July 31, 2000 after its July 2000 initial public offering, as
compared to $78.6 million at September 30, 2000 and $56.3 million at December
31, 2000.

     Given the sensitivity of Interland's growth strategy to the continued
availability of additional capital, Interland's management determined in the
fall of 2000 that, in conjunction with its efforts to accelerate the company's
pathway to profitability, it would be prudent to proceed to fully consider and
pursue any financing or other strategic alternatives that might be available to
enhance shareholder value. At a meeting of Interland's board of directors on
March 22 - 23, 2001, the directors present at the meeting voted to enter into
the merger agreement and to recommend that Interland's shareholders vote to
approve the merger and approve and adopt the merger agreement.

     The decision of the Interland directors to enter into the merger agreement,
and to recommend that Interland shareholders approve the merger and approve and
adopt the merger agreement, was the result of their careful consideration of a
range of strategic alternatives, including the pursuit of a long-term
independent business strategy for Interland.

     In the course of reaching its decision to adopt the merger agreement, the
Interland board of directors consulted with:

     - Interland's management, regarding the business and financial condition of
       Interland, trends and competitors in the Web and applications hosting
       industry, Interland management's due diligence investigation of Micron
       Electronics' business and the terms and other conditions of the proposed
       merger;

     - Bear Stearns, Interland's financial advisor, regarding the financial
       aspects of the proposed transaction and the fairness, from a financial
       point of view, to holders of Interland common stock of the exchange ratio
       in the merger; and

     - Interland's legal counsel regarding the proposed terms of the transaction
       and the obligations of the members of the Interland board in its
       consideration of the proposed transaction.

     In reaching its decision, the Interland board considered the following
information and positive factors:

     - the risks associated with continuing to execute Interland's strategic
       growth plan as an independent entity as an alternative to the merger,
       including, among others, risks associated with remaining independent
       amidst industry-wide slowdown, consolidation and competition;

     - the difficulties in pursuing additional debt or equity financing and the
       potential for substantial dilution in light of recent disruptions in the
       capital markets, particularly at a time when additional financing is
       increasingly necessary for Interland to pursue its growth strategy and
       business plan, in conjunction with Micron Electronics' strong liquidity
       position and ability to provide a $10.0 - 20.0 million loan prior to the
       closing of the merger, which would be particularly important if volatile
       capital market conditions continue;

     - the combination of the similar operations and strategy of the HostPro
       business with Interland's operations to create a broader company with
       extended reach, greater financial, human and

       technological resources, and because of the depth of its resources,
       enhanced future operating flexibility and increased opportunity for
       growth;

     - the possibility of achieving substantial operational synergies and
       economies of scale through the combination of Interland's sales force
       with Micron Electronics' national data center network, the opportunity to
       eliminate operational and administrative redundancies, and increased
       purchasing power with equipment and internet connectivity providers;

     - the ability of the combined companies to withstand operating losses
       pending execution of their business strategies following the merger,
       given their combined financial condition including the low debt levels;

     - the financial and other terms and conditions of the merger agreement and
       the merger, including the contractual grant of proportionate
       representation of Interland shareholders on the board of directors of
       Micron Electronics following the closing and the provision for an interim
       loan to Interland by Micron Electronics after June 30, 2001 if the merger
       has not closed by that time;

     - the opportunity for the holders of Interland common stock to receive a
       premium over the trading value of Interland common stock on March 22,
       2001, the last day of trading before the announcement of the merger,
       while at the same time allowing these shareholders to participate in a
       larger and more diversified company and, as shareholders of the combined
       company, to benefit from any future growth of the combined company;

     - the exchange ratio, which will enable the Interland shareholders to own
       at least approximately 30% of the outstanding stock of the combined
       company following the merger;

     - the oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, of Bear Stearns
       delivered March 23, 2001, that, as of such date, the exchange ratio is
       fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Interland common
       stock (see the section entitled "Opinion of Interland's financial
       advisor");

     - the ability of the board of directors to continue to receive unsolicited
       inquiries and proposals regarding other potential business combinations,
       negotiate and give information to third parties making such unsolicited
       proposals, and subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions, in
       the exercise of its fiduciary duties, withdraw or modify its
       recommendation to the Interland shareholders regarding the merger and, if
       Interland shareholders were then to reject the merger, enter into an
       agreement with respect to a more favorable transaction with a third
       party, subject to the payment of a termination fee to Micron Electronics;

     - the ability to complete the merger as a reorganization for United States
       federal income tax purposes in which Interland shareholders generally
       will not recognize any gain or loss, except for any gain or loss
       recognized in connection with cash received for a fractional share of
       Micron Electronics' common stock;

     - the headquarters of the combined company will be in Atlanta, Georgia, for
       a period of at least 18 months after the closing of the merger; and

     - the adoption of the Interland name by Micron Electronics following the
       merger and the survival and possible growth of the Interland brand.

     The Interland directors also considered potentially negative factors
relating to the merger, including:

     - the possibility that other transactions by Micron Electronics could delay
       or inhibit the completion of the merger, including Micron Electronics'
       possible sale of the PC Systems business prior to the closing, or
       commencement of the wind down of the PC Systems business by that date to
       satisfy Interland's closing condition, and the sale of SpecTek;

     - the possibility that costs associated with the Micron Electronics'
       operation or sale of or exit from the PC Systems business could result in
       Micron Electronics having substantially less cash available

       than anticipated upon the closing of the merger, which could jeopardize
       the combined company's ability to adequately fund its operations;

     - the possibility that the settlement of existing litigation, claims or
       assessments against Micron Electronics could result in a material use of
       existing cash, which could inhibit the combined company's ability to
       adequately fund its operations;

     - the difficulties and risks in integrating the two geographically and
       operationally diverse companies from technological, operational,
       marketing, and administrative perspectives; and

     - the interests of some executive officers and directors, including Ken
       Gavranovic becoming the vice chairman and chief technical officer of the
       combined company upon the closing of the merger and the acceleration of
       vesting of stock options of some of the officers and directors of
       Interland.

     Based in part on (1) the oral opinion presented by Bear Stearns to the
Interland board of directors during its meeting, indicating that subject to the
conditions, assumptions and limitations contained in their opinion, the proposed
exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Interland
shareholders and (2) the Interland board of directors' belief that the
transaction with Micron Electronics was an attractive offer that would in all
likelihood be lost if Interland pursued the possibility of an offer by the other
company, the Interland board of directors determined that in its view the merger
with Micron Electronics offered the best value reasonably available for
Interland's shareholders at that time, and then approved the merger agreement
and the ancillary agreements and recommended that it be approved and adopted by
the shareholders of Interland.

     Interland's board of directors concluded that the potential benefits of the
merger to Interland and its shareholders outweighed the risks associated with
the merger. Interland's board of directors does not intend the foregoing
discussion of information and factors that it considered to be exhaustive, but
believes the discussion includes the material factors that it considered. In
view of the complexity and wide variety of information and factors, both
positive and negative, that it considered in connection with its evaluation of
the merger, Interland's board of directors did not find it practicable to
quantify or otherwise assign relative or specific weights to the specific
factors that it considered in reaching its determination. In addition,
individual members of the Interland board of directors may have given different
weight to different factors.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE INTERLAND BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF INTERLAND BELIEVES THAT THE TERMS OF THE MERGER
ARE FAIR TO AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF INTERLAND AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND
UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS THAT THEY VOTE "FOR" THE PROPOSAL TO
APPROVE THE MERGER AND APPROVE AND ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

     In considering the recommendation of the board of directors of Interland
with respect to the merger agreement and merger, you should be aware that some
directors and officers of Interland have interests in the merger that are
different from, or are in addition to, the interests of the shareholders of
their company generally. Please see the section titled "The Merger and Related
Transactions -- Interests of certain persons in the merger" on page 68.

OPINION OF MICRON ELECTRONICS' FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Micron Electronics engaged CIBC World Markets to act as its exclusive
financial advisor in connection with the merger. In connection with this
engagement, Micron Electronics requested that CIBC World Markets evaluate the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Micron Electronics
common stock of the exchange ratio provided for in the merger. On March 22,
2001, at a meeting of the board of directors of Micron Electronics held to
evaluate the merger, CIBC World Markets rendered an oral opinion, which opinion
was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated March 22, 2001, to the
effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to the
matters described in the opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Micron Electronics common stock.

     The full text of CIBC World Markets' written opinion dated March 22, 2001,
which describes the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the
review undertaken, is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex
B. CIBC World Markets' opinion is addressed to the board of directors of Micron
Electronics and relates only to the fairness of the exchange ratio from a
financial point of view. The opinion does not address any other aspect of the
merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder as to any
matters relating to the merger. The summary of CIBC World Markets' opinion
described below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
its opinion. Holders of Micron Electronics common stock are urged to read the
opinion carefully in its entirety.

     In arriving at its opinion, CIBC World Markets:

     - reviewed the merger agreement;

     - reviewed audited financial statements of Micron Electronics for the
       fiscal years ended August 31, 1999 and August 31, 2000 and unaudited
       financial statements for the three-month period ended November 30, 2000
       and audited financial statements of Interland for fiscal years ended
       December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1999 and unaudited financial
       statements for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2000;

     - reviewed unaudited financial statements of Interland for the three-month
       period ended December 31, 2000;

     - reviewed and discussed with the managements of Micron Electronics and
       Interland internal financial forecasts prepared by Micron Electronics and
       Interland management relating to Micron Electronics and Interland and
       certain other financial and business information relating to Micron
       Electronics and Interland;

     - reviewed historical market prices and trading volume for Micron
       Electronics common stock and Interland common stock;

     - held discussions with the senior managements of Micron Electronics and
       Interland with respect to the businesses and prospects for future growth
       of Micron Electronics and Interland;

     - reviewed and analyzed certain publicly available financial data for
       certain companies CIBC World Markets deemed comparable to Micron
       Electronics and Interland;

     - reviewed and analyzed certain publicly available information for
       transactions that CIBC World Markets deemed comparable to the merger;

     - performed discounted cash flow analyses of Micron Electronics and
       Interland using certain assumptions of future performance provided to or
       discussed with CIBC World Markets by the managements of Micron
       Electronics and Interland;

     - reviewed public information concerning Micron Electronics and Interland;
       and

     - performed such other analyses and reviewed such other information as CIBC
       World Markets deemed appropriate.

     In rendering its opinion, CIBC World Markets relied on and assumed, without
independent verification or investigation, the accuracy and completeness of all
of the financial and other information that Micron Electronics, Interland and
their respective employees, representatives and affiliates provided to CIBC
World Markets. With respect to internal forecasts relating to Micron Electronics
and Interland, all of which were prepared by and reviewed and discussed with the
managements of Micron Electronics and Interland, respectively, CIBC World
Markets assumed, at the discretion of the managements of Micron Electronics and
Interland, without independent verification or investigation, that the forecasts
were prepared on bases reflecting the best available estimates and judgments as
to the future financial condition and operating results of Micron Electronics
and Interland. With respect to estimated costs related to sales or dispositions
of assets of Micron Electronics, CIBC World Markets relied solely upon estimates
of

Micron Electronics management. In rendering its opinion, CIBC World Markets
assumed that the exchange ratio at the time of the closing will be 0.8610,
without any adjustments whether because of cash shortfalls, high reserves
related to the PC Systems or SpecTek businesses or any other reason. CIBC World
Markets assumed with Micron Electronics' consent that, in the course of
obtaining the necessary regulatory or third party approvals for the merger, no
limitations, restrictions or conditions will be imposed that would have a
material adverse effect on Micron Electronics, Interland or the contemplated
benefits to Micron Electronics of the merger.

     In light of the anticipated dispositions of the SpecTek and PC Systems
businesses, CIBC World Markets based its analysis of the value of Micron
Electronics solely on the value of the HostPro business, plus an assumed $200
million in cash at closing, without adding or deducting any additional amounts
for the value or potential liabilities of the SpecTek or PC Systems businesses.
CIBC World Markets did not make or obtain any independent evaluations or
appraisals of the assets or liabilities of Micron Electronics, Interland or
affiliated entities. CIBC World Markets expressed no opinion as to Micron
Electronics' or Interland's underlying valuation, future performance or
long-term viability, or the price at which Micron Electronics common stock would
trade at the time of or after announcement or consummation of the merger. CIBC
World Markets' opinion was necessarily based on the information available to
CIBC World Markets and general economic, financial and stock market conditions
and circumstances as they existed and could be evaluated by CIBC World Markets
as of the date of its opinion. Although subsequent developments may affect its
opinion, CIBC World Markets does not have any obligation to update, revise or
reaffirm its opinion. Micron Electronics imposed no other instructions or
limitations on CIBC World Markets with respect to the investigations made or the
procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion.

     This summary is not a complete description of CIBC World Markets' opinion
to the board of directors of Micron Electronics or the financial analyses
performed and factors considered by CIBC World Markets in connection with its
opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytical process
involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods
of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to
summary description. CIBC World Markets believes that its analyses and this
summary must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its
analyses and factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format,
without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the
analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes
underlying CIBC World Markets' analyses and opinion.

     In performing its analyses, CIBC World Markets considered industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond
Micron Electronics' and Interland's control. No company, transaction or business
used in the analyses as a comparison is identical to Micron Electronics,
Interland or the merger, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses is
not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve complex considerations
and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other
factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the
companies, business segments or transactions analyzed.

     The estimates contained in CIBC World Markets' analysis and the ranges of
valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative
of actual values or future results, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by its analyses. In addition, analyses relating
to the value of businesses or securities do not necessarily purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually
may be sold. Accordingly, CIBC World Markets' analyses and estimates are
inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

     The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger was determined
through negotiation between Micron Electronics and Interland and the decision to
enter into the merger was solely that of the board of directors of Micron
Electronics. CIBC World Markets' opinion and financial analyses were only one of
many factors considered by the board of directors of Micron Electronics in its
evaluation of the

merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Micron
Electronics board of directors or management with respect to the merger or the
exchange ratio provided for in the merger.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses underlying
CIBC World Markets' opinion to the board of directors of Micron Electronics in
connection with the merger. The financial analyses summarized below include
information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand CIBC World
Markets' financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of
each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses. Considering the data in the tables below without considering
the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the
methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of CIBC World Markets' financial analyses.

Implied exchange ratio analysis

     Using the results derived for Micron Electronics and Interland from the
"Selected companies analysis," "Selected precedent transactions analysis,"
"Discounted cash flow analysis" and "Contribution analysis" described below,
CIBC World Markets calculated an implied exchange ratio reference range for each
analysis. CIBC World Markets then compared the implied exchange ratio reference
range derived from each analysis to the exchange ratio provided for in the
merger. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied exchange ratio
reference ranges, as compared to the exchange ratio in the merger of 0.861x:

                                                              IMPLIED EXCHANGE RATIO RANGE

Selected companies analysis

     CIBC World Markets compared financial and stock market information for
Interland and the following five selected publicly held companies in the Web
hosting industry:

         WEB HOSTING
         - Data Return Corporation
         - Digex Inc.
         - Globix Corp.
         - Interliant, Inc.
         - NaviSite, Inc.

     CIBC World Markets compared financial and stock market information for
Micron Electronics and the following nineteen publicly held companies in the Web
hosting industry, connectivity industry or PC hardware industry:

          WEB HOSTING
          - Data Return Corporation
          - Digex, Incorporated
          - Globix Corporation
          - Interland, Inc.
          - Interliant, Inc.
          - NaviSite, Inc.

          - Applied Theory Corporation
          - CAIS Internet, Inc.
          - Genuity Inc.
          - Pilot Network Services, Inc.
          - PSINet Inc.
          - Savvis Communications Corporation
          - VIA NET.WORKS, Inc.

          PC HARDWARE
          - Apple Computer, Inc.
          - Compaq Computer Corporation
          - Dell Computer Corporation
          - Gateway, Inc.
          - Hewlett-Packard Company
          - International Business Machines Corporation

     CIBC World Markets reviewed enterprise values as multiples of estimated
calendar years 2001 and 2002 revenues. All multiples were based on closing stock
prices as of March 21, 2001. Estimated financial data for the selected companies
were based on publicly available research analysts' estimates as of that date.
Estimated financial data for Micron Electronics and Interland were based on
internal forecasts prepared by Micron Electronics and Interland management,
respectively.

     For Interland, CIBC World Markets applied a range of selected multiples
derived from the selected companies of estimated calendar years 2001 and 2002
revenue to corresponding financial data of Interland in order to derive implied
equity reference ranges for Interland. This analysis indicated an implied equity
reference range for Interland of approximately $2.08 to $2.84 per share. CIBC
World Markets also applied a control premium of 40% to this reference range to
approximate a takeover valuation. The control premium used was on the low end of
the range of takeover premiums in the selected precedent transactions analysis.
Applying a control premium indicated an implied equity reference range for
Interland of approximately $2.91 to $3.98 per share.

     For Micron Electronics, CIBC World Markets valued each constituent business
of Micron Electronics separately: Web hosting, connectivity and hardware resale,
to account for the fact that each business was being valued at substantially
different multiples of revenue in the market. CIBC World Markets applied a range
of selected multiples derived from the Web hosting, connectivity and PC hardware
groups of selected companies of estimated calendar years 2001 and 2002 revenue
to corresponding financial data of the Web hosting component of Micron
Electronics' business, the connectivity component and the PC hardware resale
component. CIBC World Markets multiplied the PC hardware multiples by 10% to
account for the lower margin realized by hardware resellers as compared to
hardware manufacturers. The resulting enterprise values of the three constituent
businesses were then added together, which indicated an implied equity reference
range for Micron Electronics of $3.06 to $3.42 per share.

     Selected precedent transactions analysis. CIBC World Markets reviewed the
purchase prices and implied transaction multiples in the following 13 selected
transactions in the Web hosting industry:

     CIBC World Markets reviewed transaction values in the selected transactions
as a multiple of one-year forward and two-year forward revenue. All multiples
for the selected transactions were based on publicly available information at
the time of announcement of the particular transaction. These multiples were
then discounted by 90% to account for currently depressed market conditions in
the Web hosting industry, where many companies from the selected companies
analysis were trading at over a 90% discount to the 52-week high of their
respective trading ranges. Estimated financial data for Interland was based on
internal forecasts prepared by Interland management. CIBC World Markets then
applied a range of selected multiples derived from the selected transactions of
one-year forward and two-year forward revenue to corresponding financial data of
Interland in order to derive implied equity reference ranges for Interland. This
analysis indicated an implied equity reference range for Interland of
approximately $2.08 to $2.84 per share.

Discounted cash flow analysis

     CIBC World Markets performed separate discounted cash flow analyses for
each of Micron Electronics and Interland to estimate the present value of the
unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Micron Electronics and Interland each
could generate over fiscal years 2001 through 2005. Estimated financial data for
Micron Electronics and Interland were based on internal forecasts prepared by
Micron Electronics and Interland management, respectively, which CIBC World
Markets reviewed and discussed with the managements of Micron Electronics and
Interland. CIBC World Markets calculated a range of estimated EBITDA terminal
values by applying terminal value multiples ranging from 10.0x to 12.0x to
Micron Electronics' and Interland's projected fiscal year 2005 EBITDA. The
present value of the cash flows and terminal values were calculated using a
discount rate of 25% to 30%. This analysis indicated an implied equity reference
range for Micron Electronics of approximately $8.69 to $11.53 per share and an
implied equity reference range for Interland of approximately $6.38 to $9.47 per
share.

Contribution analysis

     CIBC World Markets analyzed the relative contributions of Micron
Electronics and Interland to the combined company's fiscal 2000 and estimated
fiscal years 2001 and 2002 Web hosting revenue. Estimated financial data for
Micron Electronics and Interland were based on internal forecasts prepared by
Micron Electronics and Interland management, respectively, which CIBC World
Markets reviewed and discussed with the managements of Micron Electronics and
Interland. This analysis indicated implied contribution reference ranges of
approximately 77.9% to 70.0% pro forma equity ownership for Micron Electronics
and approximately 22.1% to 30.0% pro forma equity ownership for Interland, as
compared to the pro forma equity ownership in the combined company immediately
upon consummation of the merger for the holders

of Micron Electronics common stock of approximately 70% and for the holders of
Interland common stock of approximately 30%.

Other factors

     In rendering its opinion, CIBC World Markets also reviewed and considered
other factors, including:

     - selected research analysts' reports for Micron Electronics and Interland,
       including stock price estimates of those analysts;

     - the 52-week historical trading ranges for Micron Electronics common stock
       and Interland common stock;

     - the relationship between movements in Micron Electronics common stock and
       Interland common stock, movements in the common stock of selected
       companies in the Web hosting industry and movements in the Nasdaq
       National Market Index; and

     - the potential pro forma financial impact of the merger on Micron
       Electronics and Interland based on internal forecasts prepared by Micron
       Electronics and Interland management, respectively, which CIBC World
       Markets reviewed and discussed with the managements of Micron Electronics
       and Interland.

OPINION OF INTERLAND'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

Overview

     Interland engaged Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. as its financial advisor based
on Bear Stearns' experience and expertise in similar transactions. Bear Stearns
is an internationally recognized investment banking firm. Bear Stearns, as part
of its investment banking business, is continuously engaged in the valuation of
businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted
securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.

     At the March 23, 2001 meeting of the Interland board of directors, Bear
Stearns rendered its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing,
to the effect that, as of that date and based on upon qualifications,
assumptions, limitations and other matters set forth in the written opinion, the
exchange

ratio provided for in the agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to
holders of Interland common stock.

     The full text of Bear Stearns' written opinion, which sets for the
assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the
review undertaken by Bear Stearns, is attached as Annex C to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference. The summary of the Bear
Stearns opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
full text of the opinion. INTERLAND SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE BEAR
STEARNS OPINION IN ITS ENTIRETY. In reading the discussions of the Bear Stearns
opinion set forth below, Interland shareholders should be aware that the
opinion:

     - was provided to the Interland board of directors for its benefit and use
       in connection with its consideration as to whether the exchange ratio was
       fair, from a financial point of view, to the shareholders of Interland;

     - did not constitute a recommendation to the board of directors of
       Interland in connection with the merger;

     - did not constitute a recommendation to any holders of Interland common
       stock as to how to vote in connection with the merger;

     - did not address Interland's underlying business decision to pursue the
       merger, the relative merits of the merger as compared to alternative
       business strategies that might exist for Interland or the effects of any
       other transaction in which Interland might engage; and

     - did not express any opinion as to the price or range of prices at which
       the shares of common stock of Interland and Micron Electronics would
       trade subsequent to the announcement of the restructuring and the merger
       or as to the price or range of prices at which the shares of common stock
       of Micron Electronics may trade subsequent to the consummation of the
       restructuring and the merger.

     Although Bear Stearns evaluated the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the exchange ratio to the shareholders of Interland, the exchange ratio
itself was determined at arms-length negotiations. Bear Stearns provided advice
to Interland during the course of such negotiations as requested by the Board of
Directors. Interland did not provide specific instructions to, or place any
procedures to be followed or factors to be considered by, Bear Stearns in
performing its analyses or providing its opinion.

     In arriving at its opinion, Bear Stearns, among other things:

     - reviewed the merger agreement between Interland and Micron Electronics;

     - reviewed Interland's (1) Annual Report for the year ended December 31,
       2000, (2) Registration Statement on Form S-1 which became effective on
       July 24, 2000 and the Prospectus contained therein, (3) unaudited
       financial results for the two months ended February, 28, 2001 and (4)
       reports on Form 8-K for the year ended December 31, 2000 and through
       March 23, 2001;

     - reviewed Micron Electronics' (1) Annual Report for the year ended August
       31, 2000, (2) Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended November
       30, 2000, (3) unaudited financial results for the two months ended
       January 31, 2001 and (4) reports on Form 8-K for the three years ended
       December 31, 2000 and through March 23, 2001;

     - reviewed certain operating and financial information, including
       projections for the three years ending December 31, 2003, prepared and
       provided to Bear Stearns by Interland's management relating to
       Interland's business and prospects on a standalone basis;

     - reviewed certain operating and financial information, including
       projections for the three years ending August 31, 2003, prepared and
       provided to Bear Stearns by Micron Electronics' management relating to
       Micron Electronics' business and prospects on a standalone basis giving
       effect to the restructuring;

     - reviewed certain estimates of cost savings and other combination benefits
       expected to result from the merger, prepared and provided to Bear Stearns
       by Interland's management;

     - met with certain members of the senior management of Interland and Micron
       Electronics to discuss each company's respective business, operations,
       historical and projected financial results and future prospects;

     - reviewed the historical prices, trading multiples and trading volumes of
       the common stock of Interland and Micron Electronics;

     - reviewed publicly available financial data, stock market performance data
       and trading multiples of companies which Bear Stearns deemed generally
       comparable to Interland and Micron Electronics;

     - reviewed the terms of recent merger and acquisition transactions of
       companies which Bear Stearns deemed generally comparable to Interland;

     - reviewed the pro forma financial results, financial condition and
       capitalization of Micron Electronics on a pro forma basis giving effect
       to the restructuring and merger; and

     - conducted such other studies, analyses, inquiries and investigations as
       Bear Stearns deemed appropriate.

     In preparing its opinion, Bear Stearns relied upon and assumed, without
independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial and
other information, including without limitation the financial projections and
estimated combination benefits, provided to Bear Stearns by Interland and Micron
Electronics. With respect to the financial projections and estimated combination
benefits, Bear Stearns assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the senior
managements of Interland and Micron Electronics as to the expected future
performance of Interland and Micron Electronics on a standalone basis and of
Micron Electronics on a pro forma basis giving effect to the restructuring and
the merger. Bear Stearns further assumed the accuracy of and relied upon
information provided by Micron Electronics' management relating to (1) cost
estimates relating to effecting the restructuring, (2) the impact of the
restructuring on Micron Electronics' financial statements and projections and
(3) the timing of the restructuring. Bear Stearns did not assume any
responsibility for the independent verification of any such information or of
the financial projections, synergy estimates and information relating to the
restructuring provided to Bear Stearns, and Bear Stearns further relied upon the
assurances of the senior managements of Interland and Micron Electronics that
they are unaware of any facts that would make the information, financial
projections, synergy estimates and information relating to the restructuring
provided to Bear Stearns incomplete or misleading.

     In arriving at its opinion, Bear Stearns did not perform or obtain any
independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities of Interland and Micron
Electronics, nor was Bear Stearns furnished with any such appraisals. Bear
Stearns assumed that the merger will:

     - qualify as a tax-free "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
       368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code; and

     - be consummated without any regulatory limitations, restrictions,
       conditions, amendments or modifications that collectively would have a
       material effect on Interland and Micron Electronics on a standalone basis
       or on Micron Electronics on a pro forma basis giving effect to the
       restructuring and the merger.

     The following is a brief summary of the material valuation, financial and
comparative analyses considered by Bear Stearns in connection with the rendering
of its opinion. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of
the analyses underlying the Bear Stearns opinion.

     Bear Stearns' opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other
conditions, and the information made available to Bear Stearns, as of the date
of the opinion. In performing its analyses, Bear Stearns made numerous
assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the
control of Bear Stearns,

Interland and Micron Electronics. Any estimates contained in the analyses
performed by Bear Stearns are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested
by such analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or
securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which
such businesses or securities might actually be sold. Accordingly, such analyses
and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

Summary of reviews and analyses

     The following is a summary of the material reviews and financial and
valuation analyses presented by Bear Stearns to Interland's board of directors
at its meeting held on March 23, 2001. In order to understand fully the reviews
and financial valuation analyses used by Bear Stearns, any information presented
in tabular format must be read together with the text of each summary. The
tables alone do not represent a complete description of any such reviews or
financial and valuation analyses.

Situation analysis

     Bear Stearns updated the Interland board of directors on various recent
developments in the U.S. capital markets and the telecom sector. Bear Stearns
also reviewed the solicitation efforts it had undertaken relating to a potential
sale of Interland, which efforts culminated in the agreement to merge with
Micron Electronics.

     U.S. capital markets overview. Bear Stearns reviewed the current state of
the U.S. equity and debt capital markets and observed that the U.S. equity
markets have been extremely challenging over the past year and particularly
since September 1, 2000. Bear Stearns noted that U.S. equity markets have
experienced high levels of volatility with rapid and extreme changes in
valuations. Specifically, Bear Stearns observed that the Nasdaq composite index
closed at 4,234.33 on September 1, 2000 and closed at 1,890.91 at March 16,
2001, a decline of 55.3%. In addition, U.S. issuances of equity and
equity-linked securities for the telecom sector declined from $1.7 billion in
March 2000 to virtually none in March 2001. Similarly, the U.S. market
conditions for high yield and investment grade debt were also very difficult in
2000, but have experienced some recovery during the first part of 2001. The
spread over U.S. Treasurys (i.e., the difference between average yields on U.S.
Treasurys and average yield-to-worst levels for high yield bonds) fell from 941
basis points in mid-December 2000 to 791 basis points on March 16, 2001. Bear
Stearns noted, however, that the high yield market continues to remain closed
for smaller, first-time issuers.

     Telecom sector overview. Bear Stearns noted that stock prices across
various sub-sectors of the telecommunications and data services sectors had
declined substantially over the past year, and particularly since September 1,
2000. Since September 1, 2000, indicies of Web hosting companies, integrated
communications providers/competitive local exchange carriers and the
long-distance carriers had declined approximately 85.3%, 52.4% and 38.8%,
respectively. Bear Stearns further noted that many of Interland's competitors,
generally the smaller, more capital-constrained Web hosting companies, had seen
their stock prices trade down to "distressed" levels. Such stock price declines
had been driven by missed earnings targets for the third and fourth quarters of
2000, reduced guidance for 2001 financial targets and by the lack of access to
debt or equity capital markets for all but the highest quality issuers.

     Bear Stearns further noted that GST Telecommunications, Inc., ICG
Communications, Inc. and NorthPoint Communications Group, Inc. each had filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in recent months and that many other new
entrant providers of telecommunications services were on the brink of a severe
liquidity crisis as of mid-March 2001.

     Summary of Interland solicitation efforts. Bear Stearns reviewed the
efforts it had undertaken related to a potential sale of Interland. Bear Stearns
noted that it had contacted 22 public companies about the sale of, or business
combination with, Interland, and the only parties that expressed any interest
were Micron Electronics and one other party (see section entitled "Background of
the Merger" above).

     Business and financial overviews. Bear Stearns conducted a review of the
historical and projected financial results and financial condition of Interland
and Micron Electronics on a stand-alone basis and of Micron Electronics on a pro
forma basis giving effect to the restructuring and the merger.

     Interland. Bear Stearns reviewed Interland's recent historical operating
and financial results and projected operating and financial results through
December 31, 2003. Bear Stearns observed that since July 2000, at the time of
Interland's initial public offering, Interland management had made significant
reductions to its estimates for revenue and earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, referred to as EBITDA, for the 2001-2003 period.
Bear Stearns noted further that Interland's actual revenue and EBITDA
performance for the two-month period ended February 28, 2001 was below such
recently reduced revenue and EBITDA estimates referenced above. Bear Stearns
also observed that Interland was not fully funded based on its most recent
projections, and that, given recent financial and operating performance was
below management estimates, an even greater amount of capital may be needed
sooner than currently anticipated. Bear Stearns reviewed Interland's potential
short-term and long-term funding sources and noted that Interland would likely
be unable to secure adequate financing for its current business plan from
external sources given current U.S. capital markets.

     Micron Electronics. Bear Stearns reviewed Micron Electronics' recent
historical operating and financial results and projected operating and financial
results through August 31, 2003, in each case giving effect to the
restructuring. Bear Stearns noted that Micron Electronics' actual operating and
financial results for the two-month period ended January 31, 2001 were
relatively consistent with Micron Electronics' estimated results for such
period. Bear Stearns also noted that, based on operating projections and on cost
estimates relating to the restructuring provided by Micron Electronics
management, Micron Electronics would have more than adequate cash balances to
fund its current business plan.

     Micron Electronics pro forma for the merger. Bear Stearns reviewed the
projections of Interland and Micron Electronics (giving effect to the
restructuring) and also the combination of cost savings and benefits that were
expected to result from the merger. Bear Stearns noted that such projections
provided by Interland's and Micron Electronics' management had roughly similar
projected revenue growth rates, profit margins and mix of revenue. Bear Stearns
further noted that expected cost savings provided by Interland management
totaled approximately $10.5 million for the third and fourth quarters of 2001
and approximately $33.8 million for 2002, while expected one-time costs to
achieve such synergies were expected to total approximately $14.5 million. Bear
Stearns noted the significant improvement in Micron Electronics' projected
profitability and cash position as a result of such estimated cost savings as
compared to the sum of the two company's projections excluding the estimated
cost savings.

Financial and valuation analyses

     Hypothetical pro forma trading valuation analysis. Bear Stearns calculated
a range of implied trading values per Interland common share on a pro forma
basis giving effect to the merger, the restructuring and the exchange ratio.
Bear Stearns chose a range of enterprise values of $180.0 million to $280.0
million for Interland and Micron Electronics combined on a pro forma basis. Such
enterprise value range implies a range of enterprise value/2001 estimated
revenue multiples for Micron Electronics on a pro forma basis of approximately
1.23x to 1.91x, which compared to 1.47x for Interland on a standalone basis,
1.94x for Data Return Corp., 2.49x for Globix Corp. and a mean of 1.47x for the
smaller Web hosting companies based on closing stock prices as of March 20, 2000
(see "Analysis of comparable publicly traded Web hosting companies" below).

     After subtracting total debt and adding excess cash balances relating to
both Interland and Micron Electronics, as well as certain other adjustments,
Bear Stearns derived an aggregate net equity value for Micron Electronics on a
pro forma basis giving effect to the merger and the restructuring. Bear Stearns
then calculated a range of Micron Electronics pro forma per share equity values
by dividing such aggregate net equity value by the number of Micron Electronics
fully diluted common shares that would be outstanding subsequent to the merger
based on the exchange ratio. Bear Stearns then calculated the range of implied
Interland per share values by multiplying such Micron Electronics pro forma per
share equity

values by the exchange ratio, and also compared such implied per share equity
values for Interland to Interland's closing stock price of $1.66 per share on
March 20, 2001. A summary of such hypothetical pro forma trading valuation
analysis is provided in the table below.

     Bear Stearns then calculated a range of implied Interland per share equity
values giving effect to the combination benefits discussed above (see "Micron
Electronics pro forma for the merger" above). Bear Stearns calculated such
values based on an estimated range of annual EBITDA synergies at intervals up to
and including $30.0 million, which annual EBITDA synergies Bear Stearns
capitalized at a multiple of 10.0x. The range of implied Interland per share
equity values based on such EBITDA synergies, and the premiums of such values to
Interland's closing stock price of $1.66 per share on March 20, 2001, is
provided in the table below.

     Implied and current valuations and trading multiples. Bear Stearns reviewed
the aggregate net equity and enterprise values of Interland based on (1)
Interland's closing stock price and 20-day average stock price as of March 20,
2001 and (2) the implied pro forma per share equity values giving effect to the
merger (assuming no synergies) (see "Hypothetical pro forma trading valuation
analysis" above). In addition, Bear Stearns compared such per share values to
Interland's recent trading prices and also calculated implied multiples of
enterprise value/estimated revenue for 2001 and 2002. These analyses are
summarized in the table below.

(1) Dollars in millions, except per share data.
(2) Enterprise value represents equity value plus debt and less excess cash.

     Bear Stearns noted that the aforementioned range of implied pro forma
equity values per Interland common share represented meaningful premia versus
Interland's closing stock price and 20-day average stock price as of March 20,
2001 and its 52-week low closing stock price of $1.38 per share on March 16,
2001.

     Analysis of comparable publicly traded Web hosting companies. Bear Stearns
analyzed selected historical and projected operating information, stock market
performance data and valuation multiples for Interland and implied valuation
multiples for Micron Electronics on a pro forma basis giving effect to the
merger and the restructuring (see "Hypothetical pro forma trading valuation
analysis" and "Implied and current valuations and trading multiples" above).
Bear Stearns then compared such data to that of certain publicly traded Web
hosting companies deemed by Bear Stearns to be comparable to Interland.
Specifically, Bear Stearns calculated enterprise value/estimated 2001 revenue
multiples and enterprise value/estimated 2002 revenue multiples based on closing
stock prices as of March 20, 2001 for such comparable Web hosting companies.
Such values and multiples were based on publicly available

information, including estimates published in third-party Wall Street research
reports. These comparable companies and their respective trading multiples are
set forth in the table below.

(1) Represents net equity value plus market value of debt as of March 20, 2001,
    less excess cash.

     Bear Stearns noted that Interland and Micron Electronics on a pro forma
basis were more comparable to the smaller Web hosting companies, which
companies, in general, had lower aggregate stock market capitalizations and
lower levels of historical and projected revenue. Such smaller comparable
companies also were, in general, more capital constrained and had recent stock
price declines greater than those incurred by the larger Web hosting companies.

     No company utilized in the peer group comparison is identical to Interland
or Micron Electronics on a pro forma basis and, accordingly, Bear Stearns'
analysis of comparable companies necessarily involved complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and
other factors which would necessarily affect the relative values of Interland
and Micron Electronics on a pro forma basis versus the companies to which they
were compared.

     Relative contribution analysis. Bear Stearns also performed an analysis of
the relative contributions by Micron Electronics (as adjusted for the
restructuring) and Interland to the pro forma combined company with respect to
revenue, EBITDA without combination benefits and EBITDA with combination
benefits over the 2001 to 2003 period. Bear Stearns' relative contribution
analysis was based upon projections provided by both Interland and Micron
Electronics management. Bear Stearns then compared the analysis referenced above
to the relative contributions to combined enterprise value by Interland and
Micron Electronics. Based on the range of hypothetical Micron Electronics pro
forma enterprise values and the number of Micron Electronics common shares to be
issued to the Interland shareholders based on the exchange ratio, Interland
would retain approximately 52.5% - 65.7% of the combined enterprise value and

Micron Electronics would retain 47.5% - 34.3% of the combined enterprise value.
The relative contribution analysis is summarized in the table below.

(1) Dollars in millions.

(2) Assumes EBITDA synergies of $33.8 million in 2002 and 2003.

     Bear Stearns noted that the relative contribution analysis was consistently
favorable to Interland. Specifically, the portion of Micron Electronics' pro
forma enterprise value retained by Interland's shareholders (i.e., 52.5% - 65.7%
of the total) was well in excess of Interland's relative contribution to revenue
(44.3% - 44.5% of the total), to EBITDA without synergies (33.3% - 49.2%) and to
EBITDA with synergies (18.2% - 39.4%).

     Selected precedent mergers and acquisitions transactions. Bear Stearns
reviewed selected precedent mergers and acquisitions involving companies that,
like Interland, provide Web hosting services. Bear Stearns made specific
reference to two directly comparable transactions in the "shared" Web hosting
space -- Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Corp.'s acquisition of Verio, Inc. in
May 2000 and XO Communication, Inc.'s acquisition of Concentric Network Corp. in
January 2000. However, these transactions were substantially larger than the
merger ($6.4 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively) and were announced in early
and mid-2000, when the Nasdaq composite index was substantially higher than
current levels. In addition, Verio was acquired in a cash transaction. Other
transactions were either not directly comparable (e.g., Exodus Communications
Inc.'s acquisition of GlobalCenter Inc. (collocation) and WorldCom, Inc.'s
acquisition of Intermedia Communications Inc./Digex, Inc. (managed Web hosting))
or were announced when the Web hosting industry was in a different stage of
development (e.g., Metromedia Fiber Network, Inc./AboveNet Communications Inc.
in June 1999 and Verio/Hiway

Technologies, Inc. in November 1998). The following table summarizes certain
relevant statistics for the precedent transactions in the Web hosting sector.

     Bear Stearns noted that none of the precedent mergers and acquisitions
transactions above are identical to the merger. Bear Stearns further noted that
the analysis of precedent transactions necessarily involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that would necessarily affect the acquisition
value of Interland versus the acquisition value of any other comparable company
in general and the transactions above in particular.

Other considerations

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process that involves
various judgments and determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial and valuation analysis and the application of those methods
to the particular circumstances. The opinion is, therefore, not necessarily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Bear Stearns believes
that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of
its analyses and the factors considered, without considering all of the analyses
and factors, would create a misleading and incomplete view of the processes
underlying its opinion. Bear Stearns did not form an opinion as to whether any
individual analysis or factor, whether positive or negative, considered in
isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. In arriving at its
opinion, Bear Stearns did not assign any particular weight to any analysis or
factor considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments based upon its
experience in providing such opinions and on then-existing economic, monetary,
market and other conditions as to the significance of each analysis and factor.
In performing its analyses, Bear Stearns, at Interland's direction and
Interland's consent, made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of Interland or Bear Stearns. Any assumed estimates
implicitly contained in Bear Stearns' opinion or relied upon by Bear Stearns in
rendering its opinion do not necessarily reflect actual values or predict future
results or values. Any estimates relating to the value of the business or
securities do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect the prices
at which companies or securities may actually be sold.

     Interland's board of directors retained Bear Stearns based upon Bear
Stearns' qualifications, experience and expertise. Bear Stearns is an
internationally recognized investment banking firm that regularly engages in the
valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. Bear Stearns has previously
rendered investment banking services to Interland and has received customary
fees for rendering these services. In the ordinary course of its business, Bear
Stearns may actively trade the equity securities of Interland and Micron
Electronics for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and,
accordingly, at any time may hold a long or short position in such securities.

     Pursuant to an engagement letter, Interland agreed to pay to Bear Stearns a
total advisory fee of $2.5 million upon completion of the merger. Of this
amount, $0.5 million was payable upon Bear Stearns rendering its fairness
opinion to Interland's board of directors on March 23, 2001. In addition,
Interland agreed to reimburse Bear Stearns for all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by Bear Stearns in connection with the merger, including the
reasonable fees and disbursements to its legal counsel. Interland has also
agreed to indemnify Bear Stearns against specific liabilities in connection with
its engagement, including liabilities under the Federal securities laws.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

     When considering the recommendations of Micron Electronics' and Interland's
boards of directors, you should be aware that the directors and officers of
Micron Electronics and Interland and Micron Technology and some shareholders of
Interland have interests in the merger and have arrangements that are different
from, or are in addition to, those of Micron Electronics and Interland
shareholders generally. As a result, these directors, officers and shareholders
could be more likely to vote in favor of recommending the merger agreement and
the merger than if they did not hold these interests. The boards of directors of
Micron Electronics and Interland were aware of these interests and took these
interests into account in approving the merger and the transactions contemplated
by the merger documents. These interests include:

     - Acceleration of Interland stock options. Under the terms of the Interland
       Stock Incentive Plan and specific option grants to several executive
       officers, key employees and non-employee directors of Interland, unvested
       options to purchase 1,373,918 shares of Interland common stock will
       immediately vest upon the completion of the merger. The following tables
       show the number of unvested Interland options held by executive officers
       and non-employee directors that will vest and become exercisable as a
       result of the merger assuming that the merger is completed on or after
       July 15, 2001:

                                          NUMBER OF UNVESTED OPTIONS THAT
    INTERLAND EXECUTIVE OFFICER         WILL VEST AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER
    ---------------------------         -----------------------------------

H. Christopher Covington                108,000
Jeffrey L. Ehrlich                      175,000
Nicholas Farsi                          125,000
Kenneth Gavranovic                      108,000
David N. Gill                           201,000
Maryjane Stevens                        48,600
Mark Alexander                          197,000

                                          NUMBER OF UNVESTED OPTIONS THAT
  INTERLAND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR       WILL VEST AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER
  -------------------------------       -----------------------------------

Frederick W. Field                      35,064
Clyde A. Heintzelman                    30,339
William E. Whitmer                      31,915

     - Acceleration of Interland restricted stock. Upon the merger, shares of
       Interland restricted stock subject to a right of repurchase owned by each
       of Interland's directors and executive officers will be exchanged for
       Micron Electronics common stock, subject to the same restrictions. This
       right to repurchase with respect to two-thirds of the restricted stock
       holdings of Christopher Covington and David Gill, officers of Interland,
       will vest upon the merger, and the remainder will vest six months after
       the merger. As of May 15, 2001, Mr. Covington held 75,000 unvested shares
       of restricted stock and Mr. Gill held 300,000 unvested shares of
       restricted stock. Furthermore, restricted stock held by some other
       officers of Interland will fully vest if they are terminated without
       cause within six months after the merger.

     - Board memberships and employment. Assuming the proposal to elect three
       new directors to the Micron Electronics board of directors is approved by
       Micron Electronics' shareholders, three new directors will become members
       of the board of directors of Micron Electronics to fill newly created
       director positions. Two of these new directors have been selected by
       Interland, and one will have been selected jointly by Micron Electronics
       and Interland. In addition, some executive officers of Interland will
       become executive officers of Micron Electronics, including Kenneth
       Gavranovic, who will become vice chairman and chief technology officer of
       Micron Electronics. Mr. Gavranovic and Micron Electronics have entered
       into an employment agreement assumption and amendment that will be
       effective upon the completion of the merger. Under this agreement, Mr.
       Gavranovic's annual salary will be increased to $300,000, but automatic
       increases contained in his original employment agreement with Interland
       will be removed. Micron Electronics anticipates that it will enter into
       employment contracts on customary terms with some executive officers and
       other employees of Interland, although currently it has not done so.

     - Registration rights. Under the MTI registration rights agreement, Micron
       Technology, which will own approximately 42% of the outstanding common
       stock of Micron Electronics after the merger, has been granted
       registration rights with respect to the shares of Micron Electronics
       common stock that it owns. Micron Technology will be entitled to require
       Micron Electronics to register its shares of Micron Electronics common
       stock and will also be entitled to "piggyback" registration rights.

       Additionally, under the amended and restated registration rights
       agreement, Micron Electronics will be required to file a registration
       statement registering for public resale at least 25% of the registrable
       securities that are held by parties to this agreement who own at least
       50% of these registrable securities common stock. The parties to this
       agreement are currently Micron Electronics, Interland, and Micron
       Technology, however, Interland has agreed to use its best efforts to
       cause some of its shareholders to become parties to this agreement, upon
       which the MTI registration rights agreement would terminate. Micron
       Electronics will only be required to effect one registration in any
       six-month period. In addition, the parties to this agreement will also be
       entitled to "piggyback" registration rights.

       For a further description of these registration rights see "Related
       Agreements -- Amended and restated registration rights agreement" on page
       89 and "Related Agreements -- MTI registration rights agreement" on page
       89.

     - Indemnification; insurance. Micron Electronics and Interland directors
       and executive officers have customary rights to indemnification under
       indemnification agreements. The merger agreement provides that, upon
       completion of the merger, Micron Electronics will indemnify and hold
       harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all directors and
       officers of Interland in their capacities as such:

      -- to the same extent they were indemnified or had the right to
         advancement of expenses as of the date of completion of the merger,
         under Interland's articles of incorporation, bylaws and indemnification
         agreements with any directors, officers and employees of Interland; and

      -- to the fullest extent permitted by law, in each case for acts or
         omissions occurring at or prior to the completion of the merger.

      The merger agreement also provides that, upon completion of the merger,
      Micron Electronics will procure, for a period of five years after
      completion of the merger, the comparable coverage as the directors' and
      officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained
      by Interland.

     - Loan guarantee. Interland has guaranteed obligations of Mr. Gavranovic to
       Bear Stearns to repay a $3.4 million loan. Mr. Gavranovic has entered
       into an agreement with Interland under which he has agreed to promptly
       repay Interland any amounts that Interland may pay under that guarantee.
       Micron Electronics will assume the rights and obligations of the
       guarantee at the effective time of the merger. This loan is secured by a
       lien on all the shares of Interland owed by Mr. Gavranovic,

       and salary, severance pay, or other amounts payable to Mr. Gavranovic may
       be offset against the loan.

STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER

     In the merger, Interland and a wholly owned subsidiary of Micron
Electronics will merge, and as a result, Interland will survive the merger and
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Micron Electronics. Each outstanding share
of Interland common stock will be exchanged for 0.861 shares of Micron
Electronics common stock. The exchange ratio cannot be decreased. In the event
that Micron Electronics' cash and cash equivalents, including any amounts to be
received by Micron Electronics for tax refunds, net of those liabilities and
related reserves that are not related to the HostPro business, which amount is
referred to as "Net Available Cash," are less than $200.0 million, less the
amount of any loans made to Interland by Micron Electronics under the bridge
loan and security agreement, as of the closing, the exchange ratio will be
increased as provided in the schedule attached as Annex D. The exchange ratio
could increase to as high as 2.3676 shares of Micron Electronics common stock
for each share of Interland common stock if the Net Available Cash balance drops
below $10.0 million.

     Net Available Cash is the cash and cash equivalents of Micron Electronics,
including any amounts to be received by Micron Electronics for tax refunds, at
the time of the merger closing, less any reserves for all liabilities of Micron
Electronics related to the operations of its PC Systems or SpecTek businesses or
the sale, transfer, disposition or winding down and cessation of operations of
either business, or any other liabilities of Micron Electronics to the extent
not related to its HostPro business.

     The merger agreement contains a procedure for calculating Net Available
Cash that involves Micron Electronics and an independent accounting firm making
the initial determination, with Interland having the right to dispute this
determination through its independent accounting firm. If necessary, a final
determination will be made by a third independent accounting firm. This
determination of the Net Available Cash must be completed at the time of the
closing of the merger.

     Net Available Cash at the time of the merger closing will reflect the
continued funding of the operations of the HostPro business through the closing
and of the PC Systems business through its disposition, as well as the impact of
the transactions involving the sale of the PC Systems and SpecTek businesses.
The net proceeds of approximately $43.2 million from the sale of the SpecTek
assets and the land, building and intellectual property to Micron Technology are
not reflected in the financial statements of Micron Electronics as of March 1,
2001 included in this document. The estimated operating losses for the third
fiscal quarter ending May 31, 2001 and the originally estimated loss on disposal
of the PC Systems business of $147.5 million, are reflected in the financial
statements of Micron Electronics as of March 1, 2001, in this document as a
discontinued operation. Based on the final terms of the agreement to sell the PC
Systems business, the revised estimated loss increased to approximately $170.5
million, including the $70 million cash contribution by Micron Electronics to
GTG PC. Net Available Cash at the time of the merger closing will depend on a
variety of factors that will occur between the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and the merger closing, including the timing of the merger
closing. Therefore, Micron Electronics cannot predict or estimate with any
certainty the amount of Net Available Cash at the time of the merger closing,
and as a result Micron Electronics cannot predict whether the exchange ratio
will remain at 0.8610 or will be increased as provided in the schedule attached
as Annex D. We encourage you to review Annex D for examples of how the exchange
ratio could be adjusted according to the amount of Net Available Cash at the
time of the merger closing.

TREATMENT OF OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

     Options and warrants to purchase Interland common stock will be exchanged
for options or warrants, as the case may be, to purchase shares of Micron
Electronics common stock according to the exchange ratio.

NO FRACTIONAL SHARES

     No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of Micron
Electronics common stock will be issued in connection with the merger. Instead,
Interland's shareholders will receive cash, without interest, in lieu of a
fraction of a share of Micron Electronics common stock.

POTENTIAL CASH PAYMENT TO MICRON ELECTRONICS' SHAREHOLDERS

     To the extent that Micron Electronics has Excess Cash at the closing of the
merger, or Net Proceeds from the disposition of the PC Systems business within
three years of the closing of the merger, the holders of Micron Electronics
common stock of record as of the close of trading on the closing date of the
merger, will be entitled to receive pro rata cash payments of any Excess Cash
and of any additional Net Proceeds. Interland shareholders will not be entitled
to receive any distributions of Excess Cash or Net Proceeds. Based on its
current estimates, Micron Electronics believes it will not have Excess Cash at
the closing of the merger. In addition, Micron Electronics cannot assure you
that it will receive any Net Proceeds, or that any Net Proceeds received by
Micron Electronics would be sufficient to result in a cash payment to Micron
Electronics' shareholders. However, in the event it will have Excess Cash or Net
Proceeds, any payments are subject to the following restrictions:

     - Any Excess Cash or Net Proceeds received prior to the six-month
       anniversary of the closing will be held in escrow for six months
       following the closing of the merger. These amounts will be used to pay
       any liabilities that do not relate to the HostPro business and that arise
       before the end of that six-month escrow period;

     - At the end of the six-month period, a special committee of the board of
       directors of Micron Electronics, will determine if Micron Electronics has
       any liabilities relating to its former non-hosting businesses. The
       determination of this amount is subject to the approval by Micron
       Technology, or any person that Micron Technology designates to represent
       the pre-closing date Micron Electronics shareholders. If the special
       committee and the representative are unable to agree on these amounts,
       the merger agreement provides for specific dispute resolution procedures;

     - No payments of Excess Cash will be made after the third anniversary of
       the closing of the merger, regardless of whether Excess Cash is received
       after the three-year period. Additionally, Micron Electronics would not
       be entitled to receive Net Proceeds after the third anniversary of the
       closing of the sale of the PC Systems business;

     - For administrative convenience, payments of Excess Cash or Net Proceeds
       may be deferred by Micron Electronics, in its sole discretion, until the
       aggregate amount of any payments is equal to or greater than $10.0
       million;

     - The right to receive any cash payments is granted to these shareholders
       individually, is not transferable and will not attach to or trade with
       the common stock of Micron Electronics and will not be represented by any
       certificate, document or other instrument; and

     - A record date will be set as of the close of trading on the date of the
       closing of the merger, but immediately prior to the merger closing in
       connection with the potential cash payments of Excess Cash or Net
       Proceeds.

     EXCESS CASH is the amount of cash and cash equivalents shown on Micron
Electronics' audited closing date balance sheet, less:

     - The amount of any liabilities on that closing date balance sheet relating
       to businesses other than the Web hosting business; and

     - An amount equal to $200.0 million plus the amount of any decrease in the
       reserves for non-hosting business liabilities originally reflected on the
       post-closing balance sheet, reflected in Micron Electronics financial
       statements after the closing date of the merger and which have been
       audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

     NET PROCEEDS are net proceeds received by Micron Electronics from the sale
of its PC Systems business, after provision for taxes, payment of commissions,
payment of indebtedness required to be incurred in connection with the sale,
deduction of any amounts as a reserve or credit against the purchase price. In
the event of a sale of, or initial public offering of securities with respect
to, the PC Systems business within three years of the closing of the sale of the
PC Systems business, Micron Electronics would be entitled to receive a
percentage of any proceeds available only after payment of liabilities and
transaction costs and payment of a specified return to the investors in GTG PC
Holdings. This percentage decreases each year until the third year, after which
time Micron Electronics will not be entitled to any proceeds.

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER

     The merger will be completed no later than the time when all of the
conditions to completion of the merger are satisfied or waived, including
approval of the merger and approval and adoption of the merger agreement by the
shareholders of Interland, approval of the issuance of shares of Micron
Electronics common stock in the merger and the amendment to Micron Electronics'
articles of incorporation and bylaws, increase in the size of the Micron
Electronics board of three directors and election of directors by the
shareholders of Micron Electronics. The merger will become effective upon both
the filing of a certificate of merger with the State of Delaware and the filing
of articles of merger with the State of Georgia.

EXCHANGE OF INTERLAND STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR MICRON ELECTRONICS STOCK
CERTIFICATES

     When the merger is completed, Micron Electronics' exchange agent will mail
to Interland shareholders a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in
surrendering Interland stock certificates in exchange for Micron Electronics
stock certificates. When an Interland shareholder delivers its Interland stock
certificates to the exchange agent along with an executed letter of transmittal,
the Interland stock certificates will be canceled and the shareholder will
receive Micron Electronics stock certificates representing the number of full
shares of Micron Electronics common stock to which the shareholder is entitled
under the merger agreement. Interland shareholders should not submit their
Interland stock certificates for exchange unless and until they receive the
transmittal instructions and a form of letter of transmittal from the exchange
agent.

     Micron Electronics will only issue Interland shareholders a Micron
Electronics stock certificate or a check instead of a fractional share in a name
in which the surrendered Interland stock certificate is registered. If any
Interland shareholder wishes to have a certificate or check issued in another
name, the shareholder must present the exchange agent with all documents
required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership and show that
it paid any applicable stock transfer taxes. If any Interland shareholder has
lost its stock certificate, that shareholder will be required to furnish an
affidavit of loss and a bond in addition to the documents accompanying the
letter of transmittal to receive the corresponding Micron Electronics stock
certificate.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

     The following discussion summarizes the material federal income tax
consequences of the merger to Micron Electronics, Interland and their
shareholders. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code, applicable
Treasury Regulations, judicial authority, and administrative rulings and
practice, all as of the date hereof. The IRS could adopt positions contrary to
those set forth below. In addition, future legislative, judicial, or
administrative changes or interpretations could adversely affect the accuracy of
these statements and conclusions. These changes or interpretations could be
applied retroactively and could affect the tax consequences of the merger to
Micron Electronics, Interland and their respective shareholders. This discussion
assumes that you hold your Micron Electronics or Interland shares as capital
assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code. This discussion does not
address all federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to you in
light of your particular circumstances. For example, this

discussion does not address the federal income tax consequences of the merger to
the following classes of shareholders:

     - dealers in securities;

     - foreign persons;

     - financial institutions;

     - tax-exempt organizations;

     - insurance companies;

     - Interland shareholders who acquired their Interland shares through stock
       option or stock purchase programs or in other compensatory transactions;
       and

     - Interland shareholders who hold their Interland shares as part of a
       straddle, conversion, or other integrated transaction.

     In addition, the following discussion does not address the tax consequences
of the merger under foreign, state or local tax laws. Finally, the discussion
does not address the tax consequences of transactions occurring prior to or
after the merger, whether or not these transactions are in connection with the
merger, including, without limitation, the exercise of options or rights to
purchase Interland shares in anticipation of the merger. ACCORDINGLY, MICRON
ELECTRONICS AND INTERLAND SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX
ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING
THE APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE
MERGER.

Federal income tax consequences to Interland shareholders

     The merger will qualify as a reorganization for federal income tax purposes
under section 368(a) of the Code. As a reorganization, the merger will have the
following federal income tax consequences to the Interland shareholders, subject
to the limitations and qualifications referred to in this section:

     - You will not recognize gain or loss on the exchange of your Interland
       shares for shares of Micron Electronics common stock in the merger,
       except as discussed below with respect to cash received in lieu of
       fractional shares of Micron Electronics common stock.

     - If you receive cash in lieu of a fractional share of Micron Electronics
       common stock, you will be treated as if you actually received a
       fractional share, and that share was subsequently redeemed by Micron
       Electronics. You should recognize gain or loss with respect to the cash
       you receive in lieu of a fractional share measured by the difference
       between the amount of cash you receive and your tax basis in the
       fractional share. Generally, your gain or loss will be capital gain or
       loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held your
       Interland shares for more than one year as of the closing date of the
       merger.

     - You must transfer the tax basis in your Interland shares to the Micron
       Electronics common stock, including fractional shares, you receive in the
       merger. After any fractional shares are treated as redeemed, the
       aggregate tax basis in the Micron Electronics common stock you receive in
       the merger will equal the aggregate tax basis in the Interland shares you
       surrendered, reduced by any basis allocable to fractional shares in
       exchange for which you receive cash.

     - The holding period for the Micron Electronics common stock you receive in
       the merger will include the period during which you held the Interland
       shares you exchanged for Micron Electronics common stock.

     Even if the merger qualifies as a reorganization, you will recognize gain
to the extent that you receive any shares of Micron Electronics common stock in
exchange for services or property other than solely Interland shares. All or a
portion of this gain could be taxable as ordinary income. You will also
recognize gain to the extent you are treated as receiving consideration other
than Micron Electronics common stock in exchange for Interland shares.

Federal income tax consequences to Micron Electronics shareholders

     You will not recognize gain or loss as a result of the merger, and the tax
basis in your Micron Electronics shares will not change as a result of the
merger.

Federal income tax consequences to Micron Electronics and Interland

     Micron Electronics, including its merger subsidiary, and Interland will not
recognize gain or loss as a result of the merger.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER

     Micron Electronics intends to account for the merger as a purchase for
financial reporting and accounting purposes. After the merger, the results of
operations of Interland will be included in the consolidated financial
statements of Micron Electronics. The purchase price, or, the aggregate merger
consideration, will be allocated based on the fair values of the assets acquired
and the liabilities assumed. Any excess of cost over fair value of the net
tangible assets of Interland acquired will be recorded as goodwill and other
intangible assets and will be amortized by charges to operations under generally
accepted accounting principles.

REGULATORY FILINGS AND APPROVALS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER

     The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act, which prevents some transactions from being
completed until required information and materials are furnished to the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission
and the appropriate waiting periods end or expire. We have filed the required
information and materials with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission and the waiting period under that Act has expired.

     The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade
Commission may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds after expiration of the
waiting period. Accordingly, at any time before or after the completion of the
merger, either the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the
Federal Trade Commission could take action under the antitrust laws. Other
persons could also take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to
enjoin the merger. Additionally, at any time before or after the completion of
the merger, notwithstanding that the applicable waiting period expired or ended,
any state could take action under the antitrust laws.

     Neither of us is aware of any other material governmental or regulatory
approval required for completion of the merger, other than the effectiveness of
the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a
part, compliance with applicable corporate law of Delaware and Georgia and rules
of the Nasdaq National Market.

RESTRICTIONS ON SALES OF SHARES BY AFFILIATES OF INTERLAND AND MICRON
ELECTRONICS

     The shares of Micron Electronics common stock issued in the merger will be
freely transferable under the Securities Act, except for shares of Micron
Electronics common stock issued to any person who is an affiliate of either of
Micron Electronics or Interland. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates
include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under
common control of either of Micron Electronics or Interland and may include some
of their officers and directors, as well as their principal shareholders.
Affiliates may not sell their shares of Micron Electronics common stock acquired
in the merger except under:

     - an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
       resale of those shares;

     - an exception under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or

     - any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

LISTING ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET OF MICRON ELECTRONICS COMMON STOCK TO BE
ISSUED IN THE MERGER

     It is a condition to the closing of the merger that the shares of Micron
Electronics common stock to be issued in the merger be approved for listing on
the Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of issuance.

ABSENCE OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Holders of Interland common stock do not have dissenters' appraisal rights
under Georgia law in connection with the merger. Likewise, holders of Micron
Electronics common stock do not have dissenters' appraisal rights under
Minnesota law in connection with the merger.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF INTERLAND COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER

     If the merger is completed, the Interland common stock will be delisted
from the Nasdaq National Market and its registration under the Exchange Act will
be terminated.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

Time" carefully.

NO OTHER NEGOTIATIONS

     Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated,
Interland has agreed not to take any of the following actions directly or
indirectly:

     - solicit or initiate the making, submission or announcement of any
       Acquisition Proposal, as defined below;

     - participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
       Proposal;

     - furnish any non-public information with respect to any Acquisition
       Proposal;

     - take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
       Acquisition Proposal;

     - engage in discussions with any person with respect to any Acquisition
       Proposal except as to the existence of these prohibitions;

     - approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or

     - enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract,
       agreement or commitment relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

     However, if Interland receives an unsolicited, written, bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that its board of directors reasonably concludes, based on
written advice of a financial advisor of national standing, may constitute a
Superior Offer, as defined below, Interland may furnish non-public information
regarding it and may enter into discussions with the person or group who has
made that Acquisition Proposal, if:

     - neither Interland nor its representatives have violated the provisions
       otherwise restricting its negotiations with third parties or its
       furnishing non-public information to third parties;

     - Interland's board of directors concludes in good faith, after
       consultation with its outside legal counsel, that this action is required
       for the board of directors to meet its fiduciary obligations to
       Interland's shareholders under applicable law;

     - prior to furnishing non-public information to, or entering into any
       discussions with, a party making the Acquisition Proposal, Interland
       gives Micron Electronics written notice of the Acquisition Proposal,
       including the identity of the party making the Acquisition Proposal and
       the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal;

     - Interland gives Micron Electronics at least three business days' advance
       notice of its intent to furnish non-public information or enter into
       discussions; and

     - Interland furnishes the non-public information to Micron Electronics at
       the same time that Interland furnishes this information to the party
       making the Acquisition Proposal and the information furnished to the
       other party is subject to an agreement requiring the confidential
       treatment of that information on terms at least as restrictive as those
       governing the confidential information of Interland provided to Micron
       Electronics.

     Interland has agreed to inform Micron Electronics as promptly as
practicable as to any Acquisition Proposal, request for non-public information
that Interland reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry that Interland reasonably should believe would lead to an Acquisition
Proposal. Interland has also agreed to inform Micron Electronics as to the
identity of the party making the Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and
the material terms of the Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. Interland
also has agreed to keep Micron Electronics informed as promptly as practicable
in all material respects as to the status and details of any Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry.

     An ACQUISITION PROPOSAL is any offer or proposal by a third party relating
to:

     - the acquisition or purchase of more than a 20% interest in the total
       outstanding voting securities of Interland or any of its subsidiaries;

     - any tender offer or exchange offer, that, if consummated, would result in
       any person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of the total
       outstanding voting securities of Interland or any of its subsidiaries;

     - any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
       involving Interland under which shareholders of Interland immediately
       prior to the acquisition hold less than 80% of the equity interest in the
       resulting entity;

     - any sale, lease outside the ordinary course of business, exchange,
       transfer, license outside the ordinary course of business, or acquisition
       or disposition of more than 50% of the assets of Interland; or

     - any liquidation or dissolution of Interland.

     A SUPERIOR OFFER with respect to Interland is an unsolicited, bona fide
written proposal made by a third party to complete any of the following
transactions:

     - a merger or consolidation involving Interland under which the
       shareholders of Interland immediately preceding the transaction hold less
       than 50% of the equity interest in the surviving entity of the
       transaction; or

     - the acquisition by any person or group, including by way of a tender
       offer or an exchange offer or a two step transaction involving a tender
       offer followed with reasonable promptness by a merger involving
       Interland, directly or indirectly, of ownership of 100% of the then
       outstanding shares of capital stock of Interland

on terms that the board of directors of Interland determines, in its reasonable
judgment, based on the written advice of a financial advisor of national
standing, to be more favorable to Interland's shareholders than the terms of the
merger. An offer will not be a Superior Offer if any financing required to
complete the transaction is not committed and it is not likely, in the
reasonable judgment of Interland's board of directors, based on the advice of a
financial advisor of national standing, to be obtained on a timely basis.

     Interland's board of directors may, without breaching the merger agreement,
withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor of the merger
proposal if:

     - a Superior Offer is made to Interland and is not withdrawn;

     - Interland provides written notice to Micron Electronics, including the
       identity of the party making the Superior Offer and specifying the
       material terms and conditions of the Superior Offer;

     - Micron Electronics does not, within five business days after receiving
       this written notice, make an offer that the board of directors of
       Interland determines by majority vote in its good faith judgment, based
       on written advice of a financial advisor of national standing, to be at
       least as favorable to Interland's shareholders as the Superior Offer;

     - Interland's board of directors concludes in good faith, after
       consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of the
       Superior Offer, the withholding, withdrawal, amendment or modification of
       its recommendation is required for the board of directors to comply with
       its fiduciary obligations to Interland's shareholders under applicable
       law; and

     - Interland has not violated the provisions in the merger agreement related
       to the restrictions on its negotiations with third parties, its
       furnishing non-public info to third parties or related to calling
       shareholder meetings or soliciting proxies.

     Interland also agreed to provide Micron Electronics with prior notice of
any meeting of its board of directors at which Interland's board of directors is
reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal to determine whether it
is a Superior Offer. Even if the board of directors' recommendation is withheld,
withdrawn, amended or modified, Interland must nevertheless hold and convene the
shareholders meeting with respect to the proposed merger with Micron
Electronics.

     The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to closing the
merger, whether before or after the requisite shareholder approval:

     - by mutual written consent authorized by the boards of directors of Micron
       Electronics and Interland;

     - by either Micron Electronics or Interland, if the merger is not completed
       by November 30, 2001, except that the right to terminate the merger
       agreement under this provision is not available to any party whose action
       or failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the
       failure of the merger to occur on or by November 30, 2001, and this
       action or failure to act constitutes a breach of the merger agreement;

     - by either Micron Electronics or Interland, if a governmental authority
       has issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action that is
       final and nonappealable, having the effect of permanently enjoining,
       restraining or prohibiting the merger;

     - by either Micron Electronics or Interland, if the merger is not approved
       by the shareholders of Interland, except that the right to terminate the
       merger agreement under this provision is not available to Interland where
       the failure to obtain shareholder approval was caused by an action or
       failure to act by Interland that constitutes a material breach of the
       merger agreement, or a breach of the voting agreement by any party other
       than Micron Electronics;

     - by either Micron Electronics or Interland if the proposals submitted to
       the Micron Electronics shareholders for the Micron Electronics special

       agreement under this provision is not available to Micron Electronics if
       the failure to obtain shareholder approval was caused by an action or
       failure to act by Micron Electronics that constitutes a material breach
       of the merger agreement;

     - by Micron Electronics at any time prior to the approval of the merger and
       approval and adoption of the merger agreement by the required vote of
       shareholders of Interland, if a Triggering Event, as described below,
       occurs;

     - by Interland, on the one hand, or Micron Electronics, on the other, upon
       a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the
       part of the other in the merger agreement, or if any of the other's
       representations or warranties are or become untrue, so that the
       corresponding condition to closing would not be met. However, if the
       breach or inaccuracy is curable by the other through the exercise of its
       commercially reasonable efforts, and the other continues to exercise
       commercially reasonable efforts, then the other may not terminate the
       merger agreement if the breach or inaccuracy is cured within 30 days
       after delivery of the notice of breach or inaccuracy; or

     - by Interland if the Net Available Cash at closing is less than $100.0
       million, less the amount of the aggregate bridge loan amount made to
       Interland under to the bridge loan and security agreement further
       described under "Related Agreements -- Bridge loan and security
       agreement," provided particular conditions do not occur. This termination
       right will not be available to Interland if more than $10.0 million has
       been advanced to Interland under the bridge loan and security agreement.

     A TRIGGERING EVENT will occur if:

     - Interland's board of directors withdraws or amends or modifies in a
       manner adverse to Micron Electronics its unanimous recommendation in
       favor of the approval of the merger and adoption and approval of the
       merger agreement;

     - Interland fails to include in this joint proxy statement/prospectus the
       unanimous recommendation of its board of directors in favor of the
       approval of the merger and the adoption and approval of the merger
       agreement;

     - Interland's board of directors fails to reaffirm its unanimous
       recommendation in favor of the approval of the merger and the adoption
       and approval of the merger agreement within 10 business days after Micron
       Electronics requests in writing that this recommendation be reaffirmed at
       any time after the public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal;

     - Interland's board of directors or any committee of the board approves or
       publicly recommends any Acquisition Proposal;

     - Interland enters into a letter of intent or agreement accepting an
       Acquisition Proposal;

     - Interland materially breaches the provisions of the merger agreement
       restricting its negotiation with third parties or provision of non-public
       information or the provisions of the merger agreement relating to holding
       the Interland's shareholders meeting; or

     - if a tender or exchange offer relating to the securities of Interland is
       commenced by a person or entity unaffiliated with the Micron Electronics,
       and Interland does not send to its shareholders within 10 business days
       after the tender or exchange offer is first commenced a statement
       disclosing that Interland recommends rejection of the tender or exchange
       offer.

TERMINATION FEE

     Interland will be obligated to pay Micron Electronics a termination fee
equal to $3.5 million, plus an amount equal to the amount of any outstanding
amounts under the bridge loan up to $2.1 million, if Micron Electronics
terminates the merger agreement at any time prior to approval of the merger by
Interland's shareholders because a Triggering Event has occurred. This
termination fee is in addition to repaying the aggregate bridge loan amount
under the terms of the bridge loan and security agreement further described
under "Related Agreements -- Bridge loan and security agreement."

     If the merger agreement is terminated by either Interland or Micron
Electronics because the required approval of the merger by Interland's
shareholders was not obtained, or Micron Electronics terminates the merger
agreement due to a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
of Interland, Interland is obligated to pay the termination fee described in the
previous paragraph, in the event that:

     - prior to termination of the merger agreement an Acquisition Proposal was
       publicly announced; and

     - within 12 months of the termination of the merger agreement, Interland:

      -- completes an Acquisition, as defined below; or

      -- enters into an agreement providing for an Acquisition, and that
         Acquisition is later consummated with the person with whom the
         agreement was entered into or an affiliate of that person, regardless
         of when it closes.

     Micron Electronics is obligated to pay Interland a termination fee equal to
$3.5 million if, due to the failure to obtain the approval of the proposals to
be voted upon at the Micron Electronics special meeting of shareholders by the
shareholders of Micron, the merger agreement is terminated and an Acquisition
Proposal is publicly announced prior to the termination of the merger agreement,
and within 12 months of the termination of the merger agreement, Micron
Electronics:

     - completes an Acquisition; or

     - enters into an agreement providing for an Acquisition and that
       Acquisition is later consummated with the person with whom the agreement
       was entered into or an affiliate of that person, regardless of when it
       closes.

     Any transaction contemplated by the merger agreement as well as the Micron
Electronics' contemplated changes are excluded from the definition of
Acquisition as it relates to Micron Electronics.

     An ACQUISITION is any of the following:

     - a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
       liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the applicable
       company in which the applicable company's shareholders immediately
       preceding the transaction hold less than 50% of the aggregate equity
       interests in the surviving entity of the transaction;

     - a sale or other disposition of assets representing in excess of 50% of
       the aggregate fair market value of the applicable company's business; or

     - the acquisition by any person or group, including by way of a tender
       offer or an exchange offer or issuance by the company, directly or
       indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial
       ownership of shares representing in excess of 50% of the voting power of
       the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the applicable company.

AMENDMENT, EXTENSION AND WAIVER OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     Any party to this agreement may amend the merger agreement before closing
the merger by execution of a written instrument signed by each party, provided
that the party complies with applicable state law regarding resolicitation of
shareholder votes in amending the agreement. Either of the parties may extend
the other's time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
under the merger agreement, waive any inaccuracies in the other's
representations and warranties and waive compliance by the other with any of the
agreements or conditions contained in the merger agreement.

VOTING AGREEMENT

     In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Micron
Electronics, Micron Technology and some Interland shareholders entered into a
voting agreement, under which:

     - some Interland shareholders agreed to vote an aggregate of 17,994,964
       shares of Interland common stock held by them, constituting an aggregate
       of approximately 38% of Interland's outstanding common stock as of March
       15, 2001, in favor of the approval of the merger and the approval and
       adoption of the merger agreement and any other actions contemplated by
       the merger agreement and any actions required in furtherance of the
       merger. They also agreed to vote against any proposal made in opposition
       to or in competition with the merger or any action or agreement that
       would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or
       any other obligation or agreement of Interland under the merger agreement
       or of the shareholders under the voting agreement. Each of those
       Interland shareholders executed an irrevocable proxy to this effect with
       respect to the shares subject to the voting agreement.

     - Micron Technology agreed to vote the 58,622,863 shares of Micron
       Electronics common stock beneficially held by it, constituting
       approximately 61% of Micron Electronics' outstanding common stock:

      -- in favor of the approval of the merger and approval and adoption of the
         approval of the merger agreement;

      -- in favor of the issuance of Micron Electronics common stock in the
         merger;

      -- in favor of the amendment to Micron Electronics' articles of
         incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of Micron
         Electronics capital stock to 200 million and change the name of Micron
         Electronics to "Interland, Inc.";

      -- in favor of the amendments to the bylaws to amend the term of the
         directors and authorize the board to decrease the size of the board;

      -- in favor of the proposal to increase the size of the Micron Electronics
         board to eight;

      -- in favor of the appointment of the new directors; and

      -- against approval of any proposal made in opposition to or in
         competition with the merger, including acquisitions of Micron
         Electronics, or any action or agreement that would result in a breach
         of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or
         of Micron Electronics under the merger agreement or of Micron
         Technology under the voting agreement.

     Micron Technology and those Interland shareholders also agreed not to offer
for sale, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option
or other arrangement to offer for sale, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of
their shares of Micron Electronics or Interland, as the case may be. To the
extent that Micron Technology or any of those Interland shareholders was a party
to an agreement to transfer their shares of Micron Electronics or Interland
common stock, as of the date of the Merger Agreement, that shareholder has
agreed not to transfer its shares unless the transferee agrees to be bound under
the terms of the voting agreement.

AMENDED AND RESTATED REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

     In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Interland agreed
to use its best efforts to cause the parties to its existing registration rights
agreement to amend and restate that registration rights agreement. This
agreement will require Micron Electronics to file a registration statement
registering for public resale at least 25% of the registrable securities that
are held by the former Interland shareholders that are parties to this agreement
and Micron Technology, or a lesser percentage provided the aggregate offering
price exceeds $5.0 million, upon request by those shareholders. Micron
Electronics will only be required to effect one registration in any six-month
period. In addition, the parties to this agreement holding registrable
securities will be entitled to "piggyback" registration rights so as to be able
to include their shares of Micron Electronics common stock in a registration
statement filed by Micron Electronics.

MTI REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

     In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Micron
Electronics, Interland and Micron Technology entered into an MTI registration
rights agreement under which Micron Electronics granted Micron Technology
registration rights with respect to the shares of Micron Electronics common
stock that Micron Technology owns. This agreement will require Micron
Electronics to file a registration statement registering for public resale at
least 25% of the shares of Micron Electronics common stock that are beneficially
owned by Micron Technology, or a lesser percentage provided the aggregate
offering price exceeds $5.0 million, upon the request of Micron Technology.
Micron Electronics will only be required to effect one registration in any
six-month period. In addition, Micron Technology will be entitled to "piggyback"
registration rights so as to be able to include its shares of Micron Electronics
common stock in a registration statement filed by Micron Electronics. This
agreement will be replaced by the amended and restated registration rights
agreement upon its execution as discussed above.

SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT

     In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Micron
Electronics, Joel J. Kocher and some Interland shareholders entered into a
shareholder agreement. Under this agreement, Mr. Kocher and several Interland
shareholders who will hold approximately 12% of the combined company's
outstanding shares of capital stock assuming an exchange ratio of 0.8610, agreed
not to sell the corresponding number of shares of Micron Electronics common
stock that they will own or receive in the merger, for a period of nine months
after the closing of the Merger. This agreement is subject to some exceptions,
which include but are not limited to, transfers:

     - to Micron Electronics;

     - in a public offering of Micron Electronics securities;

     - in response to a third party tender offer or exchange offer;

     - in a merger or consolidation; or

     - under a plan of liquidation approved by Micron Electronics.

     In addition, these shareholders are also permitted to transfer shares of
Micron Electronics common stock to any other person provided that the person
agrees to be bound by this shareholder agreement.

MTI SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT

     In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Micron
Electronics and Micron Technology entered into a MTI shareholder agreement.
Under this agreement Micron Technology agreed not to sell any shares of Micron
Electronics common stock beneficially held by it, for a period of nine

months after the closing of the merger. This agreement is subject to some
exceptions, which include but are not limited to, transfers:

     - to Micron Electronics;

     - in a public offering of Micron Electronics securities;

     - in response to a third party tender offer or exchange offer;

     - in a merger or consolidation; or

     - under to a plan of liquidation approved by Micron Electronics.

     In addition, Micron Technology is also permitted to transfer shares of
Micron Electronics common stock to any other person provided that the person
agrees to be bound by these resale restrictions of this MTI shareholder
agreement. Assuming an exchange ratio of 0.861, Micron Technology will hold
approximately 43% of the outstanding shares of the combined company.

     Micron Technology also agreed not to acquire additional voting securities
of Micron Electronics common stock or beneficial ownership of Micron Electronics
common stock for a period of 18 months after the closing of the merger, subject
to specific exceptions. Micron Technology also granted to Micron Electronics an
option to purchase, at any time after the closing of the merger until two years
after the closing of the merger, all outstanding shares of Micron Electronics
common stock held by Micron Technology in excess of 25% of Micron Electronics'
outstanding capital stock. The purchase price for this option will be the
average of the closing prices of the securities on a national securities
exchange or the Nasdaq National Market over the 20 trading day period ending two
days prior to the purchase of the stock under this option. The MTI shareholder
agreement also provides that Micron Technology will have the right to receive
information with respect to Micron Electronics so long as Micron Technology
holds at least 5% of the outstanding voting stock of Micron Electronics.

BRIDGE LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT

     In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Micron
Electronics entered into a bridge loan and security agreement with Interland.
Under the terms of this agreement, if the closing of the merger has not occurred
prior to June 30, 2001, Micron Electronics has agreed to advance up to an
aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million to Interland between June 30, 2001
and August 30, 2001.

     In addition, if the closing of the merger has not occurred prior to August
31, 2001, Micron Electronics has agreed to advance up to an aggregate principal
amount of $20.0 million, including all amounts previously advanced under this
agreement, until the earlier to occur of:

     - the closing of the merger; or

     - the termination of the merger agreement.

     Interest accrues on amounts advanced under the bridge loan and security
agreement at the rate of 10% per year. Loans made under this agreement will be
secured by all the assets of Interland. These loans must also be repaid
regardless of whether the merger is completed.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT ASSUMPTION AND AMENDMENT

     In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Micron
Electronics and Kenneth Gavranovic, the current chairman and chief executive
officer of Interland, agreed to assume and amend the employment agreement dated

Mr. Gavranovic will be employed as vice chairman and chief technical officer of
the combined company and will receive a base salary of $300,000 per year.

          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information
has been prepared to give effect to the merger, to be accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting. The total estimated purchase price of the merger
has been allocated on a preliminary basis to assets and liabilities based on
management's best estimates of their fair value with the excess cost over the
net assets acquired allocated to goodwill. The adjustments to the unaudited pro
forma combined condensed financial information are subject to change pending a
final analysis of the total purchase price and the fair value of the assets and
liabilities assumed. The impact of these changes could be material.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of March 1,
2001 gives effect to the merger as if it had occurred on March 1, 2001, and
combines the historical consolidated balance sheet of Micron Electronics as of
that date and the historical consolidated balance sheet of Interland as of March
31, 2001.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations for the
year ended August 31, 2000 combines the historical consolidated statement of
operations of Micron Electronics for the year ended August 31, 2000 with the
historical consolidated statement of operations of Interland for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2000. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed
statement of operations for the six month period ended March 1, 2001, combines
the historical consolidated statement of operations of Micron Electronics for
the six months ended March 1, 2001 with the historical consolidated statement of
operations of Interland for the six months ended March 31, 2001.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information is based

                NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED
                              FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED BALANCE SHEET

     The pro forma combined condensed balance sheet gives effect to the merger
as if it had occurred on March 1, 2001 with respect to the balance sheet of
Micron Electronics or on March 31, 2001, with respect to the balance sheet of
Interland.

     On March 23, 2001, Micron Electronics announced it would acquire all the
outstanding common stock of Interland by issuing 0.8610 shares of Micron
Electronics common stock in exchange for each share of Interland common stock.
In addition, Micron Electronics will issue options and warrants to purchase
shares of Micron Electronics common stock in exchange for each issued and
outstanding Interland option and warrant using the ratio of 0.8610 shares of
Micron Electronics for each share of Interland. The exchange ratio could be
adjusted as provided in the merger agreement. The following adjustments have
been reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet:

          (a) To record common stock, options and warrants issued to the
     shareholders of Interland, the elimination of Interland equity and the
     application of purchase accounting.

     Under purchase accounting, the total purchase price will be allocated to
Interland's assets and liabilities based on their fair values as required by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, Business Combinations. The
allocations are subject to valuations as of the date of the consummation of the
merger. The amounts and components of the estimated purchase price along with
the preliminary allocation of the estimated purchase price to net assets
purchased are presented below.

     The assumed total purchase price of approximately $125.2 million consists
of approximately 40.8 million shares of Micron Electronics' common stock assumed
to be issued with an estimated fair value of $112.7 million, 9.6 million vested
and unvested stock options and warrants with an estimated fair value of $8.1
million, and estimated direct transaction costs of approximately $4.5 million.
The 40.8 million shares of Micron Electronics common stock to be issued is based
upon 47,348,585 shares of Interland common stock outstanding at March 31, 2001
at the exchange ratio of 0.861. The fair value of Micron Electronics' common
stock was determined as the average market price from March 21, 2001 to March
27, 2001, which includes two trading days prior and two trading days subsequent
to the public announcement of the merger. The fair value of the common stock
options and warrants were estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest rate of
4.5%, expected lives of 3.5 and 3.1 years, respectively, expected dividend rate
of 0%, and volatility of 76%.

Transaction costs......................................        4,500

                                                            $125,231
                                                            ========

     The total purchase price will be allocated to assets acquired, including
tangible and intangible assets, and liabilities assumed based on the fair value
of such assets and liabilities on the date of acquisition. A valuation of the
intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred revenue is being conducted by an
independent third-party appraisal company and is expected to be completed prior
to closing. In addition, management is in the process of assessing and
formulating its integration plans, which are expected to include employee
separations and eliminations of duplicate facilities. The finalization of these
plans could result in a material

                NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED
                        FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

change to the estimated accrual for elimination of duplicate resources and
related costs. While the exact amount is not known management currently
estimates the amount to be approximately $2.4 million.

Allocation of Purchase Price

Net historical book value of assets acquired, net of
  liabilities assumed..................................     $ 40,514
Excess of fair value of property, plant and equipment
  over historical book value...........................        3,329
Adjust historical deferred revenue and related costs to
  fair value:
  Other current assets.................................       (1,620)
  Deferred revenue.....................................        5,413
  Other liabilities....................................       (1,970)
Accrual for elimination of duplicate resources and
  related costs........................................       (2,400)
Deferred costs relating to warrant agreements..........        1,723
Intangible assets:
  Workforce in place...................................        7,400
  Interland's tradename................................        4,800
  Reseller arrangements................................        1,000
  Technology in place..................................       12,000
  Goodwill.............................................       55,042
                                                            --------
Net assets acquired....................................     $125,231
                                                            ========

     The actual allocation of the purchase price will depend upon the
composition of Interland's net assets on the closing date and Micron
Electronics' evaluation of the fair value of the net assets as of that date.
Additionally, as discussed elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, the
exchange ratio of 0.861 shares of Micron Electronics common stock for each share
of Interland common stock could be adjusted as provided in the merger agreement
in the event that Micron Electronics' cash and cash equivalents, including any
amounts to be received by Micron Electronics for tax refunds, less the amount of
any liabilities and related reserves that do not relate to its HostPro business
are less than $200 million minus the amount of any bridge loan made by Micron
Electronics to Interland as of the closing of the merger. Consequently, the
purchase price and the actual allocation of the purchase price will differ from
that presented above.

NOTE 2. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations gives
effect to the merger as if it had occurred at the beginning of the periods
presented.

     The following adjustments have been reflected in the unaudited pro forma
combined condensed statement of operations:

          (b) Adjustment to record additional depreciation on revalued property,
     plant and equipment, deferred costs relating to warrant agreements and
     amortization of goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the
     allocation of the purchase price. The pro forma adjustment assumes
     goodwill, other

                NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED
                        FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

     intangible assets and deferred costs will be amortized on a straight-line
     basis over the following estimated lives:

Workforce in place..........................................          3.0 years
Technology in place.........................................          1.5 years
Interland trade name........................................          4.0 years
Reseller agreements.........................................  0.75 to 2.3 years
Goodwill....................................................          4.0 years
Deferred costs..............................................   2.3 to 4.4 years

     The ultimate lives assigned will be determined at the date of acquisition
based on the facts and circumstances existing at that date.

          (c) To reflect the estimated shares of Micron Electronics' common
     stock to be issued as consideration for the merger and to eliminate
     Interland weighted average shares.

          (d) To reclassify certain amounts to conform with Micron Electronics'
     presentation.

          (e) To eliminate Micron Electronics' income tax benefit. It is assumed
     that the combined entity will not meet the requirements to recognize the
     benefit of net operating losses as income from the discontinued operations
     will not be available to offset losses from continuing operations in future
     periods.

NOTE 3. NET ASSETS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

     The sale of the PC Systems and SpecTek businesses are described more fully
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

     Consistent with accounting for discontinued operations, Micron Electronics
recorded an estimate of future operating losses from the PC Systems business
between March 2, 2001 and May 31, 2001, the expected completion date of the
sale, and an estimate of the loss on disposal of the discontinued operation.
This estimated loss recorded in the second fiscal quarter ended March 1, 2001
was $147.5 million. Based on the final terms of the agreement to sell the PC
Systems business, the revised estimated loss is approximately $170.5 million.
Management believes that these estimates are reasonable; however, they are based
on preliminary data and are subject to revision.

     On March 22, 2001, Micron Electronics entered into a Purchase Agreement to
sell all assets primarily used by SpecTek and certain land, buildings and
intellectual property assets used primarily by the PC Systems business to MTI.
This disposal of this business will be recorded during Micron Electronics' third
fiscal quarter of 2001.

     The net assets of discontinued operations consists of the assets and
liabilities of the discontinued operations, including estimated future operating
losses and loss on disposal, as of March 1, 2001.

     Subsequent to March 1, 2001, based on the final terms of the agreement to
sell the PC Systems business, the estimated loss from discontinued operations
was increased approximately $23 million.

     The following table sets forth the closing prices per share of Micron
Electronics common stock and Interland common stock as reported on the Nasdaq
National Market on (1) March 22, 2001, the business day preceding public
announcement that Micron Electronics and Interland had entered into the merger
agreement and (2)             , 2001, the last full trading day for which
closing prices were available at the time of the printing of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

     This table also sets forth the equivalent price per share of Interland
common stock on those dates. The equivalent price per share is equal to the
closing price of a share of Micron Electronics common stock on that date
multiplied by 0.8610, the number of shares of Micron Electronics common stock to
be issued in exchange for each share of Interland common stock.

                                                                                     EQUIVALENT

     Micron Electronics and Interland believe that Interland common stock
presently trades on the basis of the value of the Micron Electronics common
stock expected to be issued in exchange for the Interland common stock in the
merger, discounted primarily for the uncertainties associated with the merger.

     Apart from the factors described in publicly disclosed information
concerning Micron Electronics that is included or incorporated by reference in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Micron Electronics cannot state with
certainty what factors account for changes in the market price of the Micron
Electronics common stock.

     Interland shareholders are advised to obtain current market quotations for
Micron Electronics common stock and Interland common stock. No assurance can be
given as to the market prices of Micron Electronics common stock or Interland
common stock at any time before the consummation of the merger or as to the
market price of Micron Electronics common stock at any time after the merger.
The exchange ratio will not be adjusted to compensate Interland shareholders for
decreases in the market price of Micron Electronics common stock that could
occur before the merger becomes effective. In the event the market price of
Micron Electronics common stock decreases or increases prior to the consummation
of the merger, the value of the Micron Electronics common stock to be received
in the merger in exchange for Interland common stock would correspondingly
decrease or increase.

     Micron Electronics and Interland have never paid cash dividends on their
shares of capital stock. Under the merger agreement, each of Micron Electronics
and Interland has agreed not to pay cash dividends pending the consummation of
the merger, without written consent of the other. If the merger is not
consummated, the Interland board of directors presently intends that it would
continue its policy of retaining all earnings to finance the expansion of its
business. The Micron Electronics board of directors presently intends to retain
all earnings for use in its business and has no present intention to pay cash
dividends before or after the merger.

                       COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF
                      MICRON ELECTRONICS COMMON STOCK AND
                             INTERLAND COMMON STOCK

     This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes differences
between Micron Electronics common stock and Interland common stock. While we
believe that the description covers the material differences between the two,
this summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you,
including the articles of incorporation and bylaws of each company. You should
read this entire document and the other documents we refer to carefully for a
more complete understanding of the differences between Micron Electronics common
stock and Interland common stock. You may obtain the information incorporated by
reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus without charge by following
the instructions in the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information"
on page 1.

     Micron Electronics is incorporated in the State of Minnesota and Interland
is incorporated in the State of Georgia. Shareholders of Interland will hold
Micron Electronics common stock rather than Interland common stock. Therefore,
the rights of these shareholders will be governed by Minnesota law, and the
provisions of the Micron Electronics articles of incorporation and bylaws,
rather than the Interland articles of incorporation and the Interland bylaws.

POWER TO CALL SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS

     Georgia law permits a special meeting of shareholders to be called by:

     - the board of directors or the persons authorized to do so by the articles
       or bylaws; or

     - the written demand or demands delivered to the corporation of holders of
       at least 25%, or such other percentage as may be provided in the articles
       or bylaws, of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to
       be considered at the proposed special meeting.

     The Interland bylaws provide that the chairman of the board of directors or
the president may call a special meeting at any time. However, the president or
the secretary must call a special meeting either when directed by the board of
directors or at the written request of shareholders owning at least 25% of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote at the meeting.

     Minnesota law permits special meetings to be called by the chief executive
officer, chief financial officer, two or more directors, a person authorized in
the articles or bylaws to call special meetings, or a shareholder or
shareholders holding 10% or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to
vote. A special meeting for the purpose of considering any action to facilitate
or effect a business combination, however, including any action to change or
otherwise affect the composition of the board of directors for that purpose,
must be called by 25% or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to
vote. The Micron Electronics bylaws do not differ from the Minnesota statute.

ACTIONS BY WRITTEN CONSENT OF SHAREHOLDERS

     Under Georgia law, action required or permitted to be taken at a
shareholders' meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by
all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action or, if so provided in the
articles, by persons who would be entitled to vote at a meeting shares having
voting power to cast not less than the minimum number (or numbers, in the case
of voting groups) of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take the
action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote were present and
voted. The action must be evidenced by one or more written consents bearing the
date of signature and describing the action taken, signed by shareholders
entitled to take action without a meeting and delivered to the corporation for
inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records.

     Under Minnesota law, any action which may be taken at a meeting may be
taken without a meeting by written consent signed by all of the shareholders
entitled to vote on that action. Unless the written action provides otherwise,
it becomes effective when signed by all those shareholders.

INSPECTION OF SHAREHOLDER LIST

     Georgia law provides that a shareholders' list must be available for
inspection by any shareholder, or such person's agent or attorney at the time
and place of the meeting.

     Minnesota law provides that a shareholder, beneficial owner or a holder of
a voting trust certificate of a publicly held corporation has, upon written
demand stating the purpose, a right at any reasonable time to examine and copy
the corporation's share register and other corporate records reasonably related
to the stated purpose and described with reasonable particularity in the written
demand upon demonstrating the stated purpose to be proper.

SHAREHOLDER VOTING ON BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

Statutory mergers

     Under Georgia law, unless the articles of incorporation, the bylaws, or the
board of directors requires a greater vote or a vote by voting groups, the plan
of merger or share exchange to be authorized must be approved by (1) a majority
of all the votes entitled to be cast on the plan by all shares entitled to vote
on the plan, voting as a single voting group; and (2) a majority of all the
votes entitled to be cast by holders of the shares of each voting group entitled
to vote separately on the plan as a voting group by the articles of
incorporation.

     Action by the shareholders of the surviving corporation on a plan of merger
or by the shareholders of the acquiring corporation in a share exchange, is not
required if:

     - the articles of incorporation of the surviving or acquiring corporation
       will not differ from its articles before the merger or share exchange;

     - each share of stock of the surviving or acquiring corporation outstanding
       immediately before the effective date of the merger or share exchange is
       to be an identical outstanding or reacquired share immediately after the
       merger or share exchange; and

     - the number and kind of shares outstanding immediately after the merger or
       share exchange, plus the number and kind of shares issuable as a result
       of the merger or share exchange and by the conversion of securities
       issued pursuant to the merger or share exchange, or the exercise of
       rights and warrants issued pursuant to the merger or share exchange, will
       not exceed the total number and kind of shares of the surviving or
       acquiring corporation authorized by its articles of incorporation
       immediately before the merger or share exchange.

     Under Minnesota law the plan of merger shall be submitted at a meeting to
the shareholders of each constituent corporation. At the meeting, a vote of the
owners must be taken on the proposed plan. The plan of merger is adopted when
approved by the holders of a majority of all shares entitled to vote.

     Submission of a plan of merger to a vote at a meeting of shareholders of a
surviving corporation is not required if:

     - the articles of the corporation will not be amended in the transaction;

     - each holder of shares of the corporation that were outstanding
       immediately before the effective time of the transaction will hold the
       same number of shares with identical rights immediately thereafter;

     - the voting power of the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to
       vote immediately after the merger, plus the voting power of the shares of
       the corporation entitled to vote issuable on conversion of or on the
       exercise of rights to purchase, securities issued in the transaction,
       will not exceed by more than 20%, the voting power of the outstanding
       shares of the corporation entitled to vote immediately before the
       transaction; and

     - the number of participating shares of the corporation immediately after
       the merger, plus the number of participating shares of the corporation
       issuable on conversion of, or on the exercise of

       rights to purchase, securities issued in the transaction, will not exceed
       by more than 20% the number of participating shares of the corporation
       immediately before the transaction.

Sale of assets

     Both Georgia and Minnesota law require that a sale of all or substantially
all of the assets of a corporation be approved by a majority of the outstanding
voting shares of the corporation transferring such assets.

CLASS VOTING

     Georgia law requires that mergers be approved by a majority of all the
votes entitled to be cast by holders of the shares of each voting group entitled
to vote separately on the plan as a voting group by the articles of
incorporation.

     In addition, Georgia law as well as Minnesota law provides that shares of a
class or series not otherwise entitled to vote on the merger are entitled to
vote on a plan of merger if the plan contains a provision that, if contained in
a proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation, would require action by
that class or series of shares voting as a separate group on the proposed
amendment.

SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

     Georgia regulates business combinations with interested shareholders. The
restrictive period for these transactions is five years, with limited
exceptions. The requirements of this part of the Georgia Business Corporation
Code do not apply to business combinations of a corporation unless the bylaws of
the corporation specifically provide that all of such requirements are
applicable to the corporation. The bylaws of Interland are silent regarding
these requirements.

     Minnesota law provides that an issuing public corporation may not engage in
any business combination or aid a subsidiary in doing so for a four-year period
following the interested shareholder's share acquisition date unless the
combination is approved prior to that date by a board committee of the issuing
public corporation.

CUMULATIVE VOTING

     In an election of directors under cumulative voting, each share of stock
normally having one vote is entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of
directors to be elected. A shareholder may then cast all such votes for a single
candidate or may allocate them among as many candidates as the shareholder may
choose. Without cumulative voting, the holders of a majority of the shares
present at an annual meeting or any special meeting held to elect directors
would have the power to elect all the directors to be elected at that meeting,
and no person could be elected without the support of holders of a majority of
the shares voting at such meeting.

     Georgia law provides that shareholders do not have a right to cumulate
their votes for directors unless the articles so provide. If the articles so
provide a shareholder may cumulate votes in the election of directors if the
meeting notice or Proxy Statement accompanying the notice states that cumulative
voting will be in effect or upon proper notice of his or her intention to do so.
The Interland bylaws state that shareholders do not have a right to cumulate
their votes for directors.

     Minnesota law provides that unless the articles do not permit cumulative
voting, shareholders may cumulate their votes in the election of directors by
giving written notice of intent to do so to any officer before the meeting, or
to the presiding officer at the meeting at which the election is to occur. The
Micron Electronics articles provide that there shall be no cumulative voting by
the shareholders of the corporation.

SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUITS

     Under Georgia law, a shareholder may not commence or maintain a derivative
proceeding unless the shareholder:

     - was a shareholder of the corporation at the time of the act or omission
       complained of or became a shareholder through transfer by operation of
       law from one who was a shareholder at that time; and

     - fairly and adequately represents the interests of the corporation in
       enforcing the right of the corporation.

     In order to commence a derivative proceeding the shareholder must first
make a written demand on the corporation to take suitable action and wait 90
days from the date the demand was made or until the demand is rejected by the
corporation or unless irreparable injury would result to the corporation by
waiting for the expiration of the 90 day period.

     Minnesota law provides no specific statutory provisions dealing with
shareholder derivative suits.

DISSENTERS' RIGHT OF APPRAISAL

     Under Georgia law and Minnesota law, a shareholder of a corporation
participating in some major corporate transactions may, under varying
circumstances, be entitled to dissenters' right of appraisal under which such
shareholder may receive cash in the amount of the fair market value of the
shares held by such shareholder in lieu of the consideration such shareholder
would otherwise receive in the transaction. The fair market value of the shares
is determined by either a court or an agreement between the corporation and the
shareholder. The limitations on the availability of dissenters' rights under
Georgia law are different from those under Minnesota law.

     There is no right of dissent in Georgia in favor of the holder of shares of
any class or series that, at the record date fixed to determine the shareholders
entitled to receive notice of and to vote at a meeting at which a plan of merger
is to be acted on, were either listed on a national securities exchange or held
of record by more than 2,000 shareholders, unless specified requirements are
met.

     Under Minnesota law, unless the articles, the bylaws, or a resolution
approved by the board of directors otherwise provide, if the shareholder's
shares are not entitled to be voted on the merger, the right to obtain payment
does not apply to a shareholder of the surviving corporation in a merger, with
respect to shares of the shareholder that are not entitled to be voted on the
merger and are not canceled or exchanged in the merger.

DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASES OF SHARES

     Under Georgia law there are no specific statutory provisions dealing with
dividend sources. Georgia law provides that no distribution may be made if,
after giving it effect either:

     - the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in
       the usual course of business; or

     - the corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its total
       liabilities plus (unless the articles permit otherwise) the amount that
       would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of
       the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of
       shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving
       the distribution.

     In addition, Georgia law generally provides that a corporation may acquire
its own shares.

     The Interland bylaws provide that distributions upon the shares of the
corporation may by declared by the board of directors at any regular or special
meeting, pursuant to law. Before payment of any distribution, there may be set
aside out of any funds of the corporation available for dividends such sum as
the directors, in their absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve.

     Under Minnesota law, permissible sources for the payment of dividends are
not specified in the statute. Minnesota law provides that distributions may be
made only if the corporation will be able to pay its debts in the ordinary
course of business after doing so. A determination that the corporation will be
able to pay such debts is presumed to be proper if such determination is made on
the basis of financial information prepared in accordance with accounting or
other methods reasonable under the circumstances.

     A corporation may also acquire its own shares, subject to the statutory
restrictions on corporate distributions and share purchases from five-percent
beneficial owners.

     The Micron Electronics bylaws state that the board may declare dividends
whenever and in such amounts as it deems advisable.

SIZE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Under Georgia law a board of directors must consist of one or more
individuals, with the number specified or fixed in accordance with the articles
or bylaws. The articles or bylaws may authorize the shareholders or the board of
directors to fix or change the number or may establish a variable range for the
size of the board of directors by fixing a minimum and maximum number of
directors. If a variable range is established, the number of directors may be
fixed or changed from time to time, within the minimum and maximum, by the
shareholders or, if the articles or bylaws so provide, the board of directors.
The Interland bylaws set the number of directors at not less than five nor more
than fifteen, the number to be determined from time to time by resolution of
Interland's board of directors or shareholders.

     Under Minnesota law a corporation must have one or more directors. The
number is set in the manner provided in the bylaws or articles of incorporation
and may be changed by amendment to or in the manner provided in the articles or
bylaws. The Micron Electronics bylaws provide that the number of directors will
be established by resolution of the shareholders subject to the authority of the
board of directors to increase or decrease the number of directors as permitted
by law. If the proposed amendment to the Micron Electronics' bylaws is approved,
the Micron Electronics board will be authorized to reduce its size.

CLASSIFIED BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     A classified board of directors is one in which a particular number of
directors, but not necessarily all, are elected on a rotating basis each year.

     Georgia law permits the articles or bylaws of a corporation to provide for
a classified board of directors, under which the directors can be divided into
as many as three classes with staggered terms of office, with only one class of
directors standing for election each year. The Interland articles and bylaws
provide for a classified board of directors.

     Minnesota law provides that directors may be divided into classes as
provided in the articles or bylaws. A fixed term of a director must not be
longer than five years. If the proposed amendment to the Micron Electronics'
bylaws is approved, the Micron Electronics board members will have terms of at
least two years from one closing date of the merger, with an indefinite term
after that time. Neither the Micron Electronics articles nor the Micron
Electronics bylaws provide for a classified board of directors.

REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

     Under Georgia law, the shareholders may remove directors with or without
cause unless the articles or a bylaw adopted by the shareholders provides that
directors may be removed only for cause. If a director is elected by a voting
group of shareholders, only the shareholders of that voting group may
participate in the vote to remove that director. If cumulative voting is
authorized, a director may not be removed if the number of votes sufficient to
elect the director under cumulative voting is voted against the director's
removal. If cumulative voting is not authorized, a director may be removed only
by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast. If the directors have staggered
terms, they may be removed only for cause, unless the articles or a bylaw
adopted by the shareholders provides otherwise.

     The Interland bylaws state that the shareholders may remove any director
only for cause by the vote of shareholders representing a majority of the issued
and outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors.

     Under Minnesota law, unless the articles, bylaws or a shareholder control
agreement provide otherwise, a director may be removed at any time, with or
without cause, if (1) the director was named by the board of directors to fill a
vacancy, (2) the shareholders have not elected directors in the interval between
the time of the appointment to fill a vacancy and the time of the removal, and
(3) a majority of the remaining directors present affirmatively vote to remove
the director. Directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all shares
entitled to vote at an election of directors. A director who was elected solely
by the holders of a class or series of shares, as stated in the articles or
bylaws, may be removed only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the voting power of all shares of that class or series entitled to vote at an
election of that director. However, in the case of a corporation having
cumulative voting, unless the entire board of directors is removed
simultaneously, no directors may be removed if the votes cast against their
removal would be sufficient if cumulatively voted to elect them.

     Micron Electronics current bylaws mirror the Minnesota statute. If the
proposed amendment to Micron Electronics' bylaws is approved, directors may not
be removed except for cause, for a period of two years following the closing of
the merger.

DIRECTORS' COMMITTEES

     Under Georgia law, unless the articles or bylaws provide otherwise, a board
of directors may create committees and appoint board members to serve on them.
To the extent specified by the board of directors or in the articles or bylaws,
each committee may exercise the authority of the board of directors. A committee
may not, however:

     - approve or propose to shareholders action that is required to be approved
       by shareholders;

     - fill vacancies on the board of directors or on any of its committees;

     - amend the articles, except that, as authorized by a resolution adopted by
       the board of directors, a committee may amend the articles of
       incorporation to fix the designations, preferences, limitations and
       relative rights of shares or to change the number of shares in a series,
       but not below the number of such shares then issued;

     - adopt, amend or repeal bylaws; or

     - approve a plan of merger not requiring shareholder approval.

     The Interland bylaws specifically give the board of directors authority to
create committees and appoint directors to serve on them.

     Under Minnesota law, the board of directors by resolution approved by a
majority of the board of directors, may establish committees having the
authority of the board of directors in the management of the business of the
corporation. Committees are subject at all times to the direction and control of
the board of directors. Committee members must be natural persons and need not
be directors. The Micron Electronics bylaws allow the establishment of
committees on the vote of a majority of the board of directors.

TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS

     Under Georgia law a director's conflicting interest transaction with
respect to a corporation means a transaction effected or proposed to be effected
by the corporation (or a subsidiary of the corporation or any other entity in
which the corporation has a controlling interest) respecting which a director of
the corporation has a conflicting interest. A director's conflicting interest
transaction may not be enjoined, set aside, or give rise to an award of damages
or other sanctions, on the ground of an interest in the

transaction of the director or any person with whom or which he has a personal,
economic, or other association if:

     - The transaction received the affirmative vote of a majority (but not less
       than two) of those qualified directors on the board of directors or on a
       duly empowered committee thereof who voted on the transaction with either
       required disclosure to them; or

     - If a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all
       qualified shares were cast in favor of the transaction after notice to
       the shareholders describing the director's conflicting interest
       transaction, the director who has the conflicting interest informs the
       secretary of the number, and the identity of persons holding or
       controlling the vote, of all shares that to the knowledge of the director
       are beneficially owned (or the voting of which is controlled) by the
       director or by a related person of the director, or both, and the
       required disclosure is made to the shareholders who voted on the
       transaction (to the extent the information was known to them).

     An officer's conflicting interest transaction under Georgia law is defined
as any transaction, other than a director's conflicting interest transaction,
between a corporation (or a subsidiary of the corporation or any other entity in
which the corporation has a controlling interest) and one or more of its
officers or between a corporation and a related person of an officer. An
officer's conflicting interest transaction may not be enjoined, set aside, or
give rise to an award of damages or other sanctions, in an action by a
shareholder or by or in the right of the corporation, on the ground of an
interest in the transaction of the officer or any person with whom or which he
has a personal, economic, or other association, if:

     - The transaction was approved by the board of directors after required
       disclosure;

     - The transaction was approved by the shareholders after required
       disclosure; or

     - The transaction, judged in the circumstances at the time of commitment,
       is established to have been fair to the corporation.

     Minnesota law provides that a corporation may, with the affirmative vote of
a majority of directors present, lend money to, guarantee an obligation of,
become a surety for, or otherwise financially assist a person if:

     - the transaction is in the usual course of business;

     - is with or for the benefit of a related organization, an organization in
       which the corporation has a financial interest, an organization with
       which the corporation has a business relationship, or an organization to
       which the corporation has the power to make donations, any of which
       relationships constitute consideration sufficient to make the financial
       assistance so approved enforceable against the corporation;

     - is with, or for the benefit of, an officer or other employee of the
       corporation or a subsidiary, and may reasonably be expected, in the
       board's judgment, to benefit the corporation; or

     - whether or not any separate consideration has been paid or promised to
       the corporation, has been approved

        - by the holders of two-thirds of the voting power of the shares
          entitled to vote that are owned by persons other than the interested
          person(s), or

        - by the unanimous affirmative vote of the holders of all outstanding
          shares whether or not entitled to vote.

     The Micron Electronics bylaws mirror the Minnesota statute and provide that
the loan, guarantee, surety contract or other financial assistance may be with
or without interest, and may be unsecured, or may be secured in the manner as a
majority of the directors approve, including, without limitation, a pledge of or
other security interest in the shares of the corporation.

INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

     Under Georgia law a corporation may indemnify an individual made a party to
a proceeding conducted himself in good faith and because such person is or was a
director. The corporation may indemnify against liability incurred in the
proceeding if the director conducted himself in good faith and reasonably
believed that his conduct was in the corporation's best interests, and that in
the case of any criminal proceeding, the director had no reasonable cause to
believe the conduct was unlawful. The termination of a proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement or conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent is not, of itself, determinative that the director did not meet the
necessary standard of conduct. A corporation can indemnify a director against
reasonable expenses incurred by such person in connection with the proceeding. A
corporation may not indemnify a director in connection with:

     - a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation, except for reasonable
       expenses required in connection with the proceeding if it is determined
       that the director has met the relevant standard of conduct; or

     - any other proceeding with respect to conduct for which he or she was
       adjudged liable on the basis that personal benefit was improperly
       received by him or her, whether or not involving action in his or her
       official capacity.

     A corporation must indemnify a director who was wholly successful, on the
merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he was a party
because he was a director of the corporation against reasonable expenses
incurred by the director in connection with the proceeding.

     A corporation may, before final disposition of a proceeding, advance funds
to pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by a director who is a
party to a proceeding because he or she is a director if the director delivers
to the corporation a written affirmation of the director's good faith belief
that he or she has met the relevant standard of conduct or that the proceeding
involves conduct for which liability has been eliminated under the articles and
the director undertakes to repay any funds if it is determined that the director
is not entitled to indemnification.

     As well, a corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of an
individual who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
corporation of who, while a director, officer, employee or agent of the
corporation serves at the corporation's request as a director, officer, partner,
trustee, employee or agent of another domestic or foreign corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other entity against
liability asserted against or incurred by such individual in that capacity or
arising from the person's status, regardless of whether the corporation
otherwise would have power to indemnify the individual against the same
liability.

     Georgia law also provides that a corporation may, by a provision in its
articles or bylaws or in a resolution adopted or a contract approved by its
board of directors or shareholders, obligate itself in advance of the act or
omission giving rise to a proceeding to provide indemnification or pay for or
reimburse expenses consistent with Georgia law. Any provision that obligates the
corporation to provide indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by law
shall be deemed to obligate the corporation to advance funds to pay for or
reimburse expenses in accordance with Georgia law to the fullest extent
permitted by law, unless the provision specifically provides otherwise. Such a
provision shall not obligate the corporation to indemnify or advance expenses to
a director or a predecessor of the corporation, pertaining to conduct with
respect to the predecessor, unless otherwise specifically provided. A
corporation may, by a provision in its articles, limit any of the rights to
indemnification or advance for expenses.

     The Interland bylaws mirror the Georgia statute. The bylaws provide that
every officer or director, to the extent that he has been successful in defense
of any proceeding to which he was a party because he is or was an officer or
director of the corporation, shall be indemnified by the corporation against
reasonable expenses.

     Minnesota law provides that unless the articles or bylaws provide
otherwise, a corporation must indemnify a person made or threatened to be made a
party to a proceeding by reason of the former or present official capacity of
the person. A director may be indemnified in connection with a proceeding so
long as the director:

     - has not been indemnified by another organization for the same judgments,
       penalties, fines, settlements or expenses;

     - acted in good faith;

     - received no improper personal benefit;

     - with respect to criminal proceedings, had no reasonable cause to believe
       the conduct was unlawful; and

     - reasonably believed the conduct to be in or not opposed to the best
       interests of the corporation.

     A director made or threatened to be made a party to a proceeding is
entitled, upon written request to the corporation, to payment or reimbursement
by the corporation of reasonable expenses incurred by the person in advance of
the final disposition of the proceeding.

     As well, under Minnesota law indemnification insurance may be purchased and
maintained whether or not the corporation would have been required to indemnify
the person under the statute.

     The Micron Electronics articles provide that a director of the corporation
shall not be personally liable to the corporation or its shareholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for
liability for:

     - any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its
       shareholders;

     - acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
       misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

     - under sections 302A.559 or 80A.23 of the Minnesota Statutes;

     - any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
       benefit; or

     - any act or omission occurring prior to the date when this Article became
       effective.

DISSOLUTION

     Under Georgia law and Minnesota law a corporation may be dissolved upon
adoption of a resolution by the board and a vote by the holders of a majority of
all shares entitled to vote at a meeting called for such purpose.

                    ADDITIONAL MATTERS BEING SUBMITTED TO A
                  VOTE OF ONLY MICRON ELECTRONICS SHAREHOLDERS

                                 PROPOSAL NO. 2

               APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

     Micron Electronics' articles of incorporation currently authorize Micron
Electronics to issue up to 150,000,000 shares of common stock. This proposal
would amend the articles of incorporation to authorize Micron Electronics to
issue up to 200,000,000 shares of capital stock and change the name Micron
Electronics, Inc. to "Interland, Inc." upon the closing of the merger. The
larger number of authorized shares of common stock provided for in this proposal
will provide Micron Electronics the certainty and flexibility necessary to
undertake various types of transactions, including financings, increases in the
shares reserved for issuance pursuant to stock incentive plans, or other
corporate transactions not yet determined.

     In order for the board of directors to be able to respond to future
circumstances with a reasonable degree of flexibility, Micron Electronics must
have a sufficient number of authorized shares to cover any stock dividends or
other transactions. There are currently 150 million shares authorized and
approximately 97 million issued and outstanding shares of Micron Electronics'
common stock and approximately 22 million shares reserved for issuance under
Micron Electronics' stock plans. In addition, based on an assumed exchange ratio
of 0.861 and 47,348,585 shares of Interland common stock outstanding as of March
15, 2001, Micron Electronics will issue approximately 40,767,132 shares in the
merger, excluding options and warrants to purchase Interland common stock to be
assumed in the merger. Under the proposed amendment to the articles of
incorporation, the additional shares of common stock would be available for
issuance without further shareholder action, unless shareholder action is
otherwise required by Minnesota law or the rules of any stock exchange or
automated quotation system on which the common stock may then be listed or
quoted. Micron Electronics has no current plans to issue the remainder of the
additional authorized shares, other than shares that could be issued in
connection with any additional stock options granted under its 2001 Equity
Incentive Plan, 1995 Stock Option Plan or its Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

     Based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding and reserved as
of March 31, 2001, the proposed increase in the number of authorized shares of
capital stock from 150,000,000 to 200,000,000 would result in approximately
159,623,297 shares of common stock being issued, outstanding and reserved, which
includes approximately 22,000,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance
upon exercise of options outstanding and equity awards to be granted under
Micron Electronics' equity compensation plans, and 40,767,132 shares of common
stock reserved for issuance in the merger, excluding options and warrants to
purchase Interland common stock to be assumed in the merger. Although Micron
Electronics currently has no agreements or understandings with respect to any
other material acquisitions, the increase in the authorized number of shares of
common stock will provide Micron Electronics with additional flexibility with
regard to any future acquisitions.

     The additional shares of common stock that would become available for
issuance if the proposed amendment were adopted could also be used by Micron
Electronics to oppose a hostile takeover attempt or delay or prevent changes of
control of Micron Electronics or changes in or removal of management of Micron
Electronics. For example, without further shareholder approval, the board of
directors could strategically sell shares of common stock in a private
transaction to purchasers who would oppose a takeover or favor the current board
of directors. Although the current proposal to increase the number of authorized
shares of common stock has been prompted by business and financial
considerations, not by the threat of any attempt to accumulate shares or
otherwise gain control of Micron Electronics, shareholders nevertheless should
be aware that approval of the proposal could facilitate future efforts by Micron
Electronics to deter or prevent changes of control of Micron Electronics,
including transactions that are favored by a majority of the independent
shareholders or in which the shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for
their shares over then-current market prices or benefit in some other manner.

     Micron Electronics' articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions
that could have an anti-takeover effect, including the following:

     - Micron Electronics' shareholders may only take action at a meeting or by
       written consent;

     - Micron Electronics' board of directors must be given advance notice
       regarding shareholder-sponsored proposals for consideration at annual
       meetings and for shareholder nominations for the election of directors;

     - vacancies on the board of directors may be filled until the next annual
       meeting of shareholders only by majority vote of the directors then in
       office; and

     - special meetings of shareholders may only be called by the Chairman of
       the Board, the President or by the board of directors, or a shareholder
       holding 10% of the outstanding stock, except that a shareholder must hold
       25% of the outstanding stock to call a special meeting that relates to a
       business combination.

     In addition, the authority granted by Micron Electronics' articles of
incorporation to the board of directors to fix the designations, powers,
preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions of any class
or series of Micron Electronics' preferred stock could be used for anti-takeover
purposes. The proposal to increase the number of authorized shares of common
stock, however, is not part of any plan to adopt a series of amendments having
an anti-takeover effect, and Micron Electronics' management presently does not
intend to propose anti-takeover measures in future proxy solicitations.

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, Micron Electronics agreed to
change its name to "Interland, Inc." upon closing of the merger in order to
capitalize on the brand equity Interland has built in the Web hosting market.

                THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE AMENDMENT
               TO MICRON ELECTRONICS' ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION.

                                 PROPOSAL NO. 3

                    AMENDMENT TO MICRON ELECTRONICS' BYLAWS

     Micron Electronics' bylaws currently set the number of directors on the
Micron Electronics board at five. In addition, Micron Electronics board members
currently serve for terms of one year and generally may be removed with or
without cause by the shareholders of Micron Electronics, or in some instances,
by the Micron Electronics board.

     This proposal would amend the bylaws as follows:

     - Provide that all directors shall hold office for a period of at least two
       years after the closing of the merger;

     - Permit the removal of directors only for "cause" during the two-year
       period following the closing of the merger;

     - Effective after the expiration of the two-year period after the merger,
       change the term of all directors to an indefinite term, and permit their
       removal with or without cause; and

     - Authorize the board of directors to decrease the size of the board in the
       future.

     If this proposal is approved, the term of all current directors of Micron
Electronics will be extended for an additional year.

     These amendments are being proposed to comply with the provisions of the
merger agreement that require that these changes to the bylaws be approved by
Micron Electronics' shareholders as a condition to closing the merger.

     THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" AMENDING MICRON ELECTRONICS' BYLAWS.

                                 PROPOSAL NO. 4

         INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF MICRON ELECTRONICS' BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Micron Electronics' bylaws currently permit the number of directors
comprising the board to be established by resolution of the shareholders of
Micron Electronics. Micron Electronics' board of directors is currently fixed at
five directors.

     This proposal would increase the size of the Micron Electronics' board of
directors to eight members.

     This increase is being proposed to comply with the provisions of the merger
agreement that require that the Micron Electronics board be increased to eight
directors as a condition to closing the merger.

            THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" INCREASING THE SIZE OF
                MICRON ELECTRONICS' BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO EIGHT.

                                 PROPOSAL NO. 5

                             ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

     It is also a condition to closing the merger that three new directors are
added to the Micron Electronics' board of directors. Two of these nominees were
selected by Interland and one was selected jointly by Micron Electronics and
Interland.

     The nominees and some information about them are set forth below:

     This section contains forward-looking statements within the safe harbor
provisions of th
