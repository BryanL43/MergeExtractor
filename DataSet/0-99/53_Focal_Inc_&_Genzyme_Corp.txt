                         LEXINGTON, MASSACHUSETTS 02421

                 A MERGER PROPOSAL--YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Stockholders:

    The board of directors of Focal, Inc. has approved a merger transaction with
Genzyme Corporation in which Focal will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Genzyme Corporation and Focal's business will become part of Genzyme's
Biosurgery division. After consideration of possible alternatives and in light
of Focal's financial condition, your board believes that the proposed merger is
in the best interests of Focal and its stockholders. The proposed merger
provides Focal stockholders with the opportunity to participate in the growth of
the combined businesses and offers Focal the resources required to develop its
proprietary biomaterial platform technology.

    We have scheduled a special stockholders' meeting on Thursday, June 28,
2001, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State
Street, Boston, Massachusetts, to vote upon adoption of the merger agreement. To
complete the merger, we must obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Focal common stock. Genzyme and a group of
institutional stockholders of Focal, which together hold approximately 35% of
the outstanding shares of Focal common stock, have agreed to vote in favor of
the merger agreement. If the merger agreement is adopted you will receive 0.1545
of a share of Genzyme Biosurgery Division common stock, which is referred to as
"Biosurgery Stock," for each share of Focal common stock that you own and cash
for any fractional share of Biosurgery Stock that you would otherwise be
entitled to receive.

    Biosurgery Stock is one of Genzyme Corporation's three tracking stocks. It
is designed to reflect the value and track the performance of Genzyme's
Biosurgery division, which develops, manufactures and sells instruments,
devices, biomaterials and biotherapeutic products to improve or replace surgery.
Biosurgery Stock is quoted on The Nasdaq National Market under the trading
symbol "GZBX." We anticipate that Genzyme will issue an aggregate of
approximately 2.1 million shares of Biosurgery Stock in the merger, based upon
0.1545 multiplied by       shares of Focal common stock outstanding as of
May 25, 2001, the record date for the special stockholders' meeting, excluding
shares of Focal common stock owned by Genzyme and shares that may be issued
prior to the closing of the merger upon exercise of outstanding options or
warrants. After completion of the merger, we anticipate that the former
stockholders of Focal will own approximately 5.7% of the total outstanding
shares of Biosurgery Stock.

    PLEASE CAREFULLY CONSIDER ALL OF THE INFORMATION IN THIS DOCUMENT REGARDING
FOCAL, GENZYME CORPORATION, GENZYME BIOSURGERY AND THE MERGER, INCLUDING IN
PARTICULAR, THE DISCUSSION IN THE SECTION ENTITLED "RISK FACTORS" BEGINNING ON
PAGE     .

    Included with this proxy statement/prospectus is a copy of Focal's annual
report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000, as amended, and its
quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2001.

    Your board of directors has determined that the merger and merger agreement
are advisable and in the best interests of Focal and its stockholders and
unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" adoption of the merger agreement.
Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please complete, sign,
date and return your proxy in the enclosed envelope. Your vote is very
important.

                                          Sincerely,

    A special meeting of the stockholders of Focal, Inc. will be held on
Thursday, June 28, 2001, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of Hale and
Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, to:

    Only stockholders of record at the close of business on May 25, 2001 are

or postponements of the meeting. On that date, there were       shares of Focal
common stock issued and outstanding and held by approximately       holders of
record.

    We cannot complete the merger unless the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Focal common stock on the record date affirmatively vote
to adopt the merger agreement.

    For more information about the merger, please review carefully this
document, including the merger agreement attached as Annex A.

                                          By Order of the Board of Directors,

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:  WHY ARE THE COMPANIES PROPOSING THE MERGER?

A:  Genzyme and Focal have had a business relationship for several years.
    Focal's business cannot be sustained without substantial new capital. Its
    extensive efforts to find alternative strategic investors or acquirors have
    not been successful. Focal and Genzyme believe that that the proposed merger
    will provide the opportunity for the combined businesses to employ Genzyme's
    financial and technical resources and commitment to commercializing Focal's
    biomaterial products and expanding the range of applications for Focal's
    proprietary biomaterial platform.

Q:  WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A:  Mail your signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as
    possible, so your shares will be represented at your meeting after you
    carefully read and consider the information contained in this proxy
    statement/prospectus. In order to be sure that your vote is counted, please
    submit your proxy as instructed on your proxy card even if you plan to
    attend a meeting in person.

Q:  WHAT IF I DON'T VOTE?

A:  If you abstain from voting, do not vote or do not give voting instructions
    to your broker, you will, in effect, be voting against adoption of the
    merger agreement. If you sign and send in your proxy but do not indicate how
    you want to vote, we will count your proxy as a vote FOR adoption of the
    merger agreement.

Q:  IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
    SHARES FOR ME?

A:  In most cases, your broker will vote your shares only if you provide
    instructions on how to vote. Follow the instructions provided to you by your
    broker.

Q:  SHOULD I SEND IN MY FOCAL STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A:  No. After the merger is completed, you will receive written instructions for
    exchanging your stock certificates. Please do not send in your stock
    certificates with your proxy.

Q:  WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A:  Genzyme and Focal are working toward completing the merger as quickly as
    possible. If we obtain the necessary stockholder approval, we expect to
    complete the merger by the end of the second or beginning of the third
    quarter of 2001.

Q:  WHO SHOULD I CALL WITH QUESTIONS?

A:  You should call Harry R. Trout III, Focal's chief financial officer, at
    (781) 280-7800 with any questions about the merger.

    You can also obtain additional information about Genzyme and Focal from
    documents each of us files with the SEC by following the instructions in the
    section entitled "WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION" on page       of this
    proxy statement/ prospectus.

                                 THE COMPANIES

GENZYME (SEE PAGE   )

    Genzyme is a biotechnology and human healthcare company that develops
innovative products and provides services for significant unmet medical needs.
Genzyme has three operating divisions and three series of common stock designed
to reflect the value and track the performance of these operating divisions:

    - Genzyme General, which develops and markets therapeutic products, with an
      expanding focus on products to treat patients suffering from lysosomal
      storage disorders and other specialty therapeutics; diagnostic products
      with a focus on IN VITRO diagnostics; and other products and services,
      such as genetic testing services and lipid and peptide products for drug
      delivery.

    - Genzyme Biosurgery, which develops, manufactures and sells instruments,
      devices, biomaterials and biotherapeutic products to improve or replace
      surgery, with an emphasis on the orthopaedic and cardiothoracic markets;
      and

    - Genzyme Molecular Oncology, which utilizes its functional genomics and
      antigen discovery technology platforms to develop novel cancer products
      focused on cancer vaccines and angiogenesis inhibitors and to generate
      partnering revenue by developing cancer products, with a focus on
      therapeutic vaccines and angiogenesis inhibitors.

    Genzyme created Genzyme Biosurgery in December 2000 by combining two of its
former divisions, Genzyme Surgical Products and Genzyme Tissue Repair, and
simultaneously acquiring Biomatrix, Inc., a public company engaged in the
development and commercialization of viscoelastic products made of biological
polymers called hylans for use in therapeutic medical applications and skin
care. In connection with the formation of Genzyme Biosurgery, Genzyme created
Genzyme Biosurgery Division common stock which it refers to as "Biosurgery
Stock." Biosurgery Stock is designed to track the performance of Genzyme
Biosurgery.

    Genzyme is in the process of acquiring Wyntek Diagnostics Inc., a
privately-held California corporation which provides high quality, point-of-care
rapid medical diagnostic tests for pregnancy and infectious diseases. The
acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2001. If Genzyme
completes the acquisition of Wyntek, it will allocate that acquisition to
Genzyme General.

    The principal offices of Genzyme, a Massachusetts corporation, are located
at One Kendall Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, and its telephone number
at these offices is (617) 252-7500.

FOCAL (SEE PAGE   )

    Focal develops, manufactures and commercializes synthetic, absorbable,
liquid surgical sealants based on its proprietary polymer technology. In
addition to Focal's commercial surgical sealants for lung and neurological
surgery, its FocalSeal-Registered Trademark--L and FocalSeal-Registered
Trademark--S surgical sealant products are currently being developed for use
inside the body to seal leaks resulting from cardiovascular and gastrointestinal
surgery.

    The principal offices of Focal, a Delaware corporation, are located at 4
Maguire Road, Lexington, Massachusetts 02421, and its telephone number at these
offices is (781) 280-7800.

MATERIAL CONTRACTS BETWEEN GENZYME AND FOCAL (SEE PAGE   )

    Focal and Genzyme are parties to a marketing and distribution agreement
under which Genzyme has exclusive marketing and distribution rights to Focal's
surgical sealant products for lung surgery, cardiovascular surgery and
gastrointestinal surgery in North America. Focal and Genzyme also are parties to
a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which Genzyme committed, subject to
conditions, to purchase up to $20.0 million of Focal common stock, in four
installments of up to $5.0 million each. Focal has exercised three of its
options totaling $15.0 million and, as a result, Genzyme acquired 3,851,806
shares of Focal common stock representing approximately 22% of Focal's
outstanding capital stock. At Focal's option, Genzyme has agreed to purchase up
to $5.0 million of additional shares of Focal common stock, subject to specified
conditions. Focal anticipates that if it exercises its option in full, Genzyme
would own in excess of 45% of the outstanding Focal common stock. The stock
purchase agreement also provides Genzyme with specified negotiation rights in
connection with a proposed change of control of Focal and preemptive rights in
connection with future issuances of Focal capital stock, which rights are
suspended while the merger agreement is in effect. Concurrently with entering
into the merger agreement, Genzyme and Focal entered into a letter agreement
that modified the terms of the stock purchase agreement and the marketing and
distribution agreement. In addition, under the letter agreement Genzyme agreed
to restrictions on its ability to buy, sell or vote shares of Focal common
stock.

                              THE SPECIAL MEETING

DATE AND PURPOSE (SEE PAGE   )

    A special meeting of Focal stockholders has been scheduled to be held at the
offices of Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts, on
June 28, 2001, at 10:00 a.m., local time.

RECORD DATE; VOTING RIGHTS (SEE PAGE  )

    If you owned shares of Focal common stock as of the close of business on
May 25, 2001, the record date for the special meeting, you may vote on the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. On that date, there were       shares of
Focal common stock issued and outstanding and held by approximately
holders of record. At the special meeting, Focal stockholders will have one vote
for each share of Focal common stock they owned on the record date.

VOTE REQUIRED (SEE PAGE   )

    To complete the merger, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Focal common stock must vote to adopt the merger agreement. If you fail to
vote or abstain from voting, it will have the effect of a vote against the
merger agreement. A broker who holds Focal common stock as your nominee
generally will not have the authority to vote your shares unless you provide the
broker with instructions on how to vote your shares.

VOTING AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE   )

    A group of institutional stockholders of Focal representing approximately
12.5% of Focal's outstanding common stock have entered into a voting agreement
with Genzyme, in which they agreed to vote their shares of Focal common stock in
favor of adopting the merger agreement. The voting agreement, together with the
3,851,806 shares of Focal common stock owned by Genzyme, effectively ensures
that approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of Focal common stock will vote
in favor of adoption of the merger agreement.

THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

    In the proposed merger, Sammy Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Genzyme, will be merged into Focal. Focal will be the
surviving corporation and will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Genzyme as a
result of the merger.

    The proposed merger will occur following the adoption of the merger
agreement by the Focal stockholders and satisfaction or waiver of all other
conditions to the merger. The merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this
proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read it because it is the legal
document that governs the merger.

WHAT THE HOLDERS OF FOCAL COMMON STOCK WILL RECEIVE IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

    In the proposed merger, you will receive 0.1545 of a share of Biosurgery
Stock for each outstanding share of Focal common stock that you own. You will
receive cash for any fractional share of Biosurgery Stock you would otherwise be
entitled to receive. The amount of cash will be equal to the product of the
fraction multiplied by the average of the high and low per share trading prices
of Biosurgery Stock on the trading day on which the merger is completed. For
example, if you own 100 shares of Focal common stock, you will receive 15 shares
of Biosurgery Stock and a cash payment equal to 45% of the market value of one
share of Biosurgery Stock on the closing date of the merger, rounded to the
nearest whole cent.

FOCAL'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

    In reaching its decision to approve the merger, the Focal board of directors
considered, among other things:

    - the state of Focal's business, financial condition, results of operations
      and prospects, including the fact that Focal's business could not be
      sustained without substantial new capital;

    - the fact that extensive efforts to find alternative strategic investors or
      acquirors had not succeeded;

    - the historical market prices and recent trading activity of Focal common
      stock and Biosurgery Stock, including the offer price per share of Focal
      common stock implied by the exchange ratio of 0.1545;

    - the opportunity for the combined businesses to employ Genzyme's financial
      and technical resources and commitment to commercializing Focal's
      biomaterial products and expanding the range of applications for Focal's
      proprietary biomaterial platform;

    - the impact of Genzyme's existing agreements with Focal on its prospects
      and alternatives; and

    - the potential delisting of Focal common stock from The Nasdaq National
      Market.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE FOCAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS (SEE PAGE   )

    Focal's board of directors has determined that the merger and merger
agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Focal and its stockholders
and unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" adoption of the merger agreement.

FAIRNESS OPINION OF STEPHENS INC. (SEE PAGE   )

    In deciding to approve the merger, the Focal board of directors considered
an opinion from Stephens Inc., a financial advisor to the Focal board of
directors. On April 24, 2001, Stephens delivered its written opinion to the
Focal board of directors that, as of that date and based on and subject to the
matters set forth in the opinion, the exchange ratio of 0.1545 was fair from a
financial point of view to

the Focal stockholders, other than Focal's directors, officers and employees,
and Genzyme and its affiliates. The full text of this written opinion is
attached as Annex B to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read this
opinion carefully in its entirety. The opinion of Stephens is directed to the
Focal board of directors and is not a recommendation to any stockholder on how
to vote on the merger or the merger agreement.

GENZYME'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

    In reaching its decision to approve the merger, the Genzyme board of
directors considered, among other things:

    - its assessment of Focal's products, technology and patent portfolio; and

    - Genzyme's ownership of approximately 22% of the outstanding Focal common
      stock and Genzyme's potential obligation to acquire additional shares of
      Focal common stock for cash.

OWNERSHIP OF GENZYME BIOSURGERY AFTER THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

    Genzyme will issue approximately 2.1 million shares of Biosurgery Stock to
Focal stockholders, other than Genzyme, in the merger. These shares of
Biosurgery Stock will represent approximately 5.7 percent of the outstanding
Biosurgery Stock after the merger. The aggregate market value of these shares is
approximately       , based upon the closing prices for Biosurgery Stock on
      , 2001. This information is based on the number of shares of Biosurgery
Stock and Focal common stock outstanding on May 25, 2001 and does not take into
account shares of Focal common stock which may be issued pursuant to stock
options, warrants and other convertible securities before the merger is
completed.

MANAGEMENT AFTER MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

    Genzyme's board of directors and the composition of Genzyme's management
will not change as a result of the merger.

INTEREST OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS (SEE PAGE   )

    When considering the recommendations of the Focal board of directors, you
should be aware that Focal officers and directors may have interests in the
merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of other Focal
stockholders. For example, when the merger is completed, Focal officers and
directors will be entitled to receive retention bonuses, loan forgiveness,
severance benefits and other benefit payments.

    On the record date, current directors, executive officers of Focal and their
affiliates as a group beneficially owned approximately 2.6% of the outstanding
shares of Focal common stock, including options exercisable within 60 days of
the record date. Current directors and executive officers of Genzyme and their
affiliates as a group beneficially owned approximately   % of the outstanding
shares of Biosurgery Stock; including options exercisable within 60 days of the
record date.

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

    Focal stockholders must adopt the merger agreement before we can complete
the merger. The merger is also subject to additional customary closing
conditions. Other than the condition relating to stockholder approval, either
Focal or Genzyme could elect to waive conditions to its own performance and
complete the merger. If Focal waives any material conditions, it may be required
to resolicit stockholder approval.

RESTRICTIONS ON OTHER TRANSACTIONS (SEE PAGE   )

    The merger agreement contains provisions which generally limit the ability
of Focal's board of directors to solicit or participate in discussions with any
third party about other transactions. In addition, the merger agreement requires
Focal to seek stockholder approval of the merger even if the Focal board of
directors changes its recommendation to vote in favor of adoption of the merger
agreement.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE   )

    Genzyme and Focal can mutually terminate the merger agreement without
completing the merger.

    Either Genzyme or Focal may terminate the agreement if:

    - the merger is not completed by August 31, 2001,

    - the other party is unable to satisfy a condition to closing,

    - a governmental entity has permanently enjoined the merger agreement and
      that action is non-appealable, or

    - the Focal stockholders do not approve the merger.

    In addition, Genzyme can terminate the merger agreement if the Focal board
of directors withdraws, modifies, or qualifies its recommendation that the Focal
stockholders adopt the merger agreement or fails to recommend against an
alternative transaction. Focal can terminate the merger agreement if Genzyme
fails to purchase all of the shares of Focal common stock that it is required to
purchase under the stock purchase agreement between Genzyme and Focal.

TERMINATION FEES AND EXPENSES (SEE PAGE   )

    Focal may be required to pay a termination fee of $600,000 to Genzyme, if
the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, including if:

    - after a person publicly announces an alternative acquisition proposal
      involving Focal, the merger agreement is terminated because:

       -- the Focal stockholders do not approve the merger;

       -- Focal is in breach of specified provisions of the merger agreement; or

       -- the August 31, 2001 deadline has passed;

       and within nine months of the termination of the merger agreement, Focal
       either enters into a binding agreement for or consummates an alternative
       transaction; or

    - the Focal board of directors withdraws, modifies or qualifies its
      recommendation that the Focal stockholders approve the merger, or fails to
      recommend against an alternative transaction.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (SEE PAGE   )

    The merger will be treated as a taxable exchange by the Focal stockholders
of their shares of Focal common stock for shares of Biosurgery Stock.
Accordingly, you will realize taxable gain, or loss, to the extent that the fair
market value of the Biosurgery Stock you receive in the merger, plus any cash in
lieu of a fractional share, exceeds, or is less than, your adjusted tax basis in
the Focal common stock exchanged in the merger. Your aggregate tax basis in the
Biosurgery Stock you receive will equal the fair market value of the Biosurgery
Stock as of the date the merger is completed, and your holding period for the
Biosurgery Stock will begin the day after the merger. Additionally, no gain or
loss will generally be recognized by Focal, Genzyme or Sammy Merger Corp. as a
result of the merger.

    WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR FOR A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE
FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES THAT THE MERGER WILL HAVE ON
YOU.

TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS (SEE PAGE   )

    Each option and warrant to purchase shares of Focal common stock outstanding
immediately before the effective time of the merger will be assumed by Genzyme
after the merger and will become an option or warrant, as the case may be, to
acquire Biosurgery Stock. Genzyme will adjust the number of shares issuable upon
exercise of the option or warrant and the exercise prices to reflect the
exchange ratio in the merger.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (SEE PAGE   )

    Genzyme expects to account for the merger under the purchase method of
accounting, which means that the assets and liabilities of Focal, including its
intangible assets, will be recorded on Genzyme's books at their fair market
values. The results of operations and cash flows of Focal will be included in
Genzyme's financial statements prospectively as of the closing of the merger.

REGULATORY APPROVALS (SEE PAGE   )

    Genzyme and Focal are not aware of any material governmental or regulatory
approvals required for closing the merger other than compliance with federal
securities laws.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS (SEE PAGE   )

    Under Delaware law, Focal stockholders will not have appraisal rights in
connection with the merger.

COMPARATIVE STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS (SEE PAGE   )

    Genzyme is a Massachusetts corporation governed by the Massachusetts
Business Corporation Law. Focal is a Delaware corporation governed by the
Delaware General Corporation Law. When we complete the merger, Focal
stockholders will hold shares of Biosurgery Stock. Accordingly, their rights as
stockholders will be governed by Massachusetts law, Genzyme's charter and
by-laws and the management and accounting policies that govern Genzyme's
treatment of its various divisions and tracking stocks.

COMPARATIVE STOCK PRICE AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION (SEE PAGE   )

                      GENZYME CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

                       SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA

Genzyme is providing the following information to aid you in your analysis of
the financial aspects of the merger. The table below represents selected
historical consolidated statements of operations and balance sheet data of
Genzyme and its subsidiaries. The statements of operations and balance sheet
data for the years ended December 31, 1996 through December 31, 2000 are derived
from Genzyme's audited financial statements for those periods. The statements of
operations data for the three months ended March 31, 2000 and 2001 and the
balance sheet data as of March 31, 2001 are derived from Genzyme's unaudited
financial statements for those periods. In the opinion of Genzyme's management,
the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on a basis consistent with
the audited financial statements and include all adjustments, consisting only of
normal recurring accruals necessary for a fair presentation of the financial
position and results of operations for these periods. The operating results for
the three months ended March 31, 2001 are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year.

    Genzyme has three series of common stock--Genzyme General Division common
stock, which is referred to as "Genzyme General Stock," Biosurgery Stock and
Genzyme Molecular Oncology Division common stock, which is referred to as
"Molecular Oncology Stock"--which it refers to as "tracking stock." Unlike
typical common stock, each of Genzyme's tracking stocks is designed to track the
financial performance of a specified subset of its business operations and its
allocated assets, rather than operations and assets of the entire company. The
chief mechanisms intended to cause each tracking stock to "track" the financial
performance of each division are provisions in Genzyme's charter governing
dividends and distributions. Under these provisions, Genzyme's charter:

    - factors the assets and liabilities and income or losses attributable to a
      division into the determination of the amount available to pay dividends
      on the associated tracking stock; and

    - requires Genzyme to exchange, redeem or distribute a dividend to the
      holders of Molecular Oncology Stock or Biosurgery Stock, if all or
      substantially all of the assets allocated to those corresponding divisions
      are sold to a third party (a dividend or redemption payment must equal in
      value the net after-tax proceeds from the sale; an exchange must be for
      Genzyme General Stock at a 10% premium to the average market price of the
      exchanged stock following the announcement of the sale).

    To determine earnings per share, Genzyme allocates its earnings to each
series of its common stock based on the earnings attributable to that series of
stock. The earnings attributable to each series of stock are defined in
Genzyme's charter as the net income or loss of the corresponding division
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and as
adjusted for tax benefits allocated to or from that division in accordance with
Genzyme's management and accounting policies. Genzyme's charter also requires
that all income and expenses of Genzyme be allocated among the divisions in a
reasonable and consistent manner. However, subject to its fiduciary duties,
Genzyme's board of directors can, at its discretion, change the methods of
allocating earnings to each series of common stock without shareholder approval.
Genzyme intends to allocate earnings using its current methods for the
foreseeable future.

    Because the earnings allocated to each series of stock are based on the
income or losses attributable to each corresponding division, Genzyme provides
financial statements and management's discussion and analysis of Genzyme
Corporation and of each of its divisions to aid investors in evaluating
Genzyme's performance and the performance of each of its divisions.

    On December 14, 2000, Genzyme acquired GelTex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a
public company engaged in developing therapeutic products based on polymer
technology. Genzyme accounted for the acquisition as a purchase and allocated it
to Genzyme General. Accordingly, the results of operations

                      GENZYME CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

                 SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA (CONTINUED)

of GelTex are included in Genzyme's consolidated financial statements and the
combined financial statements of Genzyme General from the date of acquisition.

    As part of the acquisition of GelTex, Genzyme acquired all of GelTex's
interest in RenaGel-TM- LLC, Genzyme's joint venture with GelTex. Prior to the
acquisition of GelTex, Genzyme accounted for Genzyme's investment in RenaGel-TM-
LLC under the equity method. These summary financial statements reflect the
consolidation of RenaGel-TM- LLC into Genzyme's financial statements and
accounting for its purchase of GelTex's 50% interest in the joint venture using
the purchase method of accounting.

    On December 18, 2000, Genzyme acquired Biomatrix, Inc., a public company
engaged in the development and manufacturing of viscoelastic biomaterials for
use in orthopaedic and other medical applications. At the time of the merger,
Genzyme created Genzyme Biosurgery as a new division. Genzyme reallocated the
businesses of two of its then-existing divisions--Genzyme Surgical Products and
Genzyme Tissue Repair--to Genzyme Biosurgery and allocated the acquired
businesses of Biomatrix to Genzyme Biosurgery. As a result of this transaction,
Genzyme amended its charter to create Biosurgery Stock and eliminate Surgical
Products Division common stock, which Genzyme refers to as "Surgical Products
Stock," and Tissue Repair Division common stock, which Genzyme refers to as
"Tissue Repair Stock." Each outstanding share of, or option to purchase,
Surgical Products Stock was converted into the right to receive 0.6060 of a
share of, or option to purchase, Biosurgery Stock and each outstanding share of,
or option to purchase, Tissue Repair Stock was converted into the right to
receive 0.3352 of a share of, or option to purchase, Biosurgery Stock. Genzyme
accounted for the acquisition of Biomatrix as a purchase and, accordingly, the
results of operations of Biomatrix are included in Genzyme's consolidated
financial statements and the combined financial statements of Genzyme Biosurgery
from the date of acquisition.

    In addition, because Genzyme is in the process of acquiring Wyntek and
expects to close the acquisition in the second quarter of 2001, you should read
Genzyme's selected historical financial data in conjunction with Wyntek's
historical financial statements and related notes contained in Genzyme's current
report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 18, 2001.

    While each series of Genzyme's tracking stock is designed to reflect each
division's performance, it is common stock of Genzyme Corporation and not of a
division; each division is not a company or legal entity, and therefore does not
and cannot issue stock. Consequently, holders of each tracking stock have no
specific rights to assets allocated to each division. Genzyme Corporation
continues to hold title to all of the assets allocated to the corresponding
division and is responsible for all of its liabilities, regardless of what it
deems for financial statement presentation purposes as allocated to any
division. Holders of each tracking stock, as common stockholders, are therefore
subject to the risks of investing in the businesses, assets and liabilities of
Genzyme as a whole. For instance, the assets allocated to each division are
subject to company-wide claims of creditors, product liability plaintiffs and
stockholder litigation. Also, in the event of a Genzyme liquidation, insolvency
or similar event, holders of each tracking stock would only have the rights of
common stockholders in the combined assets of Genzyme.

    As market or competitive conditions warrant, Genzyme may create new series
of tracking stock or change its earnings allocation methodology. However, at the
present time, it has no plans to do so.

    This information is only a summary. You should read it in conjunction with
Genzyme's historical financial statements and related notes and "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"
contained in Genzyme's annual reports, quarterly reports and other information
on file with the SEC. For more details on how you can obtain these reports and
other information, you should read the section of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled "WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION" beginning on

            Pencer-Registered Trademark-, Inc.

    - 1997-- $7.0 million from the acquisition of PharmaGenics, Inc.

    - 1999-- $5.4 million from the acquisition of Peptimmune, Inc.

    - 2000-- $118.0 million from the acquisition of GelTex

    Springfield Mills manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom.

(4) During 2000, in accordance with Genzyme's policy pertaining to affiliate
    sales of stock, Genzyme recorded gains of $22.7 million relating to public
    offerings of common stock by its unconsolidated affiliate, Genzyme
    Transgenics Corporation, of which $20.3 million was recorded in the three
    months ended March 31, 2000. In 1999, Genzyme's gain on affiliate sale of
    stock represents the gain on its investment in Genzyme Transgenics as a
    result of Genzyme Transgenics' various issuances of additional shares of its
    common stock.

(5) Gain on sale of product line of $31.2 million in 1998 relates to the sale of
    Genzyme's research products business assets to Techne Corporation in
    July 1998. Gain on sale of product line in 1999 consists of $7.5 million,
    representing the payment of a note receivable that Genzyme received as
    partial consideration for the sale of Genetic Design, Inc. to Laboratory
    Corporation of America in 1996, and $0.5 million relating to the sale of its
    immunochemistry business assets to an operating unit of Sybron Laboratory
    Products Corp.

(6) Other income in 2000 includes a $5.1 million payment received in connection
    with the settlement of a lawsuit. Other income in 1999 includes the receipt
    of a $14.4 million payment associated with the termination of Genzyme's
    agreement to acquire Cell Genesys, Inc., net of acquisition related
    expenses.

(7) On January 1, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    ("SFAS") 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities," as amended by SFAS 137 and SFAS 138. In accordance with the
    transition provisions of SFAS 133, we recorded a cumulative-effect
    adjustment of $4.2 million, net of tax, in our unaudited, consolidated
    statement of operations to record the fair value of certain derivative
    instruments held on January 1, 2001.

(8) Until the distribution of Surgical Products Stock on June 28, 1999, Genzyme
    Surgical Products' net losses were included in the determination of income
    allocated to Genzyme General Stock. If the shares of Surgical Products Stock
    initially issued on June 28, 1999 were assumed to be outstanding since
    January 1, 1996, net income allocated to Genzyme General Stock and weighted
    average shares of Genzyme General Stock outstanding would have been as
    follows:

                                                               FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

(9) To determine earnings per share, Genzyme allocates earnings to each series
    of its common stock based on the earnings attributable to that series of
    stock. The earnings attributable to Genzyme General Stock is defined in
    Genzyme's charter as the net income or loss of Genzyme General determined in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and as adjusted for
    tax benefits allocated to or from Genzyme General in accordance with
    Genzyme's management and accounting policies. Earnings attributable to
    Biosurgery Stock and Molecular Oncology Stock are defined similarly and,
    therefore, are based on the net income or loss of the corresponding
    division.

(10) Genzyme created Genzyme Biosurgery on December 18, 2000. Prior to this
     date, the operations allocated to Genzyme Biosurgery were included in the
     operations allocated to Genzyme Surgical Products and Genzyme Tissue Repair
     and as of that date, the operations of Genzyme Surgical Products and
     Genzyme Tissue Repair ceased. Net loss per share of Biosurgery Stock for
     2000 is calculated using the net loss allocated to Biosurgery Stock for the
     period from December 19, 2000 through December 31, 2000 and the weighted
     average shares of Biosurgery Stock outstanding during the same period. Loss
     per share data are not presented for Genzyme Biosurgery for the years ended
     December 31, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999 or for the period from January 1,

     outstanding during those periods.

(11) Genzyme created Genzyme Molecular Oncology on June 18, 1997. Prior to this
    date, the operations of Genzyme Molecular Oncology were included in the
    determination of income allocated to Genzyme General Stock. Net loss per
    share of Molecular Oncology Stock for 1997 is calculated using the net loss
    allocated to Genzyme Molecular Oncology for the period June 18, 1997 through
    December 31, 1997 and the weighted average shares outstanding during the
    same period. Loss per share data are not presented for Genzyme Molecular
    Oncology for the year ended December 31, 1996 or for the period from

    Oncology Stock outstanding during those periods.

(12) Genzyme created Genzyme Surgical Products on June 28, 1999. Prior to this
    date, the operations of Genzyme Surgical Products were included in the
    operations allocated to Genzyme General and, therefore, in the net income
    allocated to Genzyme General Stock. Net loss per share of Surgical Products
    Stock for 1999 is calculated using the net loss allocated to Genzyme
    Surgical Products for the period June 28, 1999 through December 31, 1999 and
    the weighted average shares outstanding during the same period. Loss per
    share data is not presented for Genzyme Surgical Products for the years
    ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998 or for the period from January 1,
    1999 to June 28, 1999, as there were no shares of Surgical Products Stock
    outstanding during those periods. If the shares of Surgical Products Stock
    initially issued on June 28, 1999 were assumed to be outstanding since
    January 1, 1996, net loss allocated to Surgical Products Stock and weighted
    average shares outstanding would have been as follows:

                       A DIVISION OF GENZYME CORPORATION
                       SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA

    Genzyme is providing the following information to aid you in your analysis
of the financial aspects of the merger. The table below represents selected
historical combined statements of operations and combined balance sheet data for
Genzyme Biosurgery. Genzyme derived the balance sheet data at December 31, 2000
and 1999 and the statements of operations data for the years ended December 31,
1998 through December 31, 2000 from the audited financial statements of Genzyme
Biosurgery for those periods. Genzyme derived the statements of operations data
for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998 and the three months ended
March 31, 2000 and 2001 and the balance sheet data as of March 31, 2001 from the
unaudited financial statements of Genzyme Biosurgery for those periods. In the
opinion of Genzyme's management, the unaudited financial statements (except for
the impact of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities," on January 1, 2001) for
Genzyme Biosurgery have been prepared on a basis consistent with its audited
financial statements and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal
recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position
and results of operations for these periods. The operating results for Genzyme
Biosurgery for the three months ended March 31, 2001 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year.

    Genzyme Biosurgery is an operating division of Genzyme that develops,
manufactures and sells instruments, devices, biomaterials and biotherapeutic
products to improve or replace surgery, with an emphsis on the orthopaedic and
cardiothoracic markets.

    A series of Genzyme's common stock, Biosurgery Stock is designed to reflect
the value and track the performance of this division. Biosurgery Stock is common
stock of Genzyme Corporation, not of Genzyme Biosurgery; Genzyme Biosurgery is a
division, not a company or legal entity, and therefore does not and cannot issue
stock. The chief mechanisms intended to cause Biosurgery Stock to "track" the
financial performance of Genzyme Biosurgery are provisions in Genzyme's charter
governing dividends and distributions. Under these provisions, Genzyme's
charter:

    - factors the assets and liabilities and income or losses attributable to
      Genzyme Biosurgery into the determination of the amount available to pay
      dividends on Biosurgery Stock; and

    - requires Genzyme to exchange, redeem or distribute a dividend to the
      holders of Biosurgery Stock if all or substantially all of the assets
      allocated to Genzyme Biosurgery are sold to a third party.

    Because the earnings allocated to Biosurgery Stock are based on the income
or losses attributable to Genzyme Biosurgery, Genzyme includes financial
statements and management's discussion and analysis of Genzyme Biosurgery to aid
investors in evaluating its performance.

    On December 18, 2000, Genzyme created Genzyme Biosurgery by combining two of
its divisions, Genzyme Surgical Products and Genzyme Tissue Repair to form one
new division, and simultaneously acquiring Biomatrix, Inc. The accompanying
financial data reflects the financial position and results of operations of
Genzyme Biosurgery as if it has been accounted for as a separate division of
Genzyme for all periods presented, as it relates to Genzyme Surgical Products
and Genzyme Tissue Repair. Genzyme accounted for the acquisition as a purchase
and accordingly, the results of operations of Biomatrix are included in its
consolidated financial statements and the combined financial statements of
Genzyme Biosurgery from the date of acquisition.

    This information is only a summary. You should read it in conjunction with
Genzyme's historical financial statements and related notes and "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"
contained in Genzyme's annual reports, quarterly reports and other information
on file with the SEC. For more details on how you can obtain these reports and
other information, you should read the section of this proxy

- ------------------------------

(1) The cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is a one-time
    noncash charge relating to Focal's adoption of Staff Accounting Bulletin
    No. 101 ("SAB 101"). SAB 101 was issued by the Securities and Exchange
    Commission ("SEC") in December 1999. SAB 101 provides guidance related to
    revenue recognition policies based on interpretations and practices followed
    by the SEC. The impact of Focal's adoption of SAB 101 was to defer revenue
    recognition for certain portions of the revenue previously recognized by the
    Company under its collaborative research and development arrangements into
    future accounting periods.

(2) Pro forma in 1996 and 1997--pro forma net loss per share for 1997 is
    computed using the weighted average number of outstanding common shares and
    convertible preferred shares, assuming conversion at date of issuance.
    Historical earnings per share for 1997 has not been presented since such
    amounts are not deemed meaningful due to the significant change in Focal's
    capital structure that occurred in connection with its initial public
    offering in 1997.

                           COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

    We are providing the following comparative per share information to aid you
in your analysis of the financial aspects of the merger. You should read this
information in conjunction with Genzyme's and Focal's historical financial
statements that are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/
prospectus, and the pro forma combined financial statements and the related
notes that are included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. The pro
forma consolidated per share data presented below reflect the purchase method of
accounting for business combinations. The results may have been different if our
companies had always been consolidated.

    Holders of Biosurgery Stock have no specific rights to any particular asset
or group of assets of Genzyme. Genzyme continues to hold title to all of its
assets and is responsible for all of its liabilities, regardless of what it
deems for financial statement presentation purposes as allocated to any
division. Common stockholders are, therefore, subject to the risks of investing
in the businesses, assets and liabilities of Genzyme as a whole.

    Both Genzyme and Focal have fiscal years ending on December 31. The Focal
pro forma equivalent per share data equals the exchange ratio of 0.1545
multiplied by the pro forma per share data for Biosurgery Stock. The pro forma
per share data are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have
occurred if the merger had been completed on the dates indicated or the results
that will occur after the merger. No cash dividends have ever been paid or
declared on shares of Focal common stock or Biosurgery Stock. Genzyme does not
anticipate paying cash dividends on Biosurgery Stock in the foreseeable future.

prospectus entitled "UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION"
beginning on page   .

                                  RISK FACTORS

    IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER INFORMATION INCLUDED AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE
IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT/ PROSPECTUS, YOU SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE RISK
FACTORS DESCRIBED BELOW IN DECIDING HOW TO VOTE ON THE MERGER PROPOSAL. YOU
SHOULD KEEP THESE RISK FACTORS IN MIND WHEN YOU READ FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
INCLUDED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS.

                          RISKS RELATING TO THE MERGER

    BECAUSE THE EXCHANGE RATIO FOR FOCAL COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER IS FIXED AND
WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN THE MARKET PRICE OF BIOSURGERY STOCK,
HOLDERS OF FOCAL COMMON STOCK MAY RECEIVE LESS VALUE FOR THEIR SHARES IF THE
MARKET PRICE OF BIOSURGERY STOCK DECLINES BEFORE THE CLOSING OF THE PROPOSED
MERGER.

    In the merger, each share of Focal common stock will be converted into the
right to receive 0.1545 of a share of Biosurgery Stock. This exchange ratio is
fixed and will not be adjusted as a result of any change in the price of
Biosurgery Stock. Focal cannot terminate the merger agreement or elect not to
consummate the merger as a result of changes in the market price of the
Biosurgery Stock. Accordingly, the specific dollar value of Biosurgery Stock you
will receive upon completion of the merger will depend on the market value of
Biosurgery Stock at that time. The market value of Biosurgery Stock has
experienced significant volatility and its price on and after the closing date
of the merger may vary significantly from the prices on the date of execution of
the merger agreement, the date of this proxy statement/prospectus and the date
on which you vote on the merger. An increase in the value of Biosurgery Stock
will result in a higher price being paid for your shares of Focal common stock
in the merger whereas a decrease in the value of Biosurgery Stock will result in
a lower price being paid for your shares. The price of Biosurgery Stock can be
volatile and the price at the time the merger is completed may be lower than its
price on the date of this document or the date of the Focal special meeting. On
April 25, 2001, the date of the execution of the merger, the closing price of
Biosurgery Stock was $4.74 per share. On May   , 2001, the last practicable
trading day before the date of this document, the closing price of Biosurgery
Stock was $      per share. We encourage you to obtain current market quotations
for Biosurgery Stock and Focal common stock before making your decision on how
to vote on the merger.

    THE RECEIPT OF SHARES OF BIOSURGERY STOCK IN THE MERGER WILL RESULT IN
TAXABLE GAIN OR LOSS TO THE FOCAL COMMON STOCKHOLDERS WHETHER OR NOT THEY SELL
THOSE SHARES.

    The merger will be treated as a taxable exchange of your shares of Focal
common stock for shares of Biosurgery Stock. Accordingly, you will realize
taxable gain or loss, to the extent that the fair market value of the Biosurgery
Stock, plus any cash in lieu of a fractional share, received by you in the
merger exceeds, or is less than, your adjusted tax basis in the Focal common
stock exchanged in the merger. This gain or loss will be capital in nature so
long as you held the Focal common stock surrendered as a capital asset and will
be a long-term gain or loss if you have a holding period exceeding one year in
the Focal common stock surrendered. Your aggregate tax basis in the Biosurgery
Stock received in the merger will equal its fair market value at the time of the
merger and your holding period for the Biosurgery Stock will commence on the day
following the merger. The tax consequences of the merger will vary according to
your individual circumstances. We urge you to carefully read the discussion
under the section entitled "FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES" beginning on page
      , and to consult your tax advisor on the consequences of the merger.

    GENZYME FACES RISKS THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE FACED BY FOCAL, AND THESE
RISKS MAY CAUSE THE VALUE OF THE SHARES OF BIOSURGERY STOCK ISSUED TO YOU TO
DECLINE.

    In the merger you will receive shares of Biosurgery Stock, one of Genzyme's
tracking stocks. Biosurgery Stock has recently experienced extreme fluctuations
in price and volume. Genzyme's business and strategy are somewhat different from
that of Focal, and Genzyme's results of operations,

as well as the price of Biosurgery Stock, will be affected by various factors
different from those affecting Focal's results of operations and its common
stock price. Future events that may not have affected the price of Focal common
stock may cause the price of Biosurgery Stock to rise or fall. The market price
for Biosurgery Stock may fluctuate for various reasons, including:

    - announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by
      Genzyme or by its competitors;

    - governmental regulatory initiatives;

    - legal developments regarding patent or proprietary rights developments;

    - public concern as to the safety or other implications of biotechnology
      products; and

    - general market conditions.

    We describe the risks in more detail under the subsections entitled "--Risks
Relating to Genzyme Biosurgery" and "--Risks Relating to Genzyme" below.

    FOCAL DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS MAY HAVE INTERESTS THAT ARE DIFFERENT
FROM, OR IN ADDITION TO, THOSE OF FOCAL STOCKHOLDERS GENERALLY.

    You should be aware of interests of, and the benefits available to, Focal
directors and executive officers when considering the recommendation of the
Focal board of directors of the merger agreement. The Focal directors and
executive officers have interests in the merger that are in addition to, or
different from, their interests as Focal common stockholders. When the merger is
completed, Focal officers and directors will be entitled to receive retention
bonuses, loan forgiveness, severance benefits and other benefit payments. For a
more detailed discussion of the interests of Focal management, see "BACKGROUND
AND REASONS FOR THE MERGER--Interests of Focal Management in the Merger" on page
      of this proxy statement/prospectus.

             RISKS RELATING TO FOCAL IF THE MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED

    IF THE MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED, AND FOCAL IS UNABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL
FUNDS, IT MAY HAVE TO TERMINATE OPERATIONS AND/OR SEEK LEGAL PROTECTION FROM ITS
CREDITORS.

    At March 31, 2001, Focal had $5.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and
investments. Focal estimates that its existing financial resources are
sufficient to satisfy its existing level of capital and operating requirements
through the fourth quarter of 2001. Focal's accountants issued an opinion on
Focal's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2000 with an
explanatory paragraph indicating substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. Focal is undertaking measures to further reduce its
operating expenditures. The merger agreement prohibits Focal from incurring
significant indebtedness or issuing capital stock, other than under the stock
purchase agreement with Genzyme. However, if the merger is not completed, Focal
will require additional financing to continue to operate. There can be no
assurance that sources of financing would be available, or if available, will
not be highly dilutive or have other adverse effects on the value of Focal
common stock. In addition, Focal may be required to grant future investors
rights which are superior to those of its current stockholders. If the merger
does not occur, and Focal is unable to raise additional funds, it may have to
terminate operations and/or seek legal protection from its creditors.

    FOCAL COMMON STOCK MAY BE DELISTED FROM THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET, WHICH
COULD CAUSE THE PRICE OF ITS STOCK TO FALL FURTHER AND DECREASE THE LIQUIDITY OF
ITS STOCK.

    Focal common stock is listed on The Nasdaq National Market. In order to
continue to be listed on Nasdaq, however, Focal must maintain certain minimum
financial requirements, including, among other things, at least $4,000,000 in
net tangible assets, a public float of at least 750,000 shares with a market

value of at least $5 million, and a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. The
failure to meet any one of these maintenance criteria may result in the
delisting of Focal's securities from Nasdaq. Nasdaq has previously notified
Focal that it is not in compliance with these requirements. The delisting of
Focal common stock may result in the trading of the stock on the Nasdaq SmallCap
Market, the over-the-counter markets in the so-called "pink sheets" or the
NASD's Electronic Bulletin Board. Consequently, the liquidity of Focal common
stock could be impaired, not only in the number of shares which could be bought
and sold, but also through delays in the timing of the transactions and
reductions in security analyst and media coverage of Focal. This may reduce
demand for Focal common stock and destabilize the price for the stock. As a
result, stockholders might find it more difficult to dispose of Focal common
stock. A delisting would also greatly impair Focal's ability to raise additional
necessary capital. In addition, delisting would adversely affect the purchase
price of the shares of Focal common stock that Focal may require Genzyme to
purchase under an existing stock purchase agreement, resulting in further
dilution to Focal stockholders. For a more detailed discussion of the potential
Nasdaq delisting, see "BACKGROUND AND REASONS FOR THE MERGER" on page   . For a
more detailed discussion on the stock purchase agreement between Genzyme and
Focal, see "MATERIAL CONTRACTS BETWEEN GENZYME AND FOCAL" on page   of this
proxy statement/prospectus.

    IF FOCAL COMMON STOCK IS DELISTED, IT MAY BE SUBJECT TO THE "PENNY STOCK"
REGULATIONS WHICH MAY AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO SELL YOUR SHARES.

    If Focal common stock is delisted from The Nasdaq National Market it may
become subject to the "penny stock" regulations under Rule 15g-9 of the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Penny stock is defined by
Rule 15g-9 generally as any equity security that has a market price or exercise
price less than $5.00 per share, subject to exceptions, including listing on The
Nasdaq National Market. That rule imposes additional sales practice requirements
on broker-dealers that sell low-priced securities to persons other than
institutional accredited investors and established customers, who generally are
individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual incomes exceeding
$200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouses. For transactions covered by
this rule, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the
purchaser and have received the purchaser's written consent to the transaction
prior to sale. Furthermore, the broker-dealer must obtain a signed and dated
acknowledgement from the purchaser demonstrating that the purchaser has actually
received the required risk disclosure document before effecting a transaction in
penny stock. These requirements have historically resulted in reducing the level
of trading activity in securities that become subject to the penny stock rules.
Consequently, you may likely find it more difficult to resell your shares of
Focal common stock in the secondary market, which would likely have an adverse
effect on the market price of Focal common stock.

    FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE MERGER COULD HARM FOCAL'S STOCK PRICE AND ITS FUTURE
BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS.

    If the merger is not completed, Focal may be subject to the following
material risks, among others:

    - Focal employees may experience uncertainty and terminate their
      relationship with Focal if the merger is not completed;

    - the price of Focal common stock may decline to the extent that the current
      market prices of Focal common stock reflect a market assumption that the
      merger will be completed;

    - Focal must pay for its costs related to the merger, such as legal,
      accounting and financial advisory fees, even if the merger is not
      completed;

    - if Focal exercises in full its option to require Genzyme to purchase
      shares of Focal common stock under an existing stock purchase agreement,
      this may result in Genzyme owning a majority

      or near majority of the outstanding capital stock of Focal depending on
      the purchase price for those shares; and

    - Focal may be required to pay Genzyme a termination fee of up to $600,000.

    In addition, if the merger agreement is terminated and the Focal board of
directors determines to seek another merger or business combination, it is not
certain that it will be able to find a partner willing to pay an equivalent or
more attractive price than that which Genzyme would pay in the merger.

    THE TERMINATION FEE, THE RESTRICTIONS ON SOLICITATION CONTAINED IN THE
MERGER AGREEMENT, THE VOTING AGREEMENT AND THE EXISTING STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT
AND MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT WITH GENZYME MAY DISCOURAGE OTHER
COMPANIES FROM TRYING TO ACQUIRE FOCAL.

    Under the merger agreement, Focal is generally prohibited from entering into
or soliciting, initiating or encouraging any inquiries or proposals that may
lead to a proposal or offer for a merger or other business combination
transaction with any person other than Genzyme. Focal agreed to pay a
termination fee to Genzyme in specified circumstances, including where a third
party acquires or seeks to acquire Focal. Payment of the termination fee could
have an adverse effect on Focal's financial condition. In addition, Focal
entered into a stock purchase agreement with Genzyme in October 1999 pursuant to
which Genzyme purchased an aggregate of 3,851,806 shares of Focal common stock.
Focal has the option, exercisable at Focal's sole discretion, to sell to Genzyme
$5.0 million of additional shares of Focal common stock. If Focal exercises this
option in full, depending on the per share purchase price, Genzyme may own a
majority or a near majority of the outstanding capital stock of Focal. The stock
purchase agreement also provides Genzyme with specified negotiation rights in
the event of a proposed change of control of Focal and preemptive rights in
connection with future issuances of Focal capital stock. Furthermore, a group of
institutional stockholders of Focal beneficially owning an aggregate of
approximately 12.5% of the Focal common stock outstanding on the record date
have entered into a voting agreement with Genzyme whereby they have agreed to
vote their shares in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and against
any competing transaction. These agreements and Genzyme's large ownership
position in Focal could discourage other companies from trying to acquire Focal
even though those other companies might be willing to offer greater value to
Focal stockholders than Genzyme has offered in the merger agreement.

                      RISKS RELATING TO GENZYME BIOSURGERY

    In the merger, Genzyme will issue shares of Biosurgery Stock upon conversion
of the outstanding shares of Focal common stock. Biosurgery Stock is intended to
track the value and reflect the performance of Genzyme Biosurgery. Accordingly,
before voting on the merger, you should carefully consider the following factors
affecting the business of Genzyme Biosurgery.

    A FAILURE TO INCREASE SALES OF SYNVISC-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-
VISCOSUPPLEMENTATION PRODUCT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE PRICE OF
BIOSURGERY STOCK.

    Genzyme Biosurgery expects to generate a substantial portion of its product
revenues from sales of Synvisc-Registered Trademark- viscosupplementation
product, a treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee. Net product sales of
Synvisc-Registered Trademark- viscosupplementation product totaled $0.1 million
for the 13-day period beginning December 18, 2000 (date of Genzyme Biosurgery
inception) to December 31, 2000, representing approximately 0.08% of Genzyme
Biosurgery's total revenues for that year, and $16.0 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2001, representing approximately 30% of Genzyme
Biosurgery's total revenues for that period.

    Failure to achieve sales growth for Synvisc-Registered Trademark-
viscosupplementation product may cause the value of Biosurgery Stock to decline.
Revenues from Synvisc-Registered Trademark- viscosupplementation product could
be impacted

negatively if competitive treatments for osteoarthritis of the knee are deemed
more efficacious or cost effective. Some companies are developing competitive
products, and other companies may do so in the future.

    The commercial success of Synvisc-Registered Trademark- viscosupplementation
product also will depend on many other factors, including:

    - THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT.

       Many third-party payers in the United States and abroad cover
       Synvisc-Registered Trademark- viscosupplementation product. Genzyme
       Biosurgery will continue to discuss reimbursement for Synvisc-Registered
       Trademark-viscosupplementation product with European government agencies.
       Genzyme cannot guarantee that any third-party payers will continue to
       cover Synvisc-Registered Trademark- viscosupplementation product or that
       additional third-party payers will begin to provide reimbursement.

    - CONTINUED RELATIONS WITH MARKETING PARTNERS.

       Genzyme Biosurgery has entered into several distribution agreements for
       marketing and distributing Synvisc-Registered Trademark-
       viscosupplementation product. Genzyme Biosurgery has in the past and may
       in the future periodically reacquire distribution rights in some
       territories if partners cease to perform under agreements relating to
       these territories. Genzyme Biosurgery may not be able to maintain or
       replace these marketing partners. In this event, there may be disruptions
       in sales associated with restructuring Genzyme Biosurgery's distribution
       arrangements.

    The future commercial success of Synvisc-Registered Trademark-
viscosupplementation product, as well as the other marketed products allocated
to Genzyme Biosurgery, is highly uncertain. For additional details concerning
the risks associated with commercializing novel biotechnology products, you
should review the factors described below under "--Risks Related to Genzyme."

    THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF CARTICEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- CHONDROCYTES IS
UNCERTAIN.

    Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes cartilage repair service
involves a proprietary process for growing autologous chondrocytes (a patient's
own cartilage cells) to replace those that are damaged or lost. Net revenues
from Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes services totaled $18.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2000, representing approximately 13% of Genzyme
Biosurgery's total revenue for that year, and $4.3 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2001, representing 8% of Genzyme Biosurgery's total revenues for
that period. The commercial success of Carticel-Registered Trademark-
chondrocytes will depend on many factors, including the following:

    - POSITIVE RESULTS FROM POST-MARKETING STUDIES.

       If two ongoing post-marketing studies do not demonstrate that treatment
       with Carticel-Registered Trademark-chondrocytes is superior to the
       alternatives studied, the Food and Drug Administration, commonly referred
       to as the FDA, may suspend or withdraw its approval of
       Carticel-Registered Trademark-chondrocytes.

    - FDA APPROVAL OF RELATED DEVICE.

       Genzyme Biosurgery has developed a device to improve the procedure for
       implanting Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes and has filed for
       marketing approval with the FDA. Genzyme cannot guarantee that the FDA
       will approve this device, that this device will improve the procedure for
       implanting Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes, or that this
       device will gain commercial acceptance.

    - THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT.

       Since the FDA approved Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes,
       Genzyme has seen a substantial increase in the number of third-party
       payers who cover it. Some third-party payers, however, do not cover

       Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes. Genzyme cannot guarantee
       that any third-party payers will continue to cover it or that additional
       third-party payers will begin to provide reimbursement.

       Although FDA approval is a crucial factor in insurance plans deciding to
       cover new treatments, a number of major insurance plans also base such
       decisions on their own or third-party evaluations of treatments. One
       independent association that conducts evaluations is the Blue Cross Blue
       Shield Association. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's Technology
       Assessment Committee does not believe that Carticel-Registered Trademark-
       chondrocytes meets all of its published criteria for new treatments.
       Genzyme believes that Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes do in
       fact meet all of these criteria and is discussing the evaluation with the
       Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. While individual Blue Cross Blue
       Shield plans representing more than 50% of Blue Cross Blue Shield
       policyholders have provided policy coverage for Carticel-Registered
       Trademark- chondrocytes without a favorable evaluation by the Blue Cross
       Blue Shield Association, many Blue Cross Blue Shield plans have delayed
       approving Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes from coverage under
       their policies as a direct result of this unfavorable ruling. Since these
       remaining plans represent a significant percentage of insured lives in
       the United States, this ruling has restricted Genzyme's access to a
       substantial portion of the market for Carticel-Registered Trademark-
       chondrocytes.

    - THE SUCCESS OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS.

       The process that Genzyme Biosurgery uses to grow a patient's cartilage
       cells is not patentable, and it does not yet have significant patent
       protection covering the other processes used in providing
       Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes. Consequently, Genzyme cannot
       prevent a competitor from developing the ability to grow cartilage cells
       and from offering a product or service that is similar or superior to
       Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes. If a competitor were to
       develop such ability and obtain FDA approval for a competitive product or
       service, Genzyme Biosurgery's results of operations would be negatively
       impacted. Genzyme Biosurgery is aware of at least two other companies
       that are growing autologous cartilage cells for cartilage repair in the
       European market. Also, several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
       are developing alternative treatments for knee cartilage damage. One or
       more of these companies may develop products or services superior to the
       Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes.

    - MARKET ACCEPTANCE BY ORTHOPAEDIC SURGEONS.

       Genzyme is marketing Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes to
       orthopaedic surgeons. Genzyme cannot guarantee that it will train enough
       surgeons who incorporate Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes into
       their practice to make it commercially successful.

    - FLUCTUATING REVENUES DUE TO SEASONAL FACTORS.

       Genzyme expects that the revenues from the sale of the
       Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes will fluctuate based on
       Genzyme Biosurgery's success in penetrating the market, the availability
       of competitive procedures and the availability of third-party
       reimbursement. Genzyme cannot predict the timing or magnitude of these
       fluctuations. Furthermore, Genzyme expects that revenues from
       Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes will be lower in the summer
       months because fewer operations are typically performed during those
       months.

    - RELIANCE ON KEY COLLABORATORS.

       Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes were developed based on the
       work of a group of Swedish physicians. Individuals who are familiar with
       the know-how underlying Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes
       through their association with these physicians may disclose the
       information to Genzyme's competitors. This event could have an adverse
       effect on Genzyme Biosurgery's results of operations.

       Genzyme Biosurgery will have a sponsored research agreement with the
       University of Gothenburg in Sweden and certain physicians, including the
       two physicians who lead the

       group that developed Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes. The
       purpose of the agreement is to conduct additional research on
       Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes. The agreement will prohibit
       members of the research team from disclosing any information relating to
       Genzyme Biosurgery or its business that they acquire in connection with
       their work under the agreement. The agreement also will state that all
       inventions that the members conceive or reduce to practice during the
       course of the research program will be Genzyme Biosurgery's property,
       with royalties payable to the inventing member. Genzyme cannot guarantee
       that these members will honor their obligations under the sponsored
       research agreement.

    GENZYME BIOSURGERY WILL DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP NOVEL
PRODUCTS AND TREATMENTS THAT MAY NOT BE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL.

    Genzyme Biosurgery has devoted a significant amount of money to developing
products that will represent alternatives to traditional surgical procedures or
treatments. These products will likely require several years of aggressive and
costly marketing before they might become widely accepted by the surgical
community. Genzyme Biosurgery expects to develop products that are designed to
enable surgeons to perform minimally invasive cardiovascular surgery. The
medical conditions that can be treated with minimally invasive cardiovascular
surgery are currently being treated with widely accepted surgical procedures
such as coronary artery bypass grafting and catheter-based treatments, including
balloon angioplasty, atherectomy and coronary stenting. To date, minimally
invasive cardiovascular surgery has been performed on a limited basis and its
further adoption by the surgical community will partly depend on Genzyme
Biosurgery's ability to educate cardiothoracic surgeons about its effectiveness
and to facilitate the training of cardiothoracic surgeons in minimally invasive
cardiovascular surgery techniques.

    Similarly, until recently surgeons have not used products designed to reduce
the incidence and extent of postoperative adhesions. Since 1996, when
Seprafilm-TM- bioresorbable membrane was introduced, market acceptance of
anti-adhesion products has been slow. To increase sales of the Sepra-TM-
products, Genzyme Biosurgery has had to educate surgeons and hospital
administrators about the problems of, and costs associated with, adhesions and
the benefits of preventing adhesions. Genzyme Biosurgery also has had to, and
continues to have to, train surgeons on the proper handling and use of these
products.

    Genzyme cannot guarantee that Genzyme Biosurgery's continued efforts in
educating and training the surgical community will result in the widespread
adoption of minimally invasive cardiovascular surgery and anti-adhesion products
or that surgeons adopting these procedures and products will use Genzyme
Biosurgery's products.

    ADVERSE EVENTS IN THE FIELD OF GENE THERAPY MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT REGULATORY
APPROVAL OR PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF GENZYME BIOSURGERY'S GENE THERAPY PRODUCTS.

    The death of a patient undergoing gene therapy using an adenoviral vector to
deliver a therapeutic gene has been widely publicized. Although this patient was
not part of a Genzyme Biosurgery clinical trial, deaths and any other adverse
events in the field of gene therapy that may occur in the future may result in
greater governmental regulation and potential regulatory delays relating to the
testing or approval of Genzyme Biosurgery's gene therapy products. As a result
of the death, the U.S. Senate has conducted hearings to determine whether
additional legislation is required to protect volunteers and patients who
participate in gene therapy clinical trials. Additionally, the Recombinant DNA
Advisory Committee, which acts as an advisory body to the National Institutes of
Health (NIH), has extensively discussed the use of adenoviral vectors in gene
therapy clinical trials and recently issued a draft report on the safety of
adenoviral vectors. While this draft report recommends that clinical trials
using adenoviral vectors should continue with caution, it also suggested a
number of changes in the way gene

therapy clinical trials are conducted. If any new guidelines are adopted by the
NIH, Genzyme Biosurgery's gene therapy clinical trials could be delayed or
become more expensive to conduct.

    The commercial success of any gene therapy products that Genzyme Biosurgery
develops will depend in part on public acceptance of the use of gene therapies
for the prevention or treatment of human diseases. Public attitudes may be
influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe, and gene therapy may not gain
the acceptance of the public or the medical community. Negative public reaction
to gene therapy could result in:

    - greater government regulation;

    - stricter clinical trial oversight;

    - tighter commercial product labeling requirements of gene therapies; and

    - a decrease in the demand for any gene therapy product that Genzyme
      Biosurgery may develop.

    Recently, the NIH and FDA have issued proposed rules regarding the public
disclosure of information from gene therapy trials. If these rules become
regulation, additional public disclosure requirements may affect public
perception of gene therapies.

    BECAUSE GENZYME BIOSURGERY HAS SIGNIFICANT FIXED PAYMENTS, IT WILL NEED TO
DEVOTE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS CASH FLOW TO MAKE THE PAYMENTS AND MAY NEED
TO BORROW MONEY IN THE FUTURE TO MAKE DEBT PAYMENTS AND OPERATE ITS BUSINESS.

    As of March 31, 2001, Genzyme had allocated to Genzyme Biosurgery
approximately $218.0 million borrowed under a credit facility. Genzyme
Biosurgery will use a large part of its cash flow from operations to make
principal and interest payments on this debt. Genzyme is currently in
negotiations for the sale of its Synvisc-Registered Trademark-
viscosupplementation product manufacturing facility in Pointe-Claire, Canada and
its Snowden-Pencer-Registered Trademark- surgical instruments product lines
which are allocated to Genzyme Biosurgery. While the proposed sale of this
manufacturing facility and the Snowden-Pencer-Registered Trademark-product lines
will generate some cash proceeds, it will not be sufficient to meet all of
Genzyme Biosurgery's obligations. If Genzyme Biosurgery's cash flow from
operations is insufficient to meet its obligations, Genzyme may need to borrow
additional funds on behalf of Genzyme Biosurgery to make these payments. Genzyme
cannot guarantee that such additional financing will be available or available
on favorable terms.

    In addition to amounts borrowed under the credit facility, significant cash
obligations allocated to Genzyme Biosurgery include the following:

    - GENZYME GENERAL.

       In 1999, Genzyme Biosurgery received $25.0 million in cash from Genzyme
       General in connection with the transfer to Genzyme General of its
       interest in a joint venture with Diacrin, Inc. The joint venture has
       announced that it will not initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of
       NeuroCell-TM--PD by June 30, 2001. As a result, Genzyme General may, at
       its election after June 30, 2001, require Genzyme Biosurgery to repay
       Genzyme General $20.0 million of the $25.0 million Genzyme Biosurgery
       received from Genzyme General in connection with the transfer to Genzyme
       General of Genzyme Biosurgery's interest in the joint venture. This
       refund, together with accrued interest at 13.5% per year, will be due
       within 90 days of receipt of Genzyme General's notice of its election.
       This payment may be made in cash, Biosurgery designated shares, or a
       combination of both, at Genzyme Biosurgery's option. If Genzyme
       Biosurgery elects to repay Genzyme General in cash, Genzyme Biosurgery's
       cash reserves will be diminished. If Genzyme Biosurgery elects to repay
       Genzyme General in shares of Biosurgery Stock, this would dilute the
       rights of the holders of Biosurgery Stock and could adversely affect the
       market price of Biosurgery Stock.

    - UBS WARBURG LLC.

       In connection with Genzyme's acquisition of Biomatrix, a wholly-owned
       subsidiary of Genzyme assumed a 6.9% convertible subordinated note due
       May 14, 2003 in favor of UBS Warburg LLC. At March 31, 2001,
       $10.0 million of this note remained outstanding. Genzyme Biosurgery will
       use a part of its cash flow to satisfy debt service on this note. If all
       or a portion of the note is not converted at the option of the holder
       into Biosurgery Stock, at maturity Genzyme Biosurgery's cash reserves
       will be diminished by the amount necessary to repay the outstanding
       principal of the note.

    GENZYME BIOSURGERY ANTICIPATES FUTURE LOSSES AND MAY NEVER BECOME
PROFITABLE.

    Genzyme Biosurgery expects to have operating losses before amortization of
intangibles and goodwill through 2001 as it continues to spend substantial
amounts of money on, among other things, conducting research, development,
regulatory and commercialization activities to support its expanded product
lines. This strategy involves risks, which include supporting higher levels of
operating expenses, attracting and retaining employees, and dealing with other
management difficulties that arise from rapid growth. If Genzyme Biosurgery
cannot manage growth effectively, it may not become profitable.

    IF GENZYME BIOSURGERY FAILS TO OBTAIN CAPITAL NECESSARY TO FUND ITS
OPERATIONS, IT WILL BE UNABLE TO FUND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND COMPLETE CLINICAL
TRIALS.

    Genzyme anticipates that Genzyme Biosurgery's current cash resources,
together with revenues generated from products sales, will be sufficient to fund
its operations through at least 2001. Genzyme Biosurgery's cash needs may differ
from those planned because of many factors, including the:

    - results of research and development efforts;

    - ability to establish and maintain strategic alliances;

    - ability to enter into and maintain licensing arrangements and additional
      distribution arrangements;

    - ability to share costs of product development with research and marketing
      partners;

    - costs involved in enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property
      rights;

    - market acceptance of novel approaches and therapies;

    - success of its initiatives to reduce expenses and streamline its
      operations;

    - development of competitive products;

    - ability to satisfy regulatory requirements of the FDA and other
      governmental authorities; and

    - ability to sell its Snowden-Pencer-Registered Trademark- product lines and
      its manufacturing in Canada, as described below.

    In February 2001, Genzyme Biosurgery announced its intention to divest the
Snowden-Pencer-Registered Trademark-surgical instruments product lines. These
product lines include hand-held reusable instruments and endoscopic instruments
for general, plastic, gynecological and cardiovascular surgery. Genzyme
Biosurgery also announced in February its intention to terminate the production
of Synvisc-Registered Trademark-viscosupplementation product in Canada and to
sell its manufacturing facility in Ponte-Claire, Canada. Genzyme expects to
complete these transactions in the second half of 2001.

    Genzyme Biosurgery may require significant additional financing to continue
operations beyond 2001. Genzyme cannot guarantee that Genzyme Biosurgery will be
able to obtain any additional financing, extend any existing financing
arrangement, or accomplish either on terms that Genzyme considers favorable. If
Genzyme Biosurgery has insufficient funds or is unable to raise additional
funds, it may delay, scale back or eliminate some of its programs. Genzyme
Biosurgery may also have to give third parties rights to commercialize
technologies or products that it would otherwise have sought to commercialize
itself.

    CHANGES IN GENZYME BIOSURGERY'S MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES COULD
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE ITS ABILITY TO DELIVER ITS PRODUCTS.

    Genzyme Biosurgery is engaged in the production of a wide variety of
products and services. Genzyme Biosurgery's manufacturing processes are highly
complex and are regulated by the government. It is possible that Genzyme
Biosurgery will have problems maintaining or expanding its facilities in the
future. These problems could cause delays in production or delivery. Any
significant disruption in Genzyme Biosurgery's manufacturing operations or in
its ability to manufacture products cost effectively could have an adverse
effect on its business, results of operations, and financial condition.

    COMPETITION FROM OTHER MEDICAL PRODUCTS COMPANIES COULD HURT GENZYME
BIOSURGERY'S PERFORMANCE.

    The human health care products and services industry is extremely
competitive. Major medical device and technology companies compete or may
compete with Genzyme Biosurgery. These include such companies as:

    - Atrium Medical Corporation and Sherwood-Davis & Geck, a division of Tyco
      International, Ltd., in the cardiovascular and fluid management market;

    - Ethicon, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company, and U.S. Surgical Corporation,
      a division of Tyco, in the cardiovascular closure market;

    - CardioThoracic Systems, Inc., Medtronic, Inc., U.S. Surgical, Guidant
      Corporation, Baxter Healthcare Corporation and Ethicon in the minimally
      invasive cardiovascular surgery market;

    - Ethicon, Lifecore Biomedical, Inc., Life Medical Sciences, Inc. and
      Gliatech, Inc. in the anti-adhesion market;

    - Karl Storz and Padgett Instruments in the reusable plastic surgery
      instruments market;

    - V. Mueller, Pilling Weck Surgical Instruments, Colmer-Shurtleff and
      Scanlan International, Inc. in the reusable cardiovascular instruments
      market;

    - Karl Storz, Cabot Ciron Maxxim Corporation, Olympus and Pilling Weck
      Surgical Instruments in the reusable laporoscopic instruments market; and

    - Fidia S.p.A., Q-Meck AB, Sanofi and OrthoLogic Corp., Anika
      Therapeutics, Inc. and Zimmer, Inc., and Seikagiku Corporation and
      Smith & Nephew in the viscosupplementation products market.

    These competitors may have superior research and development, marketing and
production capabilities. Some competitors also may have greater financial
resources than Genzyme Biosurgery. The division is likely to incur significant
costs developing and marketing new products without any guarantee that they will
be competitively successful in one or more markets. The future success of
Genzyme Biosurgery will depend on its ability to effectively develop and market
its products against those of its competitors.

    THE TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION IN THE SURGICAL DEVICES INDUSTRY MAY
ADVERSELY AFFECT GENZYME BIOSURGERY'S ABILITY TO MARKET SUCCESSFULLY ITS
PRODUCTS TO SOME SIGNIFICANT PURCHASERS.

    The current trend among hospitals and other significant consumers of
surgical devices is to combine into larger purchasing groups to increase their
purchasing power and thus reduce their purchase price for surgical devices.
Partly in response to this development, surgical device manufacturers have been
consolidating to be able to offer more comprehensive product lines to these
larger purchasing groups. In order to market successfully its products to larger
purchasing groups, Genzyme Biosurgery may have to expand its product lines or
enter into joint marketing or distribution

agreements with other manufacturers of surgical devices. Genzyme Biosurgery
cannot guarantee that it will be able to employ either of these initiatives or
that, when employed, these initiatives will increase the marketability of its
products.

    BIOMATRIX FACES LITIGATION THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON
GENZYME BIOSURGERY'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

    Genzyme encourages you to read the material under "--Risks Related to
Genzyme--In connection with Genzyme's acquisition of Biomatrix, Genzyme assumed
litigation faced by Biomatrix." That material describes a securities lawsuit
filed against Biomatrix before Genzyme's acquisition of Biomatrix.

                           RISKS RELATING TO GENZYME

    The following risk factors relate to Genzyme generally and affect all of its
divisions, including Genzyme Biosurgery. Holders of Biosurgery Stock are
stockholders of Genzyme and are, therefore, subject to all of the risks and
uncertainties of Genzyme, not just Genzyme Biosurgery.

    Liabilities or contingencies of the divisions of Genzyme other than Genzyme
Biosurgery that affect Genzyme's resources or financial condition could affect
the financial condition or results of operations of Genzyme Biosurgery.
Therefore, you should consider carefully these risk factors before deciding how
to vote on the merger.

    A REDUCTION IN REVENUE FROM SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT TREAT GAUCHER DISEASE
WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON GENZYME'S BUSINESS.

    Genzyme generates a majority of its product revenue from sales of
enzyme-replacement products for patients with Gaucher disease. Genzyme entered
this market in 1991 with Ceredase-Registered Trademark- enzyme. Because
production of Ceredase-Registered Trademark- enzyme was subject to supply
constraints, Genzyme developed Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme, a
recombinant form of the enzyme. Recombinant technology uses specially engineered
cells to produce enzymes, or other substances, by inserting into the cells of
one organism the genetic material of a different species. In the case of
Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme, scientists engineer Chinese hamster ovary
cells to produce human alpha glucocerebrosidase. Genzyme stopped producing
Ceredase-Registered Trademark- enzyme, except for small quantities, during 1998,
after substantially all the patients who previously used Ceredase-Registered
Trademark- enzyme converted to Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme. Sales of
Ceredase-Registered Trademark- enzyme and Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme
totaled $536.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, representing
approximately 59% of Genzyme's consolidated revenues for that year, and
$139.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001, representing
approximately 50% of Genzyme consolidated revenues for that period.

    Because Genzyme business is highly dependent on Cerezyme-Registered
Trademark- enzyme, a decline in the growth rate of Cerezyme-Registered
Trademark- enzyme sales could have an adverse effect on Genzyme's operations and
may cause the value of its securities to decline substantially. Genzyme will
lose revenues from Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme if competitors develop
alternative treatments for Gaucher disease and these alternative products gain
commercial acceptance. Some companies have initiated efforts to develop
competitive products, and other companies may do so in the future. In addition,
the patient population with Gaucher disease is limited. Because a significant
percentage of that population already uses Cerezyme-Registered Trademark-
enzyme, opportunities for future sales growth are limited. Further, changes in
the methods for treating patients with Gaucher disease, including treatment
protocols that combine Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme with other
therapeutic products or reduce the amount of Cerezyme-Registered Trademark-
enzyme prescribed, could result in a decline in Cerezyme-Registered Trademark-
enzyme sales. Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme has orphan drug status,
providing Genzyme with exclusive marketing rights for Cerezyme-Registered
Trademark- enzyme in the United States until May 2001. Genzyme also has patents
protecting its method of manufacturing Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme
until 2010 and the composition of Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme until
2013. The expiration of market exclusivity and orphan drug status in

May 2001 will likely subject Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme to increased
competition which may decrease the amount of revenue Genzyme receives from this
product or the growth of that revenue.

    GENZYME'S ABILITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE SALES OF RENAGEL-REGISTERED
TRADEMARK- PHOSPHATE BINDER WILL SUBSTANTIALLY DETERMINE WHETHER AND HOW QUICKLY
ITS ACQUISITION OF GELTEX IMPROVES GENZYME'S FUTURE EARNINGS GROWTH.

    In November 1998, Genzyme launched, through a joint venture with GelTex
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Renagel-Registered Trademark- phosphate binder, a
non-absorbed phosphate binder approved for use by patients with end-stage renal
disease undergoing a form of treatment known as hemodialysis. Genzyme acquired
GelTex in December 2000. Genzyme is currently conducting additional clinical
trials in order to determine the efficacy and safety of Renagel-Registered
Trademark- phosphate binder when administered to pre-dialysis patients. The
commercial success of Renagel-Registered Trademark- phosphate binder is subject
to substantial uncertainty and will depend on a number of factors, including:

    - the results of additional clinical trials for additional indications and
      expanded labeling;

    - Genzyme's ability to increase market acceptance and sales of
      Renagel-Registered Trademark- phosphate binder;

    - market acceptance of a tablet formulation of Renagel-Registered Trademark-
      phosphate binder, which was launched in September 2000 in the United
      States;

    - optimal dosing and patient compliance with respect to Renagel-Registered
      Trademark- phosphate binder;

    - the availability of competing treatments serving the dialysis market;

    - the content and timing of Genzyme's submissions to and decisions by
      regulatory authorities;

    - Genzyme's ability to successfully retool and expand manufacturing systems;

    - Genzyme's ability to manufacture Renagel-Registered Trademark- phosphate
      binder at a reasonable price;

    - the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers, and the extent
      of coverage; and

    - the accuracy of available information about dialysis patient populations
      and the accuracy of Genzyme's expectations about growth in this
      population.

    GOVERNMENT REGULATION IMPOSES SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND RESTRICTIONS ON THE
DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF GENZYME'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

    Genzyme's success will depend on its ability to satisfy regulatory
requirements. Genzyme may not receive required regulatory approvals on a timely
basis or at all. Government agencies heavily regulate the production and sale of
healthcare products and the provision of healthcare services. In particular, the
FDA, and comparable agencies in foreign countries must approve human therapeutic
and diagnostic products before they are marketed. This approval process can
involve lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing, sampling
activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. This regulation may
delay the time at which a company like Genzyme can first sell a product or may
limit how a consumer may use a product or service or may adversely impact
third-party reimbursement. A company's failure to comply with applicable
regulatory approval requirements may lead regulatory authorities to take action
against the company, including:

    - issuing warning letters;

    - issuing fines and other civil penalties;

    - suspending regulatory approvals;

    - refusing approval of pending applications or supplements to approved
      applications;

    - suspending product sales in the United States and/or exports from the
      United States;

    - recalling products; and

    - seizing products.

    Furthermore, therapies that have received regulatory approval for commercial
sale may continue to face regulatory difficulties. The FDA and comparable
foreign regulatory agencies, for example, may require post-marketing clinical
trials or patient outcome studies. In addition, regulatory agencies subject a
marketed therapy, its manufacturer and the manufacturer's facilities to
continual review and periodic inspections. The discovery of previously unknown
problems with a therapy, the therapy's manufacturer or the facility used to
produce the therapy could prompt a regulatory authority to impose restrictions
on the therapy, manufacturer or facility, including withdrawal of the therapy
from the market.

    LEGISLATIVE CHANGES MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT GENZYME'S BUSINESS.

    The FDA has designated some of Genzyme's products, including
Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme, as orphan drugs under the Orphan Drug
Act. The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and
market drugs for rare diseases, generally by entitling the first developer that
receives FDA marketing approval for an orphan drug to a seven-year exclusive
marketing period in the United States for that product. In recent years Congress
has considered legislation to change the Orphan Drug Act to shorten the period
of automatic market exclusivity and to grant marketing rights to simultaneous
developers of the drug. If the Orphan Drug Act is amended in this manner, any
drugs for which Genzyme has been granted exclusive marketing rights under the
Orphan Drug Act, will face increased competition which may decrease the amount
of revenue Genzyme receives from these products. In addition, the U.S.
government has shown significant interest in pursuing healthcare reform. Any
government-adopted reform measures could adversely affect:

    - the pricing of therapeutic products and medical devices in the United
      States or internationally; and

    - the amount of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or other
      third-party payers.

If the U.S. government significantly reduces the amount Genzyme may charge for
its products, or the amount of reimbursement available for purchases of its
products declines, Genzyme's future revenues may decline and Genzyme may need to
revise its research and development programs.

    THE DEVELOPMENT OF GENZYME'S PRODUCTS INVOLVES A LENGTHY AND COMPLEX
PROCESS, AND GENZYME MAY BE UNABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE ANY OF THE PRODUCTS IT IS
CURRENTLY DEVELOPING.

    Before Genzyme can commercialize its development-stage products, it will
need to:

    - conduct substantial research and development;

    - undertake preclinical and clinical testing; and

    - pursue regulatory approvals.

    This process involves a high degree of risk and takes several years.
Genzyme's product development efforts may fail for many reasons, including:

    - failure of the product in preclinical studies;

    - clinical trial data that is insufficient to support the safety or
      effectiveness of the product; or

    - Genzyme's failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals.

    For these reasons, and others, Genzyme may not successfully commercialize
any of the products it is currently developing.

    ANY MARKETABLE PRODUCTS THAT GENZYME DEVELOPS MAY NOT BE COMMERCIALLY
SUCCESSFUL.

    Even if Genzyme obtains regulatory approval for any of its development-stage
products, those products may not be accepted by the market, or approved for
reimbursement by third-party payers. A number of factors may affect the rate and
level of market acceptance of these products, including:

    - regulation by the FDA and other government authorities;

    - market acceptance by doctors and hospital administrators;

    - the effectiveness of Genzyme's sales force;

    - the effectiveness of Genzyme's production and marketing capabilities;

    - the success of competitive products; and

    - the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers.

    If Genzyme's products fail to achieve market acceptance, its profitability
and financial condition will suffer.

    GENZYME MAY REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH MAY NOT BE
AVAILABLE ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL.

    As of March 31, 2001, Genzyme had approximately $619.6 million in cash, cash
equivalents and short- and long-term investments, excluding investments in
equity securities. Genzyme intends to use substantial portions of its available
cash for:

    - product development and marketing;

    - expanding facilities and staff;

    - working capital; and

    - strategic business initiatives.

    In January 2001, Genzyme purchased all of the outstanding Class A limited
partnership interests of Genzyme Development Partners, L.P. for an advance
payment of approximately $25.7 million in cash plus royalties for ten years on
sales of some Sepra-TM- products.

    In addition, Genzyme expects to pay approximately $65.0 million in cash to
stockholders of Wyntek and holders of rights to acquire Wyntek common stock in
connection with its acquisition of that company:

    Genzyme may further reduce available cash reserves to pay principal and
interest on the following debt:

    - $368.0 million in principal under Genzyme's revolving credit facility with
      a syndicate of commercial banks, $218.0 million of which is allocated to
      Genzyme Biosurgery and $150.0 million of which is allocated to Genzyme
      General.

    - $249.5 million in outstanding principal under Genzyme's 5 1/4% convertible
      subordinated notes, the entire amount of which is allocated to Genzyme
      General. These notes mature in June 2005 and are convertible into shares
      of Genzyme General Stock, Biosurgery Stock and Molecular Oncology Stock.
      On May 1, 2001, Genzyme sent a notice to the trustee under the indenture
      for these notes indicating Genzyme's intention to redeem any notes that
      remain unconverted at June 15, 2001.

    - $21.2 million in principal under Genzyme's 5% convertible subordinated
      debentures due August 2003, the entire amount of which is allocated to
      Genzyme General. These debentures are convertible into shares of Genzyme
      General Stock.

    - $10.0 million in principal under Genzyme's 6.9% convertible subordinated
      note in favor of UBS Warburg LLC, the entire amount of which is allocated
      to Genzyme Biosurgery. This note matures in May 2003 and is convertible
      into shares of Biosurgery Stock.

    - $575.0 million in principal under Genzyme's 3% convertible subordinated
      debentures, the entire amount of which is allocated to Genzyme General.
      These debentures mature on May 15, 2021, are first callable on May 20,
      2004 and are convertible into shares of Genzyme General Stock. The holders
      of these debentures may require Genzyme to purchase all or part of their
      debentures for cash on May 15, 2006, May 15, 2011 or May 15, 2016 at a
      price equal to the principal amount plus accrued interest.

    If Genzyme uses cash to pay or redeem all or a portion of this debt,
including the principal and interest due on it, its cash reserves will be
diminished. To satisfy these and other commitments, Genzyme will have to obtain
additional financing. Genzyme may be unable to obtain any additional financing,
extend any existing financing arrangement, or obtain either on terms that it
considers favorable.

    GENZYME MAY FAIL TO PROTECT ADEQUATELY ITS PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY, WHICH
WOULD ALLOW COMPETITORS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GENZYME'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
EFFORTS.

    Genzyme's long-term success largely depends on its ability to market
technologically competitive products. If Genzyme fails to obtain or maintain
these protections, it may not be able to prevent third parties from using its
proprietary rights. Genzyme's currently pending or future patent applications
may not result in issued patents. In the United States, patent applications are
confidential until patents issue, and because third parties may have filed
patent applications for technology covered by Genzyme's pending patent
applications without it being aware of those applications, its patent
applications may not have priority over any patent applications of others. In
addition, Genzyme's issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to
protect it against third parties with similar technologies or products or
provide it with any competitive advantage. If a third party initiates litigation
regarding Genzyme's patents, its collaborators' patents, or those patents for
which Genzyme has license rights, and is successful, a court could revoke
Genzyme's patents or limit the scope of coverage for those patents.

    The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, commonly referred to as the USPTO, and
the courts have not consistently treated the breadth of claims allowed in
biotechnology patents. If the USPTO or the courts begin to allow broader claims,
the incidence and cost of patent interference proceedings and the risk of
infringement litigation will likely increase. On the other hand, if the USPTO or
the courts begin to allow narrower claims, the value of Genzyme's proprietary
rights may be limited. Any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, the
patent laws may adversely affect Genzyme's ability to enforce its patent
position.

    Genzyme also relies upon trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing
technological innovation to remain competitive. Genzyme protects this
information with reasonable security measures, including the use of
confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants and corporate
collaborators. It is possible that these individuals will breach these
agreements and that any remedies for a breach will be insufficient to allow
Genzyme to recover its costs. Furthermore, Genzyme's trade secrets, know-how and
other technology may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by
Genzyme's competitors.

    GENZYME MAY BE REQUIRED TO LICENSE TECHNOLOGY FROM COMPETITORS IN ORDER TO
DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE SOME OF ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND IT IS UNCERTAIN
WHETHER THESE LICENSES WILL BE AVAILABLE.

    Third-party patent rights may cover some of the products that Genzyme or its
strategic partners are developing or testing. As a result, Genzyme or its
strategic collaborators may be required to obtain

licenses from the holders of these patents in order to use, manufacture or sell
these products and services, and payments under these licenses may reduce
Genzyme's revenue from these products. Furthermore, Genzyme may not be able to
obtain these licenses on acceptable terms or at all. If Genzyme fails to obtain
a required license or is unable to alter the design of its technology to fall
outside of a patent, Genzyme may be unable to effectively market some of its
technology and services, which could limit its profitability.

    GENZYME MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AS A RESULT OF LITIGATION OR OTHER
PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO PATENT AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

    A third party may sue Genzyme or one of its strategic collaborators for
infringing the third-party's patent rights. Likewise, Genzyme or one of its
strategic collaborators may need to resort to litigation to enforce patent
rights or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights.
For example, Genzyme filed a lawsuit on July 25, 2000 seeking injunctive relief
and damages against Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc. in the U.S. District Court in
Wilmington, Delaware for patent infringement resulting from Transkaryotic
Therapies' manufacture and use of Replagal-TM-, its replacement therapy for
Fabry disease. The suit alleges infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,356,804, which
Genzyme exclusively licensed from Mount Sinai School of Medicine. The patent is
directed to methods of making alpha-galactosidase in mammalian cells, as well as
the genetically-engineered cells themselves. On September 19, 2000,
Transkaryotic Therapies filed a lawsuit against Genzyme and Mount Sinai School
of Medicine in U.S. District Court in Boston, Massachusetts seeking declaratory
judgments that the manufacture, use and sale of Replagal-TM- does not infringe
the patent licensed by Genzyme from Mount Sinai and that the Mount Sinai patent
is invalid. While the declaratory judgment action filed by Transkaryotic
Therapies has been dismissed without prejudice, Genzyme will continue the
parallel case pending in the U.S. District Court in Delaware.

    The cost to Genzyme of any litigation or other proceeding relating to
intellectual property rights, even if resolved in Genzyme's favor, could be
substantial, and the litigation would divert its management's efforts. Some of
Genzyme's competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent
litigation more effectively than Genzyme can because they have substantially
greater resources. If Genzyme does not prevail in this type of litigation,
Genzyme or its strategic collaborators may be required to:

    - pay monetary damages;

    - stop commercial activities relating to the affected products or services;

    - obtain a license in order to continue manufacturing or marketing the
      affected products or services; or

    - compete in the market with a substantially similar product.

    Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any
litigation could limit Genzyme's ability to continue some of its operations. In
addition, a court may require that Genzyme pay expenses or damages and
litigation could disrupt Genzyme's commercial activities.

    GENZYME MAY BE LIABLE FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE.

    Individuals who use Genzyme's products or services, including those it
acquires in business combinations, may bring product liability claims against
Genzyme or its subsidiaries. While Genzyme has taken, and continues to take,
what it believes are appropriate precautions, Genzyme may be unable to avoid
significant liability exposure. Genzyme has only limited amounts of product
liability insurance, which may not provide sufficient coverage against any
product liability claims. Genzyme may be unable to obtain additional insurance
in the future, or it may be unable to do so on acceptable terms. Any additional
insurance Genzyme does obtain may not provide adequate coverage against any
asserted claims. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product
liability claims may result in:

    - diversion of management's time and attention;

    - expenditure of large amounts of cash on legal fees, expenses and payment
      of damages;

    - decreased demand for Genzyme's products and services; and

    - injury to Genzyme's reputation.

    IN CONNECTION WITH GENZYME'S ACQUISITION OF BIOMATRIX, GENZYME ASSUMED
LITIGATION FACED BY BIOMATRIX.

    On July 21 and August 7, 15, and 30, 2000, class action lawsuits requesting
unspecified damages were filed in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey against
Biomatrix, Inc. and two of its officers and directors, Endre A. Balazs and Rory
B. Riggs. In these actions, the plaintiffs seek to certify a class of all
persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Biomatrix common stock
during the period between July 20, 1999 and April 25, 2000. The plaintiffs
allege, among other things, that the defendants failed to accurately disclose
information relating to Biomatrix' product Synvisc-Registered Trademark- during
the period between July 20, 1999 and April 25, 2000, and assert causes of action
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5
promulgated under that statute. Genzyme acquired Biomatrix in December 2000.
Genzyme intends to vigorously defend against those actions. Genzyme may be
required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs to the extent that
damages or settlement costs are not covered by insurance. Regardless of their
outcome, these actions may cause a diversion of management's time and attention.

    GENZYME'S COMPETITORS IN THE BIOTECHNOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES MAY
HAVE SUPERIOR PRODUCTS, MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES OR MARKETING POSITION.

    The human healthcare products and services industry is extremely
competitive. Genzyme's competitors include major pharmaceutical companies and
other biotechnology companies. Some of these competitors may have more extensive
research and development, marketing and production capabilities. Some
competitors also may have greater financial resources than Genzyme. Genzyme's
future success will depend on its ability to develop and market effectively its
products against those of its competitors. For instance, Genzyme is seeking
orphan drug designation for some of its products that are still in development
or are currently being reviewed by the FDA for marketing approval, including
Fabrazyme-TM- enzyme for the treatment of Fabry disease. Genzyme is aware of
other companies developing products for the treatment of Fabry disease.
Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc., for example, submitted its application for
marketing approval for its product to the FDA approximately one week before
Genzyme submitted its application for Fabrazyme-TM- enzyme. If Transkaryotic
Therapies or any other company receives FDA approval for a Fabry disease therapy
with orphan drug designation before Genzyme receives FDA approval for
Fabrazyme-TM- enzyme, the Orphan Drug Act may preclude Genzyme from selling
Fabrazyme-TM- enzyme in the United States for up to seven years. Similarly,
Genzyme submitted an application for marketing approval of Fabrazyme-TM- enzyme
with the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, or EMEA, within a short time of
Transkaryotic Therapies' filing. If Transkaryotic Therapies or any other company
receives EMEA approval for a Fabry disease therapy

with orphan drug designation before Genzyme receives EMEA approval for
Fabrazyme-TM- enzyme, the European equivalent of the Orphan Drug Act may
preclude Genzyme from selling Fabrazyme-TM- enzyme in the European Union for up
to ten years. If Genzyme's products receive marketing approval but cannot
compete effectively in the marketplace, Genzyme's profitability and financial
position will suffer.

    IF GENZYME IS UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, ITS
PRODUCTS OR SERVICES MAY BECOME OBSOLETE.

    The field of biotechnology is characterized by significant and rapid
technological change. Although Genzyme attempts to expand its technological
capabilities in order to remain competitive, research and discoveries by others
may make its products or services obsolete. For example, some of Genzyme's
competitors may develop a product to treat Gaucher disease that is more
effective or less expensive than Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme. If
Genzyme cannot compete effectively in the marketplace, its profitability and
financial position will suffer.

    IF GENZYME FAILS TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE LEVELS OF REIMBURSEMENT FOR ITS PRODUCTS
FROM THIRD-PARTY PAYERS, THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF GENZYME'S PRODUCTS WILL BE
SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITED.

    A substantial portion of Genzyme's revenue comes from payments by
third-party payers, including government health administration authorities and
private health insurers. As a result of the trend toward managed healthcare in
the United States, as well as legislative proposals to reduce payments under
government insurance programs, third-party payers are increasingly attempting to
contain healthcare costs by:

    - challenging the prices charged for healthcare products and services;

    - limiting both coverage and the amount of reimbursement for new therapeutic
      products;

    - denying or limiting coverage for products that are approved by the FDA,
      but are considered experimental or investigational by third-party payers;
      and

    - refusing in some cases to provide coverage when an approved product is
      used for disease indications in a way that has not received FDA marketing
      approval.

    Government and other third-party payers may not provide adequate insurance
coverage or reimbursement for Genzyme's products and services, which could
impair its financial results. In addition, third-party payers may not reimburse
patients for newly approved healthcare products, which could decrease demand for
Genzyme's products. Furthermore, Congress occasionally has discussed
implementing broad-based measures to contain healthcare costs. It is possible
that Congress will enact legislation specifically designed to contain healthcare
costs. If third-party reimbursement is inadequate to allow Genzyme to recover
its costs or if Congress passes legislation to contain healthcare costs,
Genzyme's profitability and financial condition will suffer.

    CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, LEGAL AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS IN THE
FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH GENZYME DOES BUSINESS COULD CAUSE ITS INTERNATIONAL
SALES AND OPERATIONS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF GENZYME'S
CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, TO BE LIMITED OR DISRUPTED.

    Genzyme's international operations accounted for 39% of its consolidated
revenues for both the year ended December 31, 2000 and for the three months
ended March 31, 2001. Genzyme expects that international sales will continue to
account for a significant percentage of its revenues for the foreseeable future.
In addition, Genzyme has direct investments in a number of subsidiaries outside
of the United States, primarily in Europe and Japan. Genzyme's international
sales and operations could

be limited or disrupted, and the value of Genzyme's direct investments may be
diminished, by any of the following:

    - fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

    - the imposition of governmental controls;

    - less favorable intellectual property or other applicable laws;

    - the inability to obtain any necessary foreign regulatory approvals of
      products in a timely manner;

    - import and export license requirements;

    - political instability;

    - trade restrictions;

    - changes in tariffs;

    - difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and

    - longer payment cycles.

    A significant portion of Genzyme's business is conducted in currencies other
than its reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. Genzyme recognizes foreign
currency gains or losses arising from its operations in the period in which it
incurs those gains or losses. As a result, currency fluctuations among the U.S.
dollar and the currencies in which Genzyme does business have caused foreign
currency transaction gains and losses in the past and will likely do so in the
future. Because of the number of currencies involved, the variability of
currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates,
Genzyme may suffer significant foreign currency transaction losses in the future
due to the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on its future operating results.

    SEVERAL ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS MAY DEPRIVE GENZYME'S STOCKHOLDERS OF THE
OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE A PREMIUM FOR THEIR SHARES UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL.

    Provisions of Massachusetts law and Genzyme's charter, by-laws and
shareholder rights plan could delay or prevent a change in control of Genzyme or
a change in its management. Genzyme's tracking stock structure may also deprive
Genzyme stockholders of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares
upon a change in control because, in order to obtain control of a particular
division, an acquiror would have to obtain control of the entire corporation. In
addition, Genzyme's board of directors may, in its sole discretion:

    - exchange shares of Molecular Oncology Stock or Biosurgery Stock for
      Genzyme General Stock at a 30% premium over the market value of the
      exchanged shares; and

    - issue shares of undesignated preferred stock from time to time in one or
      more series.

    Either of these board actions could increase the cost of an acquisition of
Genzyme and thus discourage a takeover attempt.

                   RISKS RELATING TO GENZYME TRACKING STOCKS

    The following are risks related to owning shares of Genzyme tracking stock.
You should consider carefully these risk factors before deciding how to vote on
the merger.

    HOLDERS OF GENZYME TRACKING STOCK ARE STOCKHOLDERS OF A SINGLE COMPANY AND
UNFAVORABLE FINANCIAL TRENDS AFFECTING ONE DIVISION COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE
OTHER DIVISIONS.

    Genzyme's divisions are not separate legal entities. Holders of Genzyme
tracking stock are stockholders of a single company and face all of the risks of
an investment in Genzyme.

    For purposes of financial presentation, Genzyme will allocate programs,
products, assets and liabilities among its three divisions. Genzyme Corporation
and its subsidiaries, however, own all of the assets and are responsible for all
of the liabilities of each division. A holder of Biosurgery Stock, for example,
does not have any specific rights to the assets allocated to Genzyme Biosurgery
in Genzyme's financial statements. Furthermore, if Genzyme is unable to satisfy
one division's liabilities out of the assets it allocates to that division,
Genzyme may be required to satisfy those liabilities with assets it has
allocated to another division.

    GENZYME'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY TAKE ACTIONS THAT HAVE AN UNEQUAL AND
ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE HOLDERS OF ONE OR MORE SERIES OF GENZYME TRACKING STOCK.

    At times the interests of the holders of the different series of Genzyme
tracking stock may diverge or appear to diverge from each other. Genzyme is not
aware of any legal precedent interpreting the fiduciary duties of the directors
of a Massachusetts corporation in that situation. Recent cases in Delaware have
established that a Delaware court will afford considerable deference to business
decisions that are made in good faith by a disinterested and adequately informed
board of directors even when those decisions involve disparate treatment of
different series of tracking stock. These Delaware cases rely upon the premise
that the board of directors owes its fiduciary duties to the corporation and all
of its stockholders and does not owe separate duties to each class or series of
stockholders. If a Massachusetts court were to follow the reasoning in these
Delaware cases, a Genzyme stockholder may not be able to successfully challenge
an action by Genzyme's board of directors that has a disadvantageous effect on a
particular series of Genzyme tracking stock.

    MEMBERS OF GENZYME'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY FAVOR ONE SERIES OF TRACKING
STOCK OVER ANOTHER IF THEY OWN A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF THAT SERIES.

    A member of Genzyme's board may own a disproportionate amount of tracking
stock in a particular series, or the value of his or her holdings of a
particular series of stock may be different from the value of his or her
holdings in another series. This disparate stock ownership could cause the board
member to favor one series of stock over another. Nevertheless, Genzyme believes
that a member of its board could properly perform his or her fiduciary
responsibilities to all of Genzyme stockholders even if his or her interests in
shares of different series were disproportionate or of unequal values. Genzyme's
board members may create committees to review matters that raise
conflict-of-interest issues. If a committee is formed, it would report to the
full board.

    HOLDERS OF GENZYME TRACKING STOCK HAVE LIMITED DECISION-MAKING POWER BECAUSE
THEY HAVE LIMITED SEPARATE VOTING RIGHTS.

    Holders of all series of Genzyme tracking stock vote together as a single
class on all matters requiring common stockholder approval, including the
election of directors. Holders of one series of tracking stock do not have the
right to vote on matters separately from the other series except in limited
circumstances. These circumstances are dictated by Massachusetts law, Genzyme's
charter and its management and accounting policies. Therefore, stockholders of
one series of tracking stock generally could not make a proposal that would
require approval only of the holders of that series. Instead, they would have to
obtain approval from all common stockholders.

    As of April 30, 2001, the relative voting power of Genzyme's tracking stocks
was as follows:

                                                                 APPROXIMATE
                                                                 PERCENTAGE
SERIES                                                      OF TOTAL VOTING POWER
- ------                                                      ---------------------

Genzyme General Stock.....................................           93%
Biosurgery Stock..........................................            5%
Molecular Oncology Stock..................................            2%

    THE VOTES PER SHARE OF GENZYME'S TRACKING STOCKS ARE ADJUSTED EVERY TWO
YEARS.

    Under Genzyme's charter, Genzyme General Stock is entitled to one vote per
share, which is never adjusted. However, the votes per share of Genzyme's other
tracking stocks are adjusted every two years. Specifically, on January 1, 2003
and every second anniversary thereafter, the vote per share to which each
tracking stock is entitled will be recalculated based on its fair market value
divided by the fair market value of a share of Genzyme General Stock, with "fair
market value" meaning the average closing price over the 20 consecutive trading
days beginning the 30th trading day preceding the January 1st adjustment date.
At the time of an adjustment, the per share voting power of any tracking stock
relative to the other series of tracking stock could decrease materially.
Additionally, during the intervening period between adjustments, the per share
voting power of each tracking stock will remain the same even though its market
price will fluctuate relative to--and could become materially greater than--the
market prices of the other tracking stocks. Currently, Biosurgery Stock is
entitled to 0.14 vote per share and Molecular Oncology Stock is entitled to 0.14
vote per share.

    THE LIQUIDATION RIGHTS FOR GENZYME'S TRACKING STOCKS ARE NOT ADJUSTED TO
REFLECT CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUES.

    If Genzyme were to dissolve, liquidate or wind up its affairs, other than as
part of a merger, business combination or sale of substantially all of its
assets, Genzyme stockholders would receive any remaining assets according to the
percentage of total liquidation units that they hold. The number of liquidation
units per share for each series of Genzyme tracking stock outstanding is as
follows:

    - each share of Genzyme General Stock has 100 liquidation units;

    - each share of Biosurgery Stock has 50 liquidation units; and

    - each share of Molecular Oncology Stock has 25 liquidation units.

    Although Genzyme adjusts liquidation units to prevent dilution in the event
of some subdivisions, combinations or distributions of common stock, Genzyme
does not adjust them to reflect changes in the relative market value or
performance of the divisions. Therefore, at the time of a dissolution,
liquidation or winding up, the relative liquidation units attributable to each
series of tracking stock may not correspond to the value of the underlying
assets allocated to that division.

    GENZYME'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY CHANGE ITS MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING
POLICIES TO THE DETRIMENT OF ONE SERIES OF TRACKING STOCK WITHOUT STOCKHOLDER
APPROVAL.

    Genzyme's board of directors has adopted management and accounting policies
that are used to govern its business and to prepare Genzyme's financial
statements. These policies cover the allocation of corporate expenses, assets
and liabilities and other accounting matters, and the reallocation of assets
between divisions and other matters. Genzyme's board generally may modify or
rescind these policies or adopt new ones without stockholder approval. Any
revised policies could have different effects on each series of Genzyme tracking
stock and could be detrimental to one series as compared to another. The
discretion of Genzyme's board to make changes is limited only by the policies
themselves and the board's fiduciary duty to all of its stockholders. Genzyme
encourages you to review the full text of its

management and accounting policies, a copy of which is attached as Annex C to
this proxy statement/ prospectus.

    GENZYME'S BOARD CAN REQUIRE INVESTORS TO EXCHANGE THEIR SHARES OF GENZYME
TRACKING STOCK.

    Genzyme's board of directors may at any time, in its sole discretion, decide
to exchange shares of Molecular Oncology Stock and/or Biosurgery Stock, for any
combination of cash and shares of Genzyme General Stock at a 30% premium over
the exchanged stock's then current market value. At any time that all of a
division's assets are held through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Genzyme's board
can choose to "spin off" that division by exchanging the outstanding shares of
tracking stock corresponding to that division for shares in the spun off
company, whereupon former tracking stockholders will no longer be Genzyme
stockholders.

    If Genzyme transfers or sells to a third party all or substantially all of
the assets allocated to Genzyme Molecular Oncology or Genzyme Biosurgery, the
board would have to either redeem, make a dividend payment on or exchange
outstanding Molecular Oncology or Biosurgery Stock, as applicable. Genzyme's
board will have sole discretion in deciding whether to effect that redemption,
dividend payment or exchange using Genzyme General Stock or any combination of
cash or other property regardless of the form of consideration paid by the
buyer. However, Genzyme's charter will require that any exchange for Genzyme
General Stock be at a 10% premium to the exchanged series' average market price
following public announcement of the sale and that any payment of cash or other
property be equal in value to the sale's after-tax net proceeds.

    Also, Genzyme's board can exchange shares of Molecular Oncology Stock and/or
Biosurgery Stock into Genzyme General Stock at no premium to the exchanged
stocks' market value in the event of certain adverse tax developments, as
discussed in the immediately following risk factor.

    GENZYME MAY ELIMINATE TRACKING STOCK IF A CORPORATE OR SHAREHOLDER LEVEL TAX
IS IMPOSED ON THE ISSUANCE OR RECEIPT OF TRACKING STOCK.

    In 1999, the Clinton Administration proposed tax legislation that would have
imposed a corporate level tax on issuances of tracking stock. In 2000, the
Clinton Administration proposed legislation that would tax stockholders upon the
receipt of tracking stock from the issuing corporation as a distribution with
respect to its stock or in an exchange of tracking stock for other stock in the
corporation. Congress did not enact either of these proposals into law. If
similar proposals are enacted into law or effected through Treasury Department
regulations, Genzyme could be taxed on an amount up to the gain realized in
future financings in which Genzyme sells tracking stock, including Biosurgery
Stock. Also, any use of Genzyme tracking stock to acquire other companies could
result in a tax on Genzyme, the stockholders of the target company, or both.
Genzyme also may be taxed if it distributes to stockholders "designated" shares
of tracking stock, which are shares designated by the tracked division as
issuable at the option of Genzyme's board for the benefit of Genzyme General. In
addition, stockholders could be taxed if they receive a distribution of
designated shares of tracking stock or if they receive shares of tracking stock
in exchange for other Genzyme stock. These or similarly adverse tax consequences
could cause Genzyme to eliminate tracking stock from its capital structure.
Genzyme cannot predict, however, whether Congress will enact legislation, or
whether the Treasury Department will issue regulations effecting these or
similar proposals.

    GENZYME CANNOT ASSURE THAT TRACKING STOCK WILL "TRACK" THE PERFORMANCE OF
THE CORRESPONDING DIVISION.

    Although Genzyme has attempted to design its tracking stocks to "track" the
performance of their corresponding divisions, Genzyme cannot assure that the
market prices of these stocks will indeed reflect that performance. The market
may assign values to a tracking stock that are based on factors other than a
corresponding division's reported financial performance. For instance, Genzyme
cannot be

certain what, if any, valuation the market might place on the mandatory and
optional exchange features or the differing voting rights and liquidation units
of the tracking stocks. In addition, as discussed above under the subheading
"--Holders of Genzyme tracking stock are stockholders of a single company and
unfavorable financial trends affecting one division could negatively affect the
other divisions," financial developments in one division, particularly if
significant and/or adverse, may affect other divisions.

    THE USE OF OPERATING LOSSES AT UNPROFITABLE DIVISIONS TO LOWER THE REPORTED
TAX LIABILITY OF GENZYME'S PROFITABLE DIVISIONS WILL CAUSE THE UNPROFITABLE
DIVISIONS TO REPORT LOWER EARNINGS IN THE FUTURE.

    Genzyme Corporation, rather than Genzyme's divisions, is liable for taxes.
Under Genzyme's management and accounting policies, for financial reporting
purposes Genzyme generally allocate taxes among its divisions as if they were
separate taxpayers. However, Genzyme's board of directors has adopted a policy
that provides that if any of Genzyme's divisions is unable to use its operating
losses or other projected annual tax benefits to reduce its current or deferred
income tax expense, Genzyme may reallocate these losses or benefits to its
profitable divisions on a quarterly basis for financial reporting purposes. This
will result in a division with current losses (such as Genzyme Molecular
Oncology and Genzyme Biosurgery) reporting lower earnings available to its
common stockholders in the future than would be the case if that division had
retained its historical losses or other benefits in the form of a net operating
loss carry forward.

    THE NON-COMPETE POLICY AMONG GENZYME'S DIVISIONS MAY NOT COVER ALL OF THE
ACTIVITIES OF A PARTICULAR DIVISION.

    Genzyme's board of directors has adopted a policy regarding competition
among Genzyme's divisions. This non-compete policy requires that Genzyme develop
certain products and services within a given division, as opposed to another
division, or through joint ventures involving a given division, because the
product or service is within the field of activity of that division. This
non-compete policy, however, does not cover the entire field of activity of each
division. Genzyme cannot guarantee that all products and services Genzyme
develops in a given field of activity will be allocated to a division primarily
engaged in that field of activity.

                   NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

    This proxy statement/prospectus contains forward-looking statements about
Genzyme's and Focal's financial condition, results of operations, business
strategies, operating efficiencies, competitive positions, growth opportunities
for existing products, future success of development-stage products, plans and
objectives of management, the expected impact of the merger and other matters.
Words such as "estimates," "projects," "plans," "intends," "expects,"
"believes," "anticipates," "should," "may," "will" and similar expressions are
intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
statements are found at various places throughout this proxy
statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference. These
forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve
a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These risks
and uncertainties include:

    - the possibility that the merger will not be consummated;

    - the possibility that the anticipated benefits from the transaction will
      not be fully realized;

    - the possibility that costs or difficulties related to the integration of
      Focal's and Genzyme's businesses will be greater than expected; and

    - other risk factors included from time to time in Focal and Genzyme's
      public announcements and filings with the SEC.

    Forward-looking statements, therefore, should be considered in light of all
of the information included or referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus,
including the information set forth under the heading "RISK FACTORS" beginning
on page   .

    You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus.

               UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

    The following unaudited pro forma combined financial information describes
the pro forma effect of Genzyme's transaction with Focal and Genzyme's
transaction with Wyntek on the

    - unaudited statements of operations for the three months ended March 31,
      2001 and the year ended December 31, 2000; and

    - unaudited balance sheet as of March 31, 2001.

of both Genzyme and Genzyme Biosurgery, the division of Genzyme to which the
assets and liabilities and operations of Focal will be allocated.

    The following unaudited pro forma combined financial information also
describes the pro forma effect of Genzyme's acquisition of GelTex
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Biomatrix on the unaudited statement of operations for
the year ended December 31, 2000 of both Genzyme and Genzyme Biosurgery, the
division of Genzyme to which the assets and liabilities and operations of
Biomatrix were allocated, as if these mergers took place on January 1, 2000. In
addition, the Genzyme pro forma statement of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2000 reflects the change in earnings allocations resulting from the
creation of Biosurgery Stock and elimination of Surgical Products Stock and
Tissue Repair Stock as if this took place on January 1, 2000. The purpose of
this pro forma financial information is to demonstrate how the combined
financial statements of these businesses might have appeared if each of the
mergers had been completed at the beginning of the periods presented. The
results of operations of GelTex and Biomatrix are included in the results of
Genzyme beginning on the respective dates of acquisition.

    To determine earnings per share, Genzyme allocates its earnings to each
series of its common stock based on the earnings attributable to that series of
stock. The earnings attributable to each series of stock are defined in
Genzyme's charter as the net income or loss of the corresponding division
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and as
adjusted for tax benefits allocated to or from the division in accordance with
Genzyme's management and accounting policies. Genzyme's charter also requires
that all income and expenses of Genzyme be allocated among the divisions in a
reasonable and consistent manner. Genzyme's board of directors, however, retains
considerable discretion in determining the types, magnitudes and extent of
allocations to each series of common stock without shareholder approval.

    Because the earnings allocated to Genzyme Biosurgery Stock are based on the
income or losses attributable to Genzyme Biosurgery, Genzyme included pro forma
financial statements of Genzyme Biosurgery to aid investors in evaluating its
performance.

    Holders of Genzyme Biosurgery Stock have no specific rights to the assets
allocated to Genzyme Biosurgery. Genzyme Corporation continues to hold title to
all of the assets allocated to Genzyme Biosurgery and is responsible for all of
its liabilities, regardless of what Genzyme deems for financial statement
presentation purposes as allocated to any division. Holders of Genzyme
Biosurgery Stock, as common stockholders, are therefore subject to the risks of
investing in the businesses, assets and liabilities of Genzyme, as a whole.

    Genzyme has prepared the pro forma financial information using the purchase
method of accounting for all four transactions. Genzyme expects to have
reorganization and restructuring expenses as well as potential operating
efficiencies as a result of the mergers with Focal and Wyntek. The unaudited pro
forma information does not reflect these potential expenses and efficiencies.

    PENDING ACQUISITION OF FOCAL

    As a result of the merger with Focal, each outstanding share of Focal common
stock not already owned by Genzyme will automatically convert into the right to
receive 0.1545 of a share of Biosurgery Stock, except for 10,000 shares of Focal
common stock that will be purchased for cash. Genzyme will account for the
merger using the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method, the
assets and liabilities of Focal, including intangible assets, will be recorded
at their fair market values. The results of operations and cash flows of Focal
will be included in Genzyme's financial statements following the completion of
the merger. The assets, liabilities and operations of Focal will be allocated to
Genzyme Biosurgery.

    Additionally, each option and warrant to purchase shares of Focal common
stock outstanding immediately before the effective time of the merger will be
assumed by Genzyme after the merger and will become an option or warrant to
acquire Biosurgery Stock. The conversion of options to purchase Focal common
stock will be accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board Interpretation No. 44 ("FIN 44").

    PENDING ACQUISITION OF WYNTEK

    On April 30, 2001, Genzyme entered into a stock purchase agreement with
Wyntek and its stockholders, pursuant to which Genzyme will purchase all or
substantially all of the outstanding capital stock of Wyntek. Under the merger
agreement with Wyntek, Genzyme will purchase all of the outstanding stock of
Wyntek for approximately $65 million in cash. Genzyme will account for the
transaction using the purchase method of accounting. Under this method, the
assets and liabilities of Wyntek, including intangible assets, will be recorded
at their fair market values. The results of operations and cash flows of Wyntek
will be included in Genzyme's financial statements following the completion of
the transaction. No options or warrants will be assumed by Genzyme in connection
with the purchase. The assets, liabilities and operations of Wyntek will be
allocated to Genzyme General.

    ACQUISITION OF GELTEX

    On December 14, 2000, Genzyme completed the acquisition of GelTex. The
acquisition was structured as a merger of GelTex with and into one of Genzyme's
wholly-owned subsidiaries pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as
of September 11, 2000. Genzyme issued approximately 7.9 million shares of
Genzyme General Stock and paid cash of $515.2 million for all of the outstanding
stock of GelTex. In addition, Genzyme issued options and warrants to purchase
Genzyme General Stock in exchange for all outstanding GelTex options and
warrants. The conversion of options to purchase GelTex common stock was
accounted for in accordance with FIN 44.

    ACQUISITION OF BIOMATRIX

    On December 18, 2000, Genzyme completed the acquisition of Biomatrix. The
acquisition was structured as a merger of Biomatrix with and into one of
Genzyme's wholly-owned subsidiaries pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of March 6, 2000. Concurrent with the completion of Genzyme's
acquisition of Biomatrix, Genzyme amended its charter to create Biosurgery Stock
and eliminate Surgical Products Stock and Tissue Repair Stock. Genzyme issued
approximately 17.5 million shares of Biosurgery Stock and paid cash of
$252.4 million for all of the outstanding stock of Biomatrix. In addition,
Genzyme issued options to purchase Biosurgery Stock in exchange for all
outstanding Biomatrix options. The conversion of options to purchase Biomatrix
common stock was accounted for in accordance with FIN 44.

    TRACKING STOCK EXCHANGES

    In connection with the merger with Biomatrix, Genzyme effected an exchange
of its tracking stock whereby outstanding shares of Tissue Repair Stock and
Surgical Products Stock converted into Biosurgery Stock, the dividend and other
provisions of which are designed to track the financial performance of the
Genzyme Biosurgery division. Holders of Tissue Repair Stock and Surgical
Products Stock, therefore, remain holders of Genzyme common stock, but hold a
security whose dividend and other provisions are designed to track a different
subset of Genzyme's operations and assets. Additionally, the votes and
liquidation units per share of their holdings changed. Upon completion of the
tracking stock exchanges, each outstanding share of Surgical Products Stock
converted into the right to receive 0.6060 of a share of Biosurgery Stock and
each outstanding share of Tissue Repair Stock converted into the right to
receive 0.3352 of a share of Biosurgery Stock. Additionally, all outstanding
options to purchase Surgical Products Stock and Tissue Repair Stock converted
into options to purchase Biosurgery Stock at the respective conversion rates.

    The earnings attributable to Biosurgery Stock are defined in Genzyme's
charter as the net income or loss of Genzyme Biosurgery determined in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles and as adjusted for tax benefits
allocated to or from Genzyme Biosurgery in accordance with Genzyme's management
and accounting policies. Prior to the tracking stock exchange, the earnings
attributable to Surgical Products Stock and Tissue Repair Stock were defined in
Genzyme's charter as the net income or loss of Genzyme Surgical Products and
Genzyme Tissue Repair, respectively, determined in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and as adjusted for tax benefits allocated to or
from the division. Accordingly, the tracking stock exchanges involved a change
in Genzyme's methodology for allocating its earnings to its series of common
stock.

    These unaudited pro forma balance sheets and statements of operations are
for informational purposes only. They do not purport to indicate the results
that would have actually been obtained had the mergers been completed on the
assumed date or for the periods presented, or which may be obtained in the
future. To produce the pro forma financial information, Genzyme allocated the
purchase price for the Focal and Wyntek mergers using its best estimates. The
unaudited pro forma balance sheets and statements of operations should be read
in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements, including
the notes thereto, of each of Genzyme, Focal, Wyntek, GelTex and Biomatrix. For
Genzyme, those financial statements are included in Genzyme's Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 (filed on May 15, 2001) and
its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000 (filed on
April 2, 2001). For GelTex those financial statements are included in GelTex's
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2000 (filed on
November 14, 2000) and its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 1999 (filed on March 30, 2000), as amended on November 7, 2000. For
Biomatrix, those financial statements are included in Biomatrix's Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2000 (filed on
November 14, 2000) and its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 1999 (filed on March 30, 2000), as amended on April 26, 2000 and
October 26, 2000 which are filed as Exhibits 99.2 and 99.1, respectively, to
Genzyme's Current Report on Form 8-K filed May 18, 2001, as amended.

               NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1) ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRO FORMA INFORMATION

    The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements reflect the pro forma
effect of Genzyme's merger with Focal and Genzyme's purchase of Wyntek's stock
on the:

    - unaudited statements of operations for the three months ended March 31,
      2001 and the year ended December 31, 2000 and

    - unaudited balance sheet as of March 31, 2001

of both Genzyme and Genzyme Biosurgery, the division of Genzyme to which the
assets, liabilities and operations of Focal will be allocated.

    The pro forma balance sheets give effect to Genzyme's transactions with
Focal and Wyntek as if they occurred on March 31, 2001.

    The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements also reflect the pro
forma effect of Genzyme's merger with GelTex and Genzyme's merger with Biomatrix
on the unaudited statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 of
both Genzyme and Genzyme Biosurgery, the division of Genzyme to which the
assets, liabilities and operations of Biomatrix were allocated, as if these
mergers took place on January 1, 2000. In addition, the Genzyme pro forma
statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 reflects the change
in earnings allocations resulting from the creation of Biosurgery Stock and
elimination of Surgical Products Stock and Tissue Repair Stock as if this change
took place on January 1, 2000.

(2) GENZYME'S ACQUISITIONS

    (A) GENZYME'S ACQUISITION OF BIOMATRIX

    Genzyme entered into the merger agreement to acquire Biomatrix on March 6,
2000. Concurrently with the merger:

    - Genzyme Biosurgery was created as a new division of Genzyme;

    - the businesses of Genzyme Surgical Products and Genzyme Tissue Repair were
      reallocated to Genzyme Biosurgery; and

    - the businesses of Biomatrix was allocated to Genzyme Biosurgery.

    The following exchange ratios were used to determine the number of shares of
Biosurgery Stock distributed:

    - 0.6060 multiplied by the number of shares of Surgical Products Stock
      outstanding;

    - 0.3352 multiplied by the number of shares of Tissue Repair Stock
      outstanding; and

    - 0.7162 multiplied by the number of Biomatrix shares outstanding (based on
      a one-for-one exchange ratio for 71.62% of the Biomatrix shares).

This resulted in approximately:

    - 9,092,763 shares of Biosurgery Stock exchanged for 15,004,560 shares of
      Surgical Products Stock;

    - 9,679,769 shares of Biosurgery Stock exchanged for 28,877,593 shares of
      Tissue Repair Stock; and

         NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(2) GENZYME'S ACQUISITIONS (CONTINUED)
    - 17,516,712 shares of Biosurgery Stock and approximately $252.4 million of
      cash, exchanged for 24,338,908 shares of Biomatrix common stock.

In addition, options to purchase:

    - 3,252,386 shares of Surgical Products Stock under the Genzyme equity
      plans,

    - 3,923,281 shares of Tissue Repair Stock under the Genzyme equity plans,
      and

    - 1,706,639 shares of Biomatrix common stock under the Biomatrix equity
      plans

converted to options to purchase approximately 1,970,944, 1,315,083, and
1,222,300 shares of Biosurgery Stock, respectively. Using the acquisition price
of Biomatrix common stock and certain other assumptions in the Black-Scholes
option valuation model, the Biosurgery options issued in exchange for the
Biomatrix options have been valued at approximately $11.4 million. In accordance
with FIN 44, the intrinsic value of the portion of the unvested options related
to the future service period of approximately $66,000 was allocated to deferred
compensation in stockholders' equity for Genzyme or division equity for Genzyme
Biosurgery, rather than to goodwill. The unvested portion is being amortized to
operating expense over the remaining vesting periods of approximately three
years.

    (B) GENZYME'S ACQUISITION OF GELTEX

    Genzyme entered into a merger agreement to acquire GelTex on September 11,
2000. Genzyme paid approximately $515.2 million in cash and issued
$491.2 million in Genzyme General Stock for all of the outstanding shares of
GelTex common stock, using the stock price of Genzyme General Stock based on the
average trading price over three days before and after the September 11, 2000
announcement of the merger. Approximately 7.9 million shares of Genzyme General
Stock were issued in exchange for shares of GelTex common stock. In addition,
options and warrants to purchase approximately 2.1 million shares of GelTex
common stock were exchanged for options and warrants to purchase approximately
1.6 million shares of Genzyme General Stock. The vesting of GelTex options
granted to employees of GelTex before the effective date of the merger will be
accelerated as of the first anniversary of the effective date of the merger as
long as they remain employees of GelTex or Genzyme on the one year anniversary
date. Additionally, the vesting of stock options granted to directors and
several officers of GelTex were accelerated immediately upon the effective time
of the merger. Using the Black-Scholes valuation model, the options and warrants
to purchase Genzyme General Stock issued in exchange for the GelTex options and
warrants had a value of approximately $62.9 million. In accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 44 ("FIN 44"), the
intrinsic value of the portion of the unvested options related to the future
service period of $10.2 million was allocated to deferred compensation in
stockholders' equity for Genzyme. The unvested portion is being amortized to
operating expense over the remaining vesting period of approximately one year.

    (C) GENZYME'S PENDING ACQUISITION OF FOCAL

    Genzyme entered into a merger agreement to acquire Focal on April 25, 2001.
For purposes of the unaudited pro forma financial statements, we assumed that
Genzyme would issue approximately 2,086,000 shares of Biosurgery Stock and
approximately $7,000 in cash for all of the outstanding shares of Focal common
stock excluding shares owned by Genzyme which will be cancelled in the merger.
Using the price of Biosurgery Stock based on the average trading price over
three days before and after April 25, 2001, the value of the shares of
Biosurgery Stock would be approximately $9.5 million. In addition, options to
purchase 1,742,664 shares of Focal common stock and warrants to purchase

         NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(2) GENZYME'S ACQUISITIONS (CONTINUED)
43,782 shares of Focal common stock will be exchanged for options to purchase
approximately 276,705 shares of Biosurgery Stock. Using the Black-Scholes
valuation model, the options and warrants to purchase Biosurgery Stock issued in
exchange for options and warrants to purchase Focal common stock have a value of
approximately $389,000. In accordance with FIN 44, any intrinsic value of the
portion of the unvested options related to future service periods would be
allocated to deferred compensation in stockholders' equity for Genzyme. Based on
the value of Biosurgery Stock on April 25, 2001, there was no intrinsic

    (D) GENZYME'S PENDING ACQUISITION OF WYNTEK

    Genzyme entered into a stock purchase agreement on April 30, 2001 to acquire
all of the outstanding stock of Wyntek. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma
financial statements, we assumed that Genzyme would pay $65 million in cash for
all of the outstanding Wyntek common stock and all outstanding options to
acquire Wyntek common stock. No options or warrants to purchase Wyntek common
stock will be assumed by Genzyme in the transaction.

    As part of the acquisition of GelTex, Genzyme acquired all of GelTex's
interest in RenaGel LLC, a joint venture between Genzyme and GelTex. Prior to
the acquisition of GelTex, Genzyme accounted for its investment in RenaGel LLC
under the equity method. The adjustments below also reflect the consolidation of
RenaGel LLC into Genzyme's financial statements and accounting for the purchase
by Genzyme of GelTex's 50%-interest in the joint venture using the purchase
method of accounting. The assets and liabilities of the joint venture are
reflected in the amounts above. Because Genzyme already owned a 50% interest in
RenaGel LLC, the assets of RenaGel LLC were adjusted to fair value only to the
extent of the 50%-interest Genzyme acquired.

    In connection with the purchase of GelTex, Genzyme expects approximately
$118.0 million of the purchase price to be allocated to in-process research and
development, or IPR&D. Genzyme management assumes responsibility for determining
the IPR&D valuation. Genzyme engaged an independent third-party appraisal

    The total purchase price, the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired,
the allocation of purchase price and the lives of intangible assets will be
determined upon completion of the transaction and may vary from the amounts
presented herein.

    In connection with the purchase of Wyntek stock, Genzyme expects
approximately $7.9 million of the purchase price to be allocated to in-process
research and development, or IPR&D. Genzyme management assumes responsibility
for determining the IPR&D valuation and expects the final valuation will be
completed upon closing the transaction. The fair value assigned to purchased
IPR&D was estimated by discounting, to present value, the cash flows expected to
result from the project once it has reached technological feasibility. A
discount rate consistent with the risks of the project was used to estimate the
present value of cash flows. In estimating future cash flows, management
considered other tangible and intangible assets required for successful
exploitation of the technology resulting from the purchased IPR&D project and
adjusted future cash flows for a charge reflecting the contribution to value of
these assets. The value assigned to purchased IPR&D was the amount attributable
to the

         NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(3)  PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)
efforts of Wyntek up to the time of acquisition. This amount was estimated
through application of the "stage of completion" calculation by multiplying
total estimated revenue for IPR&D by the percentage of completion of the
purchased research and development project at the time of acquisition.

    The nature of the efforts to develop the purchased IPR&D into commercially
viable products, principally relates to the completion and/or acceleration of
existing development programs, including the mandatory completion of several
phases of clinical trials and the costs necessary to manage the projects and
trials. Assuming the approval of the product by the FDA, costs related to the
wide scale manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of the product are
included in the projection. The resulting net cash flows from such project are
based on Genzyme management's estimates of revenues, cost of sales, research and
development expenses, sales and marketing expenses, general and administrative
expenses, and the anticipated income tax effect.

    The discounting of net cash flows back to their present value is based on
the weighted average cost of capital, or WACC. The WACC calculation produces the
average required rate of return of an investment in an operating enterprise,
based on various required rates of return from investments in various areas of
that enterprise. The discount rate utilized in discounting the net cash flows
from purchased IPR&D was 25%. This discount rate is higher than Genzyme's WACC
due to the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the
purchased IPR&D.

    The forecast data employed in the analyses was based upon product level
forecast information obtained by Genzyme from numerous internal and external
resources. These resources included external market research and internal
experts. Genzyme senior management reviewed and challenged the forecast data and
related assumptions and utilized the information in analyzing IPR&D. The
forecast data and assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.
However, based upon the information available at this time, Genzyme management
believes the forecast data and assumptions to be reasonable. These assumptions
may be incomplete or inaccurate, and no assurance can be given that
unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur. Accordingly, actual
results may vary from the forecasted results. Any such variance may result in a
material adverse effect on Genzyme's financial condition and results of
operations.

    In the allocation of purchase price to the IPR&D, the concept of alternative
future use was specifically considered for the program under development. The
acquired IPR&D consists of Wyntek's work to complete the program. There are no
alternative uses for the in-process program in the event that the program fails
in clinical trials or is otherwise not feasible. The development effort for the
acquired IPR&D does not possess an alternative future use for Genzyme as defined
by generally accepted accounting principles.

    Below is a brief description of the IPR&D program associated with Wyntek's
cardiovascular disease diagnostic product, including an estimation of when
management believes Genzyme may realize revenues from the sale of this product.

    Wyntek is currently developing a cardiovascular product to rapidly measure
the quantitative levels of cardiac marker proteins. These are the leading
markers for the diagnosis of Acute Myocardial Infraction. The product consists
of a mobile, stand-alone, quantitative diagnostic device and a reaction strip
that detects disease specific marker proteins. The device will be used to read
reaction strips at the patient's bedside or in an emergency room setting. Wyntek
expects to complete the regulatory review process and file the PMA early in 2002
and begin selling the product during the second half of 2002. Studies to date
have demonstrated the viability of this product but there can be no assurance
that the

regulatory authorities will approve this product. A discount rate of 25% was
used in valuing the projected cash flows.

        Biosurgery Stock for Biomatrix common stock as though the Biomatrix
        acquisition occurred on January 1, 2000.

   (B4) To record the creation of Biosurgery Stock. Net losses for Genzyme
        Surgical Products and Genzyme Tissue Repair and net income for Biomatrix
        have been transferred to the calculation of loss per share allocated to
        Biosurgery Stock. The net income amount for Biomatrix of $7.1 million
        for the year ended December 31, 2000 reflects the elimination of the
        $6.5 million tax provision because Genzyme Biosurgery incurred a pro
        forma net loss for each period.

   (B5) To adjust the tax provision for the impact of the amortization of
        acquired intangibles, the reduction in investment income, the additional
        interest expense and the amortization of the deferred tax liability
        established in purchase accounting. Income taxes are allocated to
        Genzyme Biosurgery based upon the financial statement income, taxable
        income, credits and other amounts properly allocable to each division
        under generally accepted accounting principles as if it were a separate
        taxpayer. The realizability of deferred tax assets is assessed at the
        division level.

   (B6) To record interest expense that would have been incurred on the $200.0
        million of debt, at a rate of 7.5% per annum; and to reduce the
        investment income balance to reflect the payment of $52.4 million of
        cash at a rate of return of 5.45% per annum.

   (B7) To allocate the pro forma tax benefits of Genzyme Biosurgery to Genzyme
        General. Genzyme's management and accounting policies provide that, if
        as of the end of any fiscal quarter, a division can not use any
        projected annual tax benefit attributable to it to offset or reduce its
        current or deferred income tax expense, Genzyme may allocate the tax
        benefit to other divisions in proportion to their taxable income without
        any compensating payments or allocation to the division generating the
        benefit. The tax benefits allocated to Genzyme General from Genzyme
        Biosurgery totaled $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.
        On a pro forma basis, the tax benefits allocated to Genzyme General from
        Genzyme Biosurgery would have been $27.7 million for the year ended
        December 31, 2000. The tax benefits generated by Genzyme Biosurgery and
        allocated to Genzyme General are lower on a pro forma basis due
        primarily to Biomatrix' profitability offsetting losses incurred by
        Genzyme Biosurgery.

   (B8) To eliminate the charge for acquired in-process research and development
        recorded by Genzyme in connection with the acquisition. This amount was
        eliminated as it reflects a material non-recurring charge directly
        resulting from the acquisition.

        division net loss.

        forma adjustments to Genzyme General. Genzyme's management and
        accounting policies provide that, if as of the end of any fiscal
        quarter, a division can not use any projected annual tax benefit
        attributable to it to offset or reduce its current or deferred income
        tax expense, Genzyme may allocate the tax benefit to other divisions in
        proportion to their taxable income without any compensating payments or
        allocation to the division generating the benefit.

voting upon the proposal to adopt the merger agreement which is described in
this proxy statement/prospectus.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE FOCAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    After careful consideration, the Focal board of directors has determined
that the merger and the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests
of Focal and its stockholders and unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR"
adoption of the merger agreement.

RECORD DATE

    Stockholders of record at the close of business on May 25, 2001 are entitled
to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. Each holder of record of
Focal common stock at the close of business on the record date is entitled to
one vote for each share then held on each matter voted on by stockholders. At
the close of business on the record date, there were             shares of Focal
common stock issued and outstanding held by approximately       holders of
record and by approximately       persons or entities holding in nominee name.

QUORUM REQUIREMENT

    The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the
special meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy to constitute
a quorum. Abstentions are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum
exists. If you hold your shares of Focal common stock through a broker, bank or
other nominee, generally the nominee may only vote your Focal common stock in
accordance with your instructions. However, if your broker or nominee has not
timely received your instructions, the nominee may vote on matters for which it
has discretionary voting authority. Brokers generally will not have
discretionary voting authority to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement. If a nominee cannot vote on a matter because it does not have
discretionary voting authority, this is a "broker non-vote" on that matter.
Broker non-votes are counted as shares present or represented at the special
meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists, but will have the
same effect as votes against adoption of the merger agreement.

VOTE REQUIRED

    Under Delaware law, in order to complete the merger, holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Focal common stock entitled to vote at the special
meeting must vote to adopt the merger agreement. Holders of an aggregate of
2,177,367 shares of Focal common stock, representing approximately 12.5% of the
outstanding shares of Focal common stock as of the record date, have entered
into a voting agreement under which they agreed to vote in favor of adoption of
the merger agreement. This voting agreement, together with Genzyme's ownership
of approximately 22% of Focal's outstanding common stock, effectively ensures
that approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of Focal common stock will vote
in favor of adoption of the merger agreement.

VOTING AND REVOCATION OF PROXIES

    You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by one of the
following means:

    - delivering to the corporate secretary of Focal, at or before the taking of
      the vote at the Focal special stockholders meeting, a written notice of
      revocation bearing a later date than the proxy;

    - submitting a duly executed proxy with a later date relating to the same
      shares to the secretary of Focal before the taking of the vote at the
      Focal special stockholders meeting; or

    - attending the Focal special stockholders meeting and voting in person,
      although attendance at the Focal special stockholders meeting will not by
      itself constitute a revocation of a proxy.

    Any written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy should be sent to
Focal, Inc. 4 Maguire Road, Lexington, Massachusetts 02421, Attention:
Secretary, or hand delivered to the secretary of Focal at or before the taking
of the vote at the Focal special stockholders meeting. All shares of Focal
common stock that are entitled to vote and are represented at the Focal special
stockholders meeting by properly executed proxies received prior to or at such
meeting, and not revoked, will be voted at such meeting in accordance with the
instructions indicated on such proxies. Please note that if a broker, bank or
other nominee is the holder of record of your shares and you wish to vote at the
meeting, you must bring a letter from the broker, bank or other nominee
confirming that you are the beneficial owner of the shares. If you execute a
proxy card without giving instructions, the shares of Focal common stock
represented by that proxy card will be voted "FOR" adoption of the proposed
merger agreement.

    The Focal board of directors is not aware of any other matters to be voted
on at the special meeting. If any other matters are properly presented at the
Focal special stockholders meeting for consideration, including, among other
things, consideration of a motion to adjourn the meeting to another time and/or
place, including, without limitation, for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies, the persons named in the enclosed forms of proxy and acting thereunder
will have discretion to vote on these matters in accordance with their best
judgment.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

    Under Delaware corporate law, Focal stockholders are not entitled to
appraisal rights in connection with the merger because:

    - Focal common stock was, as of the record date for the special meeting,
      designated and reported for trading on The Nasdaq National Market; and

    - Focal common stock will be converted into shares of Biosurgery Stock,
      which also will be designated and reported for trading on The Nasdaq
      National Market.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

    Focal is paying Innisfree M&A Incorporated, a proxy solicitation firm,
$8,500 plus expenses to help it with the solicitation. Officers, directors and
regular employees of Focal, who will receive no additional compensation for
their services, may solicit proxies by telephone or personal call. Focal has
asked brokers and nominees who hold stock in their names to give the proxy
statement/prospectus to their customers. This proxy statement/prospectus is
first being mailed on or about             .

                              GENZYME CORPORATION

    Genzyme is a biotechnology and human healthcare company that develops
innovative products and provides services for major unmet medical needs. Genzyme
was founded in 1981 and became a Massachusetts corporation in 1991. Genzyme
currently has three operating divisions. Each of Genzyme's divisions has a
related series of common stock--or "tracking" stock--that is intended to reflect
its value and track its financial performance. Its three operating divisions
are:

    - Genzyme General, which develops and markets:

       -- therapeutic products, with an expanding focus on products to treat
          patients suffering from lysosomal storage disorders and other
          specialty therapeutics;

       -- diagnostic products, with a focus on IN VITRO diagnostics; and

       -- other products and services, such as genetic testing services and
          lipids and peptides for drug delivery;

    - Genzyme Biosurgery, which develops and markets instruments, devices,
      biomaterials and biotherapeutic products to improve or replace surgery,
      with an emphasis on the orthopaedic and cardiothoracic markets; and

    - Genzyme Molecular Oncology, which utilizes its functional genomics and
      antigen discovery technology platforms to develop novel cancer products
      focused on cancer vaccines and angiogenesis inhibitors and to generate
      partnering revenue.

    Genzyme allocates all of its products, services, programs, assets and
liabilities among its divisions for purposes of financial statement
presentation; however, Genzyme, the corporation, continues to own all of the
assets and is responsible for all of the liabilities allocated to each of the
divisions.

                                  FOCAL, INC.

    Focal was incorporated in Delaware in 1991, and is focused on the
development, manufacture and commercialization of synthetic, absorbable surgical
sealants based on its proprietary polymer technology.

    Focal introduced its first commercial product, FocalSeal-L surgical sealant
for lung surgery indications, in Europe in 1998 through a strategic marketing
alliance with Ethicon, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company. Focal has terminated
its alliance with Ethicon effective as of July 5, 2001. In November 1999, Focal
received CE mark approval for FocalSeal-S surgical sealant for neurosurgery
indications. CE mark approval indicates compliance with European standards for
safety and allows certified products to be marketed and sold in the European
Union. In May 2000, the FDA approved FocalSeal-L lung surgical sealant for
commercial sale in the United States. Focal launched FocalSeal-L lung surgical
sealant in the United States in July 2000 through its marketing partner, Genzyme
Biosurgery. In addition, Focal has received marketing approval for FocalSeal-L
lung surgical sealant in Canada. In May 2001, Focal reached agreement with the
FDA on a study protocol for a pivotal study of safety and efficacy for
FocalSeal-S. Pending approval of the investigational new drug exemption
application, Focal expects to begin this study in the third quarter of 2001.

    Clinicians perform more than 4 million open and minimally invasive lung,
neurological, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal surgical procedures each year
worldwide. In many of these procedures, air or fluid leaks may arise and cannot
be effectively treated with existing wound closure products such as sutures and
staples. Patients with persistent air or fluid leaks may require prolonged
hospitalization, have more complications, higher levels of post-operative pain,
and a higher risk of mortality. Sutures and staples represent the principal
products comprising the wound closure market. Sutures and staples work very
effectively in bringing dissected tissues back together after surgery. However,
sutures and staples alone do not have inherent sealing capabilities, and,
therefore, cannot consistently eliminate air and fluid leakage at the wound
site. Focal's surgical sealants have several key properties that Focal believes
enable them to effectively seal and reduce air and fluid leaks following
surgery. These properties include adherence to tissue, strength, flexibility and
elasticity, and ease of use.

    Focal has designed its FocalSeal surgical sealants to be compatible with the
human body and to remain intact through the critical wound healing period and
then be absorbed and eliminated by the body. Focal believes the use of its
FocalSeal surgical sealants could potentially shorten patient recovery times and
hospital stays, and reduce post-surgical complications.

    Focal believes, based upon preclinical evaluation of its polymers, that its
FocalSeal-L and FocalSeal-S surgical sealant formulations may also be applicable
to cardiovascular surgery, gastrointestinal surgery and other surgical
applications. Focal has successfully demonstrated in preclinical models that
FocalSeal-L surgical sealant is effective in sealing blood leaks in coronary
artery bypass graft surgery and other cardiovascular indications. Focal is
currently conducting further preclinical trials.

    Focal also intends to develop other applications for the liquid formulations
of its polymer technology, including local drug delivery vehicles. In local drug
delivery applications, Focal believes that its polymers can deliver high
concentrations of drugs at local disease sites, thereby potentially enhancing
efficacy and reducing toxicity associated with systemic delivery of drugs. Focal
believes that its polymer technology will be uniquely effective because it
adheres to the target tissue while it is releasing drugs. Focal has demonstrated
in preclinical models the ability to obtain sustained release of drugs at a
local disease site.

    Focal believes it has built a strong patent portfolio related to its polymer
technology. As of April 30, 2001, Focal owns, licenses or has the right to 49
issued United States patents and 36 foreign patents corresponding to certain of
the issued United States patents and has 90 patent applications pending in the
United States, as well as foreign counterparts of certain of these applications.

                  MATERIAL CONTRACTS BETWEEN GENZYME AND FOCAL

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

    In October 1999, Focal entered into a marketing and distribution agreement
with Genzyme pursuant to which Focal granted Genzyme Biosurgery exclusive
marketing and distribution rights to Focal's surgical sealant products for lung
surgery, cardiovascular surgery and gastrointestinal surgery in North America.
Under this agreement, Genzyme reimburses Focal for its cost of manufacturing
FocalSeal-Registered Trademark--L sealant and pays Focal 50% of the gross margin
generated from Genzyme's sales of the product to end users.

STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

    In connection with the marketing and distribution agreement, Genzyme and
Focal entered into a stock purchase agreement in October 1999 pursuant to which
Genzyme has acquired 3,851,806 shares of Focal common stock representing
approximately 22% of Focal's outstanding capital stock. Under the stock purchase
agreement, Genzyme committed to purchase up to $20.0 million of Focal common
stock over an eighteen month period, in four installments of up to $5.0 million
each, subject to certain specified conditions, including the continued listing
of Focal common stock on The Nasdaq National Market. Genzyme made the first
$5.0 million purchase in November 1999 of 810,372 shares of Focal common stock.
The second $5.0 million purchase was made in April 2000, with Genzyme purchasing
614,250 shares of Focal common stock. The third $5.0 million purchase was made
in January 2001, with Genzyme purchasing 2,427,184 shares of Focal common stock.
At Focal's option, subject to satisfaction of specified conditions, Genzyme may
be required to purchase up to $5.0 million of additional shares of Focal common
stock. Under the stock purchase agreement, the purchase price per share for this
option would be based upon the average per share closing prices of the Focal
common stock as reported by The Nasdaq National Market for the 20 consecutive
trading days immediately preceding the date the exercise notice is delivered.

    Genzyme and Focal also agreed in the stock purchase agreement to provisions
which would affect a potential change of control of Focal. Genzyme agreed to
restrictions on its ability to acquire beneficial ownership of Focal common
stock other than under the stock purchase agreement or as the result of any
stock split. However, these restrictions would not apply if the Focal board of
directors determined to solicit or consider proposals for a transaction that
would result in a change of control of Focal's assets or common stock, Focal
entered into an agreement for such a change of control transaction, or a third
party made a public announcement of a tender or exchange offer for 20% or more
of the then outstanding Focal common stock.

    The stock purchase agreement also provides that, until the earlier of the
termination of the marketing and distribution agreement and Genzyme ceasing to
hold at least 25% of the shares of Focal common stock purchased under the stock
purchase agreement, Focal must notify Genzyme of its receipt of any written
offer from a third party that could result in a change of control transaction
(unless the Focal board of directors has determined not to consider such offer).
Within two business days of its receipt of such notice, Genzyme is required to
inform Focal if it wishes to negotiate a change of control transaction with
Focal on terms no less favorable to Focal than those contained in the third
party's written offer. If Genzyme so notifies Focal, then Focal is obligated to
negotiate in good faith with Genzyme (subject to the fiduciary duties of the
Focal board of directors). If Genzyme does not provide this notice, Focal has no
further obligation to negotiate with Genzyme.

    In addition, the stock purchase agreement grants Genzyme the right to
purchase its pro rata share of any future issuances of common stock by Focal,
excluding issuances such as stock option grants, stock dividends and common
stock issued to strategic partners in exchange for intellectual property rights.
These purchase rights lapse if Genzyme has not purchased all of the shares that
it is required to purchase under the stock purchase agreement.

LETTER AGREEMENT

    In connection with the merger agreement, Genzyme and Focal entered into a
letter agreement that amended the terms of their existing marketing and
distribution and stock purchase agreements. Genzyme agreed to waive several of
the conditions to its obligation to purchase $5.0 million of additional shares
of Focal common stock, including matters contemplated by the merger agreement
and the requirement that Focal common stock be listed on The Nasdaq National
Market. Under the revised terms, Focal may exercise its final option to sell to
Genzyme $5.0 million of additional shares of Focal common stock between
June 15, 2001 and July 12, 2001. If Focal exercises the final option and the
applicable conditions to closing are met, Genzyme is required to purchase the
shares in four installments on each of July 16, July 31, August 15 and
August 31, 2001. If the merger agreement is not terminated prior to June 15,
2001, the price for these shares will be $0.70 per share, unless Focal common
stock has been delisted from The Nasdaq National Market, in which case the price
will be $0.40 per share. If, however, the merger agreement is terminated prior
to June 15, 2001, then the per share purchase price for the Focal common stock
will be the average of the per share closing prices of Focal common stock as
reported by The Nasdaq National Market (or if the Focal common stock is not then
listed on The Nasdaq National Market, on the principal trading market for the
Focal common stock at that time, or, if there is no principal trading market,
the fair market value per share of Focal common stock as determined in good
faith by the Focal board of directors) for the five consecutive trading days
immediately preceding the applicable purchase date. If Focal exercises its
option in full, Genzyme will own approximately 10,994,663 shares of Focal common
stock representing approximately 45% of Focal's outstanding capital stock,
assuming the $0.70 per share price.

    Genzyme agreed that until the earliest of (a) September 1, 2001, (b) the
date the merger agreement becomes terminable by Genzyme due to a material breach
of the merger agreement by Focal, or (c) the termination of the merger agreement
in accordance with its terms, it would:

    - not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of beneficial ownership of shares
      of Focal common stock,

    - not acquire beneficial ownership or voting rights with respect to shares
      of the Focal common stock, other than pursuant to the exercise of the
      final option or its pre-emptive rights under the stock purchase agreement,
      or under the terms of the merger agreement and the voting agreement, and

    - ensure that no votes are cast nor proxies given at any meeting of Focal's
      stockholders, unless otherwise requested by Focal, with respect to any
      shares of Focal common stock as to which Genzyme has beneficial ownership
      or voting rights in excess of 40% of the number of outstanding shares of
      Focal common stock as of the record date for any meeting of Focal's
      stockholders.

    The letter agreement also provides that while the merger agreement is in
effect, the restrictions on Focal's ability to issue stock and solicit
alternative transactions contained in the merger agreement would govern instead
of the provisions of the stock purchase agreement that grant Genzyme the right
to purchase its pro rata share of future issuances of Focal common stock and
that require Focal to negotiate with Genzyme if Focal receives an offer from a
third party for a transaction that would result in a change of control of
Focal's assets. In the letter agreement, Genzyme also agreed to permit Focal to
reduce from eight to two the number of employees co-promoting
FocalSeal-Registered Trademark--L product in the U.S. market. Subsequently,
Genzyme agreed to eliminate Focal's obligation to provide employees to co-
promote FocalSeal-Registered Trademark--L product.

                     BACKGROUND AND REASONS FOR THE MERGER

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

    Genzyme and Focal have had a business relationship with each other for
several years. In October 1999, Focal and Genzyme entered into a marketing and
distribution agreement pursuant to which Genzyme Biosurgery has exclusive
marketing and distribution rights to Focal's surgical sealant products for lung
surgery, cardiovascular surgery and gastrointestinal surgery in North America.
At the same time, Genzyme entered into a stock purchase agreement with Focal,
pursuant to which Genzyme has purchased 3,851,806 shares of Focal common stock
representing approximately 22% of Focal's outstanding capital stock. At Focal's
option, Genzyme may be required to make one additional $5.0 million investment.
For a description of the marketing and distribution agreement and the stock
purchase agreement, see "MATERIAL CONTRACTS BETWEEN GENZYME AND FOCAL" on page
  .

    Since its inception, Focal has incurred substantial net losses and has
funded its operations primarily through the private placement of equity
securities and through its initial public offering of common stock. In addition,
Focal has entered into strategic alliances with corporate partners. Throughout
2000, the Focal board of directors and management considered potential strategic
alternatives to secure continued funding without success. At the same time,
sales of FocalSeal-Registered Trademark--L surgical sealant for lung surgery
indications in Europe through Focal's strategic marketing alliance with Ethicon
were below anticipated levels. While Focal launched FocalSeal-Registered
Trademark--L sealant for lung surgery indications in North America in July 2000
through its marketing partner, Genzyme Biosurgery, revenues from such sales have
not been sufficient to alter Focal's need for a significant capital infusion in
the near term.

    At the September 21, 2000 quarterly meeting, the Focal board of directors
directed management to recommend an investment banker to assist Focal in
exploring strategic alternatives, including a sale of the company.

    On October 3, 2000, at the request of Robert J. DePasqua, he and John
Connolly, Executive Vice President of Genzyme Biosurgery, met at Genzyme's
offices. Mr. DePasqua reviewed with Mr. Connolly the state of Focal's business
and discussed a possible acquisition of Focal by Genzyme.

    On October 20, 2000 at a meeting of the Focal board of directors,
Mr. DePasqua reported on Focal's progress in selecting a financial advisor and
apprised the board of the status of discussions with Genzyme regarding a
potential merger. At a meeting of the compensation committee of the Focal board
of directors held the same day, the committee approved changes to the
compensation and bonus arrangements, options, separation benefits and other
arrangements with senior management in connection with retention of key
employees. For a more detailed discussion of the interests of Focal management,
see "BACKGROUND AND REASONS FOR THE MERGER--Interests of Focal Management in the
Merger" on page       of this proxy statement/prospectus.

    In late October and early November 2000, representatives of Focal spoke with
Wayne Pambianchi at The Sage Group, a health care strategic consulting firm,
concerning Focal's present circumstances and future prospects. The Sage Group
presented its credentials, experience and capabilities. On November 14, 2000,
Focal engaged The Sage Group to provide services relating to Focal's strategic
options, including the sale or merger of Focal. The basis for this selection was
The Sage Group's knowledge of Focal, its technology, products, and markets, as
well as The Sage Group's reputation, background and experience in the industry.
With The Sage Group's assistance, Focal prepared a descriptive memorandum which
was distributed to companies identified by The Sage Group which might be
interested in a strategic investment in or acquisition of Focal, including,
large, small and mid-capitalization providers of medical devices, drug delivery
systems, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, and wound management
products. From December 2000 through early April 2001, representatives of The
Sage Group contacted approximately 46 such companies regarding a

potential acquisition of Focal's business and had preliminary discussions with
approximately 15 of these companies.

    Despite these efforts, only two companies, including Genzyme, made a site
visit and only Genzyme made an acquisition proposal. Focal believes that
contacted parties did not submit offers for a number of reasons, including
concerns about Focal's business fundamentals, market conditions, and the
relationship with Genzyme, including the terms of the exclusive marketing and
distribution agreement, Genzyme's ownership position and the negotiation and
other rights under the stock purchase agreement.

    From December 2000 through March 2001, Messrs. Connolly, DePasqua, Rudowsky,
Pambianchi, and Earl Collier, President of Genzyme Biosurgery, engaged in a
series of exploratory, non-binding discussions relating to a possible business
combination between the parties. Focal management informally briefed the Focal
board from time to time concerning these discussions. These meetings became more
frequent following February 27, 2001 when Focal management decided, based on
results to date from the strategic alternatives initiative, to focus more
deliberately on a transaction with Genzyme.

    On January 23, 2001, Mr. DePasqua and Mr. Rudowsky provided a detailed
report to the board of directors on the activities of The Sage Group with
respect to potential acquisition transactions. At this meeting, the board and
members of Focal's management considered and discussed strategic alternatives
for the company in lieu of a sale of the business, including a spin out of
Focal's research-stage assets for applications outside of the field of surgical
sealants into a separately-financed independently operated company. The Focal
board did not pursue any of these alternatives because it believed a sale of the
company would provide superior value to stockholders and would be more likely to
succeed.

    On January 25, 2001, Focal announced a major restructuring of the Focal
board of directors and management. Mr. DePasqua was elected Chairman of the
Board and Mr. Rudowsky was appointed Focal's President and Chief Executive
Officer and was elected to the Focal board of directors. Two Focal directors
also resigned. Focal also publicly announced that it had retained the services
of The Sage Group to investigate potential strategic alternatives.

    On January 31, 2001, Focal's independent auditors delivered their report on
Focal's financial statements for 2000, including a statement that Focal's
recurring losses and net capital deficiency raised substantial doubt about the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

    On February 16, 2001, Messrs. Pambianchi, DePasqua, Rudowsky, and Jarrett
met with representatives of another potential bidder to discuss its interest in
acquiring Focal's business.

    On March 7, 2001, Mr. Pambianchi, Mr. Collier, Mr. Connolly and Thomas
Mathers, Vice President of Genzyme Biosurgery, met to discuss the structure,
value and timing of a possible acquisition of Focal by Genzyme, as well as
Focal's options in the event Genzyme did not make an offer. During this meeting,
Mr. Collier indicated that while the acquisition of Focal was of interest to
Genzyme, various factors limited the magnitude of an offer that Genzyme could
make, including the combined effects of the financial markets, Genzyme's
previous $15 million investment in Focal common stock, the imminent need to
write down part of this investment, the necessity of making significant
additional investments following an acquisition to achieve profitability for
Focal's business and other factors. Mr. Collier suggested that an acquisition
involving shares of Biosurgery Stock would make sense for Genzyme and would
provide Focal shareholders increased liquidity and meaningful upside potential.
The parties also discussed Genzyme's negotiation rights under the stock purchase
agreement.

    On March 13, 2001, Mr. Pambianchi spoke to Mr. Connolly by telephone
regarding the possibility of Genzyme relinquishing, sharing, or selling its
rights to FocalSeal, to facilitate a possible transaction with another party.
Mr. Connolly rejected these ideas. Mr. Pambianchi and Mr. Connolly again
discussed the merits of an acquisition of Focal by Genzyme. Subsequent to this
discussion,

Mr. Pambianchi also spoke to Mr. Connolly about allowing reductions in Focal's
sales force required under the marketing and distribution agreement, in order to
reduce Focal's expenses. Mr. Pambianchi kept Focal management apprised of
developments throughout these discussions.

    On March 15, 2001, at a meeting of the Focal board of directors,
Mr. Pambianchi reviewed several strategic alternatives available to Focal in
lieu of a sale of the business. Messrs. DePasqua, Rudowsky and Pambianchi also
apprised the board of the status of discussions with Genzyme concerning a
potential acquisition. Later the same day, Mr. Pambianchi, Mr. Rudowsky,
Mr. Connolly and Mr. Collier met at Genzyme's offices to discuss research
collaborations as well as the reduction of number of the Focal sales specialists
required under the marketing and distribution agreement.

    On March 16, 2001, Mr. Connolly contacted Mr. Rudowsky and Mr. Pambianchi
and indicated that Genzyme management believed that it could recommend to
Genzyme's board of directors an acquisition of Focal providing for the exchange
of 0.1133 of a share of Biosurgery Stock for each outstanding share of Focal
common stock. The management of Focal considered the offer and determined that
it could not recommend the offer to the Focal board of directors.

    On March 26, 2001, representatives of another potential acquiror met with
Mr. Jarrett, Mr. Bromander and Mr. Rudowsky at Focal's headquarters.

    On March 27, 2001, Mr. Pambianchi, Mr. Connolly and Mr. Rudowsky met to
discuss the status of the marketing and distribution agreement. During this
meeting, the parties further discussed the merits of a merger.

    On April 2, 2001, Mr. Connolly contacted Mr. Rudowsky by telephone and
indicated that Genzyme management would recommend to Genzyme's board of
directors a transaction providing for the exchange of 0.1545 of a share of
Genzyme Biosurgery for each outstanding share of Focal common stock.
Mr. Rudowsky called Mr. DePasqua and advised him of the conversation.
Mr. DePasqua then called Mr. Connolly to review the offer and request a written
proposal.

    On April 3, 2001, Genzyme management submitted to Focal a letter outlining
the terms for a potential acquisition, together with a proposed form of
exclusivity agreement. On April 3 and April 4, 2001, Messrs. Pambianchi,
DePasqua and Rudowsky reviewed Genzyme's letter and informally apprised
directors of its terms. Focal management considered the terms of the letter and
determined that the letter could serve as the basis for an acceptable
transaction.

    On April 4, 2001, the parties finalized and executed an agreement providing
Genzyme with an exclusivity period of ten days for the parties to evaluate a
business combination. The parties also finalized and executed a non-disclosure
agreement, and Genzyme's counsel, Palmer & Dodge LLP delivered a draft merger
agreement to Focal's counsel, Hale and Dorr LLP.

    On April 6, 2001, the other potential acquiror notified Focal that it would
not make a proposal for an acquisition.

    On April 10, 2001, Focal engaged Stephens Inc., an investment banking firm,
to render an opinion to the Focal board of directors concerning the fairness,
from a financial point of view, of the proposed transaction. The basis for this
selection was prior experience with the firm, as well as its reputation,
background and experience in the industry. During the period from April 10, 2001
to April 25, 2001, Stephens Inc. met with members of Focal's management team to
evaluate the business. In addition, Stephens Inc. visited Genzyme on April 16,
2001 to review its business.

    Between April 5, 2001 and April 25, 2001, representatives from Genzyme and
Focal, and their respective legal counsel, engaged in a series of discussions to
negotiate the terms and conditions of the definitive merger agreement and
related documentation. In addition, a letter agreement was drafted which, among
other things, modified the rights and obligations under the existing stock
purchase and distribution and marketing agreements between the parties.
Throughout this period, both parties and

their legal, financial and accounting advisors conducted a detailed due
diligence review of the other party's business, financial condition and
operations.

    In early April, Focal received a letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market stating
that Nasdaq had determined that Focal no longer met the net tangible asset
requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq National Market and that,
therefore, Nasdaq would review Focal's eligibility for continued listing. Focal
subsequently submitted to Nasdaq a plan relating to compliance with the net
tangible asset requirement. In a separate letter dated April 19, 2001, Nasdaq
informed Focal that Focal had failed to meet the minimum bid requirement of
$1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days. The letter stated that Focal would have
until July 18, 2001 to demonstrate compliance by trading at or above $1.00 for
ten consecutive trading days. The letter indicated that Nasdaq would deliver
written notification of its determination to delist Focal common stock from The
Nasdaq National Market if Focal is unable to achieve compliance with the minimum
bid price on or before July 18, 2001. In a letter dated May 14, 2001, Nasdaq
informed Focal that based upon Focal's planned acquisition by Genzyme, Nasdaq
had determined to grant Focal an extension of time with respect to de-listing.
The extension is conditioned upon closing the merger with Genzyme on of before
August 31, 2001. At the effective time of the merger, Focal must request
delisting of its common stock from The Nasdaq National Market.

    On April 16, 2001, the full Focal board of directors held a special meeting
to consider the terms of the proposed transaction. Representatives of
Stephens Inc. and Hale and Dorr LLP also participated. Mr. Rudowsky and
Mr. DePasqua gave an update on the state of the business and described the
history of the search for a strategic investor or acquiror. Mr. DePasqua also
stated that earlier that day he had spoken with Mr. Collier in an effort to
obtain an increase in the exchange ratio without success. It was noted that
Focal's anticipated expenditures would exhaust its existing capital resources,
including the final $5 million investment from Genzyme, by year end, and that no
source of additional capital or alternative acquiror had been identified.
Representatives of Stephens then reviewed its preliminary financial analysis of
the proposed transaction. Representatives of Hale and Dorr LLP then made a
presentation concerning the significant terms of the merger agreement, the
voting agreement to be entered into by several institutional stockholders of
Focal, the terms of the letter agreement modifying the stock purchase agreement
with Genzyme, and a proposed amendment to Focal's preferred shares rights
agreement. Hale and Dorr LLP also reviewed the obligations of the directors
under Delaware law in considering the proposed transaction. The Focal board of
directors discussed various issues relating to the proposed business
combination, including the terms of the merger and the associated risks and
merits. In addition, the implications of the potential delisting from The Nasdaq
National Market of Focal common stock, including the potential elimination of
Genzyme's obligation to fund the final $5.0 million under the stock purchase
agreement, and the interaction of the agreements with Genzyme and the merger
agreement and voting agreement, were discussed. The interests of members of the
Focal board and management in the merger, including bonus and severance
arrangements, were also considered.

    Between April 16 and April 24, 2001, the parties and their respective legal
counsel continued to negotiate the terms of the proposed merger agreement and
related agreements. The parties continued to conduct due diligence. On
April 17, 2001, the parties agreed to extend the exclusivity period through
April 27, 2001.

    On April 24, 2001, the full Focal board of directors held a special meeting
to consider the terms of the proposed transaction. In addition, representatives
of Stephens Inc. and Hale and Dorr LLP participated. Focal management reported
on the status of the merger negotiations with Genzyme. Representatives of
Stephens Inc. then presented their financial analyses with respect to the
proposed business combination with Genzyme, and delivered its oral opinion that,
as of such date and based upon and subject to certain assumptions and matters
set forth in the opinion, the exchange ratio of 0.1545 is fair from a financial
point of view to the holders of Focal common stock, other than directors,
officers and employees of Focal, and Genzyme and its affiliates. This opinion
was confirmed in a letter

subsequently delivered by Stephens Inc., a copy of which is attached to this
proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B. Additionally, a representative of Hale
and Dorr LLP reviewed the significant terms of the merger agreement, the voting
agreement, the letter agreement and a proposed amendment to Focal's preferred
shares rights agreement and summarized the board's fiduciary duties in
connection with the proposed transaction. Following the presentations and
further discussions, the Focal board unanimously determined that the merger
agreement, and the transactions contemplated thereby, are advisable, fair and in
the best interests of, Focal and its stockholders, unanimously adopted and
approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and
unanimously recommended that stockholders of Focal approve the merger agreement.
The Focal board also approved the indemnification arrangements with several
Focal officers.

    On April 25, 2001, following final negotiations, the merger agreement, the
letter agreement and the voting agreement were executed. Prior to the opening of
trading on April 26, 2001, Genzyme and Focal issued a press release announcing
the execution of the merger agreement.

FOCAL'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

    In reaching its determination to approve the merger, the merger agreement,
the letter agreement and the related transactions, the Focal board of directors
considered a number of factors in addition to those described above. The
following summarizes the material factors that the Focal board of directors
considered:

    - the state of Focal's business, financial condition, results of operations
      and prospects and the nature of the industry in which Focal operates,
      including the fact that Focal's business could not be sustained without
      substantial new capital and that extensive efforts to find alternative
      strategic investors or acquirors had not succeeded, as well as the belief
      that because of fundamental changes in the equity markets, there was no
      assurance that the financing environment for early-stage development
      companies such as Focal, even with promising technologies, would improve
      substantially;

    - the historical market prices and recent trading activity of shares of
      Focal common stock and Biosurgery Stock, including the fact that the
      exchange ratio of 0.1545 implied an offer price per share of Focal common
      stock of $0.66 per share based on the closing price of Biosurgery Stock as
      reported on the Nasdaq on April 23, 2001, represented a discount to the
      closing price of Focal common stock on that day, and that the offer price
      per share of Focal common stock implied by the exchange ratio represented
      a premium to the relative average closing prices of Focal common stock
      relative to that of Biosurgery Stock over the preceding 30 trading days;

    - the opinion of Stephens Inc., Focal's financial advisor, that the exchange
      ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Focal common
      stock, other than directors, officers and employees of Focal, and Genzyme
      and its affiliates;

    - the opportunity for the combined businesses to employ Genzyme's financial
      and technical resources and commitment to pioneering new biomaterial
      products to help expand the range of applications for Focal's proprietary
      biomaterial platform;

    - the belief that, with Focal's intellectual property portfolio and
      expertise with synthetic biomaterials and Genzyme Biosurgery's
      infrastructure and portfolio of products in the area of surgical
      biomaterials, the combined businesses would be well-positioned to hold a
      leadership position in the emerging field of surgical biomaterials;

    - the ability of Focal stockholders to continue to participate in the future
      growth and success of Focal through their receipt of shares of Biosurgery
      Stock in the merger, and the increased liquidity created for Focal
      stockholders by receiving shares in a larger, publicly traded company;

    - the terms of the stock purchase agreement, including Genzyme's negotiation
      and preemptive rights, and the fact that if Focal exercised the final
      option under the stock purchase agreement, based upon recent market
      prices, Genzyme would own a near majority of Focal's outstanding common
      stock and thereby achieve a significant level of control over Focal
      without an obligation to acquire the company;

    - the potential delisting of Focal common stock from The Nasdaq National
      Market and its impact on the value of Focal common stock, Genzyme's
      obligations under the stock purchase agreement and Focal's ability to
      attract new investors;

    - the need for relatively few regulatory approvals or consents to consummate
      the merger, and the favorable prospects for receiving necessary approvals
      and consents;

    - the advantages and potential disadvantages of holding Genzyme tracking
      stock;

    - the terms of the merger agreement, including those relating to the Board
      recommendation, the holding of the Focal stockholder meeting and the
      $600,000 termination fee payable by Focal under specified circumstances,
      and the effect that the merger agreement and the existing arrangements
      with Genzyme would have on Focal's ability to pursue or complete an
      alternative transaction, and the fact that the merger agreement was the
      product of arm's-length negotiations;

    - the provisions of the letter agreement, including the restrictions on
      Genzyme's ability to acquire or vote shares of Focal common stock, the
      timing and price of the final $5 million option, the elimination of
      various conditions to Genzyme's obligation (including the requirement that
      Focal's shares be listed on The Nasdaq National Market), and the reduction
      of specified Focal obligations under the distribution and marketing
      agreement; as well as Focal management's view that the changes required by
      Genzyme in the timing of its funding obligations under the stock purchase
      agreement were consistent with Focal's anticipated capital requirements;

    - the impact on the proposed merger of the voting agreement between Genzyme
      and a group of institutional stockholders of Focal in light of Genzyme's
      existing ownership of Focal common stock, and the fact that the voting
      agreement would terminate if the merger agreement is terminated; and

    - the expectation that the merger will be treated as a taxable transaction
      to Focal stockholders.

    The Focal board of directors also identified and considered a number of
uncertainties and risks concerning the merger, including:

    - the risk that the per share value of the consideration actually received
      by Focal stockholders might be significantly less than the per share price
      implied by the exchange ratio prior to the announcement of the merger
      because the exchange ratio will not be adjusted for changes in market
      price of either Biosurgery Stock or Focal common stock;

    - the risk that the benefits sought in the merger and the related
      transactions might not be achieved;

    - the difficulty of integrating the businesses of Focal and Genzyme, and the
      possible adverse effects that could result from the need for senior
      management to focus significant time and effort on completing the merger
      and integrating the businesses;

    - the risk that Focal might suffer employee attrition or fail to attract key
      personnel due to uncertainties associated with the merger; and

    - the risk that the merger might not be consummated and the other applicable
      risks described in this proxy statement/prospectus under "RISK
      FACTORS--Risks Relating to the Merger" beginning on page   .

    In light of the wide variety of factors that the Focal board of directors
considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger agreement and the
complexity of these matters, the Focal board of directors did not quantify or
otherwise assign relative weights to the factors it considered. In addition,
individual members of the Focal board may have given different weights to
different factors. However, the Focal board as a whole viewed its determinations
and recommendations based on the totality of the information presented to, and
considered by it.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE FOCAL BOARD

    The Focal board of directors has determined that the merger and the merger
agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Focal and its stockholders
and unanimously recommends that Focal stockholders vote FOR adoption of the
merger agreement.

FAIRNESS OPINION OF FOCAL'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

    The Focal board of directors engaged Stephens Inc. to provide a fairness
opinion in connection with the proposed acquisition of Focal by Genzyme pursuant
to the merger agreement.

    On April 24, 2001, Stephens presented its oral opinion and some of its
written analyses to the Focal board of directors. Stephens subsequently
delivered its written opinion, dated April 24, 2001, to the Focal board of
directors to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the qualifications
set forth in the opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the stockholders of Focal, other than directors, officers and employees
of Focal and Genzyme and its affiliates.

    The full text of the written fairness opinion of Stephens, which sets forth
the assumptions made, general procedures followed, factors considered and
limitations on the review undertaken by Stephens in rendering its opinion, is
attached as Annex B and is incorporated into this proxy statement/ prospectus by
reference. You should read this opinion in its entirety.

    Stephens has consented to the use of its fairness opinion in this proxy
statement/prospectus. Stephens provided the fairness opinion to the Focal board
of directors for its information, and the fairness opinion is directed only to
the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to the
stockholders of Focal and does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder of Focal as to how that stockholder should vote on the merger
agreement or any matter related to the merger. The summary of the fairness
opinion set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the fairness opinion.

    In arriving at its opinion, Stephens analyzed, reviewed and considered the
financial and other matters that it deemed relevant, including among other
things:

    - publicly available financial statements and reports for Focal and Genzyme,
      including their annual reports filed on Form 10-K for the years ended
      December 31, 1999 and 2000;

    - internal financial statements and other financial and operating data,
      including financial projections, for Focal prepared by management of
      Focal;

    - the reported prices and trading activity of the shares of Focal common
      stock and Biosurgery Stock;

    - the financial performance of Focal and the prices and trading activity of
      Focal common stock as compared with the performance, stock prices and
      trading activity of other comparable publicly-traded companies;

    - the merger agreement and related documents;

    - discussions with Focal's management with respect to the operations of and
      future business prospects of Focal and the anticipated financial
      consequences of the merger on Focal; and

    - other analyses performed by Stephens as it deemed appropriate.

    In preparing the fairness opinion, Stephens assumed and relied on the
accuracy and completeness of all information supplied or reviewed by it in
connection with its analysis of the transaction and has further relied on the
assurances of management of Focal that they are not aware of any facts that
would make this information inaccurate or misleading. Stephens has not assumed
any responsibility for independently verifying this information and has not
undertaken an independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or
liabilities of Focal or Genzyme or been furnished with any evaluation or
appraisal, nor conducted a physical inspection of the properties or facilities
of Focal or Genzyme. With respect to the financial projections furnished to
Stephens and discussed with Focal, Stephens assumed that the financial
projections were reasonably prepared and reflected the best currently available
estimates and judgment as to the expected future financial performance of Focal.
Stephens expressed no opinion as to these financial projections or the
assumptions on which they were based.

    For purposes of rendering the fairness opinion, Stephens assumed, in all
respects material to its analysis, that the representations and warranties of
each party to the merger agreement and all related documents and instruments
contained therein were true and correct, that each party to these documents
would perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by
each party under these documents and that all conditions to the consummation of
the merger would be satisfied without any waivers. Stephens assumed that in the
course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or other consents or approvals
(contractual or otherwise) for the merger, no restrictions, including any
divestiture requirements or amendments or modification, would be imposed that
would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the merger.

    Stephens was not asked to consider, and the fairness opinion does not in any
manner address, the price at which Focal common stock or Biosurgery Stock would
trade following either the announcement or consummation of the merger. The
fairness opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions
as they existed on, and could be evaluated, as of the date of the opinion.

    Stephens noted that based on an exchange ratio of 0.1545 of a share of
Biosurgery Stock for each outstanding share of Focal common stock, the value of
common equity, including the value of stock options, plus the amount of assumed
debt of Focal less assumed cash of Focal is approximately $6.9 million,
representing 2.7x Focal's revenues for the latest twelve months and 3.9x, and
1.3x Focal's revenues for the projected fiscal years 2001 and 2002,
respectively.

    The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by
Stephens in connection with its presentation to the Focal board of directors on
April 24, 2001, and the preparation of its fairness opinion.

    STOCK PRICE HISTORY

    To provide contextual data and comparative market data, Stephens examined
the history of the trading prices for Focal common stock for the one-year period
ending April 20, 2001, and for Biosurgery Stock for the period beginning on
December 19, 2000 through April 20, 2001. Stephens reviewed the daily closing
prices of Focal common stock and compared the performance of the price of Focal
common stock to that of the Nasdaq Biotech Stock Index, the Standard and Poor's
500 Stock Index and an index of the share prices of public company comparables.
Stephens also reviewed the daily closing prices of Biosurgery Stock and compared
the performance of the price of Biosurgery Stock to that of the Standard and
Poor's 500 Stock Index, the Nasdaq Biotech Stock Index and Genzyme General
Stock. This information was presented solely to provide the Focal board of
directors with background information regarding the prices of Focal common stock
and Biosurgery Stock over the periods indicated.

    PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY ANALYSIS

    Stephens analyzed the publicly available financial information, operating
data and projected financial performance (per research analyst estimates) of
seven selected publicly traded companies that Stephens believed to be
appropriate for comparison to corresponding financial information and operating
data of Focal. These companies, referred to as the Public Comparables, were:

    - Cryolife, Inc.;

    - Closure Medical Corporation;

    - Kensey Nash Corporation;

    - Vascular Solutions, Inc.;

    - Fusion Medical Technologies, Inc.;

    - Cohesion Technologies, Inc.; and

    - Gliatech Inc.

    The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the ratios of
market value of common equity for the Public Comparables, plus total outstanding
debt less total outstanding cash which is referred to as Enterprise Value. The
information in the table is based on the closing stock price of Focal common
stock on April 20, 2001.

                                                                    PUBLIC COMPARABLE
                                                                        MULTIPLES
                                                              ------------------------------
                                                                LOW       MEDIAN      HIGH
                                                              --------   --------   --------

Enterprise Value as a ratio of:
  Latest twelve months revenues.............................    1.2x       7.1x      17.0x
  Projected fiscal 2001 revenues............................    2.5x       5.7x      12.7x
  Projected fiscal 2002 revenues............................    1.4x       3.2x       9.3x

    Stephens derived a range of implied exchange ratios of:

    - 0.1683 to 0.2036 based on a ratio of Enterprise Value to latest twelve
      months revenues;

    - 0.1112 to 0.1357 based on a ratio of Enterprise Value to projected
      revenues for the twelve month period ending December 31, 2001; and

    - 0.1351 to 0.2080 based on a ratio of Enterprise Value to projected
      revenues for the twelve month period ending December 31, 2002.

    DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS

    Stephens performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Focal based upon
estimates of projected financial performance prepared by Focal management.
Stephens calculated a range of implied exchange ratios using these projections,
based upon the discounted net present value of the sum of the projected stream
of unleveraged free cash flows for the years ending December 31, 2001 to
December 31, 2005 and a projected terminal value at December 31, 2005 less net
debt outstanding (defined as total debt less total cash and cash equivalents) as
of March 31, 2001 divided by the number of Focal's fully-diluted shares
outstanding. Stephens applied several discount rates ranging from 30% to 40% and
multiples of revenue ranging from 3.5x to 4.5x to generate the terminal value.
Utilizing this methodology, the implied exchange ratio ranged from 0.1130 to
0.2362.

    RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS

    Stephens reviewed the relative contribution of Focal's revenue and gross
profit compared to that of the underlying operations of Genzyme Biosurgery
tracked by the Biosurgery Stock for the pro forma twelve months ended
December 31, 2000 and Focal's projected revenue and gross profit compared to
Biosurgery Stock for the projected twelve months ending December 31, 2001.
Stephens' analysis yielded a relative contribution range of 0.4% to 1.2% with a
median of 0.7%. Stephens derived a range of implied exchange ratios of 0.0850 to
0.1315 based upon this range of contribution of revenue and gross profit to
Genzyme Biosurgery.

    The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of
the analyses performed by Stephens but describes, in summary form, the principal
elements of the presentation made by Stephens to the Focal board of directors on
April 24, 2001. The preparation of a fairness opinion involves various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analyses and the implication of these methods to the particular circumstances
and, therefore, an opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description.
Each of the analyses conducted by Stephens was carried out in order to provide a
different perspective on the transaction and to add to the total mix of
information available. Stephens did not form a conclusion as to whether any
individual analysis, considered in isolation, supported or failed to support an
opinion as the fairness of the exchange ratio from a financial point of view.
Rather, in reaching its conclusion, Stephens considered the results of the
analyses in light of each other and ultimately reached its opinion based on the
analyses taken as a whole. Accordingly, notwithstanding the separate factors
summarized above, Stephens has indicated to the Focal board of directors that it
believes that consideration of some of the relevant analyses and factors,
without considering all analyses and factors, could create an incomplete or
inaccurate view of the evaluation process underlying the opinion. The analyses
performed by Stephens are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by
such analyses.

    FEES

    Pursuant to a letter agreement between Focal and Stephens, Focal agreed to
pay Stephens a fee of $250,000 in connection with the delivery of the fairness
opinion. Stephens will also be reimbursed for its out-of-pocket expenses,
including reasonable fees and expenses for its legal counsel. In addition, Focal
has agreed to indemnify Stephens for liabilities related to or arising out of
the engagement, including specified liabilities under the federal securities
laws.

    As part of Stephens' investment banking business, it regularly issues
fairness opinions and is continually engaged in the valuation of companies and
their securities in connection with business reorganizations, private
placements, negotiated underwritings, mergers and acquisitions and valuations
for estate, corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of business,
Stephens and its affiliates at any time may hold long or short positions, and
may trade or otherwise effect transactions as principal or for the accounts of
customers, in debt or equity securities or options on securities of Focal and
Genzyme.

INTERESTS OF FOCAL MANAGEMENT IN THE MERGER

    When you consider the recommendation of the Focal board of directors with
respect to the merger, you should be aware that some officers and directors of
Focal have interests in connection with the merger that are different from or in
addition to yours, as summarized below. In making its determination as to the
advisability of the merger and its decision to recommend the merger, the Focal
board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them among the
other matters in approving the merger agreement.

    In order to retain Focal's management team through a sale of the company, in
October 2000, the compensation committee of the Focal board of directors,
comprised of two non-employee directors, approved compensation and bonus
arrangements payable in connection with a change in control of Focal. As a
result, upon the completion of the merger, Robert J. DePasqua, the chairman of
the Focal board of directors, will receive a cash bonus of $150,000, plus the
unpaid balance of his salary through the end of this year, and Ronald S.
Rudowsky, Focal's president, chief executive officer and a director, will
receive a bonus of $200,000. In addition, upon the completion of the merger,
three other Focal executive officers will receive an aggregate of $350,000 in
bonuses. Mr. Rudowsky and the other three executive officers would be entitled
to bonuses equal to 50% of the amounts described in the two previous sentences
if no change of control transaction involving Focal occurs before December 31,
2001, and the officer continues to be employed by Focal on that date. Upon the
earlier of December 31, 2001, or the completion of the merger or another change
of control transaction involving Focal, the Focal compensation committee
authorized the forgiveness of any then outstanding principal and interest
payable with respect to a loan to Mr. Rudowsky in the principal amount of
$40,000 and a loan to another Focal executive officer in the principal amount of
$42,951.

    Upon the consummation of the merger, Focal anticipates that the employment
of all of its executive officers will be terminated. Each of Focal's officers is
party to an employment or severance agreement which provides for benefits upon a
termination of employment other than for "cause" (each as defined in the
officer's employment or severance agreement). Under these agreements, each
officer is eligible to receive six months (twelve months in the case of
Mr. Rudowsky) of salary and benefits after termination. In addition, during the
specified severance periods under these agreements, all stock options granted to
each of the officers will continue to vest.

    Each of Focal's officers and directors may be indemnified by Focal with
respect to acts and omissions in their capacities as officers and directors of
Focal. In addition, under the merger agreement Genzyme has agreed to maintain
directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the Focal officers and
directors for a period of six years following the closing of the merger.

GENZYME'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

    In considering whether to approve the merger agreement, Genzyme's board of
directors consulted with management. During deliberations, the board of
directors considered the following positive factors:

    - acquiring Focal's surgical sealant products and polymer technology which
      may enhance Genzyme Biosurgery's line of surgical products;

    - acquiring Focal's patent portfolio; and

    - deferring Genzyme's potential obligation to acquire additional shares of
      Focal common stock for cash.

    Genzyme's board of directors also considered a number of potentially
negative factors regarding the merger, including:

    - the risk that the potential advantages of the merger might not be
      realized;

    - Genzyme's ownership of approximately 22% of the outstanding Focal common
      stock and Genzyme's potential acquisition of $5 million worth of
      additional shares pursuant to its stock purchase agreement with Focal
      which, depending on the purchase price for those shares, could provide
      Genzyme with a near majority ownership of Focal's outstanding capital
      stock or with effective control of Focal; and

    - the possibility that Genzyme could acquire Focal for a lower price at a
      future date.

    After evaluating these factors and risks, Genzyme's board of directors
concluded that the Focal merger should provide long-term benefits to Genzyme
stockholders. Consequently, the board of directors approved the merger
agreement.

                      THE MERGER AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    The following is a summary of significant provisions of the merger
agreement. For a more complete understanding of the merger agreement, you should
read the entire agreement which is attached as Annex A and is incorporated into
this proxy statement/prospectus by reference. Genzyme and Focal are also parties
to additional agreements which affect their right and obligations which are
described under "MATERIAL CONTRACTS BETWEEN GENZYME AND FOCAL" on page   .

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MERGER

    In the merger, Sammy Merger Corp., a specially formed, wholly owned
subsidiary of Genzyme, will merge with and into Focal. Focal will be the
surviving corporation and will continue to exist under Delaware law as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Genzyme. The charter and by-laws of the specially formed,
wholly owned subsidiary, as in effect immediately before the merger, will be the
charter and by-laws of the surviving company.

REQUIRED APPROVAL AND EFFECTIVE TIME

    The consummation of the merger requires the approval of the holders of a
majority of the shares of Focal common stock outstanding on May 29, 2001. We
expect to close the merger by the second or third quarter of 2001. The merger
will be effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Delaware
secretary of state, or a later time that we specify in the certificate of
merger. We plan to file the certificate of merger soon after the Focal special
meeting of stockholders.

MERGER CONSIDERATION FOR FOCAL COMMON STOCK

    At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Focal common
stock will automatically convert into the right to receive 0.1545 of a share of
Biosurgery Stock, with cash payable for any fractional share of Biosurgery
Stock. Shares of Focal common stock held by Genzyme will be cancelled. The
exchange ratio was agreed to in arm's-length negotiations between
representatives of Genzyme and Focal.

    Based on the number of shares of Focal common stock outstanding as of the
record date, approximately 2.1 million shares of Biosurgery Stock will be
issuable in the merger, representing approximately 5.7% of the total Biosurgery
Stock to be outstanding after the issuance. This number assumes that no Focal
common stock options or warrants are exercised between the record date and the
effective time.

NO FRACTIONAL SHARES

    Genzyme will not issue fractional shares in the merger. Instead, it will pay
cash to each Focal common stockholder who otherwise would be entitled to receive
a fractional share of Biosurgery Stock. The cash amount will equal the
fractional share number multiplied by the average of the high and low per share
trading prices of Biosurgery Stock as reported by The Nasdaq National Market on
the trading day on which the effective time of the merger occurs.

EXCHANGE OF FOCAL COMMON STOCK CERTIFICATES

    Promptly after the effective time, Genzyme or American Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, Genzyme's exchange agent, will mail transmittal forms to each
person who held shares of Focal common stock as of the effective time specifying
how to exchange Focal common stock certificates for Biosurgery Stock
certificates and any cash for fractional shares.

  DO NOT SEND IN YOUR FOCAL CERTIFICATES UNTIL YOU RECEIVE A TRANSMITTAL FORM.

    If your certificates for any shares of Focal common stock have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, you will be required to submit to the exchange agent
appropriate evidence regarding the ownership, loss, theft or destruction of the
certificate, an affidavit to that effect, a customary indemnification agreement,
and if reasonably necessary, a bond securing performance of the indemnification
agreement.

    Genzyme will honor a request from a person surrendering a Focal common stock
certificate that the Biosurgery Stock being given in exchange be issued to a
person other than the registered holder of the certificate on the exchange
agent's books, so long as the requesting person:

    - submits all documents necessary to evidence and effect the transfer to the
      new holder; and

    - pays any transfer or other taxes for issuing shares of Biosurgery Stock to
      a person other than the registered holder of the certificate, unless the
      requesting person satisfactorily establishes to Genzyme that any tax has
      been paid or is inapplicable.

    Holders of Focal common stock exchanged for Biosurgery Stock in the merger
will be entitled to receive dividends and other distributions on Biosurgery
Stock (without interest) that are declared or made with a record date after the
effective time. Dividends or other distributions will not be paid to any former
holder of Focal common stock, however, until that holder surrenders the shares
of Focal common stock to the exchange agent.

TREATMENT OF FOCAL STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

    STOCK OPTIONS

    At the effective time of the merger, Genzyme will assume each outstanding
and unexercised option to purchase shares of Focal common stock granted under
Focal's 1992 Incentive Stock Plan, 1999 Stock Incentive Plan and 1997 Director
Option Plan, whether or not exercisable. Each assumed option will continue to be
governed by the same terms and conditions of the applicable Focal stock option
plan and option agreement in effect immediately before the effective time of the
merger, except that:

    - each option will be exercisable for a number of shares of Biosurgery Stock
      equal to the number of shares of Focal common stock that were issuable
      upon exercise of the option immediately before the effective time
      multiplied by 0.1545, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares
      of Biosurgery Stock; and

    - the per share exercise price for the shares of Biosurgery Stock issuable
      upon exercise of the assumed option will be equal to the exercise price
      per share of Focal common stock at which the option was exercisable
      immediately before the effective time divided by 0.1545, rounded up to the
      nearest whole cent.

    On April 30, 2001, options to purchase 1,742,664 shares of Focal common
stock were outstanding. The weighted average exercise price per share of these
options was $3.88. These options will be converted into options to purchase
approximately 269,242 shares of Biosurgery Stock; the weighted average exercise
price per share of these options as converted into options to purchase
Biosurgery Stock will be $25.11.

    Genzyme has agreed to register on Form S-8 the shares of Biosurgery Stock
subject to Focal common stock options. Genzyme expects that the registration of
these shares will be effective shortly after the effective time of the merger,
and Genzyme has agreed to use reasonable commercial efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration for so long as the former Focal common stock
options remain outstanding.

    WARRANTS

    At the effective time of the merger, Genzyme will assume outstanding
warrants to purchase up to 43,782 shares of Focal common stock with a weighted
average exercise price per share of $11.56. Each assumed warrant will continue
to be governed by the same terms and conditions that governed it immediately
before the effective time of the merger except that the warrants shall be
exercisable for shares of Biosurgery Stock rather than Focal common stock. The
number of shares of Biosurgery Stock issuable upon exercise of the assumed
warrants, as well as the exercise price, will be adjusted based on the merger's
exchange ratio of 0.1545.

TREATMENT OF FOCAL BENEFITS AND OTHER EMPLOYEE MATTERS

    All Focal employees who remain employed by Focal or Genzyme after the merger
will be eligible to participate in Genzyme's or the surviving corporation's
health and welfare benefit plans. Genzyme has agreed to give these Focal
employees service credit for service with Focal for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting, and entitlement to benefits, under any
Genzyme employee benefit plans (except defined benefit plans). Genzyme has also
agreed to give service credit for pre-existing condition exclusion periods and
waiting periods under any Genzyme welfare benefit plans that a continuing Focal
employee is eligible to participate in after the merger.

    Focal has agreed that it will not make any discretionary contribution to the
Focal 401(k) plan or make any required contribution to it in Focal common stock.
Focal has agreed to terminate its 401(k) plan as of the day immediately
preceding the closing date of the merger. Following the closing of the merger,
Focal employees who remain employed by Focal or Genzyme would be eligible to
participate in Genzyme's 401(k) plan and will be given credit for service with
Focal for purposes of determining participation and vesting under Genzyme's
401(k) plan.

    Focal has also agreed to terminate its 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
prior to the effective date of the merger.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

    The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger. The discussion is based on the Internal Revenue
Code, related regulations, existing administrative interpretations and court
decisions as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, all of which may
change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion does not address the
effects of the merger under any state, local or foreign tax laws. This
discussion assumes that Focal common stockholders hold their shares of Focal
common stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the
Internal Revenue Code. This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S.
federal income taxation that may be important to you either in light of your
particular circumstances or if you are subject to special rules. These special
rules include those relating to:

    - stockholders who are not U.S. citizens or residents or that are foreign
      corporations, partnerships, estates or trusts;

    - financial institutions;

    - tax-exempt organizations;

    - insurance companies;

    - dealers in securities;

    - stockholders who acquired their Focal common stock by exercising options
      or similar derivative securities or otherwise as compensation; and

    - stockholders who hold their Focal common stock as part of a hedge,
      straddle, appreciated financial position or conversion transaction.

    TAX CONSEQUENCES TO FOCAL COMMON STOCKHOLDERS

    The merger will be treated as a taxable sale of Focal common stock by Focal
stockholders for federal income tax purposes. It will not be a tax-deferred
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code because of the cash purchase of 10,000 shares of Focal common stock by
Genzyme from an existing stockholder prior to the merger. Accordingly, a holder
of Focal common stock will recognize gain, or loss, equal to the amount by which
the fair market value of the Biosurgery Stock, plus cash in lieu of any
fractional share received by such holder in the merger exceeds, or is less than,
the holder's adjusted basis for the shares of Focal common stock surrendered in
the merger. Gain or loss must be computed separately for blocks of Focal common
stock acquired at different times and for different amounts. Such gain or loss
will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares of Focal common stock have
been held for more than one year. A holder's aggregate tax basis in the
Biosurgery Stock received in the merger will equal the fair market value of such
shares at the effective time of the merger. A holder's holding period for the
Biosurgery Stock received in the merger will begin on the day following the
effective time of the merger.

    TAX CONSEQUENCES TO GENZYME AND FOCAL

    Genzyme, including its merger subsidiary, and Focal will not recognize a
gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes by reason of the merger.

    BACKUP WITHHOLDING

    Unless a non-corporate holder of Focal common stock complies with reporting
and/or certification procedures or is an exempt recipient under the backup
withholding and information reporting provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
and Treasury regulations, the holder may be subject to a 31% backup withholding
tax on any cash payments received in the merger. Any amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against the
holder's federal income tax liability, provided the required information is
furnished to the IRS.

    THE ABOVE DISCUSSION IS ONLY INTENDED TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A GENERAL SUMMARY.
IT IS NOT A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION OF EVERY POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL
INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCE OR ANY OTHER CONSEQUENCE OF THE MERGER. IN ADDITION, THE
DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE
CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. MOREOVER, THIS DISCUSSION DOES NOT
ADDRESS ANY NON-INCOME TAX OR ANY FOREIGN, STATE OR LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF
THE MERGER. ACCORDINGLY, WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO CONSULT WITH YOUR TAX ADVISOR
TO DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX
CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE MERGER.

CASH PURCHASE OF SHARES

    Genzyme has agreed to purchase an aggregate of 10,000 shares of Focal common
stock for cash from an existing stockholder immediately prior to the closing of
the merger. The price for these shares will equal the average of the high and
low per share trading prices of Focal common stock as reported on The Nasdaq
National Market on the trading day on which the effective time of the merger
occurs.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

    Genzyme will account for the merger using the purchase method of accounting
for a business combination. Under this method of accounting, the assets and
liabilities of Focal, including intangible assets, will be recorded at their
fair market values. The results of operations and cash flows of Focal will be
included in Genzyme's financial statements following the completion of the
merger. Consistent

with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States or GAAP,
amounts assigned to purchased in-process research and development--i.e., Focal
research and development projects that are still in process at the closing of
the merger, but which, if unsuccessful, have no alternative future use--must be
charged to expense on the date that the merger closes.

COVENANTS UNDER THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    FOCAL'S INTERIM OPERATIONS

    Until the closing of the merger, and unless Genzyme has otherwise agreed in
writing, Focal has agreed to do the following:

      or programs.

    Focal has also agreed until the merger closes, with some exceptions, that it
will not do or agree to do any of the following without Genzyme's prior written

    - change the compensation payable to any officer, director, employee, agent
      or consultant or enter into any employment, severance or other agreement

      or redeem any shares of its capital stock, except upon the exercise of
      convertible securities outstanding on the date of execution of the merger
      agreement or in compliance with the stock purchase agreement between Focal
      and Genzyme;

    - amend its charter or by-laws;

    - make any material acquisition of property or assets outside the ordinary
      course of business;

    - authorize capital expenditures exceeding $50,000 singly or $100,000 in the
      aggregate;

    - change any of its accounting practices or principles or restate its
      financial statements except as may be required by law or to comply with
      generally accepted accounting principles;

    - make any tax election or settle or compromise any material tax liability,
      change its tax accounting methods or periods, enter into any tax-related
      closing agreement, surrender its right to any tax refund, or consent to
      any extension or waiver of the limitations period applicable to any tax
      claim or assessment;

    - settle or compromise any pending or threatened material legal proceeding;

    - enter into or modify any material license, development, research or
      collaboration agreement; or

    - modify, amend, terminate, waive, release or assign any material rights or
      claims under any confidentiality agreement to which Focal is a party.

    NO SOLICITATION BY FOCAL

    Focal has agreed not to (1) solicit any person regarding any competing
transaction to this merger, (2) participate in any negotiations with or provide
information to, any person seeking any competing transaction to this merger; or
(3) grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement.
However, prior to adoption of the merger agreement by the stockholders of Focal,
Focal may enter into discussions and negotiations with, or provide information
to, a person making an unsolicited, bona fide written proposal for a competing
transaction if:

    - Focal has not breached any of the restrictions related to solicitation of
      other transactions,

    - the Focal board of directors concludes in good faith after consultation
      with its financial advisor that the proposal is reasonably likely to lead
      to a competing transaction more favorable for Focal's stockholders than
      the proposed merger (including adjustment to the terms and conditions
      proposed by Genzyme in response to the proposal), and

    - the Focal board of directors concludes in good faith after consultation
      with outside legal counsel that consideration of a competing transaction
      is required by the board's fiduciary duties under applicable law.

    These provisions do not restrict Focal's communications with respect to a
tender offer as required by law. In addition, Focal has agreed to inform Genzyme
of any inquiry it receives relating to a competing transaction. The merger
agreement defines a competing transaction as a possible acquisition of Focal or
all of its assets or capital stock or, except in the ordinary course of business
and consistent with Focal's covenants in the merger agreement, a material
portion of its assets, or any merger, reorganization, consolidation, business
combination, share exchange, tender offer, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation or similar transaction involving Focal.

    RECOMMENDATION OF THE FOCAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    The Focal board of directors has agreed to take all lawful action that does
not conflict with its fiduciary duties to secure the vote of Focal stockholders
to adopt the merger agreement.

    INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE FOR FOCAL OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

    Genzyme has agreed to cause the surviving corporation in the merger to honor
Focal's indemnification obligations under agreements with its directors and
officers and its charter and by-laws in effect before the effective time of the
merger. The charter and by-laws of the surviving corporation will contain
exculpation and indemnification provisions with respect to Focal's directors and
officers that are no less favorable than those contained in Focal's charter and
by-laws immediately prior to the merger. Genzyme may not amend these provisions
for a period of six years after the effective time of the merger in a manner
that adversely affects the rights of Focal's former directors and officers,
unless otherwise required by law. Genzyme has agreed, for a period of six years
after the effective time of the merger, to maintain or to cause the surviving
corporation to maintain in effect directors' and officers' liability insurance
for Focal's current directors and officers on terms comparable to those
applicable to Focal's current directors and officers. However, neither Genzyme
nor the surviving corporation will be required to pay more than 200% of the
annual premium currently paid by Focal for such directors' and officers'
liability insurance coverage.

    OTHER COVENANTS

    The merger agreement contains covenants of both parties relating to, among
other things, expenses, public announcements, notifications, employee matters
and further assurances, and cooperation in obtaining consents and approvals.

    Focal has also agreed, among other things, to:

    - grant Genzyme access to company information as is reasonably necessary to
      investigate Focal; and

    - engage a proxy solicitor to assist Focal in obtaining the stockholder vote
      required to approve the merger agreement, if Genzyme so requests.

    Genzyme has also agreed, among other things, to:

    - notify The Nasdaq National Market of the shares of Biosurgery Stock to be
      issued in the merger; and

    - cause all shares of Focal common stock owned by Genzyme to be voted in
      favor of the merger agreement, provided that, under the letter agreement,
      prior to the earliest of (1) September 1, 2001, (2) the date that the
      merger agreement can be terminated by Genzyme because of a breach of the
      merger agreement by Focal or (3) the termination of the merger agreement,
      the number of shares so voted, together with the Focal common stock
      subject to the voting agreement as described above, does not exceed 40% of
      the outstanding shares of Focal common stock.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

    Each of Genzyme and Focal has made customary representations and warranties
to the other in the merger agreement regarding, among other things:
