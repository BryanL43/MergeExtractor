    proxy as a vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement. IF YOU ABSTAIN FROM
    VOTING OR DO NOT VOTE BY NOT RETURNING YOUR PROXY CARD, IT WILL HAVE THE
    EFFECT OF A VOTE AGAINST THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

Q:  CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE MAILED MY SIGNED PROXY?

A:  Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted. You
    can do this in one of three ways. First, you can send a written notice
    stating that you would like to revoke your proxy. Second, you can complete
    and submit a new proxy dated after the date of your original proxy. If you
    choose either of these two methods, you must submit your notice of
    revocation or your new proxy to the Secretary of Aronex Pharmaceuticals at
    8707 Technology Forest Place, The Woodlands, Texas 77381-1191. Third, you
    can attend the special meeting and vote in person. Simply attending the
    meeting, however, will not revoke your proxy; you must also vote at the
    special meeting.

Q:  IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
    SHARES FOR ME?

A:  Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to
    vote. Follow the information provided to you by your broker. WITHOUT YOUR
    INSTRUCTIONS, YOUR BROKER WILL NOT VOTE YOUR SHARES, WHICH WILL HAVE THE
    EFFECT OF A VOTE AGAINST THE MERGER.

Q:  SHOULD I SEND IN MY ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A:  No. After the merger is completed, you will receive written instructions for
    exchanging your stock certificates. Please do not send in your stock
    certificates with your proxy.

Q:  WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A:  We are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. If
    approved by the Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders, Antigenics expects to
    complete the merger by the end of             , 2001.

Q:  HOW MANY SHARES OF ANTIGENICS COMMON STOCK WILL BE ISSUED TO ARONEX
    PHARMACEUTICALS'S STOCKHOLDERS?

A:  It is estimated that Antigenics will issue approximately
    shares of its common stock and                contingent value rights to
    Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders in the merger, based on the number of
    shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock outstanding on
                   , 2001, and based on the average closing price of Antigenics
    common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market for the ten trading
    days prior to                , 2001.

Q:  WHAT PERCENTAGE OF ANTIGENICS'S COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING WILL THIS
    REPRESENT?

A:  These shares (not including the shares underlying the contingent value
    rights) will represent approximately      % of the outstanding Antigenics
    common stock after the merger. Antigenics shares held by its stockholders
    before the merger will represent approximately      % of the outstanding
    Antigenics shares after the merger.

                                   THE MERGER

SUMMARY OF THE TRANSACTION (SEE PAGE   )

     In the proposed merger, Nasa Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Antigenics, will be merged into Aronex
Pharmaceuticals. Aronex Pharmaceuticals will be the surviving corporation and
the name of the surviving corporation will be Aronex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

     The proposed merger will occur following adoption of the merger agreement
by the Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders and satisfaction or waiver of the
other conditions to the merger. The merger agreement is attached as Annex A. We
encourage you to read it because it is the legal document that governs the
merger.

WHAT THE HOLDERS OF ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS COMMON STOCK WILL RECEIVE IN THE
MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     In the proposed merger, Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stockholders will
receive Antigenics common stock and contingent value rights to receive
additional shares of Antigenics common stock. When Antigenics and Aronex
Pharmaceuticals complete the merger, each outstanding share of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals common stock will convert into a right to receive a fraction of
a share of Antigenics common stock at an exchange ratio based on Antigenics
common stock's then-average closing price. The average closing price will be
Antigenics common stock's average closing price for the 10 trading days ending
the second trading day before the closing of the merger. If the average closing
price falls within $12.00 and $20.00, then the exchange ratio will equal $1.10
divided by that price. If the average closing price is less than $12.00, then
the exchange ratio will be 0.0917. If the average closing price is greater than
$20.00, then the exchange ratio will be 0.0550. Antigenics will not issue any
fractional shares of Antigenics common stock in the merger. Instead, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals stockholders will receive cash for fractional shares.

     The contingent value rights will be governed by the contingent value rights
agreement, the form of which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as
Annex B. We encourage you to read this agreement carefully. A contingent value
right represents the right to receive a fraction of a share of Antigenics common
stock if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, commonly known as the FDA,
approves ATRAGEN(R) for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, or APL,
which is referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the "milestone," on
or before July 6, 2002. The fraction shall equal an exchange ratio, which is
calculated by dividing $0.15 by the average per share closing price of
Antigenics common stock during a 10-day trading period ending the third trading
day prior to the date the milestone is achieved. If the average closing price
falls within $12.00 and $20.00, then the exchange ratio will equal $0.15 divided
by that price. If the average closing price is less than $12.00, then the
exchange ratio will be 0.0125. If the average closing price is greater than
$20.00, then the exchange ratio will be .0075. In addition, the exchange ratio
will be reduced in 10% increments for each $50,000 increment above $4,000,000
that Aronex Pharmaceuticals incurs certain merger transaction expenses. If these
merger transaction expenses exceed $4,500,000, the exchange ratio will be 0, and
no Antigenics common stock shall be issued under the contingent value rights.
See "The Merger and the Merger Agreement -- Merger Consideration for Aronex
Pharmaceuticals Stock and Exchange Ratios" for a description of the transaction
expenses.

     If the milestone is not achieved on or before July 6, 2002 or specific
merger transaction expenses are greater than $4,500,000, the holders of
contingent value rights will not receive any additional shares of Antigenics
common stock.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (SEE PAGE   )

     We intend that the merger qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code. If the merger does qualify as a
reorganization, no gain or loss will be recognized by Aronex Pharmaceuticals,
Antigenics or the merger subsidiary by reason of the merger. Except for any cash
you receive instead of fractional shares, you will not recognize gain or loss on
your receipt of Antigenics common stock, including your receipt of any
additional shares of Antigenics common stock pursuant to the contingent value
rights agreement, in exchange for your shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals stock in
the merger.

     BECAUSE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER MAY VARY DEPENDING UPON EACH
ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS STOCKHOLDER'S PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, ANTIGENICS URGES
YOU TO CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISORS ABOUT THE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN
TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE MERGER.

APPRAISAL OR DISSENTERS' RIGHTS (SEE PAGE   )

     Under Section 262(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals stockholders do not have appraisal or dissenters' rights in
connection with the merger.

ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     The Aronex Pharmaceuticals board concluded that the merger was in the best
interests of Aronex Pharmaceuticals and its stockholders. In reaching its
decision, the board considered, among other things:

     - Aronex Pharmaceuticals's difficulty in raising additional capital to meet
       its ongoing commitments as well as its drug development goals;

     - Aronex Pharmaceuticals's inability to meet the continued listing
       requirements of the Nasdaq National Market and the current difficulty, in
       light of the recent FDA non-approval letter for ATRAGEN for APL, of
       raising sufficient capital to satisfy such requirements;

     - increased ability of the combined company to fund research and
       development of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products;

     - the opportunity the merger affords Aronex Pharmaceuticals's stockholders
       to reduce their exposure to the risks inherent in Aronex
       Pharmaceuticals's reliance on a limited number of currently
       uncommercialized products;

     - the difficulties in competing against larger companies with greater
       financial resources;

     - the merger will allow holders of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock to
       retain an equity interest in the combined company, to achieve greater
       liquidity than could be achieved by continuing to hold Aronex
       Pharmaceuticals common stock, and to participate in the potential growth
       of Antigenics;

     - the board's belief that the exchange ratio fractions are favorable based
       upon the recent trading prices for Aronex Pharmaceuticals and Antigenics
       common stock;

     - the likelihood that the merger will be consummated, including the terms
       and conditions of the merger agreement, and the limited conditions to the
       consummation of the merger;

     - the oral opinion of Robertson Stephens delivered April 20, 2001
       (subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated April 23, 2001) that
       as of such date and based on and subject to the assumptions, limitations,
       and qualifications referred to in the written opinion, the merger
       consideration was fair to holders of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock
       from a financial point of view; and

     - although the FDA recently rejected Aronex Pharmaceuticals's New Drug
       Application, or NDA, for ATRAGEN in APL, Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
       stockholders have the opportunity for recognizing additional
       consideration should the NDA be approved on or before July 6, 2002.

OPINION OF ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR (SEE PAGE   )

     In deciding to approve the merger, the Aronex Pharmaceuticals board
considered an opinion from its financial advisor, Robertson Stephens, Inc. On
April 23, 2001, Robertson Stephens delivered its written opinion to the Aronex
Pharmaceuticals board, that as of that date and based on and subject to the
assumptions, limitations, and qualifications referred to in the opinion, the
merger consideration pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock. The full
text of this written opinion is attached as Annex C to this proxy
statement/prospectus. Aronex Pharmaceuticals encourages you to read this opinion
carefully in its entirety. The opinion of Robertson Stephens is directed to the
Aronex Pharmaceuticals board and is not a recommendation to any stockholder on
how to vote on the merger or the merger agreement.

ANTIGENICS REASONS FOR THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     In reaching its decision to approve the merger, the Antigenics board
considered, among other things, the benefits of:

     - Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products, technology, and patent portfolio;

     - the positive effect on Antigenics's ability to produce effective
       therapies from acquiring Aronex Pharmaceuticals's technology; and

     - the expansion of Antigenics's product pipeline, particularly by the
       addition of products in the later stages of FDA approval.

                              THE SPECIAL MEETING

DATE AND PURPOSE (SEE PAGE   )

     A special meeting of Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders will be held at
the offices of Palmer & Dodge LLP, One Beacon Street,                Floor,
Boston, Massachusetts 02108 on             , 2001 at 9:00 a.m., local time.

RECORD DATE; VOTING RIGHTS (SEE PAGE   )

     If you owned shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock as of the close
of business on             , 2001, the record date for the special meeting, you
may vote on the adoption of the merger agreement.

     On that date, there were        shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common
stock outstanding. Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders will have one vote at the
meeting for each share of common stock they owned on the record date.

QUORUM; REQUIRED VOTES (SEE PAGES      )

     The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals common stock must be present, in person or by proxy, at the
Aronex Pharmaceuticals special meeting for there to be a quorum. To approve the
merger, holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals common stock must vote to adopt the merger agreement. IF YOU
FAIL TO VOTE BY NOT RETURNING YOUR PROXY CARD OR BY ABSTAINING FROM VOTING, IT
WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF A VOTE AGAINST THE MERGER. A broker who holds Aronex
Pharmaceuticals stock as your nominee generally will not have authority to vote
your shares unless you provide the broker with voting instructions.

     On the record date, directors and officers of Antigenics as a group owned
no shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals stock, and directors and officers of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals as a group owned approximately      % of the outstanding shares
of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS BOARD (SEE PAGE   )

     ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS BELIEVES THAT THE MERGER IS IN
THE BEST INTEREST OF ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS STOCKHOLDERS AND UNANIMOUSLY
RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

                           OTHER SELECTED INFORMATION

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS (SEE PAGE   )

     The officers and directors of Aronex Pharmaceuticals may have interests in
the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals stockholders. The Aronex Pharmaceuticals and Antigenics boards
were aware of these interests and considered them in approving the merger
agreement.

VOTING AGREEMENTS (SEE PAGE   )

     Two Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders and all of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
directors and executive officers holding Aronex Pharmaceuticals stock have
entered into voting agreements with Antigenics, in which they agreed to vote
their shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock in favor of adopting the
merger agreement. They also granted irrevocable proxies to an executive officer
of Antigenics to vote their shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock at the
special meeting. Approximately 3,113,764 shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common
stock and options to acquire an additional 1,450,286 shares that are exercisable
during the 60 days following April 24, 2001, or approximately   % of the

outstanding shares and approximately   % of the outstanding shares including the
options, are subject to the voting agreements and irrevocable proxies. These
voting agreements effectively ensure that   % of the outstanding shares of
Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock will vote in favor of adoption of the merger
agreement.

TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS (SEE PAGE   )

     Under the terms of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's amended and restated 1989 stock
option plan and the amended and restated 1998 stock option plan and their
related option agreements, all of the options granted under those plans shall
accelerate in full and be fully exercisable immediately prior to the merger. In
addition, except for an option granted to one of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
directors, all of the options granted under the Aronex Pharmaceuticals's amended
and restated 1993 non-employee director stock option plan are fully exercisable
or will be fully exercisable as a result of the merger.

     Each option and warrant to purchase shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals stock
outstanding after the merger will be assumed by Antigenics and will become an
option or warrant, as the case may be, to acquire Antigenics common stock.
Antigenics will adjust the number of shares issuable upon exercise and the
exercise prices to reflect the merger's exchange ratio. If the option or warrant
is exercised prior to July 6, 2002 or the date the milestone is achieved,
whichever is earlier, the option holder or warrant holder will receive that
number of contingent value rights equal to the number of shares of Antigenics
common stock subject to the option or warrant; and if the option or warrant is
exercised after the date the milestone is achieved (so long as it is achieved
prior to July 6, 2002), the option holder or warrant holder will receive that
number of shares of Antigenics common stock that would have been issued, if any,
had the holder of the option or warrant held the contingent value rights on the
date the milestone was achieved. All of the options that were accelerated as a
result of the merger as described above shall remain fully exercisable following
the merger.

EMPLOYEE MATTERS (SEE PAGE   )

     Antigenics has agreed to give credit for services rendered to Aronex
Pharmaceuticals while employed there under its employee benefit plans to Aronex
Pharmaceuticals employees who remain with the company after the merger.
Antigenics has also agreed to assume Aronex Pharmaceuticals's employment,
severance and other compensation agreements.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (SEE PAGE   )

     Antigenics expects to account for the merger under the purchase method of
accounting, which means the assets and liabilities of Aronex Pharmaceuticals,
including its intangible assets, will be recorded on Antigenics's books at their
fair values. The results of operations and cash flows of Aronex Pharmaceuticals
will be included in Antigenics's consolidated financial statements prospectively
as of the closing of the merger.

REGULATORY APPROVALS (SEE PAGE   )

     We are not aware of any governmental or regulatory approvals required for
closing the merger other than compliance with federal securities laws.

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     We must satisfy the following conditions before completing the merger:

     - Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders must adopt the merger agreement; and

     - the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a
       part must not be the subject of any stop order or related proceeding.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE   )

     We can mutually terminate the merger agreement without completing the
merger. Either Antigenics or Aronex Pharmaceuticals may terminate the agreement
if the merger is not completed by September 30, 2001, and under other
circumstances, including failure to obtain required stockholder approval.

TERMINATION FEES AND EXPENSES (SEE PAGE   )

     If Antigenics terminates the merger agreement under circumstances involving
an alternative acquisition proposal made to or by Aronex Pharmaceuticals, or
through a tender or exchange offer, or if Antigenics's closing conditions are
not satisfied by Aronex Pharmaceuticals, Aronex Pharmaceuticals may be required
to pay a termination fee of $1,200,000 to Antigenics. If Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's closing conditions are not satisfied by Antigenics, Antigenics
may be required to pay $1,200,000 to Aronex Pharmaceuticals.

     If Antigenics and Aronex Pharmaceuticals do not complete the merger, each
party generally will pay its own expenses. However, if the agreement is
terminated by Antigenics because Aronex Pharmaceuticals's directors have
undertaken certain actions permitted under the agreement in furtherance of an
alternative transaction, Aronex Pharmaceuticals will pay Antigenics's reasonable
fees and expenses. If Antigenics and Aronex Pharmaceuticals complete the merger,
the combined company will be responsible for unpaid expenses.

COMPARATIVE STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS (SEE PAGE   )

     When Antigenics and Aronex Pharmaceuticals complete the merger, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals stockholders will hold shares of Antigenics common stock. Their
rights will thus be governed by Antigenics's charter and by-laws.

     The market price of Antigenics common stock is likely to fluctuate before
and after the merger is completed. Antigenics cannot predict the future prices
for its stock, or on which markets it will be traded in the future.

     No cash dividends have ever been paid or declared on shares of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals common stock or Antigenics common stock. Antigenics does not
anticipate paying cash dividends on its stock in the foreseeable future.

                 ANTIGENICS SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA

     Antigenics is providing the following information to aid you in your
analysis of the financial aspects of the merger. Antigenics derived the selected
balance sheet data set forth below as of December 31, 1999 and 2000, and the
statement of operations data for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2000, from its audited consolidated financial statements
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. Antigenics
derived the selected balance sheet data as of December 31, 1998, and selected
statement of operations data for the two years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997,
from its audited financial statements which are not included in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

     Antigenics derived the selected financial data for the three months ended
March 31, 2000 and 2001 from its unaudited consolidated financial statements
which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. The
unaudited consolidated financial statement data includes, in Antigenics's
opinion, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that
are necessary for a fair presentation of their financial position and the
results of their operations for these periods. Operating results for the three
months ended March 31, 2001 are not necessarily indicative of the results that
may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2001. This information
is only a summary and you should read it in conjunction with Antigenics's
historical consolidated financial statements and related notes and "Antigenics's
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" contained in Antigenics's annual reports, quarterly reports, and
other information on file with the SEC. For more details on how you can obtain
these reports and other information, you should read the section of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on
page   .

     Prior to Antigenics's converting to a corporation in February 2000, as a
limited liability company, no federal, state or local income taxes were levied
on Antigenics. Each member of the limited liability company was individually
responsible for reporting his share of Antigenics's net income or loss on his
personal tax returns. As a result, Antigenics will not be able to offset future
taxable income, if any, against losses incurred prior to the closing of the
conversion to a corporation.

     Given Antigenics's history of incurring operating losses, management
believes that it is more likely than not that any deferred tax assets, net of
deferred tax liabilities, will not be realized. Therefore, there is no income
tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements for periods ended after
February 2000 because of a loss before income taxes and the need to recognize a
valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets.

     Increases in cash and cash equivalents, total current assets, total assets
and stockholders' equity in the periods presented below include the effects of
the receipt of net proceeds from Antigenics's equity offerings that totaled
approximately $18.0 million, $41.4 million, and $66.8 million in 1998, 1999, and
2000. In addition, in November 2000, Antigenics acquired Aquila
Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. through the issuance of Antigenics common stock. The
acquisition of Aquila was accounted for as a purchase and resulted in increases
in total assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity of $14.6 million, $5.3
million and $16.9 million respectively, after the write-off of acquired
in-process research and development of $25.8 million.

                                                                                                THREE MONTHS

(1) Prior to Antigenics's conversion from a limited liability company to a
    corporation in February 2000, in accordance with federal, state and local
    income tax regulations which provide that no income taxes are levied on
    United States limited liability companies, each member of the limited
    liability company was individually responsible for reporting his share of
    the company's net income or loss. Accordingly, Antigenics has not provided
    for income taxes in their consolidated financial statements for periods
    before February 2000. Given Antigenics's history of incurring operating
    losses, no income tax benefit is recognized in their consolidated financial
    statements for periods after February 2000 because of a loss before income
    taxes and the need to recognize a valuation allowance on net deferred tax
    assets.

           ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA

     The selected financial data set forth below are derived from Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's financial statements as of and for each of the years in the
five-year period ended December 31, 2000, which have been audited by Arthur
Andersen LLP, independent public accountants and unaudited financial statements
for the three months ended March 31, 2000 and 2001. In order to complete the
development and other activities to commercialize Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
products, additional financing will be required. Accordingly, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's independent public accountants' report on the financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2000 includes an explanatory fourth
paragraph expressing substantial doubt about Aronex Pharmaceuticals's ability to
continue as a going concern. In Aronex Pharmaceuticals's opinion, the
information for the three months ended March 31, 2000 and 2001 reflects all
adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a
fair statement of the results of operations and financial condition. Results for
interim periods should not be considered indicative of results for any other
periods or for the year. This information is only a summary and you should read
it in conjunction with Aronex Pharmaceuticals's historical financial statements
and related notes and "Aronex Pharmaceuticals Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained in this
proxy statement/prospectus.

        SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The following selected unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data
present the consolidated financial data of Antigenics and Aronex Pharmaceuticals
after giving effect to the merger, assuming the merger had been effective for
the periods indicated. The selected unaudited pro forma consolidated financial
data for the year ended December 31, 2000 and as of March 31, 2001 and for the
three months then ended were derived from, and should be read in conjunction
with, the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet and unaudited
pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations, including the notes,
which are contained in this proxy statement/prospectus. You should read the
selected unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data in
conjunction with the historical financial statements of both Antigenics and
Aronex Pharmaceuticals, which are incorporated by reference or contained in this
proxy statement/prospectus. Antigenics has presented the selected unaudited pro
forma condensed consolidated financial data for illustration purposes only in
accordance with the assumptions set forth below. This data does not necessarily
show what the operating results or financial position would have been if the
merger had been completed at the beginning of the period indicated, nor does it
indicate the future operating results or financial position of the combined
enterprise. The selected unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
data do not include any adjustments to reflect any cost savings or other
synergies anticipated as a result of the merger.

                           COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

     We are providing the following comparative per share information to aid you
in your analysis of the financial aspects of the merger. You should read this
information in conjunction with Antigenics's historical consolidated financial
statements that are incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus and Aronex Pharmaceuticals's historical financial
statements and unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements and the
related notes that are included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated per share data presented below reflects the
purchase method of accounting for business combinations. The results may have
been different if Antigenics and Aronex Pharmaceuticals had always been
consolidated.

     Both Antigenics and Aronex Pharmaceuticals have fiscal years ending on
December 31. The Aronex Pharmaceuticals pro forma equivalent per share data
equals an assumed exchange ratio of 0.0645 multiplied by the Antigenics pro
forma consolidated per share data. This exchange ratio is based on an assumed
value of Antigenics common stock of $17.051 based on the average closing price
for the ten trading days ending the second trading day before closing the
merger, assuming the closing occurred on May 18, 2001. The pro forma per share
data are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred if
the merger had been completed on the date indicated or the results that will
occur after the merger. See "Selected Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial
Information."

                                  RISK FACTORS

     In addition to the other information included in this proxy
statement/prospectus, you should consider carefully the risk factors described
below in deciding how to vote on the merger proposal. You should keep these risk
factors in mind when you read forward-looking statements.

                          RISKS RELATING TO THE MERGER

     YOU MAY RECEIVE LESS THAN $1.10 WORTH OF ANTIGENICS COMMON STOCK FOR EACH
SHARE OF ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS COMMON STOCK YOU OWN, AND YOU MAY NOT RECEIVE
ANY ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR THE CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS.

     In the merger, each share of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock will be
converted into the right to receive a fraction of a share of Antigenics common
stock equal to the exchange ratio. The exchange ratio will be between 0.0550 and
0.0917, depending on the market price for Antigenics common stock. If the
average closing price of Antigenics common stock is less than $12.00 during the
10-day trading period ending the second trading day before the closing date of
the merger, you will receive 0.0917 of a share of Antigenics common stock for
each share of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock. This may be less than $1.10
worth of Antigenics common stock. Aronex Pharmaceuticals cannot terminate the
merger agreement because this value is below $1.10. The actual number of shares
of Antigenics common stock issued will not be determined until two trading days
before the closing date of the merger. The market value of Antigenics common
stock on and after the closing date of the merger may vary significantly from
the prices on the date of execution of the merger agreement, the date of this
proxy statement/prospectus or the date on which you vote on the merger.

     In the merger, each share of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock will also
convert into a contingent value right. The contingent value right represents the
right to receive a fraction of a share of Antigenics common stock equal to an
exchange ratio if the milestone is achieved and the transaction expenses are
below a certain amount. The milestone may not be achieved on or before July 6,
2002 due to numerous factors, including a delay in the FDA's approval of ATRAGEN
in APL or the transaction expenses may exceed $4,500,000. In either case, you
would not receive any Antigenics common stock for your contingent value rights.

ANTIGENICS FACES DIFFERENT MARKET RISKS FROM THOSE FACED BY ARONEX
PHARMACEUTICALS, AND THESE RISKS MAY CAUSE THE VALUE OF THE SHARES OF ANTIGENICS
COMMON STOCK ISSUED TO YOU TO DECLINE.

     In the merger you will receive shares of Antigenics common stock.
Antigenics common stock has recently experienced extreme fluctuations in price
and volume. The business, strategy and financial condition of Antigenics is
somewhat different from that of Aronex Pharmaceuticals. Antigenics's results of
operations, as well as the price of Antigenics common stock, may be affected by
various factors different from those affecting Aronex Pharmaceuticals's results
of operations and its common stock price. Future events that may not have
affected the price of Aronex Pharmaceuticals stock may cause the price of
Antigenics common stock to fall.

     For a description of and other information about Antigenics common stock
and the differences between Antigenics common stock and Aronex Pharmaceuticals
stock, see "Comparative Per Share Data" on page   , "Comparative Stock Prices
and Dividends" on page   , and "Comparison of Rights of Antigenics and Aronex
Pharmaceuticals Stockholders" on page   .

ANTIGENICS AND ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS MAY NOT SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE OPERATIONS,
AND THE INTEGRATION OF THE BUSINESSES MAY BE COSTLY.

     After the merger, Antigenics and Aronex Pharmaceuticals, each of which
previously operated independently, will have to integrate operations. The
integration will require significant efforts from each company, including
coordinating research and development efforts. Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
collaborators, customers, distributors or suppliers may terminate their
arrangements with Aronex Pharmaceuticals or

demand new arrangements. Integrating operations may distract management's
attention from the day-to-day business of the combined company. If Antigenics is
unable to successfully integrate the operations of the two companies or if this
integration process costs more than expected, Antigenics's future results will
be negatively impacted.

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS MAY HAVE INTERESTS THAT ARE
DIFFERENT FROM, OR IN ADDITION TO, THOSE OF ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS STOCKHOLDERS
GENERALLY.

     You should be aware of potential conflicts of interest, and the benefits
available to officers and directors of Aronex Pharmaceuticals when considering
the Aronex Pharmaceuticals board's recommendation of the merger. The officers
and directors of Aronex Pharmaceuticals have interests in the merger that are in
addition to, or different from, their interests as Aronex Pharmaceuticals
stockholders. The Aronex Pharmaceuticals board was aware of these conflicts of
interest when it approved the merger. These interests include the right of
Aronex Pharmaceuticals's officers and directors to:

     - accelerated vesting of their stock options upon consummation of the
       merger;

     - receipt of severance benefits under employee retention agreements in the
       event they are terminated by Antigenics after the merger; and

     - indemnification and insurance coverage with respect to acts and omissions
       in their capacities as officers and directors of Aronex Pharmaceuticals.

     For a more detailed discussion of potential conflicts of interests of
Aronex Pharmaceuticals management, see "Background and Reasons for the
Merger -- Potential Conflicts of Interests of Aronex Pharmaceuticals Management
in the Merger" on page   of this proxy statement/prospectus.

    RISKS RELATING TO ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS IF THE MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED.

IF THE MERGER IS NOT CONSUMMATED, ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS WILL REQUIRE FUTURE
CAPITAL WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE.

     In the event that the merger is not consummated, Aronex Pharmaceuticals
will continue to require substantial additional funds for its operations. At
March 31, 2001, Aronex Pharmaceuticals had $5.3 million in cash, cash
equivalents and investments, which it believes would not be sufficient to fund
operations through the end of 2001. Furthermore, Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
accountants have issued a qualified opinion on its consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2000 expressing substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. Aronex Pharmaceuticals may
have to close operations and/or seek legal protection from its creditors if the
merger is not consummated on a timely basis, or at all. Aronex Pharmaceuticals
does not know if additional funding will be available at all or on acceptable
terms. If Aronex Pharmaceuticals raises funds by selling more stock, share
ownership by its current stockholders will be diluted. In addition, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals may grant future investors rights which are superior to those of
current stockholders.

IF THE MERGER IS NOT CONSUMMATED, ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS'S COMMON STOCK WILL
PROBABLY BE DELISTED FROM NASDAQ.

     Although Aronex Pharmaceuticals's common stock presently lists on the
Nasdaq National Market, it must maintain certain minimum financial requirements
for continued inclusion on Nasdaq. On April 9, 2001, Aronex Pharmaceuticals
received a letter from Nasdaq informing Aronex Pharmaceuticals that it no longer
meets these criteria. Aronex Pharmaceuticals replied to Nasdaq's letter on April
23, 2001, in which Aronex Pharmaceuticals stated that it was undertaking the
merger with Antigenics in order to address Nasdaq's concerns. Nasdaq has advised
Aronex Pharmaceuticals that it will waive these requirements through August 31,
2001 and that it will consider an extension of this waiver if the merger is not
yet consummated by that date. If the merger is not consummated by that date (or,
if an extension is granted, by such later date) or if the merger agreement is
terminated prior to that date, Nasdaq will most likely

delist Aronex Pharmaceuticals's common stock. In such event, trading in Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's common stock would thereafter be conducted in the
over-the-counter markets in the so-called "pink sheets" or the NASD's
"Electronic Bulletin Board." Consequently, the liquidity of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's common stock could be impaired, not only in the number of
shares which could be bought and sold, but also through delays in the timing of
the transactions, reductions in the security analysts' and the news media's
coverage of Aronex Pharmaceuticals, and lower prices for its common stock that
it might otherwise attain.

IF ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS'S COMMON STOCK IS DELISTED, IT MAY BE SUBJECT TO THE
"PENNY STOCK" REGULATIONS WHICH MAY AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO SELL YOUR SHARES.

     If Nasdaq delists Aronex Pharmaceuticals's common stock, it could become
subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, which imposes additional sales
practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons
other than established customers and "accredited investors" (generally, an
individual with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or an annual income
exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with his or her spouse's income). For
transactions covered by this rule, a broker-dealer must make a special
suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written
consent to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, the rule may
adversely affect the ability of the holders of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's common
stock to sell their shares in the secondary market.

     Regulations of the Commission define "penny stock" to be any non-Nasdaq
equity security that has a market price (as therein defined) of less than $5.00
per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to
certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt,
the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction of penny stock, of a
disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission relating to the penny stock
market. The Commission also requires disclosure about commissions payable to
both of the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current
quotations of the securities. Finally, the Commission requires monthly
statements to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock
held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.

     These penny stock restrictions will not apply to Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
common stock if Nasdaq continues to list it and has certain price and volume
information provided on a current and continuing basis, and Aronex
Pharmaceuticals meets certain minimum net tangible assets or average revenue
criteria. At the present time, Aronex Pharmaceuticals does not meet these
criteria. Even if Aronex Pharmaceuticals's common stock were exempt from such
restrictions, it would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act,
which gives the Commission the authority to prohibit any person engaged in
unlawful conduct while participating in a distribution of a penny stock from
associating with a broker-dealer or participating in a distribution of a penny
stock, if the Commission finds that such a restriction would be in the public
interest. If Aronex Pharmaceuticals's common stock were subject to the rules on
penny stocks, the market liquidity for its common stock could be severely and
adversely affected.

THE TERMINATION FEE, THE RESTRICTIONS ON SOLICITATION CONTAINED IN THE MERGER
AGREEMENT, AND THE VOTING AGREEMENTS MAY DISCOURAGE OTHER COMPANIES FROM TRYING
TO ACQUIRE ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS.

     Until the completion of the merger, and with some exceptions, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals is prohibited from entering into or soliciting, initiating or
encouraging any inquiries or proposals that may lead to a proposal or offer for
a merger or other business combination transaction with any person other than
Antigenics. In addition, Aronex Pharmaceuticals agreed to pay a termination fee
to Antigenics in specified circumstances, including when a third party acquires
or seeks to acquire Aronex Pharmaceuticals. These provisions could discourage
other companies from trying to acquire Aronex Pharmaceuticals even though those
other companies might be willing to offer greater value to Aronex
Pharmaceuticals stockholders than Antigenics has offered in the merger. The
payment of the termination fee could also have a material adverse effect on
Aronex Pharmaceuticals's financial condition. Furthermore, two Aronex
Pharmaceuticals stockholders and all directors and officers who own Aronex
Pharmaceuticals common stock, beneficially owning an aggregate of approximately
     % of the Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock outstanding on

the record date have entered into voting agreements with Antigenics whereby they
have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the approval of the merger
agreement and against any competing transaction. These agreements could
discourage other companies from trying to acquire Aronex Pharmaceuticals even
though those other companies might be willing to offer greater value to Aronex
Pharmaceuticals stockholders than Antigenics has offered in the merger
agreement.

                          RISKS RELATING TO ANTIGENICS

     In the merger, Antigenics will issue shares of its common stock in exchange
for Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock. Accordingly, before voting on the
merger, you should carefully consider the following factors affecting the
business of Antigenics. These risks could result in material adverse
consequences to Antigenics's business, financial condition, operating results or
cash flows. This could cause the trading price of Antigenics common stock to
decline.

ANTIGENICS CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT IT WILL EVER COMMERCIALIZE ANY OF ITS
THERAPEUTIC OR PROPHYLACTIC VACCINES AND GENERATE ADDITIONAL REVENUE IN THE
FUTURE.

     Antigenics must receive separate regulatory approvals for each of its
     vaccines in each indication before it can sell them commercially for any
     such indication in the United States or internationally.

     To obtain regulatory approvals, Antigenics must, among other requirements,
complete clinical trials demonstrating that a particular therapeutic or
prophylactic vaccine is safe and effective. Antigenics has a number of
therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines in clinical trials. Any delays or
difficulties that Antigenics encounters in these clinical trials may have a
substantial adverse impact on its operations and cause its stock price to
decline significantly. Antigenics has limited clinical data, and future clinical
trials may not show that its vaccines are safe and effective. In addition,
Antigenics or the FDA might delay or halt the clinical trials for various
reasons, including:

     - its vaccines may not appear to be more effective than current therapies;

     - its vaccines may have adverse side effects;

     - the time required to determine whether its vaccines are effective may be
       longer than expected;

     - patients may die during a clinical trial because their disease is too
       advanced or because they experience medical problems that may not be
       related to Antigenics's vaccines;

     - sufficient numbers of patients may not enroll in the trials; or

     - Antigenics may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of a vaccine
       to complete the trials.

     Antigenics relies on third party clinical investigators to conduct its
clinical trials. As a result, Antigenics may encounter delays outside its
control. Furthermore, the success of these third parties in performing their
responsibilities under license agreements may affect the timing and amount of
license fee payments, royalties and revenues from product sales, and Antigenics
cannot assure you that these collaborations will be successful.

     Antigenics may not be able to establish additional acceptable collaborative
arrangements or license agreements should it deem these necessary to develop and
commercialize product candidates, nor can Antigenics assure you that such future
arrangements will be successful.

     The process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new
therapeutic products is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. It also can vary
substantially, based on the type, complexity and novelty of the product
involved. To date, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies have approved only a
limited number of cancer therapeutic vaccines for commercial sale. Furthermore,
the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies have relatively little experience with
autologous therapies. This lack of experience may lengthen the regulatory review
process for Oncophage, Antigenics's lead cancer product, increase its
development costs and delay or prevent commercialization. In addition, problems
encountered with other companies' therapeutic vaccine products may slow the
regulatory review of its therapeutic vaccines. The FDA may not

consider Oncophage to be an appropriate candidate for fast track designation
should Antigenics choose to seek it. Accordingly, Oncophage or any of
Antigenics's other future drug candidates could take a significantly longer time
to gain regulatory approval than Antigenics expects or may never gain approval.

     Because development of Antigenics's therapeutic or preventive vaccines for
     infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, and degenerative disorders will
     involve a lengthy and complex process, Antigenics is not certain it will be
     able to develop any marketable therapeutic or preventive vaccines for these
     indications.

     With the exception of Antigenics's immunotherapeutic agent for the
treatment of genital herpes, Antigenics has not completed all of the preclinical
development of any of its therapeutic or preventive vaccines for infectious
diseases, autoimmune disorders or degenerative disorders. Antigenics will need
to conduct extensive additional research and preclinical and clinical testing of
these vaccines prior to commercialization. This development process takes
several years and often fails to yield commercial products. Regulatory
authorities may not permit human testing of these vaccines; and, even if they
permit human testing, Antigenics may not demonstrate that a vaccine is safe and
effective.

     Even if some of Antigenics's vaccines receive regulatory approval, those
     vaccines may still face subsequent regulatory difficulties.

     If Antigenics receives regulatory approval to sell any of its human
therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines, the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory
agency may, nevertheless, limit the categories of patients who can use that
therapeutic or prophylactic vaccine. In addition, regulatory agencies subject a
marketed product, its manufacturer and the manufacturer's facilities to
continual review and periodic inspections. Furthermore, the FDA or foreign
regulatory agencies may require expensive post-approval trials. If Antigenics
discovers previously unknown problems with a product or its manufacturing and
laboratory facility, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product
or on Antigenics, including requiring Antigenics to withdraw the product from
the market. If Antigenics fails to comply with applicable regulatory approval
requirements, a regulatory agency may:

     - send Antigenics warning letters;

     - impose fines and other civil penalties on Antigenics;

     - suspend Antigenics's regulatory approvals;

     - refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved
       applications filed by Antigenics;

     - refuse to permit exports of Antigenics's products from the United States;

     - require Antigenics to recall products;

     - seize Antigenics's products;

     - impose restrictions on Antigenics's operations; or

     - criminally prosecute Antigenics.

ANTIGENICS MAY ENCOUNTER MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS THAT LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO
SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZE ITS THERAPEUTIC AND PROPHYLACTIC VACCINES.

     If Antigenics is unable to purify heat shock proteins from some cancer
     types, the size of its potential market would decrease.

     Antigenics's ability to successfully commercialize a therapeutic vaccine
for a particular cancer type depends on its ability to purify heat shock
proteins from that type of cancer. Based on Antigenics's clinical trials
conducted to date, in renal cell carcinoma, Antigenics has been able to
manufacture Oncophage from 98% of the tumors delivered to its manufacturing
facility; for melanoma, 86%; for colorectal carcinoma, 100%; for gastric cancer,
70%; and for pancreatic cancer, 30%. The relatively low rate for pancreatic
cancer is due to the abundance of proteases in pancreatic tissue. Proteases are
enzymes that break down proteins.

These proteases degrade the heat shock proteins during the purification process.
Antigenics may encounter this problem or similar problems with other types of
cancers as it expands its research. If Antigenics cannot overcome these
problems, the number of cancer types that its therapeutic vaccines could treat
would be limited.

     Delays in obtaining regulatory approval of Antigenics's manufacturing
     facility and disruptions in its manufacturing process may delay or disrupt
     its commercialization efforts.

     Before Antigenics can begin commercially manufacturing its therapeutic
vaccines, it must obtain regulatory approval of its manufacturing facility and
process. Manufacturing of Antigenics's therapeutic vaccines must comply with the
FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices requirements, commonly known as cGMP,
and foreign regulatory requirements. The cGMP requirements govern quality
control and documentation policies and procedures. In complying with cGMP and
foreign regulatory requirements, Antigenics will be obligated to expend time,
money and effort in production, recordkeeping and quality control to assure that
the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. If
Antigenics fails to comply with these requirements, it will be subject to
possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which it
is permitted to sell its therapeutic vaccines.

     The FDA, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and foreign regulatory
authorities have the authority to continuously inspect Antigenics's
manufacturing facility in Woburn, Massachusetts. Preparing this facility for
commercial manufacturing may take longer than planned, and the costs of
complying with FDA regulations may be higher than those for which Antigenics has
budgeted. In addition, any material changes Antigenics makes to the
manufacturing process may require approval by the FDA, the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts or foreign regulatory authorities. It could take longer than
Antigenics expects to obtain these approvals. Any delays in obtaining these
approvals could disrupt Antigenics's manufacturing process.

     Antigenics is the only manufacturer of its therapeutic vaccines. For the
next several years, Antigenics expects that it will conduct all of the
manufacturing of its therapeutic vaccines in the facility in Woburn,
Massachusetts. If this facility or the equipment in the facility is
significantly damaged or destroyed, Antigenics will not be able to quickly or
inexpensively replace its manufacturing capacity. Due to the nature of
Antigenics's therapeutic vaccines, a third party may not be able to manufacture
Antigenics's therapeutic vaccines.

     Antigenics has no experience manufacturing Oncophage in the volumes that
will be necessary to support large clinical trials or commercial sales. Its
present manufacturing process may not meet its initial expectations as to:

     - scheduling;

     - reproducibility;

     - yield;

     - purity;

     - cost;

     - potency;

     - quality; and

     - other measurements of performance.

     Antigenics is the only manufacturer of its Feline Leukemia vaccine and the
QS-21 family of adjuvants. For the next several years, Antigenics expects that
it will conduct all of its manufacturing of these products in its facility in
Framingham, Massachusetts. If this facility or the equipment in the facility is
significantly damaged or destroyed, Antigenics will not be able to quickly or
inexpensively replace its manufacturing capacity. This manufacturing facility
has limited expansion potential, and Antigenics may need to construct additional
manufacturing facilities or contract with another company to manufacture its

products. Furthermore, if product demand increases substantially, Antigenics
will not be able to respond quickly or inexpensively to meet this demand.
Antigenics cannot guarantee that it will be able to construct additional
facilities or out-source its manufacturing at a reasonable cost, if at all.

ANTIGENICS MAY NOT RECEIVE SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS FROM COLLABORATORS DUE TO
UNSUCCESSFUL RESULTS IN EXISTING COLLABORATIONS OR A FAILURE TO ENTER INTO
FUTURE COLLABORATIONS.

     Part of Antigenics's strategy is to develop and commercialize some of its
products by continuing its existing collaborative arrangements with academic and
corporate collaborators and licensees and by entering into new collaborations.
Antigenics's success depends on the success of these parties in performing
research, preclinical and clinical testing. These arrangements may require
Antigenics to transfer important rights to these corporate collaborators and
licensees. These collaborators and licensees could choose not to devote
resources to these arrangements or, under certain circumstances, may terminate
these arrangements early. In addition, these collaborators and licensees,
outside of their arrangements with us, may develop technologies or products that
are competitive with those that Antigenics is developing. As a result,
Antigenics cannot guarantee that any of its strategic collaborations will
continue, that Antigenics will be able to enter into new collaborations, or that
Antigenics will receive revenues from any of these relationships.

ANTIGENICS MAY HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WITH ITS CORPORATE PARTNERS THAT COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT EXPECTATIONS REGARDING ITS COLLABORATIONS.

     Antigenics may have conflicts of interest with its corporate partners that
could adversely affect its business. For example, existing or future corporate
partners may pursue alternative technologies, including those of Antigenics's
competitors. Disputes may arise with respect to the ownership of rights to any
technology or products developed with any current or future corporate partner.
If Antigenics's corporate partners pursue alternative technologies or fail to
develop or commercialize successfully any product candidate to which they have
obtained rights from Antigenics, Antigenics's business will suffer.

IF ANTIGENICS IS UNABLE TO PROTECT ITS PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY, TRADE SECRETS OR
KNOW-HOW, IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OPERATE ITS BUSINESS PROFITABLY.

     If Antigenics fails to sustain and further build its intellectual property
     rights, competitors will be able to take advantage of its research and
     development efforts to develop competing therapies.

     Antigenics's success depends, in part, on its ability to maintain
protection for its products and technologies under the patent laws of the United
States and other countries, so that Antigenics can stop others from using its
inventions. Antigenics's success also will depend on its ability to prevent
others from using its trade secrets. In addition, Antigenics must operate in a
way that does not infringe, or violate, the intellectual property rights of
others.

     Antigenics currently has exclusive rights to 30 issued United States
patents and foreign counterpart patents relating to its heat shock protein
technology. Its rights to these patents are a result of exclusive worldwide
licenses with Fordham University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine of New York
University. In addition, Antigenics has licensed or optioned rights to 106
pending United States patent applications and foreign counterpart patent
applications relating to its heat shock protein technology. Antigenics also has
exclusive rights to 31 issued and 59 pending U.S. and foreign patents and patent
applications, respectively, relating to its Saponin and CD1 technology. The
standards which the United States Patent and Trademark Office uses to grant
patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change.
Consequently, Antigenics cannot be certain as to the type and extent of patent
claims that will be issued to Antigenics in the future. Any patents which are
issued may not contain claims which will permit Antigenics to stop competitors
from using similar technology. The standards which courts use to interpret
patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change,
particularly as new technologies develop. Consequently, Antigenics cannot be
certain as to how much protection, if any, will be given to its patents, if
Antigenics attempts to enforce them and they are challenged in court. If

Antigenics chooses to go to court to stop someone else from using the inventions
claimed in its patents, that individual or company has the right to ask the
court to rule that Antigenics's patents are invalid and should not be enforced
against that third party. These lawsuits are expensive and would consume time
and other resources even if Antigenics were successful in stopping the violation
of its patents. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that its
patents are not valid and that Antigenics does not have the right to stop the
other party from using the inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the
validity of its patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the other party
on the ground that such other party's activities are not covered by (that is, do
not infringe) its patents.

     Furthermore, a third party may claim that Antigenics is using inventions
covered by such third party's patent and may go to court to stop Antigenics from
engaging in its normal operations and activities. These lawsuits are expensive
and would consume time and other resources. There is a risk that a court would
decide that Antigenics is violating the third party's patent and would order
Antigenics to stop the activities covered by the patent. In addition, there is a
risk that a court will order Antigenics to pay the other party damages for
having violated the other party's patent.

     Antigenics relies on certain proprietary trade secrets and know-how.
Antigenics has taken measures to protect its trade secrets and know-how,
including the use of confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants
and certain contractors. It is possible, however, that:

     - these persons will breach the agreements;

     - Antigenics would have inadequate remedies for any breach; or

     - Antigenics's competitors will independently develop or otherwise discover
       its trade secrets.

     Antigenics may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other
     proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights.

     The cost to Antigenics of any litigation or other proceeding relating to
intellectual property rights, even if resolved in its favor, could be
substantial. Some of its competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex
patent litigation more effectively than Antigenics can because they have
substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and
continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on
Antigenics's ability to continue its operations.

     Should third parties file patent applications, or be issued patents
claiming technology also claimed by Antigenics in pending applications,
Antigenics may be required to participate in interference proceedings in the
United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention.
Antigenics, or its licensors, may also need to participate in interference
proceedings involving its issued patents and pending applications of another
entity. An unfavorable outcome in an interference proceeding could require
Antigenics to cease using the technology or to license rights from prevailing
third parties. There is no guarantee that any prevailing party would offer
Antigenics a license or that Antigenics could acquire any license made available
to it on commercially acceptable terms.

     Antigenics cannot guarantee that the practice of its technologies will not
conflict with the rights of others. Antigenics is aware of a United States
patent, issued to a third party, with claims directed to certain heat shock
protein based therapeutic vaccines and their use in the field of tissue
grafting. Antigenics does not believe that its products or activities are
infringing any valid claims of this patent. Antigenics also is aware of two
United States patents, issued to a different third party, with claims directed
to certain methods of making heat shock protein products and related
apparatuses. These patents do not claim any therapeutic applications. These
patents also do not claim any of the methods Antigenics presently uses to make
Oncophage. Moreover, Antigenics does not believe that its methods of producing
any of its heat shock protein-based therapeutic vaccines would infringe any
valid claim of either of these patents. However, Antigenics cannot guarantee
that this third party, or any other third party, will not sue Antigenics for
infringing these, or any other, patents. One of the patent applications licensed
to Antigenics contains claims which are substantially the same as claims in one
of the third party's patents. Therefore, there is a possibility that the United
States Patent and Trademark Office will declare an interference

proceeding between one or both of the third party's patents and its patent
application. In an interference proceeding, the party with the earliest
effective filing date has certain advantages. Antigenics believes that its
claims have an earlier effective filing date than the claims of the other
patents. However, Antigenics cannot guarantee that it would prevail in any
interference proceeding. In the past and again recently, this third party has
contacted Antigenics about licensing patents rights, and Antigenics has not yet
made a decision regarding this matter.

     In some foreign jurisdictions, Antigenics could become involved in
opposition proceedings, either by opposing the validity of another's foreign
patent or by third parties' opposing the validity of its foreign patents. In
1995, the European Patent Office issued a European patent, with claims directed
to the use of heat shock proteins to produce or enhance immune responses to
cancer and infectious diseases, to the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical
Research and the Medical Research Council. This patent is exclusively licensed
to StressGen Biotechnologies Corporation. The patent holders have made no
attempt to enforce this patent against us. Nevertheless, Antigenics has
successfully sought to have this patent revoked in its entirety in an opposition
proceeding in the European Patent Office. After an oral hearing at the European
Patent Office before the Opposition Division, the Opposition Division revoked
the patent in its entirety. The holders of the patent have the right to appeal
the decision to revoke the patent in its entirety. Even if the decision to
revoke the patent were to be reversed on appeal, Antigenics still should be free
to practice its autologous cancer business in Europe.

     However, the patent owners or their licensee might still try to enforce the
revoked patent against Antigenics's infectious disease business in Europe during
any appeal. Antigenics may not obtain a final, non-appealable decision for
several years, during which time the patent remains enforceable. Antigenics may
incur significant costs by participating in the opposition proceedings and any
appeals. Furthermore, if Antigenics is sued on this patent in Europe prior to
any final decision of revocation, Antigenics may incur significant defense costs
even if it ultimately succeeds in proving that it does not infringe any valid
claims of this patent.

     This European patent claims priority to a United States patent application
filed in 1988. Antigenics does not know whether this application, or any related
application, is still pending. Antigenics does not believe that any United
States patent has issued from this application, and it does not know whether a
United States patent will ever issue from this patent application. If a United
States patent does issue, Antigenics does not know whether the patent will be
enforceable, whether any valid claims will cover its activities or products, or
whether the patent owner will attempt to assert the patent against Antigenics.

     In 1999, Antigenics received correspondence from both Copernicus
Therapeutics, Inc. and its counsel alleging similarity between the companies'
respective logos and demanding that Antigenics cease using its logo. In July
1999, Antigenics sent a response to Copernicus stating that Antigenics has prior
rights in the logo. In the response to Copernicus, Antigenics also stated that
since the respective corporate names are vastly different, both companies should
be able to continue the use of their respective logos without causing public
confusion. At this time, Antigenics has not received any further communications
from Copernicus or its counsel. Although Antigenics does not believe it is
infringing any rights owned by Copernicus, Copernicus may proceed with a
trademark lawsuit against us.

ANTIGENICS IS AN EARLY STAGE BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT MAY NEVER BE PROFITABLE.

     If Antigenics incurs operating losses for longer than it expects, it may be
     unable to continue its operations.

     Antigenics has generated $443,000 in revenues for the year ended December
31, 2000 and $884,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2001. Antigenics does
not expect to generate significant revenues for several years. Antigenics has
incurred losses since it was formed. From inception through March 31, 2001,
Antigenics has generated losses totaling $91.65 million. Antigenics expects to
incur increasing and significant losses over the next several years as it
completes its Oncophage clinical trials, applies for regulatory approvals,
continues development of its technology, and expands its operations, including
increased expenses associated with development of the technologies and product
pipeline that may be

acquired as a result of the merger with Aronex Pharmaceuticals. Its
profitability will depend on the market acceptance of any of its therapeutic and
prophylactic vaccines that receive FDA or foreign regulatory marketing approval.
The commercial success of any of Antigenics's vaccines will depend on whether:

     - the vaccine is more effective than alternative treatments;

     - side effects of the vaccine are acceptable to doctors and patients;

     - Antigenics produces the vaccine at a competitive price;

     - Antigenics obtains sufficient reimbursement for the vaccine; and

     - Antigenics has sufficient capital to market the vaccine effectively.

     Because Oncophage is autologous, or patient specific, it may be more
expensive to manufacture than conventional therapeutic products. This increased
expense may decrease Antigenics's profit margins. Furthermore, because
Antigenics's autologous products are novel, some doctors and patients may be
reluctant to use them.

     If Antigenics fails to obtain the capital necessary to fund its operations,
     Antigenics will be unable to advance its development programs and complete
     its clinical trials.

     Developing therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines and conducting clinical
trials for multiple diseases is expensive. Antigenics plan to conduct clinical
trials for many different diseases simultaneously, which will increase its
costs. Antigenics will need to raise additional capital:

     - to fund operations;

     - to continue the research and development of its vaccines; and

     - to commercialize its vaccines.

     Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all. If
Antigenics is unable to raise additional funds when Antigenics needs them,
Antigenics may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of its
development programs and some or all of its clinical trials. Antigenics also may
be forced to license technologies to others that Antigenics would prefer to
develop internally.

     On March 31, 2001, Antigenics had approximately $90.1 million in cash and
cash equivalents. Antigenics believes that it will have sufficient capital to
fund its operations for the next two years. Antigenics may need to raise capital
sooner, however, due to a number of factors, including:

     - an acceleration of the number, size or complexity of its clinical trials,
       including any increase attributable to its potential acquisition of
       Aronex Pharmaceuticals's product pipeline as a result of the merger;

     - slower than expected progress in developing its vaccines;

     - higher than expected costs to obtain regulatory approvals;

     - higher than expected costs to pursue its intellectual property strategy;

     - higher than expected costs to further develop its manufacturing
       capability; and

     - higher than expected costs to develop its sales and marketing capability.

BECAUSE OF THE SPECIALIZED NATURE OF ANTIGENICS'S BUSINESS, THE TERMINATION OF
RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS SCIENTIFIC ADVISORS OR THE DEPARTURE OF KEY MEMBERS OF
MANAGEMENT MAY PREVENT ANTIGENICS FROM ACHIEVING ITS OBJECTIVES.

     If Pramod K. Srivastava, Ph.D. severs his relationship with Antigenics,
     Antigenics may experience significant difficulties in its future
     development efforts.

     Since Antigenics's formation, Dr. Srivastava has played a significant role
in its research efforts. Dr. Srivastava is its chief scientific officer, a
member of its board of directors and acts as chairman of its scientific advisory
board. In addition, Antigenics has licensed a significant portion of its
intellectual property from institutions at which Dr. Srivastava has worked.
Antigenics sponsors research in Dr. Srivastava's laboratory at the University of
Connecticut Health Center in exchange for the right to license discoveries made
in that laboratory with its funding. Dr. Srivastava is a member of the faculty
of the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. The regulations and
policies of the University of Connecticut Health Center govern the relationship
between a faculty member and a commercial enterprise. These regulations and
policies prohibit Dr. Srivastava from becoming an employee of Antigenics.
Furthermore, the University of Connecticut may modify these regulations and
policies in the future to further limit Dr. Srivastava's relationship with us.
While Dr. Srivastava has a consulting agreement with Antigenics, which includes
financial incentives for him to remain associated with Antigenics, Antigenics
cannot guarantee that he will remain associated with Antigenics even during the
time covered by the consulting agreement. In addition, this agreement does not
restrict his ability to compete with Antigenics after his association is
terminated.

     If Antigenics fails to keep key management and scientific personnel, it may
     be unable to successfully develop its therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines,
     conduct clinical trials and obtain financing.

     Antigenics is highly dependent on its senior management and scientific
staff, particularly Garo H. Armen, Ph.D., its chairman and chief executive
officer, Russell Herndon, its chief operating officer and Elma Hawkins, Ph.D.,
its vice chairman. The competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology
field is intense, and Antigenics relies heavily on its ability to attract and
retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. Since its
manufacturing process is unique, its manufacturing and quality control personnel
are also very important.

THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF ANY OF ANTIGENICS'S THERAPEUTIC OR PREVENTIVE VACCINES
WILL DEPEND UPON THE STRENGTH OF ITS SALES AND MARKETING EFFORT AND THE
AVAILABILITY OF THIRD PARTY REIMBURSEMENT.

     If Antigenics is unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or
     enter into agreements with pharmaceutical companies to sell and market its
     therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines, Antigenics may experience difficulty
     generating revenues.

     Antigenics does not have a sales organization and has no experience in the
sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. If Oncophage is
approved for commercial sale, Antigenics plans to market it in the United States
with its own sales force. Developing a sales force is expensive and time
consuming and could delay any product launch. Antigenics cannot be certain that
it would be able to develop this capacity. If Antigenics is unable to establish
its sales and marketing capability, it will need to enter into sales and
marketing agreements to market Oncophage in the United States. Antigenics plans
to enter into these types of arrangements for sales outside the United States.
If Antigenics is unable to establish successful distribution relationships with
pharmaceutical companies, it may fail to realize the full sales potential of its
vaccines.

     If Antigenics fails to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement for its
     therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines from third party payers, the
     commercial potential of its therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines will be
     significantly limited.

     Antigenics's profitability will depend on the extent to which government
authorities, private health insurance providers and other organizations provide
reimbursement for the cost of its therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines. Many
patients will not be capable of paying for its therapeutic or prophylactic

vaccines themselves. A primary trend in the United States health care industry
is toward cost containment. Large private payers, managed care organizations,
group purchasing organizations and similar organizations are exerting increasing
influence on decisions regarding the use of particular treatments. These
organizations are becoming increasingly economically focused. Furthermore, many
third party payers limit reimbursement for newly approved health care products.
Cost containment measures may prevent Antigenics from becoming profitable.

     In addition, healthcare reform is an area of significant government focus.
Any reform measures, if adopted, could adversely affect:

     - the pricing of therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines in the United States
       or internationally; and

     - the amount of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or other
       third party payers.

     For example, recent proposals regarding Medicare coverage, if they take
effect, may put novel cancer therapies like Oncophage at a competitive
disadvantage compared to existing therapies.

PRODUCT LIABILITY AND OTHER CLAIMS AGAINST ANTIGENICS MAY REDUCE DEMAND FOR ITS
PRODUCTS OR RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES.

     Antigenics faces an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to
testing therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines in human clinical trials and will
face even greater risks when Antigenics sells such therapeutic or prophylactic
products commercially. An individual may bring a product liability claim against
Antigenics if one of its therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines causes, or merely
appears to have caused, an injury. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome,
product liability claims may result in:

     - decreased demand for Antigenics's therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines;

     - injury to its reputation;

     - withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers;

     - costs of related litigation; and

     - substantial monetary awards to plaintiffs.

     Antigenics manufactures Oncophage from a patient's tumor, and a medical
professional must inject the Oncophage into that same patient. A patient may sue
Antigenics if it, a hospital or a delivery company fails to deliver the removed
tumor or that patient's Oncophage. Antigenics anticipates that the logistics of
shipping will become more complex as the number of patients Antigenics treats
increases, and Antigenics cannot assure you that all shipments will be made
without incident. In addition, administration of Oncophage at a hospital poses
another chance for delivery to the wrong patient. Currently, Antigenics does not
have insurance that covers loss of or damage to Oncophage and does not know
whether insurance will be available to Antigenics at a reasonable price or at
all.

     Antigenics has limited product liability coverage for clinical research use
of product candidates such as the Stimulon adjuvants and Oncophage, Quilvax and
Quilimmune products. Antigenics also maintains limited product liability
insurance for the commercial sale of its feline leukemia vaccine.

ANTIGENICS MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS COMPLYING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND
REGULATIONS.

     Antigenics uses hazardous, infectious and radioactive materials that could
be dangerous to human health, safety or the environment. As appropriate,
Antigenics stores these materials and various wastes resulting from their use at
its facility pending ultimate use and disposal. Antigenics is subject to a
variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use,
generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and
wastes resulting from their use. Antigenics may incur significant costs
complying with both existing and future environmental laws and regulations. In
particular, Antigenics is subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency and to regulation
under the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act. OSHA or the EPA may adopt regulations that may affect its

research and development programs. Antigenics is unable to predict whether any
agency will adopt any regulations which could have a material adverse effect on
its operations.

     Although Antigenics believes its safety procedures for handling and
disposing of these materials comply with federal, state and local laws and
regulations, it cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or
contamination from these materials. In the event of an accident, Antigenics
could be held liable for any resulting damages which could be substantial.

ANTIGENICS'S COMPETITORS IN THE BIOTECHNOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES MAY
HAVE SUPERIOR PRODUCTS, MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY OR MARKETING EXPERTISE.

     Antigenics's business may fail because it faces intense competition from
major pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies engaged
in the development of therapeutic or preventive vaccines and other therapeutic
products directed at cancer, infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, and
degenerative disorders. Many of its competitors have greater financial and human
resources and more experience. Its competitors may:

     - develop safer or more effective therapeutic or preventive vaccines and
       other therapeutic products;

     - implement more effective approaches to sales and marketing; or

     - establish superior proprietary positions.

     More specifically, if Antigenics receives regulatory approvals, some of its
therapeutic or preventive vaccines will compete with well-established, FDA
approved therapies that have generated substantial sales over a number of years.

     Antigenics anticipates that it will face increased competition in the
future as new companies enter its markets and scientific developments
surrounding immunotherapy and other cancer therapies continue to accelerate.

ANTIGENICS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN
THE BIOTECHNOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES WHICH COULD MAKE ITS VACCINES
OBSOLETE.

     The field of biotechnology is characterized by significant and rapid
technological change. Research and discoveries by others may result in medical
insights or breakthroughs which may render Antigenics's vaccines obsolete even
before they generate any revenue.

ANTIGENICS MAY NOT SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE OPERATIONS WITH ITS RECENTLY ACQUIRED
BUSINESS, AND THE INTEGRATION OF THE BUSINESSES MAY BE COSTLY.

     On November 16, 2000, Antigenics acquired Aquila Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.
Antigenics is currently integrating its operations with those of Aquila. If
Aronex Pharmaceuticals's stockholders approve the merger as described herein,
Antigenics will acquire the business of Aronex Pharmaceuticals which will
require additional integration of its operations. These integrations require
significant efforts from each entity, including coordinating research and
development efforts. Aquila's and Aronex Pharmaceuticals's collaborators,
customers, distributors or suppliers may terminate their arrangements or demand
new arrangements; and Aquila or Aronex Pharmaceuticals personnel may leave as a
result of the acquisitions. Integrating operations may distract management's
attention from the day-to-day business of the combined company. If Antigenics is
unable to successfully integrate the operations of these companies or if this
integration process costs more than expected, its future results will be
negatively impacted.

ANTIGENICS'S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS MAY BE ABLE TO BLOCK PROPOSALS FOR A CHANGE
IN CONTROL.

     As of March 19, 2001, Antigenics Holdings L.L.C. controlled approximately
40.1% of Antigenics's outstanding common stock. Due to this concentration of
ownership, Antigenics Holdings may be able to prevail on all matters requiring a
stockholder vote, including:

     - the election of directors;

     - the amendment of Antigenics's organizational documents; or

     - the approval of a merger, sale of assets or other major corporate
       transaction.

     Antigenics's directors and officers, if they elect to act together, can
control Antigenics Holdings. In addition, several of Antigenics's directors and
officers directly and indirectly own shares of its common stock.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN ANTIGENICS'S CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND UNDER DELAWARE
LAW MAY MAKE AN ACQUISITION OF ANTIGENICS MORE DIFFICULT.

     Antigenics is incorporated in Delaware. Anti-takeover provisions of
Delaware law and its charter documents may make a change in control more
difficult even if the stockholders desire a change in control. Antigenics's
anti-takeover provisions include provisions in its certificate of incorporation
providing that stockholders' meetings may only be called by the president or the
majority of the board of directors and a provision in its by-laws providing that
its stockholders may not take action by written consent. Additionally, its board
of directors has the authority to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and
to determine the terms of those shares of stock without any further action by
its stockholders. The rights of holders of Antigenics's stock are subject to the
rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued. The issuance of
preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a
majority of its outstanding voting stock. Antigenics's charter also provides for
the classification of its board of directors into three classes. This "staggered
board" generally may prevent stockholders from replacing the entire board in a
single proxy contest. In addition, its directors may only be removed from office
for cause. Delaware law also prohibits a corporation from engaging in a business
combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock until the holder
has held the stock for three years unless, among other possibilities, the board
of directors approves the transaction. The board may use this provision to
prevent changes in its management. Also, under applicable Delaware law,
Antigenics's board of directors may adopt additional anti-takeover measures in
the future.

ANTIGENICS'S STOCK HAS LOW TRADING VOLUME AND THEREFORE ITS PUBLIC TRADING PRICE
MAY BE VOLATILE.

     Since Antigenics's initial public offering on February 4, 2000, the per
share price of its common stock has fluctuated between $10.00 and $71.50 with an
average daily trading volume over the three months ended March 31, 2001 of
approximately 102,000 shares. The market has experienced significant price and
volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to the operating performance of
individual companies. In addition to general market volatility, many factors may
have a significant adverse effect on the market price of its stock, including:

     - announcements of decisions made by public officials;

     - results of its preclinical and clinical trials;

     - announcement of technological innovations or new commercial products by
       Antigenics or its competitors;

     - developments concerning proprietary rights, including patent and
       litigation matters;

     - publicity regarding actual or potential results with respect to products
       under development by Antigenics or by its competitors;

     - regulatory developments; and

     - quarterly fluctuations in its revenues and other financial results.

THE SALE OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SHARES COULD CAUSE THE MARKET PRICE OF ITS
STOCK TO DECLINE.

     The sale by Antigenics or the resale by stockholders of shares of its stock
could cause the market price of its stock to decline. As of March 31, 2001,
Antigenics had 27,404,654 shares of common stock outstanding. All of these
shares are eligible for sale on the Nasdaq National Market, although certain of
the shares are subject to sale volume and other limitations.

     Antigenics has filed a registration statement to permit the sale of
approximately 4,800,000 shares of common stock under its equity incentive plan
and 300,000 shares of common stock under its employee stock purchase plan. As of
March 31, 2001, options to purchase 2,895,432 shares of its stock upon exercise
of options with a weighted average exercise price per share of $9.01 were
outstanding. Many of these options are subject to vesting that generally occurs
over a period of up to five years following the date of grant. As of March 31,
2001, warrants to purchase 296,989 shares of Antigenics common stock with a
weighted average exercise price per share of $13.98 were outstanding.

                   THE ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS SPECIAL MEETING

     The Aronex Pharmaceuticals board of directors is soliciting the proxies of
the common stockholders in connection with the special meeting of common
stockholders to vote on the proposed merger. This proxy statement/prospectus
contains information about the proposed merger to help you in determining how to
vote.

DATE, TIME, PLACE AND PURPOSE OF THE ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS SPECIAL MEETING

     The special meeting of stockholders of Aronex Pharmaceuticals will be held
at the offices of Palmer & Dodge LLP, One Beacon Street,   Floor, Boston,
Massachusetts 02108, on             , 2001 at 9:00 a.m., local time. At the
meeting, Aronex Pharmaceuticals will ask its stockholders to adopt the merger
agreement.

     The merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement/prospectus. Please read it and the other information contained in this
proxy statement/prospectus carefully before deciding how to vote.

RECORD DATE AND OUTSTANDING SHARES

     The board of directors has fixed the close of business on             ,
2001 as the record date for Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders entitled to
notice of and to vote at the special meeting.

     The only outstanding securities of Aronex Pharmaceuticals entitled to vote
on the merger are the shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock. Only record
holders of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock at the close of business on the
record date may vote at the meeting. Each stockholder is entitled to one vote
for each share of common stock held on the record date.

     At the close of business on the record date,                shares of
Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock were outstanding. They were held of record
by approximately                stockholders. Aronex Pharmaceuticals has been
informed that there are in excess of                beneficial owners.

VOTE REQUIRED

     To approve the merger, a majority of the outstanding shares of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals common stock must affirmatively vote for adoption of the merger
agreement. FOR PURPOSES OF THE VOTE REQUIRED, A FAILURE TO VOTE, A VOTE TO
ABSTAIN AND A BROKER NON-VOTE WILL EACH HAVE THE SAME LEGAL EFFECT AS A VOTE
AGAINST ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT. If you execute a proxy card without
giving instructions, the shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock
represented by that proxy card will be voted "FOR" adoption of the proposed
merger agreement. The Aronex Pharmaceuticals board of directors is not aware of
any other matters to be voted on at the special meeting. If any other matters
properly come before the special meeting, including a motion to adjourn the
special meeting in order to solicit additional proxies, the persons named on the
proxy card will vote the shares represented by all properly executed proxies on
those matters in their discretion, except that shares represented by proxies
that have been voted "AGAINST" adoption of the merger agreement will not be used
to vote "FOR" adjournment of the special meeting to allow additional time to
solicit additional votes "FOR" the merger agreement.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS BOARD

     THE ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT
YOU VOTE "FOR" ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

SHARE OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT AND AFFILIATED STOCKHOLDERS

     On the record date, directors, executive officers and affiliates of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals as a group beneficially owned                shares of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals common stock, or approximately      % of the outstanding shares.

QUORUM; ABSTENTIONS; BROKER NON-VOTES

     A majority of the shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock outstanding
on the record date must be present at the meeting to establish a quorum.
Stockholders may be present in person or by proxy. Abstentions will count toward
the quorum and be treated as votes at the meeting, but they will have the effect
of votes against the merger. If you hold your shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals
common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee, generally the nominee may
only vote your Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock in accordance with your
instructions. However, if your broker or nominee has not timely received your
instructions, the nominee may vote on matters for which it has discretionary
voting authority. Brokers generally will not have discretionary voting authority
to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. If a nominee cannot vote
on a matter because it does not have discretionary voting authority, this is a
"broker non-vote" on that matter. Broker non-votes are counted as shares present
or represented at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a
quorum exists, but will be counted as votes against adoption of the merger
agreement.

VOTING AGREEMENTS

     As a condition and inducement to Antigenics's entering into the merger
agreement, Antigenics entered into stockholder voting agreements with Essex
Woodlands Health Ventures IV, L.L.C., Prince Venture Partners III, L.P., and all
of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's directors and executive officers holding Aronex
Pharmaceuticals common stock under which they agreed to vote all of their shares
of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock as of the record date in favor of the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. These stockholders also agreed to grant
a representative of Antigenics irrevocable proxies to vote their shares of
Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement. Approximately                shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common
stock, which represents approximately      % of the outstanding shares of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals common stock as of the record date, are subject to these voting
agreements and irrevocable proxies. These voting agreements effectively ensure
that      % of the outstanding shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock
will vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement.

VOTING OF PROXIES

     Accompanying this proxy statement/prospectus is a proxy card by which the
Aronex Pharmaceuticals board of directors is soliciting your proxy. Aronex
Pharmaceuticals asks that you complete, date and sign the proxy card and
promptly mail it to Aronex Pharmaceuticals. All properly executed proxies
received prior to taking the vote at the meeting, and not revoked, will be voted
as instructed on the proxy card. If no instructions are given, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals will vote the proxy in favor of adopting the merger agreement.
You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the meeting by:

     - delivering to the secretary of Aronex Pharmaceuticals, by any means,
       including facsimile, a written notice, bearing a date later than the date
       on your proxy, stating that the proxy is revoked;

     - signing and delivering to Aronex Pharmaceuticals before Aronex
       Pharmaceuticals takes the vote at the meeting a proxy for the same shares
       and bearing a later date; or

     - attending the meeting and voting in person -- you must vote, because your
       attendance, by itself, does not revoke your proxy.

     Please note, however, that if the holder of record of your shares is your
broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to vote at the meeting, you must
bring a letter from the broker, bank or other nominee confirming that you are
the beneficial owner of the shares.

     You should not send any certificates representing Aronex Pharmaceuticals
common stock with your proxy. After the merger, you will receive instructions
for the surrender and exchange of your stock certificates.

APPRAISAL OR DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

     Under Delaware law, Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders are not entitled to
appraisal or dissenters' rights in connection with the merger because:

     - Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock was, as of the record date for the
       special meeting, designated and reported for trading on the Nasdaq
       National Market; and

     - Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock will be converted into shares of
       Antigenics common stock, which also will be designated and reported for
       trading on the Nasdaq National Market.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals and Antigenics will share equally the proxy
solicitation expenses. Aronex Pharmaceuticals is paying Innisfree M&A
Incorporated, a proxy solicitation firm, $8,000 plus expenses to help with the
proxy solicitation. Aronex Pharmaceuticals's employees may solicit proxies by
mail, telephone, telegraph or in person. Following the mailing of the proxies
and other soliciting materials, Aronex Pharmaceuticals will request brokers,
custodians, nominees and other record holders of common stock to forward the
proxy and other soliciting materials to the persons on behalf of whom they hold
shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals stock, along with a request for authority to
exercise the proxies. If the record holder requests, Aronex Pharmaceuticals will
reimburse the holder's reasonable expenses.

                     BACKGROUND AND REASONS FOR THE MERGER

BACKGROUND

     For some time, the board of directors and management of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals has believed that beneficial alliances or other partnership
arrangements with significant partners would provide it with important support
and leverage in its research and development efforts, including increased
financial and personnel resources with which to develop its product portfolio.
With this in mind, in March 2000, Aronex Pharmaceuticals entered into an
agreement with Robertson Stephens, Inc. pursuant to which Robertson Stephens was
engaged to provide Aronex Pharmaceuticals with financial advisory and investment
banking services in connection with Aronex Pharmaceuticals's exploration of
various strategic alternatives, including potentially the identification and
review of possible merger candidates for, and/or acquirers of, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals. As a result, Aronex Pharmaceuticals has been in the process of
evaluating companies with complementary technologies and products under
development that would provide a good fit with its own technologies as well as
companies with substantial additional resources with which to develop its
technologies.

     In line with this strategy, Geoffrey F. Cox, Ph.D., Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, met with Garo H. Armen,
Ph.D., Antigenics's President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, in July
2000 as a result of an introduction by Robertson Stephens. Drs. Cox and Armen
discussed possible transactions between Aronex Pharmaceuticals and Antigenics.
As a result of these discussions, on July 24, 2000, Antigenics and Aronex
Pharmaceuticals entered into a confidentiality agreement to facilitate further
discussions, and subsequently, Antigenics commenced a due diligence review of
Aronex Pharmaceuticals's technologies, which included a meeting between Dr. Cox
and Elma Hawkins, Ph.D., Antigenics's Vice Chairman, at Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
The Woodlands, Texas office and a meeting between Anthony Williams, M.D., Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's Vice President, Medical Affairs, Pramod Srivastava, Ph.D., a
member of Antigenics's board of directors and chairman of Antigenics's
scientific advisory board, and Jonathan Lewis, M.D., Ph.D., Antigenics's Chief
Medical Officer, at Antigenics's New York City headquarters.

     Dr. Armen indicated that Antigenics was discontinuing negotiations with
Aronex Pharmaceuticals in September 2000. However, in January 2001, following
the receipt of the non-approval letter for ATRAGEN from the FDA as discussed in
"Business of Aronex Pharmaceuticals" above, Aronex Pharmaceuticals's board
requested that Robertson Stephens broaden its search for a potential acquirer of
Aronex Pharmaceuticals's business.

     As a result of this request, Robertson Stephens contacted additional
potential partners, and Antigenics expressed interest in acquiring Aronex
Pharmaceuticals. Overall, Robertson Stephens had discussions with a substantial
number of potential partners, and Aronex Pharmaceuticals's management made
presentations to twelve of those companies.

     In March 2001, Aronex Pharmaceuticals officers met with Antigenics officers
in New York City at which time Aronex Pharmaceuticals provided updated diligence
information with respect to its clinical programs and regulatory matters. On
March 19, 2001, Aronex Pharmaceuticals received a non-binding offer letter from
Antigenics to acquire Aronex Pharmaceuticals. After receiving this letter, Dr.
Cox contacted Dr. Armen to discuss the terms, and on March 28, 2001, the
directors of Aronex Pharmaceuticals held a board meeting at Antigenics's New
York headquarters in which Drs. Armen and Hawkins and Russell H. Herndon,
Antigenics's Chief Operating Officer, made presentations about Antigenics to the
Aronex Pharmaceuticals board.

     Following this board meeting, Antigenics provided a revised non-binding
offer letter to Aronex Pharmaceuticals dated April 6, 2001 which contained some
of the major terms of the proposed transaction. Following receipt of this
letter, Aronex Pharmaceuticals's board, with Robertson Stephens's assistance,
negotiated the major terms of the merger transaction.

     Following these initial negotiations, the parties negotiated and entered
into an exclusivity letter dated April 9, 2001 in which Aronex Pharmaceuticals
agreed to negotiate exclusively with Antigenics for a two week period. During
this period, Aronex Pharmaceuticals's board, with the assistance of its legal
counsel, Andrews & Kurth L.L.P., and Robertson Stephens, and Antigenics's
management, with the assistance of its legal counsel, Palmer & Dodge LLP,
negotiated the terms of the merger agreement and its related documents. The
parties finalized negotiations on April 20, 2001.

     The Aronex Pharmaceuticals board of directors held the telephonic meeting
on April 20, 2001 at which representatives from Andrews & Kurth L.L.P. and
Robertson Stephens also participated. At the meeting, the board received a
presentation from Robertson Stephens regarding the financial terms of the
proposed transaction and the analysis undertaken by Robertson Stephens in
connection with its opinion. The board discussed generally the transaction and
also discussed other alternatives to the merger with Antigenics, including the
consequences of not undertaking the transaction and the benefits and
disadvantages of an alternative proposal that had been received by the board
prior to its negotiations with Antigenics. After consulting with both counsel
and its financial advisor, the board determined that the merger transaction with
Antigenics was the best course for Aronex Pharmaceuticals to undertake.

     The board then undertook a detailed review and discussion of the terms of
the proposed merger agreement and its related documents, and discussions
regarding the financial and other effects the proposed merger would have on
Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders. Robertson Stephens then delivered its oral
opinion to the board that the merger consideration in the proposed transaction
was fair to Aronex Pharmaceuticals's stockholders from a financial point of
view. See "Opinion of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's Financial Advisor" on page   .
After the presentations and discussions, Aronex Pharmaceuticals's board of
directors unanimously approved the merger and authorized the officers of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals to finalize and execute the merger agreement after Antigenics's
board of directors approved the transaction, subject to a review of the final
merger agreement and related documents by Dr. Cox and counsel.

     The Antigenics board of directors held a telephonic meeting on April 22,
2001 at which attorneys from Palmer & Dodge LLP also participated. After a
review and discussion of the terms of the proposed merger agreement, and
discussions regarding the financial and other effects the proposed merger would
have on Antigenics's stockholders and employees, the Antigenics board of
directors unanimously approved the merger and authorized the officers of
Antigenics to finalize and execute the merger agreement.

     After Dr. Cox and counsel for Aronex Pharmaceuticals conducted a review of
the final merger agreement and related documents and Aronex Pharmaceuticals
received the written fairness opinion of Robertson Stephens, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals and Antigenics and its merger subsidiary executed and delivered
the definitive merger agreement after the close of business on April 23, 2001.

JOINT REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     The boards of directors of Antigenics and Aronex Pharmaceuticals have
determined that the combined company following the merger would have the
potential to realize long-term improved operating results and a stronger
competitive position. The boards of directors of Antigenics and Aronex
Pharmaceuticals have identified additional potential mutual benefits of the
merger that they believe will contribute to the success of the combined company.
These potential benefits include the following:

     - Antigenics may enhance its product pipeline, particularly by the addition
       of products in the late stages of FDA approval for the treatment of
       different types of cancer;

     - a possible more rapid path to commercialization for Aronex
       Pharmaceuticals's late stage products. Antigenics intends to apply its
       expertise in clinical development and regulatory review to accelerate
       these applications;

     - a diversification of technologies and product portfolio offerings;

     - the application of Antigenics's regulatory experience in the management
       of the earlier stage Investigational New Drug (IND) applications
       submitted by Aronex Pharmaceuticals;

     - greater financial resources allow Antigenics to better develop the Aronex
       Pharmaceuticals product candidates; and

     - an additional technology platform that could complement technologies
       already resident at Antigenics.

ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     The Aronex Pharmaceuticals board of directors has unanimously approved the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and has determined
that the merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, Aronex Pharmaceuticals
and its stockholders. In reaching its determination, the Aronex Pharmaceuticals
board consulted with Aronex Pharmaceuticals's management, as well as its legal
counsel and financial advisor, and considered the following material factors:

     - Aronex Pharmaceuticals's difficulty in raising additional capital to meet
       its ongoing commitments as well as its drug development goals;

     - Aronex Pharmaceuticals's inability to meet the continued listing
       requirements of the Nasdaq National Market and the current difficulty, in
       light of the recent FDA non-approval letter for ATRAGEN for APL, of
       raising sufficient capital to satisfy such requirements;

     - increased ability of the combined company to fund research and
       development of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products;

     - the opportunity the merger affords Aronex Pharmaceuticals's stockholders
       to reduce their exposure to the risks inherent in Aronex
       Pharmaceuticals's reliance on a limited number of currently
       uncommercialized products;

     - the difficulties in competing against larger companies with greater
       financial resources;

     - the merger will allow holders of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock to
       retain an equity interest in the combined company, to achieve greater
       liquidity than could be achieved by continuing to hold Aronex
       Pharmaceuticals common stock, and to participate in the potential growth
       of Antigenics;

     - the board's belief that the exchange ratio fractions are favorable based
       upon the recent trading prices for Aronex Pharmaceuticals and Antigenics
       common stock;

     - the likelihood that the merger will be consummated, including the terms
       and conditions of the merger agreement, and the limited conditions to the
       consummation of the merger;

     - the oral opinion of Robertson Stephens delivered April 20, 2001
       (subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated April 23, 2001) that
       as of such date and based on and subject to the assumptions, limitations,
       and qualifications referred to in the written opinion, the merger
       consideration was fair to holders of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock
       from a financial point of view. (Please see "Background and Reasons for
       the Merger -- Opinion of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's Financial Advisor");
       and

     - although the FDA recently rejected Aronex Pharmaceuticals's New Drug
       Application, or NDA, for ATRAGEN for APL, Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
       stockholders have the opportunity for recognizing additional
       consideration should the NDA be approved prior to July 6, 2002.

     The Aronex Pharmaceuticals board also considered the following potentially
negative material factors in its deliberations concerning the merger:

     - the loss of control over the future operations of Aronex Pharmaceuticals
       following the merger, and

     - the risk that the benefits sought to be achieved in the merger may not be
       achieved.

     After reviewing these potentially negative factors, the Aronex
Pharmaceuticals board concluded that they were outweighed by the positive
factors described above and accordingly determined that the merger is fair to,
and in the best interests of, Aronex Pharmaceuticals and its stockholders.

     In view of the wide variety of factors considered by the Aronex
Pharmaceuticals board, it did not find it practicable to quantify, or otherwise
attempt to assign relative weights to, the specific factors considered in making
its determination. Consequently, the Aronex Pharmaceuticals board did not
quantify the assumptions and results of its analysis in reaching its
determination that the merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals and its stockholders.

     The Aronex Pharmaceuticals board unanimously recommends that Aronex
Pharmaceuticals stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement and approve the merger.

RECOMMENDATION OF ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS
UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED THE MERGER TO BE FAIR TO YOU AND IN YOUR BEST INTEREST.
ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND
UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS YOUR ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

     In considering the recommendation of the Aronex Pharmaceuticals board of
directors with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that certain
directors and officers of Aronex Pharmaceuticals have certain interests in the
merger that are different from, or are in addition to the interests of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals stockholders generally. Please see the section entitled
"Potential Conflicts and Interests of Aronex Pharmaceuticals Management in the
Merger" on page      of this proxy statement/prospectus.

OPINION OF ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals engaged Robertson Stephens to provide financial
advisory and investment banking services to it in connection with the proposed
merger, and to render an opinion as to the fairness of the "merger
consideration" in the proposed merger, from a financial point of view, to the
"holders of Aronex common stock." (See Annex C for a copy of the full opinion.)
For purposes of this section, "merger consideration" means the shares of
Antigenics common stock and the contingent value rights to be issued in the
merger. The "holders of Aronex common stock" was defined in Robertson Stephens's
written opinion letter to the board of directors of Aronex Pharmaceuticals,
dated April 23, 2001, as all holders of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock
other than Antigenics, Nasa Merger Corp. or any affiliates of Antigenics or Nasa
Merger Corp. or any holders of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock who are
officers or directors (or who have representatives serving as directors) of
Aronex Pharmaceuticals.

     On April 20, 2001, at a meeting of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's board held to
evaluate the proposed merger, Robertson Stephens delivered to Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in a written
opinion dated as of April 23, 2001, that as of that date and based on the
assumptions made, matters considered and the limitations on the review
undertaken described in the written opinion, the merger consideration in the
proposed merger was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of Aronex
common stock. The merger consideration was determined through negotiations
between the respective managements of Aronex Pharmaceuticals and Antigenics.
Although Robertson Stephens did assist the management of Aronex Pharmaceuticals
in those negotiations, it was not asked by, and did not recommend to, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals that any specific merger consideration constituted the
appropriate merger consideration for the merger.

     You should consider the following when reading the discussion of the
opinion of Aronex Pharmaceuticals' financial advisor in this document:

     - We urge you to read carefully the entire opinion of Robertson Stephens,
       which is set forth in Annex C to this proxy statement/prospectus and is
       incorporated by reference. The following description of the Robertson
       Stephens opinion is qualified by reference to the full opinion located in
       Annex C. The full opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions
       made, the matters considered and the limitations on the review undertaken
       by Robertson Stephens.

     - The Robertson Stephens opinion was prepared for the information of Aronex
       Pharmaceuticals's board in connection with its evaluation of the merger
       and does not constitute a recommendation to

       the stockholders of Aronex Pharmaceuticals as to how they should vote, or
       take any other action, with respect to the merger.

     - The Robertson Stephens opinion did not address the relative merits of the
       merger and the other business strategies that Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
       board has considered or may be considering, nor does it address the
       decision of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's board to proceed with the merger.

     - The Robertson Stephens opinion was necessarily based upon market,
       economic and other conditions that were in effect on, and information
       made available to Robertson Stephens as of, the date of the opinion. You
       should understand that subsequent developments may affect the conclusion
       expressed in the Robertson Stephens opinion, and that Robertson Stephens
       disclaims any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any
       change in any matter affecting its opinion which may come or be brought
       to Robertson Stephens's attention after the date of its opinion.

     - The Robertson Stephens opinion was limited to the fairness, from a
       financial point of view and as of the date thereof, of the merger
       consideration in the merger to the holders of Aronex common stock.

  Opinion and Analysis of Robertson Stephens

     In connection with the preparation of the Robertson Stephens opinion,
Robertson Stephens:

     - reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other
       business and financial information of Aronex Pharmaceuticals and
       Antigenics, respectively;

     - reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and
       operating data, including certain financial forecasts and other forward
       looking information, concerning Aronex Pharmaceuticals prepared by the
       management of Aronex Pharmaceuticals;

     - reviewed with Antigenics certain publicly available estimates of research
       analysts relating to Antigenics;

     - held discussions with the respective managements of Aronex
       Pharmaceuticals and Antigenics concerning the businesses, past and
       current operations, financial condition and future prospects of both
       Aronex Pharmaceuticals and Antigenics, independently and combined,
       including discussions with the managements of Aronex Pharmaceuticals and
       Antigenics concerning their views regarding the strategic rationale for
       the merger;

     - reviewed the financial terms and conditions set forth in drafts, dated
       April 20, 2001, of the merger agreement, the form of contingent value
       rights agreement and the stockholder voting agreements;

     - reviewed the stock price and trading history of Aronex Pharmaceuticals
       common stock and Antigenics common stock;

     - compared the financial performance of Antigenics and the prices and
       trading activity of Antigenics common stock with that of certain other
       publicly traded companies comparable with Antigenics;

     - compared the financial performance of Aronex Pharmaceuticals with that of
       certain other publicly traded companies comparable with Aronex
       Pharmaceuticals;

     - compared the financial terms of the merger with the financial terms, to
       the extent publicly available, of other transactions that Robertson
       Stephens deemed relevant;

     - reviewed the pro forma impact of the merger;

     - participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of
       Aronex Pharmaceuticals and Antigenics and their financial and legal
       advisors; and

     - made such other studies and inquiries, and reviewed such other data, as
       Robertson Stephens deemed relevant.

     In its review and analysis, and in arriving at its opinion, Robertson
Stephens assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial and other information provided to it (including information furnished
to it orally or otherwise discussed with it by the managements of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals and Antigenics) or publicly available and neither attempted to
verify, nor assumed responsibility for verifying, any of such information.
Robertson Stephens relied upon the assurances of the managements of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals and Antigenics that they were not aware of any facts that would
make such information inaccurate or misleading. Furthermore, Robertson Stephens
did not obtain or make, or assume any responsibility for obtaining or making,
any independent evaluation or appraisal of the properties, assets or liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of Aronex Pharmaceuticals or Antigenics, nor was it
furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.

     With respect to the financial forecasts and other forward-looking financial
information (and the assumptions and bases therefor) for Aronex Pharmaceuticals
that Robertson Stephens reviewed, Robertson Stephens has assumed that:

     - these forecasts and other forward-looking financial information were
       reasonably prepared in good faith on the basis of reasonable assumptions;

     - these forecasts and other forward-looking financial information reflect
       the best currently available estimates and judgments as to the future
       financial condition and performance of Aronex Pharmaceuticals; and

     - these forecasts and other forward-looking information would be realized
       in the amounts and in the time periods currently estimated.

     In addition, Robertson Stephens assumed that:

     - the merger will be consummated upon the terms set forth in the drafts,
       dated April 20, 2001, of the merger agreement, the form of contingent
       value rights agreement and the stockholder voting agreements without
       material alteration thereof, including, among other things, that the
       merger will be accounted for as a "purchase method" business combination
       in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles;

     - the merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the
       Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and

     - the historical financial statements of each of Aronex Pharmaceuticals and
       Antigenics reviewed by Robertson Stephens were prepared and fairly
       presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
       principles consistently applied.

Robertson Stephens relied as to all legal matters relevant to rendering its
opinion on the advice of counsel to Aronex Pharmaceuticals.

     Robertson Stephens expressed no opinion as to:

     - the value of any employee agreement or other arrangement entered into in
       connection with the merger;

     - any tax or other consequences that may result from the merger; or

     - what the value of the Antigenics common stock or the contingent value
       rights will be when issued to Aronex Pharmaceuticals's stockholders
       pursuant to the merger or the price at which the shares of Antigenics
       common stock that are issued pursuant to the merger may be traded in the
       future.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by
Robertson Stephens in connection with rendering its opinion. The summary of the
financial analyses is not a complete description of all of the analyses
performed by Robertson Stephens. Certain of the information in this section is
presented in tabular form. IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES
PERFORMED BY ROBERTSON STEPHENS, THESE TABLES MUST BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE
TEXT ACCOMPANYING EACH TABLE. THE OPINION IS

BASED UPON THE TOTALITY OF THE VARIOUS ANALYSES PERFORMED BY ROBERTSON STEPHENS
AND NO PARTICULAR PORTION OF THE ANALYSES HAS ANY MERIT STANDING ALONE.

  Comparable Companies Analysis

     Using publicly available information, Robertson Stephens analyzed, among
other things, the stock performance of the following selected publicly traded
companies in the biotechnology industry which Robertson Stephens believed to be
reasonably comparable to Aronex Pharmaceuticals:

     - Fusion Medical Technologies, Inc.

     - Immtech International, Inc.

     - LifeCell Corporation

     - DepoMed, Inc.

     - Interleukin Genetics, Inc.

     - Epimmune Inc.

     - Calypte Biomedical Corporation

     Stock performances compared by Robertson Stephens included the percentage
below the highest intraday stock price and the percentage above the lowest
intraday stock price for each company for the previous 52-week period, based
upon the closing stock prices as of April 19, 2001. As set forth in the
following table, applying the mean percentages derived from the percentages for
the comparable companies to the closing stock price of Aronex Pharmaceuticals as
of April 19, 2001 resulted in the following implied equity values, prices per
share and exchange ratios for Aronex Pharmaceuticals:

                                                         IMPLIED        IMPLIED     IMPLIED
                                                      EQUITY VALUE     PRICE PER    EXCHANGE
                                              MEAN    (IN MILLIONS)      SHARE       RATIO
                                              ----    -------------    ---------    --------

Percent below 52-week high..................  70.5%       $41.8          $1.60       0.1016
Percent above 52-week low...................  97.0%       $28.7          $1.10       0.0698

     This compares to the $1.10 in Antigenics common stock and the one
contingent value right that each share of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock
will be exchanged for in the merger, based on the closing price of Antigenics
common stock as of April 19, 2001.

     The implied equity values reflected $2.7 million of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's cash surplus over its debt as of February 28, 2001. The
implied prices per share were based on approximately 26 million shares of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals common stock outstanding using the treasury stock method. The
implied exchange ratios were based on the closing share price of $15.80 for
Antigenics common stock as of April 19, 2001.

  Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis

     Using publicly available information, Robertson Stephens reviewed and
analyzed, among other things, the consideration paid and the purchase price
premiums paid on the following selected acquisition transactions in the
biotechnology industry (listing the acquired company followed by the acquirer
and with the date these transactions were publicly announced in parenthesis)
which Robertson Stephens believed to be reasonably comparable to the proposed
merger:

     The following table sets forth the ranges of the implied Aronex
Pharmaceuticals equity valuations, prices per share and exchange ratios, based
on the closing stock price of Aronex Pharmaceuticals as of April 19, 2001,
derived from applying a range of one day and one month purchase price premiums
that Robertson Stephens derived from the precedent transactions:

                                            IMPLIED          IMPLIED           IMPLIED
                            RANGE OF     EQUITY VALUES      PRICE PER         EXCHANGE
                            PREMIUMS     (IN MILLIONS)        SHARE             RATIO
                            ---------    -------------    -------------    ---------------

One day premium...........  20% - 30%    $23.4 - $25.4    $0.90 - $0.98    0.0570 - 0.0617
One month premium.........  30% - 40%    $30.7 - $33.0    $1.18 - $1.27    0.0746 - 0.0803
Mean......................                                $1.04 - $1.12    0.0658 - 0.0710

     This compares to the $1.10 in Antigenics common stock and the one
contingent value right that each share of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock
will be exchanged for in the merger, based on the closing price of Antigenics
common stock as of April 19, 2001.

     The implied equity values reflected $2.7 million of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's cash surplus over its debt as of February 28, 2001. The
implied prices per share were based on approximately 26 million shares of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals common stock outstanding using the treasury stock method. The
implied exchange ratios were based on a closing share price of $15.80 for
Antigenics common stock as of April 19, 2001.

  Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

     Robertson Stephens performed a discounted cash flow analysis on the
after-tax free cash flows of Aronex Pharmaceuticals for calendar years 2001
through 2005 using estimates prepared by Aronex Pharmaceuticals's management.
Robertson Stephens first discounted the estimated after-tax free cash flows
through the calendar year ending 2005 using discount rates ranging from 40.0% to
50.0%. Robertson Stephens then added to the present value of these after-tax
free cash flows the exit value of Aronex Pharmaceuticals in the calendar year
ending 2005, discounted back to the present at the same discount rates. The exit
value was computed by multiplying estimated revenue for calendar year 2005 by
exit revenue multiples ranging from 1.50x to 2.50x. The range of exit revenue
multiples selected reflects Robertson Stephens's judgment as to an appropriate
range of multiples at the end of the referenced period. Applying the above
ranges of discount rates and exit revenue multiples to the after-tax free cash
flows of Aronex Pharmaceuticals and taking into account $2.7 million of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's cash surplus over its debt as of February 28, 2001 yielded the
following ranges:

   IMPLIED         IMPLIED          IMPLIED
EQUITY VALUES     PRICE PER        EXCHANGE
(IN MILLIONS)       SHARE            RATIO
- -------------   -------------   ---------------

$8.0 - $36.7    $0.31 - $1.41   0.0195 - 0.0894

     This compares to the $1.10 in Antigenics common stock and the one
contingent value right that each share of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock
will be exchanged for in the merger, based on the closing price of Antigenics
common stock as of April 19, 2001.

  Antigenics Comparable Companies Analysis

     Using publicly available information, Robertson Stephens analyzed, among
other things, the total enterprise value, trading multiples and stock
performance of Antigenics and the following selected publicly

traded companies in the biotechnology industry which Robertson Stephens believed
to be reasonably comparable to Antigenics:

     - NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

     - Adolor Corporation

     - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

     - EntreMed, Inc.

     - SuperGen, Inc.

     - Pharmacyclics, Inc.

     - Vical Incorporated

     - Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

     In examining these selected publicly traded companies, Robertson Stephens
calculated the total enterprise value of each company as a multiple of its
respective estimated calendar year 2001 and 2002 revenues and compared such
multiples to corresponding multiples for Antigenics. Total enterprise value
means diluted equity value using the treasury method plus debt less cash, based
on the closing stock prices as of April 19, 2001. Revenue data for the selected
publicly traded companies were obtained from research analysts estimates. Stock
performances compared by Robertson Stephens included the percentage below the
highest intraday stock price and the percentage above the lowest intraday stock
price for each company for the previous 52-week period and the year to date
performance of the stock for each company, based upon the closing stock prices
as of April 19, 2001. Robertson Stephens's analysis of these selected publicly
traded companies resulted in the following:

                                    TOTAL ENTERPRISE VALUE/
                                   --------------------------          STOCK PERFORMANCE
                                     CY 2001        CY 2002      -----------------------------
                                     REVENUE        REVENUE      % BELOW    % ABOVE    YEAR TO
                                   (ESTIMATED)    (ESTIMATED)     HIGH        LOW       DATE
                                   -----------    -----------    -------    -------    -------

High.............................     91.8x          36.0x        23.7%      220.1%       7.9%
Low..............................      8.7x           5.6x        82.8%       34.9%     (59.4)%
ANTIGENICS.......................     57.4X          50.6X        26.5%       48.7%      42.8%

     Based on an analysis of this data, Robertson Stephens concluded that the
trading multiples and stock performance of Antigenics common stock were within
the range of the comparable companies.

  Other Factors

     In rendering its opinion, Robertson Stephens considered other factors and
conducted other analyses, including a review of certain pro forma effects
resulting from the merger which took into account the impact of the merger on
the projected earnings per share of the combined company for calendar years 2001
through 2005 based on Aronex Pharmaceuticals management projections for its
revenues and Robertson Stephens equity research analyst estimates for Antigenics
revenues.

     No company, business or transaction compared in any of the above analyses
is identical to Aronex Pharmaceuticals, Antigenics or the proposed merger.
Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing is not entirely
mathematical; rather it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that
could affect the public trading, acquisition and other values of the comparable
companies, precedent transactions or the business segment, company or
transaction to which they are being compared. In addition, various analyses
performed by Robertson Stephens incorporate projections prepared by research
analysts using only publicly available information. These estimates may or may
not prove to be accurate.

     While this summary describes the analysis and factors that Robertson
Stephens deemed material in its presentation to the Aronex Pharmaceuticals
board, it is not a comprehensive description of all analysis

and factors considered by Robertson Stephens. The preparation of a fairness
opinion is a complex process that involves various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of
these methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is
not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving
at its opinion, Robertson Stephens did not attribute any particular weight to
any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments
as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly,
Robertson Stephens believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and
that selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors considered by it,
without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying its opinion. Several
analytical methodologies were employed and no one method of analysis should be
regarded as critical to the overall conclusion reached by Robertson Stephens.
Each analytical technique has inherent strengths and weaknesses, and the nature
of the available information may further affect the value of particular
techniques. The conclusion reached by Robertson Stephens is based on all
analyses and factors taken as a whole and also on application of Robertson
Stephens's own experience and judgment. This conclusion may involve significant
elements of subjective judgment and qualitative analysis. Robertson Stephens
expresses no opinion as to the value or merit standing alone of any one or more
parts of the analysis it performed. In performing its analyses, Robertson
Stephens made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business and other conditions and matters, many of which are beyond the control
of Aronex Pharmaceuticals, Antigenics or Robertson Stephens. Any estimates
contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by these analyses. Accordingly, analyses relating
to the value of businesses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the
prices at which these businesses actually may be sold in the future, and these
estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty.

     The engagement letter between Robertson Stephens and Aronex Pharmaceuticals
provides that, for its services, Robertson Stephens is entitled to receive usual
and customary fees in connection with the transaction and the delivery of the
fairness opinion, and with respect to the fee payable upon delivery of the
fairness opinion, such fee is payable without regard to the conclusion reached
in the opinion. The payment of Robertson Stephens's fees, other than the fee
payable on the delivery of the opinion, is contingent upon the consummation of
the merger. Aronex Pharmaceuticals has also agreed to reimburse Robertson
Stephens for its reasonable and customary out-of-pocket expenses related to this
work, including legal fees, and to indemnify and hold harmless Robertson
Stephens and its affiliates and any other person, director, employee or agent of
Robertson Stephens or any of its affiliates, or any person controlling Robertson
Stephens or its affiliates, for certain losses, claims, damages, expenses and
liabilities relating to or arising out of services provided by Robertson
Stephens as financial advisor to Aronex Pharmaceuticals. The terms of the fee
arrangement with Robertson Stephens, which Aronex Pharmaceuticals and Robertson
Stephens believe are customary in transactions of this nature, were negotiated
at arm's length between Aronex Pharmaceuticals and Robertson Stephens, and
Aronex Pharmaceuticals's board approved these fee arrangements.

     In the past, Robertson Stephens has provided certain investment banking
services to Antigenics, including acting as co-manager for Antigenics's initial
public offering, for which it has been paid customary fees. In the ordinary
course of its business, Robertson Stephens may actively trade securities of
Aronex Pharmaceuticals or Antigenics for its own account and for the account of
its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in
the securities of Aronex Pharmaceuticals or Antigenics.

     Robertson Stephens is an internationally recognized investment banking firm
and was retained based on its experience as a financial advisor in connection
with mergers and acquisitions and in securities valuations generally. As part of
its investment banking business, Robertson Stephens is frequently engaged in the
valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of securities,
private placements and other purposes.

ANTIGENICS'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     In evaluating the proposed merger, the Antigenics board of directors
reviewed presentations from management. In reaching its determination to approve
the merger agreement and the merger, the Antigenics board of directors
considered the following factors in favor of the merger:

     - the acquisition of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's technology and its current
       products, which may enhance Antigenics's ability to produce effective
       therapies for infectious diseases and cancer;

     - the expansion of Antigenics's product pipeline by adding Aronex
       Pharmaceuticals's product pipeline, which includes 4 product candidates
       in phase II and III clinical trials;

     - diversification of Antigenics's product portfolio to include small
       molecules;

     - the addition of a new technology platform; and

     - the potential for marketing approval of a product earlier than previously
       planned.

     The Antigenics board of directors weighed these advantages against
potential risks of the merger. The following summarizes factors against the
merger:

     - As with most mergers, there is a risk that anticipated benefits will not
       be realized; for example, Antigenics may encounter difficulties
       integrating Aronex Pharmaceuticals's operations. Although Antigenics has
       acquired one other company, Antigenics does not have significant
       experience integrating acquired businesses. The board, however, believed
       that the relative sizes of the companies, along with the strategic fit,
       more than offset this risk.

     - There is inherent uncertainty in developing and commercializing
       biotechnology products. The board, however, believed that the promise of
       Aronex Pharmaceuticals's programs and technology outweighs the risk that
       Antigenics will not successfully develop them.

     After considering the potential positive and negative factors of the
merger, the Antigenics directors did not attempt to quantify or prioritize
particular considerations. Each board member may have viewed the various
considerations differently than other board members. Ultimately, the Antigenics
board unanimously concluded that the Aronex Pharmaceuticals merger should
provide significant long-term benefits to Antigenics common stockholders;
consequently, the board approved the merger agreement.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS AND INTERESTS OF ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS MANAGEMENT IN THE
MERGER

     When considering the recommendation of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's board of
directors with respect to approving the merger, you should be aware that the
directors and officers of Aronex Pharmaceuticals have interests in the merger
and participate in arrangements that are different from, or are in addition to,
those of Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders generally. The Aronex
Pharmaceuticals board was aware of these interests and considered them, among
other matters, in approving the merger agreement. These include:

     - Employment.  At the closing of the merger, certain executive officers of
       Aronex Pharmaceuticals may become employees of Antigenics.

     - Accelerated Vesting of Options.  All outstanding options to purchase
       Aronex Pharmaceuticals stock held by a director, officer or employee of
       Aronex Pharmaceuticals that are unvested as of the date of the merger
       will accelerate in full and be immediately vested and exercisable
       immediately preceding the consummation of the merger, except for an
       option granted to one of Aronex Pharmaceutical's directors. Consequently,
       all options outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
       merger will be subject to accelerated vesting. On May 16, 2001, options
       to purchase 3,021,287 shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals stock were
       outstanding with a weighted average exercise price per share of $3.41. In
       addition, Antigenics has agreed to assume all of the options held by
       Aronex Pharmaceuticals's directors, officers and employees. As a result,
       those options shall become exercisable for Antigenics common stock
       following the merger.

     - Change of Control/Severance Agreements.  Geoffrey F. Cox, Ph.D., Paul A.
       Cossum, Ph.D., Anthony Williams, M.D., Terance A. Murnane and Seenu
       Srinivasan, Ph.D. (each an executive officer of Aronex Pharmaceuticals)
       have employment agreements with Aronex Pharmaceuticals which contain
       severance provisions. After completion of the merger, if any of these
       officers is terminated without cause, each is entitled to continue to
       receive for the amount of time set forth opposite their name in the table
       below (1) their salary at the time of termination and (2) health, dental,
       vision and related benefits, including if they decide to terminate their
       employment for good reason, which means that they terminate their
       employment because of a material diminution in their title or
       responsibilities within 12 months following the merger. The table also
       includes the total amount payable to each of the officers as a result of
       these severance obligations. The salary payable under these severance
       arrangements is to be paid in substantially the same manner as salary is
       paid to other employees, except that the salary payable to Dr. Cox is to
       be paid in a lump sum at his termination.

                                                          HEALTH AND       AGGREGATE

Seenu Srinivasan, Ph.D. ................     1 year       12 months        $170,000

     - Indemnification.  Aronex Pharmaceuticals officers and directors have
       continuing indemnification against some liabilities. Under the merger
       agreement, Antigenics has committed to continue to honor the existing
       indemnification obligations of Aronex Pharmaceuticals to its officers and
       directors after the completion of the merger.

                      THE MERGER AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary of significant provisions of the merger
agreement. For a more complete understanding of the merger agreement, you should
read the agreement. The agreement is attached as Annex A and is incorporated
into this proxy statement/prospectus by reference.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MERGER

     In the merger, Nasa Merger Corp., a specially formed, wholly owned
subsidiary of Antigenics, will merge with and into Aronex Pharmaceuticals.
Aronex Pharmaceuticals will be the surviving corporation and will continue to
exist under Delaware law as a wholly owned subsidiary of Antigenics. The charter
and by-laws of the specially formed, wholly owned subsidiary, as in effect
immediately before the merger, will be the charter and by-laws of the surviving
company.

EFFECTIVE TIME

     Antigenics expects to close the merger by             , 2001. The merger
will be effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Delaware
Secretary of State, or a later time that Antigenics specifies in the certificate
of merger. Antigenics plans to file the certificate of merger soon after the
Aronex Pharmaceuticals special meeting.

MERGER CONSIDERATION FOR ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS STOCK AND EXCHANGE RATIOS

     At the effective time of the merger, each then-outstanding share of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals common stock will be converted into a fraction of a share of
Antigenics common stock according to an exchange ratio. The exchange ratio will
be based upon the average closing price of the Antigenics common stock on the
Nasdaq National Market over the 10 trading days ending on the second trading day
before the closing of the merger. The exchange ratio of Aronex Pharmaceuticals
common stock into Antigenics common stock will be calculated as follows:

IF THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE OF
ANTIGENICS COMMON STOCK IS                          THEN THE EXCHANGE RATIO WILL BE
- -------------------------------            -------------------------------------------------

Less than or equal to $12.00               0.0917
Between $12.00 and $20.00                  $1.10 divided by the average closing price of
                                             Antigenics common stock as calculated above
Greater than or equal to $20.00            0.0550

     To illustrate further, the table below provides a sample range of
Antigenics common stock average closing prices and the corresponding exchange
ratios and per share values of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock exchanged in
the merger (the value attributed to Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock does not
take into account any potential value for the contingent value rights). The
actual Antigenics common stock average closing prices could be greater or lower
than those set forth below.

      $18.50             0.0595               $1.10
      $19.00             0.0579               $1.10
      $20.00             0.0550               $1.10
      $21.00             0.0550               $1.16
      $21.50             0.0550               $1.18
      $22.00             0.0550               $1.21
      $25.00             0.0550               $1.38

     The exchange ratio was agreed to in arm's-length negotiations between
representatives of Antigenics and Aronex Pharmaceuticals, with the benefit of
advice from their respective financial advisors.

     Each holder of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock will also receive one
contingent value right for each share of Aronex Pharmaceuticals stock it holds.
Each contingent value right represents the right to receive, upon the
achievement of a milestone by Aronex Pharmaceuticals prior to July 6, 2002, a
fraction of a share of Antigenics common stock equal to an exchange ratio. The
exchange ratio will be calculated by dividing $0.15 by the average per share
closing price of Antigenics common stock during a 10-day period ending on the
third day prior to the date the milestone is achieved. The exchange ratio for
the contingent value right shall not less than .0075 or greater than .0125 and
the exchange ratio shall be reduced by 10% increments for each $50,000 increment
above $4,000,000 that Aronex Pharmaceuticals incurs merger transaction expenses,
which are defined as (1) fees and expenses of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
attorneys, accountants, financial advisors and other outside advisors directly
related to the merger agreement and (2) severance payments payable because of
either the merger or the termination of its employees as a direct result of the
merger. If these merger transaction expenses exceed $4,500,000, the exchange
ratio will be 0. The milestone to be achieved is the receipt of final approval
by the FDA of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's NDA for ATRAGEN as a treatment for
patients with APL in any indication. If Aronex Pharmaceuticals achieves this
milestone on or before July 6, 2002 and the merger transaction expenses are less
than $4,500,000, each contingent value right becomes the right to receive
Antigenics common stock.

NO FRACTIONAL SHARES

     Antigenics will not issue fractional shares in the merger. Instead,
Antigenics will pay cash to each Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholder who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of Antigenics common
stock. The cash amount for the shares of Antigenics common stock to be issued at
the closing of the merger will equal the fractional share number multiplied by
the per share closing price of Antigenics common stock as reported by the Nasdaq
National Market on the trading day the effective time occurs.

     The cash amount for the shares of Antigenics to be issued pursuant to the
contingent value right, if any, will equal the fractional share number
multiplied by the per share closing price of Antigenics common stock as reported
by the Nasdaq National Market on the trading day on which Aronex Pharmaceuticals
achieves the milestone.

EXCHANGE OF ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS STOCK CERTIFICATES

     Promptly after the effective time, Antigenics or the exchange agent will
mail transmittal forms to each person who held shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals
common stock as of the effective time for use in exchanging Aronex
Pharmaceuticals stock certificates for Antigenics common stock certificates,
cash for fractional shares, and contingent value right certificates. The
transmittal forms will include instructions specifying details of the exchange.

     If the milestone is achieved, promptly thereafter Antigenics or the rights
agent will mail transmittal forms to each person who held contingent value right
certificates as of the date the milestone is achieved for use in exchanging the
contingent value right certificates for Antigenics common stock certificates and
any cash for fractional shares. The transmittal forms will include instructions
specifying details of the exchange.

  DO NOT SEND IN YOUR ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS CERTIFICATES UNTIL YOU RECEIVE A
TRANSMITTAL FORM.

     If certificates for any shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, the holder must submit appropriate evidence
regarding the ownership, loss, theft or destruction of the certificate, an
affidavit to that effect and a customary indemnification agreement to the
exchange agent.

     Antigenics will honor a request from a person surrendering an Aronex
Pharmaceuticals common stock certificate that the Antigenics common stock being
given in exchange be issued to a person other than the registered holder of the
certificate on the exchange agent's books, so long as the requesting person:

     - submits all documents necessary to evidence and effect the transfer to
       the new holder; and

     - pays any transfer or other taxes for issuing shares of Antigenics common
       stock to a person other than the registered holder of the certificate,
       unless the requesting person satisfactorily establishes to Antigenics
       that any tax has been paid or is inapplicable.

     Holders of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock exchanged for Antigenics
common stock in the merger will be entitled to receive dividends and other
distributions on Antigenics common stock (without interest) that are declared or
made with a record date after the effective time. Dividends or other
distributions will not be paid to any former holder of Aronex Pharmaceuticals
common stock, however, until that holder surrenders its shares of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals stock to the exchange agent.

TREATMENT OF ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS STOCK OPTIONS, WARRANTS, AND CONVERTIBLE
NOTE

  Options

     At the effective time of the merger, Antigenics will assume each
outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals
stock granted under Aronex Pharmaceuticals's Amended and Restated 1989 Stock
Option Plan, Amended and Restated 1998 Stock Option Plan, and Amended and
Restated 1993 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan, whether or not
exercisable. Each assumed option will continue to be governed by the same terms
and conditions of the applicable Aronex Pharmaceuticals stock option plan that
were in effect immediately before the effective time of the merger, except that:

     - each option will be exercisable for (1) a number of shares of Antigenics
       common stock equal to the number of shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals
       stock that were issuable upon exercise of the option immediately before
       the effective time multiplied by the merger's exchange ratio, rounded
       down to the nearest whole number of shares of Antigenics common stock and
       (2) either (A) if

exercised prior to the date the milestone is achieved (but not after July 6,
2002), that number of contingent value rights equal to the number of shares of
Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock subject to the option or (B) if exercised
      after the milestone is achieved (so long as it was achieved prior to July
      6, 2002), that number of shares of Antigenics common stock that would have
      been issued, if any, had the holder of the option had contingent value
      rights on the date the milestone was achieved;

     - the per share exercise price for the shares of Antigenics common stock
       issuable upon exercise of the assumed option will be equal to the
       exercise price per share of Aronex Pharmaceuticals stock at which the
       option was exercisable immediately before the effective time divided by
       the merger's exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent; and

     - all options to purchase shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals stock will
       become fully vested and exercisable, except for an option granted to one
       of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's directors.

     On May 16, 2001, options to purchase 3,021,287 shares of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals stock were outstanding; the weighted average exercise price per
share of these options was $3.41.

     Antigenics has agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-8 for the
shares of Antigenics common stock subject to Aronex Pharmaceuticals stock
options. Antigenics expects that the registration statement will be effective
shortly after the effective time of the merger, and Antigenics has agreed to use
commercially reasonably efforts to maintain the effectiveness of that
registration statement for so long as former Aronex Pharmaceuticals stock
options remain outstanding.

  Warrants

     At the effective time of the merger, Antigenics will assume each
outstanding and unexercised warrant to purchase shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals
stock, which in the aggregate are exercisable for 1,762,175 shares of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals common stock with a weighted average exercise price per share of
$3.14. Each assumed warrant will continue to be governed by the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the respective Aronex Pharmaceuticals warrant,
except that:

     - each warrant will be exercisable for (1) a number of shares of Antigenics
       common stock equal to the number of shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals
       stock that were issuable upon exercise of the warrant immediately before
       the effective time multiplied by the merger's exchange ratio, rounded
       down to the nearest whole number of shares of Antigenics common stock and
       (2) either (A) if exercised prior to the date the milestone is achieved
       (but not after July 6, 2002), that number of contingent value rights
       equal to the number of shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock
       subject to the warrant or (B) if exercised after the milestone is
       achieved (so long as it was achieved prior to July 6, 2002), that number
       of shares of Antigenics common stock that would have been issued, if any,
       had the holder of the warrant had contingent value rights on the date the
       milestone was achieved; and

     - the per share exercise price for the shares of Antigenics common stock
       issuable upon exercise of the assumed warrant will be equal to the
       exercise price per share of Aronex Pharmaceuticals stock at which the
       warrant was exercisable immediately before the effective time divided by
       the merger's exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

     Antigenics has agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-3 for the
shares of Antigenics common stock subject to Aronex Pharmaceuticals warrants, to
the extent required under the warrants. Antigenics expects that the registration
statement will be effective shortly after the effective time of the merger, and
Antigenics has agreed to use commercially reasonably efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of that registration statement for so long as former Aronex
Pharmaceuticals warrants remain outstanding.

  Convertible Note

     At the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will assume
all obligations and duties of Aronex Pharmaceuticals under its outstanding $2.5
million 10% convertible note payable to Genzyme Corporation dated May 21, 1999.
The convertible note will continue to be governed by the same terms and
conditions set forth in the convertible note that were in effect immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger, except that the convertible note
shall be convertible into whole shares of Antigenics common stock and cash in
lieu of fractional shares calculated as follows:

     - the conversion price will be equal to the conversion price of the
       convertible note at which the note was convertible immediately before the
       effective time divided by the merger's exchange ratio, rounded up to the
       nearest whole cent;

     - cash in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid, immediately after the
       effective time of the merger agreement, based upon the conversion price
       in effect immediately after the effective time; and

     - either (i) if the convertible note is converted prior to the date the
       milestone is achieved or July 6, 2002, whichever is earlier, that number
       of contingent value rights equal to the number of shares of Antigenics
       common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible note immediately
       prior to the effective time, or (ii) if the convertible note is converted
       after the date the milestone is achieved (so long as it is achieved by
       July 6, 2002) that number of shares of Antigenics common stock that would
       have been issued, if any, had the holder of the convertible note held
       such contingent value rights.

TREATMENT OF ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS BENEFITS AND STOCK PURCHASE PLANS AND OTHER
EMPLOYEE MATTERS

     Antigenics has agreed to give Aronex Pharmaceuticals employees who remain
with the company after the merger full credit in terms of eligibility, vesting,
benefit accrual, except benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans and
except as would result in duplication of benefits, and determination of the
level of benefits under any employee benefit plans. Antigenics has also agreed
to waive limitations for preexisting condition exclusions and waiting periods
under any Antigenics welfare benefit plans that a continuing Aronex
Pharmaceuticals employee is eligible to participate in after the merger. This
waiver would not include, however, limitations and waiting periods that have not
been satisfied under any Aronex Pharmaceuticals welfare plan maintained for the
employee prior to the merger.

     Antigenics has further agreed to assume and honor all Aronex
Pharmaceuticals employment, severance and other compensation agreements existing
prior to execution of the merger agreement.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals has agreed to terminate its 401(k) plan immediately
before closing unless Antigenics agrees to sponsor the plan following the
merger.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals has also agreed to terminate its 1997 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan on the effective date of the merger.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     Antigenics will account for the merger using the purchase method of
accounting for a business combination. Under this method of accounting, the
assets and liabilities of Aronex Pharmaceuticals, including intangible assets,
will be recorded at their fair values. The results of operations and cash flows
of Aronex Pharmaceuticals will be included in Antigenics's financial statements
following the completion of the merger. Consistent with GAAP, amounts assigned
to acquired in-process research and development -- i.e., Aronex Pharmaceuticals
research and development projects that are still in process at the closing of
the merger, but which, if unsuccessful, have no alternative future use -- must
be charged to expense on the date that the merger closes.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

     The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger. The discussion is based on the Internal Revenue
Code, related regulations, existing administrative interpretations and court
decisions, all of which may change, possibly with retroactive effect. This
discussion assumes that Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders hold their shares of
Aronex Pharmaceuticals stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section
1221 of the Internal Revenue Code. This discussion does not address all aspects
of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to you either in light of
your particular circumstances or if you are subject to special rules. These
special rules include those relating to:

     - stockholders who are not U.S. citizens or residents or that are foreign
       corporations, partnerships, estates or trusts;

     - financial institutions;

     - tax-exempt organizations;

     - insurance companies;

     - dealers in securities;

     - stockholders who acquired their Aronex Pharmaceuticals stock by
       exercising options or similar derivative securities or otherwise as
       compensation; and

     - stockholders who hold their Aronex Pharmaceuticals stock as part of a
       hedge, straddle, appreciated financial position or conversion
       transaction.

     This section, as it relates to matters of United States federal income tax
law, constitutes the opinions of Andrews & Kurth L.L.P., counsel to Aronex
Pharmaceuticals, and Palmer & Dodge LLP, counsel to Antigenics. These opinions
are based on a number of assumptions, representations and covenants, including
the assumption that the merger will be completed as described in this document
and that the representations contained in letters delivered to counsel by Aronex
Pharmaceuticals, Antigenics and the merger subsidiary in connection with the
delivery of the opinions will be accurate through the closing. The opinions
neither bind the IRS nor preclude the IRS from adopting a position contrary to
that expressed in the opinions. Aronex Pharmaceuticals and Antigenics cannot
assure you that contrary positions will not be successfully asserted by the IRS
or adopted by a court if the issues are litigated. Neither Aronex
Pharmaceuticals nor Antigenics intends to obtain a ruling from the IRS with
respect to the tax consequences of the merger.

     Based upon and subject to the assumptions and limitations stated above, it
is the opinion of Andrews & Kurth L.L.P. and Palmer & Dodge LLP that the merger
will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code and Antigenics, Aronex Pharmaceuticals and the merger subsidiary will each
be a party to that reorganization. As a result of the qualification of the
merger as a reorganization, the material federal income tax consequences will be
as described below.

  Tax Consequences to Aronex Pharmaceuticals Stockholders

     Except as discussed below with respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of
fractional shares, Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders will not recognize gain
or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on their receipt of Antigenics
common stock, including their receipt of any additional shares of Antigenics
common stock pursuant to the contingent value rights agreement, in exchange for
their Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock in the merger.

     The aggregate tax basis of the Antigenics common stock received by Aronex
Pharmaceuticals common stockholders in exchange for their Aronex Pharmaceuticals
common stock (including fractional shares of Antigenics common stock that are
converted to cash and any additional shares of Antigenics common stock that are
distributed pursuant to the contingent value rights agreement) will be the same
as the aggregate tax basis of the Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock
surrendered in exchange therefor.

Until additional shares, if any, are distributed pursuant to the contingent
value rights agreement, the interim basis of the Antigenics common stock
received by Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders in exchange for their Aronex
Pharmaceuticals common stock will be determined by assuming that Aronex
Pharmaceuticals stockholders will receive, in exchange for their Aronex
Pharmaceuticals common stock, the maximum number of additional shares that could
be issued pursuant to the contingent value rights agreement.

     The holding period of the Antigenics common stock received by Aronex
Pharmaceuticals stockholders in exchange for their Aronex Pharmaceuticals common
stock (including fractional shares of Antigenics common stock that are converted
to cash and any additional shares of Antigenics common stock that are
distributed pursuant to the contingent value rights agreement) will include the
holding period of the Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock surrendered in
exchange therefor.

     Stockholders who receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Antigenics
common stock will be treated as having received the fractional shares and then
as having exchanged the fractional shares for cash in a redemption by
Antigenics. A stockholder will recognize gain or loss as a result of this deemed
redemption in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash
received and the portion of the tax basis of the stockholder's Aronex
Pharmaceuticals common stock surrendered in the merger that is allocable to the
fractional share.

  Tax Consequences to Antigenics and Aronex Pharmaceuticals

     Antigenics, including its merger subsidiary, and Aronex Pharmaceuticals
will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes by reason
of the merger.

  Backup Withholding

     Unless a stockholder complies with reporting and/or certification
procedures or is an exempt recipient under the backup withholding and
information reporting provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury
regulations, the holder may be subject to a 31% backup withholding tax on any
cash payments received in the merger. Any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder's
federal income tax liability, provided the required information is furnished to
the IRS.

     THIS DISCUSSION IS ONLY INTENDED TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A GENERAL SUMMARY OF
THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER. THIS DISCUSSION
IS NOT A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION OF EVERY POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME
TAX CONSEQUENCE OR ANY OTHER CONSEQUENCE OF THE MERGER. IN ADDITION, THE
DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE
CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. MOREOVER, THIS DISCUSSION DOES NOT
ADDRESS ANY NON-INCOME TAX OR ANY FOREIGN, STATE OR LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF
THE MERGER. ACCORDINGLY, ANTIGENICS STRONGLY URGES YOU TO CONSULT WITH YOUR TAX
ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX
CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE MERGER.

       reorganization within Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code;

     - settle or compromise any material tax liability, change its tax
       accounting methods or periods, enter into any tax-related closing
       agreement, surrender its right to any tax refund, or consent to any
       extension or waiver of the limitations period applicable to any tax claim
       or assessment;

     - settle or compromise any pending or threatened material legal proceeding;

  No Solicitation by Aronex Pharmaceuticals

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals has agreed not to (1) solicit any person regarding
either a business combination with Aronex Pharmaceuticals or any other
transaction as an alternative to this merger,

(2) participate in any negotiations with or provide information to, any person
to seek any alternative transaction to this merger, or (3) negotiate with or
furnish information to, a third party regarding an alternative transaction
unless Aronex Pharmaceuticals's board or officers are otherwise required by
their fiduciary duties. Aronex Pharmaceuticals has agreed to inform Antigenics
of any written inquiry it receives relating to an alternative transaction.

  Recommendation of the Aronex Pharmaceuticals Board

action that does not interfere with its fiduciary duties to secure the vote of
its stockholders adopting the merger agreement.

Directors

     Antigenics has agreed to cause the surviving corporation of the merger to
honor Aronex Pharmaceuticals's indemnification obligations under agreements with
its directors and officers and its charter and bylaws in effect before the

maintain for six years, a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy
that provides coverage substantially similar to the coverage provided to Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's directors and officers on the date of the merger agreement for
events occurring before the effective time of the merger. Aronex
Pharmaceuticals, however, may not pay more than $250,000 for directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage without Antigenics prior written consent.

  Payment of Termination Fee

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals has agreed to pay Antigenics $1,200,000 if the
merger agreement is terminated in any of the following circumstances:

     - Antigenics terminates the merger agreement because either Aronex
       Pharmaceuticals has breached the representations and warranties in the
       merger agreement or has failed to materially comply with any of the
       covenants or agreements contained in the merger agreement or Aronex
       Pharmaceuticals's board of directors withdraws it recommendation of the
       merger agreement, recommends an alternative to the merger or fails to
       recommend against, or takes a neutral position with respect to, a tender
       or exchange offer; or

     - Antigenics or Aronex Pharmaceuticals terminates the merger agreement
       because Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders have failed to vote to adopt
       the merger agreement if, at the time of termination, either an
       alternative transaction between Aronex Pharmaceuticals and a third party
       has been announced or Aronex Pharmaceuticals or its stockholders have
       received a proposal for an alternative to the merger.

     Antigenics has agreed to pay Aronex Pharmaceuticals $1,200,000 if:

     - the merger agreement is terminated by Aronex Pharmaceuticals for uncured
       breaches by Antigenics;

     - Aronex Pharmaceuticals is not in breach of any provisions of the merger
       agreement; and

     - an alternative transaction has not been announced or Aronex
       Pharmaceuticals or its stockholders have not received a proposal for an
       alternative transaction.

The payment of this fee by Antigenics is Aronex Pharmaceuticals's sole and
exclusive remedy for any breach of Antigenics's obligations under the merger
agreement.

  Expense Reimbursement

     If the merger agreement is terminated by Antigenics because the Aronex
Pharmaceuticals board of directors, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, has
approved or recommended an alternative to the merger, then Aronex
Pharmaceuticals will pay Antigenics's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in connection with the merger agreement and the merger.

  Payment of Expenses

     Antigenics and Aronex Pharmaceuticals will share equally the fees and
expenses of printing and filing this proxy statement/prospectus and the
registration statement, and except for the expense reimbursement described
above, Antigenics and Aronex Pharmaceuticals will each pay its own
merger-related fees and expenses.

AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS

     Generally, Antigenics and Aronex Pharmaceuticals may amend or waive any
provision of the merger agreement before the effective time of the merger.
However, if a material condition is waived, Antigenics will amend the
registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part,
and Aronex Pharmaceuticals will resolicit proxies for the adoption of the merger
agreement. In addition, after Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders have approved
the merger, their further approval would be required to modify the amount or
type of consideration that they will receive in the merger, to alter the charter
of the surviving corporation or to otherwise alter the merger agreement in a
manner materially adverse to them.

APPRAISAL OR DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

     Under Delaware law, Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders are not entitled to
appraisal or dissenters' rights in connection with the merger because:

     - Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock was, as of the record date for the
       special meeting, designated and reported for trading on the Nasdaq
       National Market; and

     - Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock will be converted into shares of
       Antigenics common stock, which also will be designated and reported for
       trading on the Nasdaq National Market.

NASDAQ LISTING OF ANTIGENICS COMMON STOCK

     Antigenics has agreed to file a listing notification with Nasdaq concerning
the Antigenics common stock to be issued to Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders
in the merger including shares of Antigenics common stock issuable upon exercise
of Aronex Pharmaceuticals options and warrants, upon conversion of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's convertible note and upon exercise of the contingent value
rights.

DELISTING OF ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS COMMON STOCK

     If the merger is completed, Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock will cease
to be quoted on the Nasdaq National Market.

RESALES OF ANTIGENICS COMMON STOCK BY ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS AFFILIATES

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders may freely transfer the shares of
Antigenics common stock received in the merger, unless they are individuals and
entities who are deemed to be "affiliates" of Aronex Pharmaceuticals before the
merger or affiliates of Antigenics after the merger. Persons who may be deemed
to be affiliates of Aronex Pharmaceuticals or Antigenics include individuals or
entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with,
Antigenics and may include executive officers and directors as well as principal
stockholders. These affiliates or their brokers risk being characterized as
"underwriters" when they sell shares of Antigenics common stock received in the
merger. The United States securities laws require registration of shares sold by
underwriters. An affiliate and its broker can avoid being characterized as an
underwriter and, therefore, avoid the Securities Act registration requirements
by selling shares in compliance with Rule 145 or Rule 144 under the Securities
Act. Rule 145 covers sales by Aronex Pharmaceuticals affiliates, and Rule 144
covers sales by Antigenics affiliates. Each rule limits the number of shares an
affiliate can sell in a particular period of time. The merger agreement requires
Aronex Pharmaceuticals to use its best efforts to cause each of its affiliates
to execute and deliver to Antigenics a written agreement to the effect that the
affiliate will not offer or sell or otherwise dispose of Antigenics common stock
issued to the affiliate in the merger, including shares issued pursuant to the
contingent value rights, if any, in violation of the Securities Act or the
related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC.

     This proxy statement/prospectus does not cover resales of Antigenics common
stock received by any person who may be deemed to be an affiliate of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals and/or Antigenics.

REGULATORY MATTERS

     Antigenics and Aronex Pharmaceuticals are not aware of any material
governmental or regulatory requirements that must be complied with regarding the
merger, other than federal securities laws and the filing of documents
describing principal terms of the merger agreement with the secretary of state
of Delaware.

                             BUSINESS OF ANTIGENICS

     Antigenics is developing treatments for cancers, serious infections,
autoimmune disorders and degenerative disorders using its proprietary
technologies intended to program the immune system and improve quality of life.
These products include immunotherapeutics based on a specific class of proteins
known as heat shock proteins, also referred to as HSPs, which activate powerful
cellular immune response, and Stimulon(R) based products, including QS-21, which
activate superior antibody response. Antigenics is evaluating its lead HSP-based
immunotherapeutic, Oncophage(R), in an international multi-center Phase III
clinical trial in kidney cancer and in five additional cancer indications in
Phase II or Phase I/II trials. Through its internal programs and partnerships
with GlaxoSmithKline, Aventis Pasteur, Wyeth-Lederle, Bristol-Myers Squibb,
VaxGen and Elan Pharmaceuticals, Antigenics is testing its Stimulon-based
products in 11 Phase III and Phase II clinical trials for cancer, several
infectious diseases and degenerative diseases. Based upon its scientific and
drug development skills, Antigenics' pioneering technology platforms and its
strategic expertise, Antigenics plans to establish a leadership position in drug
discovery, development and commercialization.

                       BUSINESS OF ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS

GENERAL

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the
identification and development of proprietary innovative medicines to treat
cancer and infectious diseases. Aronex Pharmaceuticals's strategy is to identify
and develop medicines based upon either refinements of proven therapies or new
ways of treating specific diseases. Its focus is on medicines for cancer and
infectious diseases for which current therapy is inadequate. The effectiveness
of the current generation of anti-cancer and anti-infective drugs is limited
because of two significant factors. First, cancer cells frequently become
resistant to commonly used anti-cancer drugs, and organisms responsible for
infectious diseases may also develop resistance to anti-infective drugs. This
resistance results in the ultimate progression of many cancers and some
infections. Second, these current generation drugs, particularly cancer drugs,
are generally toxic because of their lack of selectivity that results in
significant side effects on normal cells. Aronex Pharmaceuticals is targeting
the development of drugs for cancer and infectious diseases that are selective
in their action, with unique or special ways of acting and more favorable safety
profiles.

     In January 2001, Aronex Pharmaceuticals received a non-approval letter from
the FDA for its NDA, amendment for ATRAGEN(R) for patients with APL, for whom
therapy with tretinoin is necessary but for whom an intravenous administration
is required. Following this event, Aronex Pharmaceuticals reduced expenditures
in its development plans and activities. Additionally, Aronex Pharmaceuticals
reduced the number of full-time employees in January 2001 from 77 to 29. Aronex
Pharmaceuticals is currently in discussions with the FDA to determine its
alternatives regarding the NDA.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals will continue to require substantial additional
funds for its operations. As of March 31, 2001, Aronex Pharmaceuticals had $5.3
million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Aronex Pharmaceuticals
believes that it can conserve its existing financial resources to satisfy its
capital and operating requirements into the fourth quarter of 2001. Its
accountants have issued a qualified opinion on its consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2000 indicating substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. In the event the merger with
Antigenics is not completed, Aronex Pharmaceuticals will need to immediately
raise additional funds, or it will have to close operations and seek legal
protection from its creditors.

longer recruiting patients, recruited patients are being monitored according to
the protocol and data is being gathered.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals can give no assurance that the results of any of its
clinical trials will be favorable or that its products will obtain regulatory
approval for commercialization.

CANCER

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals's programs in cancer focus on developing medicines
based upon either refinements of proven therapies or new approaches to the
treatment of specific disease targets. The clinical programs currently focus on
development of ATRAGEN(R) for hematological malignancies and solid tumors,
Annamycin for solid tumors and hematological malignancies and Aroplatin(TM) for
solid tumors.

 ATRAGEN(R) for APL (NDA appeal pending), APL monotherapy (Phase II enrollment
 closed), Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (Phase II enrollment closed), Prostate Cancer
 (Phase II completed), Renal Cell Carcinoma (Phase I/II enrollment closed), AML
 (Phase II enrollment closed), and Kaposi's Sarcoma (Phase II completed)

     ATRAGEN(R) is a lipid-based, intravenous formulation of all-trans-retinoic
acid (ATRA). Aronex Pharmaceuticals's lipid formulation has been developed to
change certain aspects of the drug's behavior in the body to overcome the known
deficiencies of oral retinoids, such as the oral formulation of ATRA. ATRAGEN(R)
has a different pharmacokinetics and distribution profile. In December 2000,
Aronex Pharmaceuticals presented ATRAGEN(R) pharmacokinetic data at the 42nd
Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology. These data were gathered
from healthy volunteers in its pharmacokinetic study of ATRAGEN(R) compared to
Vesanoid(R) (the oral formulation of ATRA). Analysis of pharmacokinetic
parameters revealed a statistically significant 45% decrease in the area under
the plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC) after 9 days of oral ATRA dosing
and a 32% decrease in day 9 maximum concentrations of the drug in the plasma
(Cmax). In contrast, with ATRAGEN(R) there were no decreases in the AUC or Cmax.
Dose-normalized exposure to tretinoin was 6 to 11 times greater with ATRAGEN(R)
dosing than with oral ATRA dosing. Similarly, Cmax was 15 to 23 times higher
following ATRAGEN(R) administration. Investigators concluded that patient
exposure to tretinoin was much less variable with ATRAGEN(R) than with the oral
formulation of ATRA. Although the results from this study did not constitute
evidence of safety or effectiveness, they nevertheless provided a basis for
investigating the safety and efficacy of ATRAGEN(R) in a broad range of cancers.

     Claims to methods of using ATRAGEN(R) are found in an issued United States
patent. Claims to both the composition and its method of use are pending in
continuing patent applications in the United States Patent Office. The issued
patent drawn to ATRAGEN(R) and the continuing applications are assigned jointly
to the Board of Regents of The University of Texas and Aronex Pharmaceuticals,
with Aronex Pharmaceuticals as the exclusive licensee. Claims to the ATRAGEN(R)
formulation have been allowed in the European Patent Office. See "Business of
Aronex Pharmaceuticals -- Patents and Proprietary Rights" on page
               .

     ATRAGEN(R) has been designated an orphan drug for the treatment of acute
and chronic leukemia by the FDA. See "Government Regulation" on page   .

INDICATIONS

  i. Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (NDA appeal pending)

     According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 1,000 new cases of
APL in the United States are diagnosed annually, and each year approximately
277,000 patients in the United States develop the various types of cancer
identified as potential indications for ATRAGEN(R). ATRAGEN(R) also may be
useful in treating a variety of hematological malignancies and solid tumors.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals completed a Phase I clinical trial of ATRAGEN(R) in
1995 in patients with cancers of the blood. Phase I data presented in the
journal Blood during 1996 indicated that ATRAGEN(R) sustains levels in the blood
after prolonged dosing, is well tolerated and shows evidence of activity against
certain leukemias and lymphomas. Aronex Pharmaceuticals recently completed
patient enrollment for the Phase II clinical evaluation of ATRAGEN(R) for its
potential to induce remission in APL patients. In December 2000, pivotal Phase
II efficacy and safety data compiled from sites in the United States and Peru
were presented at the 42nd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology.
Efficacy data on 95 evaluable patients indicated that ATRAGEN(R) was an
effective agent for inducing complete remission in APL patients. Safety data
from 117 APL patients indicated that ATRAGEN(R) was safe and well tolerated at
the 90 mg/m(2) dose. Based on the pivotal Phase II data, in December 1998,
Aronex Pharmaceuticals submitted an NDA with the FDA for ATRAGEN(R) for the
treatment of patients with APL for whom therapy with the drug tretinoin is
necessary but for whom an intravenous administration is required.

     In September 1999, Aronex Pharmaceuticals received a letter from the FDA
notifying it that the application was not approvable in its current form. In
July 2000, Aronex Pharmaceuticals submitted an amendment to the NDA and in
January 2001, the FDA denied approval of its NDA amendment for ATRAGEN(R). Based
on their review of the NDA amendment, the FDA stated that the proposed claim was
not supported by the data contained in the amendment, and did not establish an
identifiable population of patients who need tretinoin and cannot use the oral
formulation. Aronex Pharmaceuticals is currently in discussions with the FDA
seeking guidance regarding its available options at this time.

     This indication represents a therapeutic area where new therapies are
needed. ATRA, or tretinoin, has been approved as an oral formulation by the FDA
as a treatment for APL. ATRA and other retinoids cause cell differentiation in
contrast to most conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Retinoids are molecules
comprising both natural and synthetic derivatives of retinol, otherwise known as
vitamin A. However, Aronex Pharmaceuticals believes the effectiveness of the
oral formulation of ATRA may be reduced by the rate at which it is metabolized,
which lowers the amount of drug that reaches the cancer target.

  ii. APL monotherapy (Phase II enrollment closed)

     ATRAGEN(R) is also being assessed in Phase II clinical trials for its use
as a monotherapy in the treatment of newly-diagnosed APL patients. Interim Phase
II data presented in the journal Blood in January 2001 indicated that ATRAGEN(R)
can induce long-term remissions. Some of the patients sustained ongoing
remissions for as long as 24 months. Patient enrollment for this trial is now
closed.

  iii. Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (Phase II enrollment closed)

     In 1998, Aronex Pharmaceuticals initiated a Phase II clinical trial in
relapsed and refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In December 2000, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals presented preliminary results at the 42nd Annual Meeting of the
American Society of Hematology. The presented data represented 57 evaluable
patients. In this heavily treated patient population with a highly unfavorable
prognosis, 17 patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma, aggressive B cell
lymphoma or peripheral T cell lymphoma responded to treatment with ATRAGEN(R).
Responders, some of whom are still being monitored, had a median
progression-free survival of 6 months, an encouraging result. Toxicities were
mostly mild, and side effects most commonly were headache, dry skin, edema,
arthralgia and xerostomia. Patient enrollment for this trial is now closed.

  iv. Prostate Cancer (Phase II completed)

     In 1998, Aronex Pharmaceuticals initiated a Phase II clinical trial in
hormone-refractory prostate cancer. This trial has been completed. Aronex
Pharmaceuticals is reviewing the data for this trial and anticipates presenting
the data at an appropriate scientific meeting.

  v. Renal Cell Carcinoma (Phase I/II enrollment closed)

     In early 1999, a Phase I/II clinical trial in renal cell carcinoma was
initiated at New York Presbyterian Hospital and the Weill Medical College of
Cornell University under an institutional Investigational New Drug application,
or IND. The Phase I/II trial was designed to determine the maximum tolerated
dose of ATRAGEN(R) in combination with interferon alpha. In May 2001, data were
presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting.
Investigators reported that the combination of ATRAGEN(R) at 15 mg/m(2) every
other day and interferon alpha at 3 to 5 to 7 million units five days a week was
well tolerated without toxicity. Of the 16 evaluable patients, two had partial
remission in bone and lung, including one patient whose remission has lasted for
longer than 77 weeks and is ongoing. Five patients had stable disease, two
progressed in bone only.

  vi. Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (Phase II enrollment closed)

     In late 1999, Aronex Pharmaceuticals initiated a Phase II clinical trial in
acute myelogenous leukemia. Patient enrollment for this trial is closed and
Aronex Pharmaceuticals continues to monitor patients according to the protocol.
Aronex Pharmaceuticals is currently gathering the data for analysis.

  vii. Kaposi's sarcoma (Phase II completed)

     ATRAGEN(R) has also been assessed in Phase II clinical trials for the
treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma. Clinical trial results indicated that ATRAGEN(R)
was generally well tolerated, with headaches and dry skin being the primary
reported adverse events. Aronex Pharmaceuticals is not presently pursuing this
indication, although it may do so in the future.

 Annamycin for Refractory Breast Cancer (Phase II completed) and Refractory
 Leukemia (Phase I/II completed)

     Annamycin is a novel chemical entity belonging to the class of widely
prescribed anti-cancer agents known as anthracyclines. This class of drug, which
includes doxorubicin, daunorubicin and idarubicin, has been shown to be
effective, either alone or in combination, against proliferating cancer cells.
Anthracyclines currently on the market, however, suffer from two primary
limitations:

     - Cancer cells often develop a resistance to them, rendering the treatment
       ineffective. This resistance, once developed by cancer cells, generally
       extends to include resistance to a variety of other chemotherapeutic
       agents, a phenomenon commonly referred to as multi-drug resistance. The
       best understood mechanism behind multi-drug resistance involves an
       increase in the production of

       P-glycoprotein, a trans-cell membrane pump. This pump transports drugs,
       including most types of anti-cancer drugs, out of tumor cells.

     - Currently available anthracyclines also frequently result in severe toxic
       effects, including irreversible cardiotoxicity.

     Annamycin was designed to overcome these two major limitations. In contrast
to conventional chemotherapeutic agents, Annamycin is structured so that it
avoids the mechanism of operation of the trans-cell membrane pump believed to be
one of the mechanisms responsible for multi-drug resistance. Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's preclinical studies have shown that Annamycin, which is a
lipid-based formulation of a novel anthracycline, may be active against
multi-drug resistant tumor cells that over-express at least two of the pumps
that are believed to be, at least in part, responsible for tumor cells becoming
resistant to treatment. This over-expression implies that the levels of the
enzymes present in a particular person exceed the levels found in a healthy or
normal person. Aronex Pharmaceuticals's preclinical studies of Annamycin in
animals bearing human tumors also indicate that Annamycin may be less
cardiotoxic than doxorubicin. A Phase I dose-escalating clinical trial of
Annamycin was completed in August 1997. Data from this trial were presented at
the ASCO meeting in May 1997. Annamycin has been evaluated in Phase II
multi-center clinical trials in breast cancer patients whose tumors are
resistant to conventional therapies. In April 1999, Aronex Pharmaceuticals
initiated a Phase I/II clinical trial in refractory leukemia patients. All of
the Annamycin clinical trials are now completed. Data from the Phase I clinical
trial in relapsed/refactory leukemia patients was presented at the ASCO meeting
in May 2001. Annamycin was infused at a starting dose of 190 mg/m(2) every day
for three days with escalation to 230, 280 and 350 mg/m(2), as appropriate. The
maximum tolerated dose was determined at 280 mg/m(2). Of the 21 patients
enrolled, two achieved complete remission: one AML patient at 280 mg/m(2) who
had failed induction therapy with a chemotherapy combination regimen and one ALL
patient at 350 mg/m(2) who relapsed after allogeneic bone marrow transplant. The
physicians reported that Annamycin was generally well tolerated with no observed
cardiotoxicity, which is frequently associated with anthracyclines. Aronex
Pharmaceuticals is currently evaluating the Annamycin clinical development
program.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals believes that there is a substantial market for an
agent which is active against multi-drug resistance and exhibits an improved
safety profile over doxorubicin. The American Cancer Society estimates that each
year there are approximately 183,000 new cases of breast cancer in the United
States. Annamycin also may be useful in treating other varieties of solid
tumors, leukemias and lymphomas.

     While there are a range of chemotherapeutic agents used alone and in
combination to treat breast cancer and other solid tumors, including
doxorubicin, daunorubicin, liposomal formulations of doxorubicin and
daunorubicin, taxol, platinum and cyclophosphamide, Aronex Pharmaceuticals does
not believe that there are any medicines available that are active against
multi-drug resistant tumors. Aronex Pharmaceuticals is aware of some agents
currently in Phase II clinical trials that are designed to modify multi-drug
resistance, but for which no efficacy data are yet available. These agents would
potentially be used in combination with chemotherapeutic agents.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals's liposomal formulation of Annamycin is the subject
of an issued United States patent, licensed exclusively to Aronex
Pharmaceuticals by The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. In
addition, a patent has issued in the United States with respect to an improved
process for preparing Annamycin. This patent is exclusively licensed to Aronex
Pharmaceuticals under its agreements with M.D. Anderson and the Regents of The
University of Texas. The drug, Annamycin, is the subject of a patent that has
been non-exclusively sublicensed to Aronex Pharmaceuticals by M.D. Anderson,
which M.D. Anderson licensed from Ohio State University. See "Business of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals -- Patents and Proprietary Rights" on page   .

  Aroplatin(TM) for Lung Cancer (Phase II completed) and Renal Cell Carcinoma
(Phase II completed)

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals is developing a novel liposomal platinum analogue,
Aroplatin(TM), for the treatment of solid tumors. Aroplatin(TM) has been
designed to overcome the toxicity and resistance that currently limits the
usefulness of platinum, a chemotherapeutic agent widely used in the treatment of
solid tumors. Phase I clinical trials have been conducted under a physician's
IND at M.D. Anderson.

     Aroplatin(TM) has been evaluated in two Phase II clinical trials, under
institutional INDs at M.D. Anderson:

     - a trial for the treatment of mesothelioma, a type of lung cancer, funded
       by the Office of Orphan Drug Products at the FDA; and

     - a trial for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma funded by
       Aronex Pharmaceuticals.

     In November 1999, Aronex Pharmaceuticals assumed ownership of the
institutional INDs for Aroplatin(TM) and began conducting Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's own clinical development programs for this product.
Aroplatin(TM) has been designated an orphan drug for the treatment of malignant
mesothelioma by the FDA.

     In September 2000, Aronex Pharmaceuticals presented preliminary Phase II
data at the 9th World Conference on Lung Cancer. The presented data represented
34 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Among 23 patients who had both
pre- and post-treatment tissue biopsies, 56% showed no evidence of tumor on
biopsy after treatment. Among 18 patients at baseline who had both pre- and
post-treatment cytology samples, 83% revealed no evidence of tumors in cytologic
specimens. Investigators concluded that Aroplatin(TM) treatment produced a high
rate of pathologic response and appeared to be a promising therapeutic approach
in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals has obtained multiple patents drawn to aspects of
Aroplatin(TM). Claims of issued United States patents cover a method of treating
subjects with Aroplatin(TM) together with claims concerning liposome
manufacturing methods. These patents are exclusively licensed under Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's agreement with M.D. Anderson and the Regents of the University
of Texas. Aroplatin(TM) patent claims are allowed in Europe.

     A patent application filed in the United States by Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals
Co. Ltd. overlapped claims included in the United States patents licensed to
Aronex Pharmaceuticals and was the subject of an interference proceeding in the
United States Patent and Trademark Office. In December 2000, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals resolved this interference by signing a license agreement with
Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals that gives Aronex Pharmaceuticals exclusive rights in
the United States to a particular class of DACH platinum compounds that was the
basis for the interference. See "Business of Aronex Pharmaceuticals --
Collaborative Agreements" on page   .

INFECTIOUS DISEASES

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals's infectious diseases program centers on the
development of new agents for the treatment of infectious diseases, including
those that occur in patients with weakened immune systems. The clinical program
presently focuses on two products: the development of Nyotran(R) for
life-threatening systemic, or internal, fungal infections, and ATRAGEN(R) for
hepatitis.

 Nyotran(R) for Presumed Fungal Infections (Phase III completed), Cryptococcal
 Meningitis (Phase III completed), Candidemia (Phase II completed) and
 Aspergillus Salvage (Phase II)

     Systemic fungal infections are generally serious and may result in death.
Most systemic fungal infections are caused by Candida, or yeasts, and
Aspergillus, or molds, species. These life-threatening infections occur most
often in patients with impaired immune defense mechanisms as a result of an
underlying disease, such as HIV or diabetes, or the effects of treatments for
other medical conditions, such as chemotherapy in cancer patients or
anti-rejection therapy in patients receiving organ transplants. The population
of patients who become candidates for anti-fungal treatment is increasing
because of a number

of factors, including more aggressive use of chemotherapy in cancer patients,
increases in organ and bone marrow transplants, increased use of in-dwelling
catheters for prolonged periods and the spread of HIV.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals believes that the drugs that are currently used to
treat systemic fungal infections, including fluconazole, itraconazole,
amphotericin B and liposomal formulations of amphotericin B, have limitations
that present a need for new therapies. Data from recent in vitro, or test tube,
studies as well as clinical trial data indicate that a number of fungal strains
are becoming increasingly resistant to known therapies. Fluconazole and
itraconazole are relatively safe and effective in inhibiting fungal growth in
Candida, but are not effective in inhibiting fungal growth in Aspergillus and
are generally not effective in treating fungal infections in patients who are
seriously ill and whose immune systems are compromised and not functioning
properly. Amphotericin B is very active against both Candida and Aspergillus but
is highly toxic. Several companies have developed liposomal versions of
amphotericin B that are designed to reduce the potential toxicity of
amphotericin B.

     Nyotran(R) is a lipid-based, intravenous formulation of the drug nystatin,
an established, widely-used topical anti-fungal agent. Although nystatin has
proven to be a potent anti-fungal against a broad spectrum of fungi, including
Candida, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Blastomyces and Aspergillus, its poor
solubility and toxicity have previously precluded its systemic administration as
a therapy for these fungal infections. Aronex Pharmaceuticals's proprietary
formulation, Nyotran(R), reduces the toxicity of nystatin. In addition, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals believes that the lipid-based formulation of Nyotran(R)
addresses the solubility problem of nystatin. Aronex Pharmaceuticals believes
Nyotran(R) offers potential advantages over current systemic anti-fungal
therapies. Aronex Pharmaceuticals's in vitro studies indicate that it is active
against a range of fungal strains, including Candida, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus
and Fusarium species, some of which are resistant to currently available
anti-fungal therapies. Aronex Pharmaceuticals believes that its clinical trials
suggest that Nyotran(R) can be administered at doses that are effective in
treating Aspergillus, Candida and Cryptococcus infections.

     The strategy for the development of Nyotran(R) has involved several stages.
Aronex Pharmaceuticals has conducted three Phase I clinical studies which
demonstrated a favorable safety profile. Aronex Pharmaceuticals completed a
Phase II open label study in patients with Candidemia evaluating Nyotran(R) at
multiple doses. Results from this study indicate that a dose of one-third of the
maximum tolerated dose established in Phase I appears to be efficacious. Based
upon data from this study, Aronex Pharmaceuticals initiated Phase III
comparative multicenter trials in the United States, Australia and Europe of
Nyotran(R) against amphotericin B in patients with presumed fungal infections.
Most frequently, in a hospital environment, a patient with a fever of unknown
origin will be treated with an antibiotic. When this treatment proves
ineffective, the physician then presumes that the patient has a fungal
infection, and begins treatment with an anti-fungal agent. The diagnosis of a
confirmed fungal infection may occur several days after anti-fungal therapy has
begun. Aronex Pharmaceuticals completed the clinical trials for presumed fungal
infections in late 1998. Data from these trials comparing Nyotran(R) and
amphotericin B in treating presumed fungal infections were presented at the
September 1999 39th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and
Chemotherapy meeting.

     To expand the potential indications for Nyotran(R), Aronex Pharmaceuticals
commenced Phase III trials for patients with cryptococcal meningitis and Phase
II Aspergillus salvage. The Aspergillus salvage trials are designed to treat
patients with Aspergillus who have failed treatment with current products. In
late 1999, Aronex Pharmaceuticals completed the Phase III trials designed to
show the equivalency of Nyotran(R) versus amphotericin B in the treatment of
confirmed cryptococcal meningitis. In February 2000, Aronex Pharmaceuticals
announced its preliminary findings from this trial. The data demonstrated that
Nyotran(R) was not equivalent to amphotericin B with respect to the primary
efficacy endpoint but there was no difference with respect to survival, a
secondary endpoint. The data also indicated a favorable renal toxicity profile
when compared to amphotericin B. Having gathered data from four clinical trials,
Aronex Pharmaceuticals met with the FDA in April 2000 to discuss Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's strategy for submission of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's NDA in the
United States. Based on these discussions, Aronex Pharmaceuticals is now
conducting an historical comparative trial in refractory invasive Aspergillus.
Following submission of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's NDA in the United States,
Aronex Pharmaceuticals

will review the strategy for filings in Europe and other parts of the world that
will be accomplished by Abbott Laboratories.

     In November 1998, Aronex Pharmaceuticals entered into a license agreement
with Abbott Laboratories for Nyotran(R). The license agreement provides Abbott
with exclusive worldwide rights to market and sell Nyotran(R), subject to rights
previously granted to Grupo Ferrer Internacional, S.A. in Spain and Portugal and
certain co-promotion rights retained by Aronex Pharmaceuticals in the United
States and Canada. Abbott has paid Aronex Pharmaceuticals milestone and up-front
payments of $14.7 million under the license agreement and purchased common stock
for $3.0 million under a related stock purchase agreement. Abbott has provided
funding for the clinical development of Nyotran(R) and will make subsequent
milestone payments if specified sales targets are achieved. Abbott has agreed to
pay Aronex Pharmaceuticals royalties which increase in amount based upon the
level of product sales of Nyotran(R) in each year. See "Business of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals -- Collaborative Agreements -- Collaborative Agreement with
Abbott Laboratories" on page                .

     The active ingredient of Nyotran(R), nystatin, is available commercially.
Aronex Pharmaceuticals has utilized a contract manufacturer for Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's clinical requirements of Nyotran(R), who Aronex
Pharmaceuticals believes to be capable of satisfying the quantities required for
clinical trials and anticipated quantities for initial commercial sales.
However, Aronex Pharmaceuticals expects Abbott to manufacture the quantities of
Nyotran(R) necessary to conduct any remaining clinical trials and, following
regulatory approval, to manufacture Nyotran(R)for commercial sale.

     Current treatment for systemic fungal infection is largely limited to
amphotericin B, several liposomal formulations of amphotericin B and
fluconazole. Amphotericin B has been a common choice for the treatment of
systemic fungal infections. The clinical usefulness of amphotericin B is
limited, however, because serious toxicity can occur at doses that are only
marginally effective. Liposomal formulations of amphotericin B have been
developed by several companies, including Elan Corp., Gilead Sciences and ALZA
Corporation. Each of these companies' products have regulatory approval in the
United States and other countries. Each of these liposomal formulations shows a
reduction in toxicity as compared to amphotericin B. Pfizer Inc.'s fluconazole,
the world's largest selling anti-fungal product, is an oral formulation used for
a wide range of less serious Candida indications. The FDA recently approved
Cancidas(R) for resistant and refractory invasive Aspergillus. Cancidas(R) is
marketed by Merck & Co., Inc. Aronex Pharmaceuticals is aware of other
anti-fungal agents currently in clinical development.

     M.D. Anderson has granted Aronex Pharmaceuticals the worldwide exclusive
license under an issued patent to the use of a liposomal formulation of nystatin
in the treatment of systemic fungal infections. Another issued patent protects a
process of pharmaceutical utility in making Nyotran(R). A continuation of this
process patent is currently being prosecuted seeking additional claims in this
area. See "Business of Aronex Pharmaceuticals -- Patents and Proprietary Rights"
on page   .

  ATRAGEN(R) for Hepatitis (Preclinical)

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals has been evaluating ATRAGEN(R), Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's lipid-based, intravenous formulation of ATRA, for
hematological malignancies and solid tumors. See "Business of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals -- Cancer -- ATRAGEN(R)" on page   .

     In late 2000, some patients being treated with ATRAGEN(R) for APL were
noted to have become coincidentally infected with viral hepatitis (types B and
C) unrelated to ATRAGEN(R) . The clinicians were concerned that the addition of
cytotoxic chemotherapy to the anti-leukemia regimen would make the viral
hepatitis worse, and elected to continue treating APL with ATRAGEN(R) alone,
which was successful in inducing complete remission. The viral hepatitis also
improved while the patient was receiving ATRAGEN(R) therapy, with viral loads
dropping in a precipitous fashion. After consultation with experts in the field
of viral hepatitis and based on knowledge gathered from scientific literature of
the potential effects of high dose retinoids, Aronex Pharmaceuticals has
initiated a preclinical program to evaluate the efficacy of ATRAGEN(R) in an
animal model of this disease.

     A United States patent application is pending for this indication. See
"Business of Aronex Pharmaceuticals -- Patents and Proprietary Rights" on page
  .

COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals's development strategy involves entering into
selected development and licensing agreements with corporate partners to provide
working capital as well as assist in the efficient development and marketing of
certain of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products.

  Collaborative Agreement with Abbott Laboratories

     In November 1998, Aronex Pharmaceuticals entered into a stock purchase
agreement and a license agreement with Abbott for Nyotran(R). The license
agreement provides Abbott with exclusive worldwide rights to market and sell
Nyotran(R), subject to rights previously granted to Grupo Ferrer Internacional,
S.A. in Spain and Portugal and co-promotion rights retained by Aronex
Pharmaceuticals in the United States and Canada for an initial two-year period.
These co-promotion rights will renew annually thereafter for successive one-year
periods unless canceled by either party. To date, Abbott has purchased $3.0
million of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's common stock and paid Aronex Pharmaceuticals
up-front and milestone payments of $14.7 million under the license agreement.
Abbott's payments to Aronex Pharmaceuticals provided funding for the clinical
development of Nyotran(R), and subsequent milestones are due if specified sales
targets are achieved. However, there can be no assurance that these milestone
payments will be made. Once paid, all payments are non-refundable. Abbott will
also pay Aronex Pharmaceuticals royalties that increase in amount based upon the
level of product sales of Nyotran(R) in each year.

     The licenses granted under the Nyotran(R) agreement terminate on a
country-by-country basis on the expiration of the last patent relating to that
product in that country. The agreement is terminable by Abbott in the event
certain regulatory approvals are not obtained or other specified events occur,
such as adverse safety and efficacy issues, and are terminable by either party
on the occurrence of a breach that is not cured by the breaching party within a
certain time period after notice has been given to that breaching party.

  Relationship with Grupo Ferrer Internacional, S.A.

     In 1997, Aronex Pharmaceuticals entered into a supply and distribution
agreement with Grupo Ferrer Internacional, S.A. to commercialize and market
Nyotran(R), under which Grupo Ferrer received the exclusive right to distribute
and sell Nyotran(R) in Spain and Portugal.

  Relationship with The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals has two license agreements with M.D. Anderson which
grant Aronex Pharmaceuticals exclusive rights to manufacture, use, market and
sell products based upon certain technology developed at M.D. Anderson relating
to the development of human monocyte or murine macrophage-derived cytotoxins
which inhibit or destroy the proliferation of tumor cells, liposomal-
encapsulated polyene antibiotics, except amphotericin B, liposomal-encapsulated
anthracyclines, liposomal-encapsulated platinum derivatives and
liposomal-encapsulated retinoids. Human monocyte or murine macrophage-derived
cytotoxins refers to the source of the cytotoxins, which is either human or
mouse-based. Nyotran(R), ATRAGEN(R), Annamycin and Aroplatin(TM) are products
derived from Aronex Pharmaceuticals's relationship with M.D. Anderson.

     The license agreements with M.D. Anderson require Aronex Pharmaceuticals to
pay royalties for licensed technology based on specified percentages of
cumulative net sales and royalties from sublicensees. Aronex Pharmaceuticals is
also obligated to pay a milestone payment of $200,000 upon the approval of an
NDA for each licensed product. Because Aronex Pharmaceuticals has not sold any
products or processes to date, Aronex Pharmaceuticals has not paid any royalties
under the license agreements. M.D. Anderson is responsible for the preparation,
filing and prosecution of all patent applications, foreign and domestic,

relating to technology developed at M.D. Anderson, and Aronex Pharmaceuticals
reimburses M.D. Anderson for expenses incurred for these activities.

     The license agreements generally remain in force until the expiration of
the last patent subject to the agreements. Either party may terminate the
license agreements after 60 days notice to the other party in the event of a
material breach of the terms of that agreement. M.D. Anderson has the right to
terminate either license agreement with 90 days notice for failure to convert
the licensed subject matter to a commercial form; however, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals believes its ongoing and active development efforts directed at
commercial marketing of the licensed products currently satisfy this obligation.

     From Aronex Pharmaceuticals's inception in 1986 through 1999, it contracted
with M.D. Anderson in conjunction with the license agreements through which
Aronex Pharmaceuticals funded research and development expenses incurred by the
M.D. Anderson scientists that relate to the technology licensed to Aronex
Pharmaceuticals. Funding for these research and development contracts ended with
a final payment early in 2000.

  Relationship with Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.

     In December 2000, Aronex Pharmaceuticals entered into a license agreement
with Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals that gives Aronex Pharmaceuticals the exclusive
right in the United States to a particular class of DACH platinum compounds.
Aroplatin(TM), one of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products in clinical development,
is a liposomal formulation of a novel platinum compound from this class of
drugs. Under this agreement, Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals received a $500,000
up-front payment from Aronex Pharmaceuticals in 2001, and will receive
subsequent milestone payments based on regulatory filings, approval and sales of
Aroplatin(TM), and royalties on the sales of Aroplatin(TM) in the United States.
Except for the treatment of hepatoma, the license agreement gives Aronex
Pharmaceuticals the exclusive right to make, use, develop, import and sell
Aroplatin(TM) in the United States.

MANUFACTURING

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals does not have the facilities necessary to
manufacture its products in accordance with cGMP, but can develop formulations,
analytical methods, process controls and manufacturing technology for its
products. Aronex Pharmaceuticals generally uses contract manufacturers to
produce batches of its products for clinical testing, although Aronex
Pharmaceuticals expects Abbott to supply the quantities of Nyotran(R) necessary
to conduct Aronex Pharmaceuticals's remaining clinical trials of that product.
Aronex Pharmaceuticals and the manufacturers of its products, other than Abbott,
have not entered into any written agreements other than periodic purchase orders
for the supply of the products they manufacture on Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
behalf. Contract manufacturers are closely supervised to ensure adherence to
established production methods and compliance with Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
rigorous quality control and quality assurance standards. Aronex Pharmaceuticals
does not expect to establish any significant manufacturing capacity in the near
future. Aronex Pharmaceuticals does not operate, and does not currently plan to
operate, manufacturing facilities for the production of its products in
commercial quantities, and intends to contract with third parties for the
manufacture and supply of its products. There can be no assurance that Aronex
Pharmaceuticals will be able to obtain supplies of products from third-party
suppliers on terms or in quantities acceptable to Aronex Pharmaceuticals. Aronex
Pharmaceuticals depends on third parties for the manufacture of its products.
This may adversely affect Aronex Pharmaceuticals's product profit margins and
ability to develop and deliver products on a timely basis. Any third-party
suppliers of this kind or any manufacturing facility Aronex Pharmaceuticals
establishes will be required to meet cGMP requirements. FDA inspection and
approval of manufacturing facilities and quality procedures for a drug are a
prerequisite to approval of an NDA for that drug. Aronex Pharmaceuticals may
encounter significant delays in obtaining supplies from third-party
manufacturers or experience interruptions in its supplies. If Aronex
Pharmaceuticals is unable to obtain adequate supplies, its business would be
materially adversely affected.

     The raw materials required for the majority of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
products are currently available in quantities sufficient to conduct Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's research, development, preclinical safety and clinical
development activities. Certain of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products, such as
Annamycin and Aroplatin(TM), are new syntheses and, therefore, are not yet
available in commercial quantities. Aronex Pharmaceuticals cannot give any
assurance that the raw materials necessary for the manufacture of its products
will be available in sufficient quantities or at a reasonable cost.
Complications or delays in obtaining raw materials or in product manufacturing
could delay the submission of products for regulatory approval and the
initiation of new development programs, which could materially impair Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's competitive position and potential profitability.

SALES AND MARKETING

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals does not have any experience in sales, marketing or
distribution. To market any of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals must develop a sales and marketing force with supporting
distribution capability or enter into marketing and distribution arrangements
with a company that has an established capability. Significant additional
expenditures will be required for Aronex Pharmaceuticals to develop these
capabilities. Aronex Pharmaceuticals has entered into agreements with Abbott and
Grupo Ferrer with respect to the marketing and sale of Nyotran(R). In addition,
Aronex Pharmaceuticals may enter into marketing agreements with one or more
pharmaceutical companies to market other products that Aronex Pharmaceuticals
may develop. To the extent Aronex Pharmaceuticals relies upon licensing,
marketing or distribution arrangements with others, any revenues Aronex
Pharmaceuticals receives will depend upon the efforts of third parties. Aronex
Pharmaceuticals cannot assure that any third party will market its products
successfully or that any third-party collaboration will be on terms favorable to
Aronex Pharmaceuticals. If any marketing partner does not market a product
successfully, Aronex Pharmaceuticals's business would be materially adversely
affected. Aronex Pharmaceuticals cannot give assurance that it will be able to
establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or that Aronex
Pharmaceuticals or its collaborators will be successful in gaining market
acceptance for any products that Aronex Pharmaceuticals may develop. Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's failure to establish marketing capabilities or to enter into
marketing arrangements with third parties would have a material adverse effect
on Aronex Pharmaceuticals.

PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals's ability to commercialize any products will depend,
in part, upon its ability or the ability of its licensors to obtain patents,
enforce those patents, preserve trade secrets, and operate without infringing
upon the proprietary rights of third parties. The patent positions of
biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve
complex legal and factual questions. Some of the United States patents and
patent applications owned by or licensed to Aronex Pharmaceuticals are
method-of-use patents that cover the use of certain compounds to treat specified
conditions, and composition-of-matter patents are not available for some of
Aronex Pharmaceuticals's product candidates. Aronex Pharmaceuticals cannot
assure that:

     - the patent applications licensed to or owned by Aronex Pharmaceuticals
       will result in issued patents;

     - patent protection will be secured for any particular technology;

     - any patents that have been or may be issued to Aronex Pharmaceuticals or
       its licensors will be valid or enforceable;

     - any patents will provide meaningful protection to Aronex Pharmaceuticals;

     - others will not be able to design around the patents; or

     - Aronex Pharmaceuticals's patents will provide a competitive advantage or
       have commercial application.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals cannot give any assurance that patents owned by or
licensed to it will not be challenged by others. Aronex Pharmaceuticals could
incur substantial costs in proceedings before the

United States Patent and Trademark Office and other regulatory authorities,
including interference proceedings. These proceedings could result in adverse
decisions about the patentability of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's inventions and
products as well as about the enforceability, validity or scope of protection
afforded by the patents.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals cannot give any assurance that the manufacture, use
or sale of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's product candidates will not infringe patent
rights of others. Aronex Pharmaceuticals may be unable to avoid infringement of
those patents and may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement
action, or challenge the validity of the patents in court. Aronex
Pharmaceuticals cannot give any assurance that a license will be available to
it, if at all, upon terms and conditions acceptable to Aronex Pharmaceuticals or
that it will prevail in any patent litigation. Patent litigation is costly and
time consuming, and Aronex Pharmaceuticals cannot assure that it will have
sufficient resources to bring the litigation to a successful conclusion. If
Aronex Pharmaceuticals does not obtain a license under such patents, is found
liable for infringement, or is not able to have infringing patents declared
invalid or unenforceable, it may be liable for significant money damages, may
encounter significant delays in bringing products to market, or may be precluded
from participating in the manufacture, use or sale of products or methods of
treatment requiring these licenses. While no specific study has been conducted,
Aronex Pharmaceuticals does not believe that the commercialization of its
products pursuant to its license agreements will infringe upon the patent rights
of others. However, Aronex Pharmaceuticals cannot assure that it has identified
all or any United States and foreign patents that pose a risk of infringement.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals also relies upon trade secrets and other unpatented
proprietary information in its product development activities. To the extent
Aronex Pharmaceuticals relies on trade secrets and unpatented know-how to
maintain its competitive technological position, Aronex Pharmaceuticals cannot
assure that others may not independently develop the same or similar
technologies. Aronex Pharmaceuticals seeks to protect trade secrets and
proprietary knowledge, in part through confidentiality agreements with Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators.
Nevertheless, these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's confidential information and may not provide Aronex
Pharmaceuticals with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure
of such information. If Aronex Pharmaceuticals's employees, scientific
consultants or collaborators develop inventions or processes independently that
may be applicable to Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products, disputes may arise about
ownership of proprietary rights to those inventions and processes. These
inventions and processes will not necessarily become Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
property, but may remain the property of those persons or their employers.
Protracted and costly litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the
scope of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's proprietary rights. Failure to obtain or
maintain patent and trade secret protection, for any reason, would have a
material adverse effect on Aronex Pharmaceuticals.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals engages in collaborations, sponsored research
agreements, licensing and other arrangements with academic researchers and
institutions that have received and may receive funding from United States
government agencies. As a result of these arrangements, the United States
government or certain third parties have rights in certain inventions developed
during the course of the performance of these collaborations and agreements as
required by law or the agreements. These rights typically allow the government
to use the invention for free on an internal basis and for research and
development purposes.

     The patent laws of the United States have recently been modified.
Modifications include, but are not limited to, publication of patent
applications under certain circumstances, patent term extension, and modified
patent reexamination procedures. The effect of these legislative changes on
Aronex Pharmaceuticals's intellectual property estate is uncertain.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals's research and development activities, preclinical
studies and clinical trials, and ultimately the manufacturing, marketing and
labeling of products, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other
regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries. The United
States

Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the associated regulations and other
federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the
testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping,
approval, advertising and promotion of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products.
Preclinical study and clinical trial requirements and the regulatory approval
process take years and require the expenditure of substantial resources.
Additional government regulation may be established that could prevent or delay
regulatory approval of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products. Delays or rejections
in obtaining regulatory approvals would adversely affect Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's ability to commercialize any product it develops and Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's ability to receive product revenues or royalties. If
regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval may include
significant limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be
marketed.

     The FDA and other regulatory authorities require that the safety and
efficacy of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's therapeutic products must be supported
through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. If the results of these
clinical trials do not establish the safety and efficacy of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's products to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory
authorities, Aronex Pharmaceuticals will not receive the approvals necessary to
market Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products, which would have a material adverse
effect on Aronex Pharmaceuticals.

     Even if regulatory approvals for Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products are
obtained, Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products and the facilities manufacturing
Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products are subject to continual review and periodic
inspection. The FDA will require post-marketing reporting to monitor the safety
of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products. Each drug manufacturing establishment must
be inspected and approved by the FDA. All manufacturing establishments are
subject to biennial inspections by the FDA and must comply with the FDA's good
manufacturing practices. To supply drug products for use in the United States,
foreign manufacturing establishments must comply with the FDA's good
manufacturing practices and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA or by
regulatory authorities in those countries under reciprocal agreements with the
FDA. In complying with good manufacturing practices, manufacturers must expend
funds, time and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure
full technical compliance. Aronex Pharmaceuticals does not have any drug
manufacturing capability and must rely on outside firms for this capability. See
"Business of Aronex Pharmaceuticals -- Manufacturing" on page   . The FDA
stringently applies regulatory standards for manufacturing. Identification of
previously unknown problems with respect to a product, manufacturer or facility
may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or facility, including
warning letters, suspensions of regulatory approvals, operating restrictions,
delays in obtaining new product approvals, withdrawal of the product from the
market, product recalls, fines, injunctions and criminal prosecution.

     Before Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products can be marketed outside of the
United States, they are subject to regulatory approval similar to FDA
requirements in the United States, although the requirements governing the
conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary
widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any drug
product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the
regulatory authorities in that country. FDA approval does not assure approval by
other regulatory authorities. The current approval process varies from country
to country and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for
FDA approval. In some countries, the sale price of a drug product must also be
approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is
granted. Even if a foreign regulatory authority approves any of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's products, no assurance can be given that it will approve
satisfactory prices for the products.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals's research and development involves the controlled
use of hazardous materials, chemicals, viruses and various radioactive
compounds. Although Aronex Pharmaceuticals believes that Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's procedures for handling and disposing of those materials
comply with state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination
or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. If an accident of this type
occurs, Aronex Pharmaceuticals could be held liable for resulting damages, which
could be material to Aronex Pharmaceuticals's financial condition and business.
Aronex Pharmaceuticals is also subject to numerous environmental, health and
workplace safety laws and

regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to
blood-borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials. Additional
federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting Aronex Pharmaceuticals
may be adopted in the future. Any violation of these laws and regulations, and
the cost of compliance, could materially and adversely affect us.

     Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant "orphan drug" status to
therapeutic agents intended to treat a "rare disease or condition," defined as a
disease or condition that affects less than 200,000 persons in the United
States. Orphan drug status grants the sponsor tax credits for the amounts
expended on clinical trials, provided that certain conditions are met, as well
as potential marketing exclusivity for four to seven years following approval of
the pertinent NDA. Aronex Pharmaceuticals received orphan drug status for
ATRAGEN(R) in 1993 for the treatment of acute and chronic leukemia. Aronex
Pharmaceuticals received orphan drug status for Aroplatin(TM) in 1999 for the
treatment of malignant mesothelioma. Aronex Pharmaceuticals may request this
status for more of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products as part of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's overall regulatory strategy. There is no assurance, however,
that any of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's other products will receive orphan drug
status or that the benefits of protection currently afforded by orphan drug
status will remain in effect. In addition, any party may obtain orphan drug
status with respect to products for which patent protection has expired or is
otherwise unavailable. The first party granted marketing approval could prevent
other persons from commercializing that product during the period for which
exclusivity was granted to that party.

COMPETITION

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals believes that its products, because of their unique
pharmacologic profiles, will become useful new treatments for cancers and
infectious diseases, either as alternatives to or in combination with other
pharmaceuticals. Aronex Pharmaceuticals is engaged in pharmaceutical product
development characterized by rapid technological progress. Many established
biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, universities and other research
institutions with resources significantly greater than Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
may develop products that directly compete with Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
products. Those entities may succeed in developing products, including liposomes
and liposomal products, that are safer, more effective or less costly than
Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products. Even if Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products
should prove to be more effective than those developed by other companies, other
companies may be more successful than Aronex Pharmaceuticals because of greater
financial resources, greater experience in conducting preclinical and clinical
trials and obtaining regulatory approval, stronger sales and marketing efforts,
earlier receipt of approval for competing products and other factors. If Aronex
Pharmaceuticals commences significant commercial sales of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's products, Aronex Pharmaceuticals or Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
collaborators will compete in areas in which Aronex Pharmaceuticals has little
or no experience such as manufacturing and marketing. There can be no assurance
that Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products, if commercialized, will be accepted and
prescribed by healthcare professionals.

     Some of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's competitors are active in the development
of proprietary liposomes and in liposomal research and product development to
treat cancer and certain fungal infections. Those competitors include Elan Corp,
Gilead Sciences and ALZA Corporation. Each of these companies' products have
regulatory approval in the United States and other countries. Any marketing of
these and other products that treat disease indications targeted by Aronex
Pharmaceuticals could adversely affect the market acceptance of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's products as a result of the established market recognition and
physician familiarity with the competing product. The presence of directly
competitive products could also result in more intense price competition than
might otherwise exist, which could have a material adverse effect on Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's financial condition and results of operations. Aronex
Pharmaceuticals believes that competition will be intense for all of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's product candidates.

EMPLOYEES

     As of March 31, 2001, Aronex Pharmaceuticals had 26 full-time employees, 17
of whom were engaged in development, clinical and regulatory affairs and 9 of
whom were engaged in business management and administration. Aronex
Pharmaceuticals has not experienced any work stoppages and considers relations
with its employees to be good. Aronex Pharmaceuticals reduced its number of
full-time employees in January 2001 from 77 full-time employees in order to
reduce the amount of its expenditures in an effort to preserve its cash
reserves. Aronex Pharmaceuticals retained those individuals necessary to
maintain its current business plan.

                             ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere
herein.

OVERVIEW

     Since Aronex Pharmaceuticals's inception in 1986, it has primarily devoted
its resources to fund research, drug discovery, and development. Aronex
Pharmaceuticals has been unprofitable to date and expects to incur substantial
operating losses for the next several years as it expends its resources for
product research and development, preclinical and clinical testing and
regulatory compliance. Aronex Pharmaceuticals has sustained losses of $122.5
million through March 31, 2001. Aronex Pharmaceuticals's research and
development activities and operations have been financed primarily through
public and private offerings of securities and, to a lesser extent, from
revenues under research and development agreements and grants. Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's operating results have fluctuated significantly during each
quarter, and Aronex Pharmaceuticals anticipates that these fluctuations, largely
attributable to varying commitments and expenditures for clinical trials and
research and development, will continue for the next several years.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

  Three Months Ended March 31, 2000 and 2001

     In January 2001, Aronex Pharmaceuticals received a non-approval letter from
the FDA for its NDA amendment for ATRAGEN(R). Following this event, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals reduced expenditures in its development plans and activities.
Additionally, Aronex Pharmaceuticals reduced the number of full-time employees
in January 2001 from 77 to 29. In January 2001, Aronex Pharmaceuticals recorded
severance of approximately $600,000 relating to the employees who were
terminated and substantially reduced its operating activities.

     Revenues from research and development grants and contracts decreased 94%
to $92,000 in 2001 from $1.5 million in 2000. This decrease was mainly due to a
decrease in 2001 of $1.1 million in revenue recognized relating to Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's license agreement for Nyotran(R) with Abbott Laboratories
("Abbott") as explained below.

     During 2000, Aronex Pharmaceuticals adopted United States Securities and
Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements" (SAB 101), which requires up-front, non-refundable license
fees to be deferred and recognized over the performance period. Payments for
services under research and development grants and contracts that are
specifically tied to a separate earnings process are recognized as revenue as
the services are performed. In situations where Aronex Pharmaceuticals receives
payment in advance of the performance of services, such amounts are deferred and
recognized as revenue as the related services are performed. Non-refundable
fees, including payments for up-front licensing fees and milestones
(collectively, "Non-refundable Fees"), are recognized as revenue based on the
percentage of costs incurred to date, estimated costs to complete, and total
Non-refundable Fees received. Prior to January 1, 2000, Aronex Pharmaceuticals
had recognized revenue from Non-refundable Fees when it had no obligations to
return the fees under any circumstances, and there were no additional
contractual services to be provided or costs to be incurred by it in connection
with the Non-refundable Fees.

     The cumulative effect of adopting SAB 101 at January 1, 2000 resulted in a
one-time, non-cash charge of $4.5 million, with a corresponding increase to
deferred revenue that will be recognized in future periods. The $4.5 million
represents portions of 1998 and 1999 Non-refundable Fees from Abbott in
consideration for the exclusive worldwide rights to market and sell Nyotran(R).
For the three month periods ended March 31, 2000 and 2001, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals recognized $1.2 million and $92,000,

respectively, of research and development grants and contracts revenue that was
included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1, 2000. The balance
of the deferred revenue from this adjustment at March 31, 2001, $1.6 million,
will be recognized in the future as Aronex Pharmaceuticals incurs costs relating
to obtaining approval for Nyotran(R) from the FDA.

     Interest income decreased 52% to $106,000 in 2001 from $221,000 in 2000.
The decrease in interest income resulted from a decrease in the average amount
of funds available for investment during the first three months of 2001.

     Research and development expenses decreased 64% to $2.1 million in 2001
from $5.8 million in 2000. In mid-January 2001, Aronex Pharmaceuticals
substantially reduced the number of employees in research and development. At
the end of the first quarter of 2001, there were 17 employees in research and
development, compared to approximately 63 at the end of the first quarter of
2000. Due to this reduction, general expenses such as travel, postage and office
supplies decreased in addition to the following decreases:

     - a decrease of $2.1 million in clinical trial costs relating mainly to
       Nyotran(R) and ATRAGEN(R);

     - a decrease of $210,000 in clinical and regulatory consultants costs
       related to Nyotran(R) and ATRAGEN(R);

     - a decrease of $404,000 in salary and payroll costs;

     - a decrease of $554,000 in drug manufacturing and materials costs relating
       mainly to ATRAGEN(R) and Annamycin; and

     - a decrease of $154,000 in laboratory supplies, laboratory equipment
       maintenance and outside laboratory testing.

     General and administrative expenses increased 44% to $1.0 million in 2001
from $699,000 in 2000. The increase in general and administrative expenses
resulted primarily from severance relating to the termination of the vice
president of business development and an increase in legal expenses as a result
of obtaining assistance relating to the FDA approval process for ATRAGEN(R).

     Other income of $2,653,000 in the first quarter of 2000 represents a gain
on the sale of Targeted Genetics common stock, which had a carrying value of
zero.

  Years Ended December 31, 1999 and 2000

     The cumulative effect of adopting SAB 101 at January 1, 2000 resulted in a
one-time, non-cash charge of $4.5 million, with a corresponding increase to
deferred revenue that will be recognized in future periods. The $4.5 million
represents portions of 1998 and 1999 non-refundable fees from Abbott
Laboratories in consideration for the exclusive worldwide rights to market and
sell Nyotran(R). For the year ended December 31, 2000, Aronex Pharmaceuticals
recognized $2.8 million of research and development grants and contracts revenue
that was included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1, 2000. The
balance of the deferred revenue from this adjustment, $1.7 million, will be
recognized in the future as Aronex Pharmaceuticals incurs costs relating to
obtaining approval for Nyotran(R) from the FDA.

     Prior period financial statements have not been restated to apply SAB 101
retroactively; however, the pro forma amounts included in the consolidated
statements of operations show the net loss and per share net loss assuming
Aronex Pharmaceuticals had retroactively applied SAB 101 to all prior periods.

     Interest income decreased by 30% to $926,000 in 2000, from $1.3 million in
1999. This decrease resulted from a decrease in the average amount of funds
available for investment in 2000.

     Research and development expenses decreased by 23% to $16.6 million in
2000, from $21.5 million in 1999. The decrease in research and development
expenses resulted primarily from:

     - a decrease of $4.7 million in clinical trial costs for Nyotran(R) as the
       majority of the required clinical trial work was completed by the end of
       1999;

     - a decrease of $1.2 million in salary and payroll costs;

     - a decrease of $430,000 in pharmacology and toxicology studies relating to
       Nyotran(R); and

     - a decrease of $245,000 in drug materials and manufacturing costs related
       to Aroplatin(TM).

     The decreases listed above were offset by:

     - an increase of $1.0 million in clinical trial costs for ATRAGEN(R);

     - an increase of $661,000 in drug materials and manufacturing costs
       relating to Annamycin and ATRAGEN(R);

     - an increase of $194,000 in outside pharmaceutical development testing
       relating to Nyotran(R); and

     - a $500,000 license fee relating to Aroplatin(TM).

     Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 30% to $3.2 million
in 2000, from $4.7 million in 1999. The decrease in selling, general and
administrative expenses resulted from the following:

     - a decrease of $315,000 in salary and payroll costs;

     - a decrease of $240,000 in business consultant costs;

     - a decrease of $471,000 in marketing expenses relating to ATRAGEN(R); and

     - a decrease of $548,000 in uncollectible receivables.

     Interest expense and other increased 36% to $448,000 in 2000, from $330,000
in 1999. The increase in interest expense was due to the increase in the average
note payable balance in 2000.

     Net loss increased by 27% to $18.0 million in 2000, from $14.1 million in
1999. The increase in net loss resulted primarily from a decrease in revenues of
$8.2 million mainly as a result of the reduction in revenues resulting from
Aronex Pharmaceuticals's license agreement for Nyotran(R) and the cumulative
effect of the change in accounting principle of $4.5 million relating to the
recognition of research and development revenue. These items were partially
offset by a reduction in expenses of $6.2 million and the recording of a $2.7
million gain from the sale of investments.

  Years Ended December 31, 1998 and 1999

     Revenues from research and development grants and contracts increased 66%
to $11.1 million in 1999, from $6.7 million in 1998. This increase resulted from
milestone and development revenue under Aronex Pharmaceuticals's license
agreement for Nyotran(R).

     Interest income increased by 5% to $1,330,000 in 1999, from $1,265,000 in
1998. This increase resulted from an increase in the average amount of funds
available for investment in 1999.

     Research and development expenses decreased 6% to $21.5 million in 1999,
from $22.8 million in 1998. The decrease in research and development expenses
resulted primarily from decreases of $2.3 million and $729,000 in clinical
investigation costs and manufacturing relating to Nyotran(R). These decreases
were partially offset by increases of $640,000 in payroll costs and $600,000 in
regulatory consultants relating mostly to ATRAGEN(R) and Nyotran(R).

     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 39% to $4.7 million
in 1999, from $3.4 million in 1998. The increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses resulted primarily from an increase of $408,000 in
business consultant expense relating mainly to evaluating the market potential
for Aronex Pharmaceuticals's product candidates and an increase of $286,000 in
marketing expenses relating mainly to ATRAGEN(R).

     Interest expense and other increased 284% to $330,000 in 1999, from $86,000
in 1998. The increase in interest expense and other resulted primarily from an
increase in the average amount of capital lease obligations and indebtedness
used to fund the acquisition of laboratory equipment.

     Net loss decreased 23% to $14.1 million in 1999, from $18.2 million in
1998. The decrease in net loss resulted primarily from an increase of $4.3
million in revenues relating to research and development grants and contracts.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Since Aronex Pharmaceuticals's inception, its primary source of cash has
been from financing activities, which have consisted primarily of sales of
equity securities, and to a lesser extent, from revenues under research and
development agreements and grants. Aronex Pharmaceuticals has raised an
aggregate of approximately $98.8 million from the sale of equity securities from
inception through December 31, 2000. In July 1992, Aronex Pharmaceuticals raised
net proceeds of approximately $10.7 million in the initial public offering of
its common stock. In September 1993, Aronex Pharmaceuticals entered into a
collaborative agreement with Genzyme Corp. relating to the development and
commercialization of ATRAGEN(R), in which Aronex Pharmaceuticals received net
proceeds of approximately $4.5 million from the sale of common stock to Genzyme.
In November 1993, Aronex Pharmaceuticals raised net proceeds of approximately
$11.5 million and in May 1996, Aronex Pharmaceuticals raised net proceeds of
approximately $32.1 million in public offerings of common stock. From October
1995 through December 31, 1998, Aronex Pharmaceuticals received aggregate net
proceeds of approximately $6.5 million from the exercise of certain warrants
issued in Aronex Pharmaceuticals's 1995 merger with API Acquisition Company,
Inc. (formerly Oncologix, Inc.). In November 1998, Aronex Pharmaceuticals
entered into a license agreement with Abbott relating to Nyotran(R), in which
Abbott purchased 837,989 shares of common stock for $3.0 million. Through
February 29, 2000 Aronex Pharmaceuticals received an additional $14.7 million in
up-front and milestone payments from Abbott, all of which are non-refundable. In
February 1999 and April 2000, Aronex Pharmaceuticals raised net proceeds of
approximately $11.7 million and $7.3 million, respectively, in offerings of
Aronex Pharmaceuticals's common stock. In November 2000, Aronex Pharmaceuticals
entered into an agreement with Acqua Wellington North American Equity Fund Ltd.
for an equity financing agreement covering the sale of up to $24 million of
Aronex Pharmaceuticals's common stock over a 28-month period ending in March
2003. Aronex Pharmaceuticals has not raised any funds under this agreement and
has no current intentions or obligation to do so.

     In December 2000, Aronex Pharmaceuticals entered into a license agreement
with Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. that gives Aronex Pharmaceuticals the
exclusive right in the United States to a particular class of DACH platinum
compounds. Aroplatin(TM), one of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products in clinical
development, is a liposomal formulation of a novel platinum compound from this
class of drugs. Under this agreement, Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals received a
$500,000 up-front payment from Aronex Pharmaceuticals in 2001 (such amount was
expensed in the 2000 financial statements), and will receive subsequent
milestone payments based on regulatory filings, approval and sales of
Aroplatin(TM), and royalties on the sales of Aroplatin(TM) in the United States.
Except for the treatment of hepatoma, the license agreement gives Aronex
Pharmaceuticals the exclusive right to make, use, develop, import and sell
Aroplatin(TM) in the United States.

     The majority of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's development activities are
committed on a short-term, as-needed basis through contracts and purchase
orders. These arrangements can be changed based on Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
needs and development activities. Aronex Pharmaceuticals has contracted with
certain clinical research and other consulting organizations to assist in
conducting its clinical trials. The agreements provide that Aronex
Pharmaceuticals can terminate them at any time, should either its financial
situation, or the results of the studies, require it. Nonetheless, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals intends to continue to engage such services in the future.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals's primary use of cash to date has been in operating
activities to fund research and development, including preclinical studies and
clinical trials and general and administrative expenses. Cash of $18.3 million
and $13.1 million was used in operating activities during 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Aronex Pharmaceuticals had cash, cash-equivalents and long-term
investments of $5.3 million

as of March 31, 2001, consisting primarily of cash and money market accounts,
and United States government securities and investment grade commercial paper.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals has experienced negative cash flows from operations
since inception and has funded its activities to date primarily from equity
financings. Aronex Pharmaceuticals has expended, and will continue to require,
substantial funds to continue its development activities, including preclinical
studies and clinical trials of its products, and to commence sales and marketing
efforts if FDA and other regulatory approvals are obtained.

     The majority of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's clinical trials have reached the
stage where it has completed patient enrollment at their current phase. At the
current time, Aronex Pharmaceuticals is gathering clinical trial data for
analysis. Aronex Pharmaceuticals anticipates reporting the data at appropriate
scientific meetings. Before Aronex Pharmaceuticals initiates any new clinical
trials, it will analyze each product's likelihood for approval, the cost of the
proposed clinical trial, cash available at such time and the inherent risk
profile. Aronex Pharmaceuticals anticipates these steps will assist it in
maximizing shareholder value. See "Business of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals -- Products in Clinical Development" on page   .

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals will continue to require substantial additional
funds for its operations. At March 31, 2001, Aronex Pharmaceuticals had $5.3
million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Aronex Pharmaceuticals
believes that it can conserve its existing financial resources to satisfy its
capital and operating requirements into the fourth quarter of 2001. Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's accountants have issued a qualified opinion on Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December
31, 2000 indicating substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern. In the event the merger with Antigenics is not completed, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals will need to immediately raise additional funds, or it will have
to close operations and seek legal protection from its creditors.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals has experienced significant fluctuations in accounts
payable and accrued payroll, primarily as a result of its development
activities. Aronex Pharmaceuticals anticipates that the amounts expended for
these items in the future will continue to correspond with its development
activities. Aronex Pharmaceuticals expects the volume of development activities
to decrease in 2001 and there will be a decrease in outstanding payables and a
decrease in its liquidity position.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals has typically obtained debt financing when necessary
for equipment, furniture and leasehold improvement requirements. In 1998, Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's capital requirements increased with the move into new
facilities. As a result, Aronex Pharmaceuticals borrowed $1.4 million and
$547,000 in 1998 and 1999, respectively, to finance its requirements in this new
facility. Aronex Pharmaceuticals expects that it will continue to incur
additional debt to meet its capital requirements from time to time in the
future, based on its financial resources and needs. Aronex Pharmaceuticals does
not plan to make any significant capital expenditures in 2001.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals's capital requirements will depend on many factors.
These factors include:

     - expenses associated with completing the merger;

     - problems, delays, expenses and complications frequently encountered by
       development stage companies;

     - the progress of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's research, development and
       clinical trial programs;

     - the extent and terms of any future collaborative research, manufacturing,
       marketing or other funding arrangements;

     - the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals of Aronex
       Pharmaceuticals's products;

     - Aronex Pharmaceuticals's ability to obtain regulatory approvals;

     - the success of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's sales and marketing programs;

     - the costs of filing, prosecuting and defending and enforcing any patent
       claims and other intellectual property rights; and

     - changes in economic, regulatory or competitive conditions of Aronex
       Pharmaceuticals's planned business.

     Estimates about the adequacy of funding for Aronex Pharmaceuticals's
activities are based on certain assumptions, including the assumption that
testing and regulatory procedures relating to Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products
can be conducted at projected costs. There can be no assurance that changes in
Aronex Pharmaceuticals's development plans, acquisitions, or other events will
not result in accelerated or unexpected expenditures.

                 MATERIAL CONTRACTS WITH ARONEX PHARMACEUTICALS

     In May 2001, Antigenics and Aronex Pharmaceuticals entered into a services
agreement under which Antigenics shall provide assistance relating to regulatory
and other pre-marketing activities for Aronex Pharmaceuticals's products. Under
this agreement, Aronex Pharmaceuticals will pay $10,000 per month to Antigenics
for its services as well as any reasonable out of pocket expenses. This
agreement shall terminate upon the earlier of (1) 30 days after written notice
by either party to the other party of its termination of the agreement, (2)
termination of the merger agreement or (3) consummation of the merger.

        UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
statements reflect the proposed merger of Antigenics and Aronex Pharmaceuticals
in a transaction to be accounted for as a purchase business combination.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March
31, 2001 has been prepared as if the merger occurred on March 31, 2001. The
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet combines the historical
consolidated balance sheets of Antigenics and Aronex Pharmaceuticals at March
31, 2001 incorporated by reference or appearing elsewhere in this proxy
statement/prospectus, and gives effect to the unaudited pro forma adjustments
necessary to account for the merger as a purchase.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations
have been prepared as if the merger had occurred on January 1, 2000. These
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations combine
historical consolidated statements of operations of Antigenics for the year
ended December 31, 2000 (adjusted to reflect Antigenics' acquisition of Aquila
Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. as if it had also occurred on January 1, 2000 and
excluding the related acquired in-process research and development write-off)
and the historical consolidated statements of operations of Antigenics for the
three months ended March 31, 2001 with the historical statements of operations
of Aronex Pharmaceuticals for the year ended December 31, 2000 and the three
months ended March 31, 2001, respectively, incorporated by reference or
appearing elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, and gives effect to the
unaudited pro forma adjustments necessary to account for the merger as a
purchase.

     The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based on an estimated purchase
price and preliminary purchase price allocations made by Antigenics based on
available information and assumptions that Antigenics believes to be reasonable.
Therefore, the amounts in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
financial statements are subject to change. The unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated financial statements are provided for illustrative purposes only
and do not purport to represent what Antigenics' results of operations or
financial position would actually have been, had the merger in fact occurred on
such dates, nor do they purport to project the results of operations or
financial position of Antigenics for any future period or date.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the audited and unaudited financial statements and
accompanying notes of Antigenics and Aronex Pharmaceuticals which are
incorporated by reference or included elsewhere in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

                                 FINANCIAL DATA
                     (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)

NOTE A.

     Reflects the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals. Under purchase accounting, the assets and liabilities of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals are required to be adjusted to their fair values. The estimated
purchase price of $33,514 is the sum of (i) $28,571 representing the assumed
issuance of 1,676 shares of Antigenics common stock valued at $17.051 per share,
which represents the average closing price per share of Antigenics common stock
for the ten trading days ending the second trading day before May 18, 2001, to
be issued at an exchange ratio of 0.0645 shares of Antigenics common stock for
each of the 25,974 outstanding shares of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock as
of March 31, 2001, (ii) $2,232 representing the fair value of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals options and warrants to acquire Aronex Pharmaceuticals common
stock which will be vested upon the consummation of the merger and exchanged for
options and warrants to purchase 308 shares of Antigenics common stock and (iii)
an estimated $2,705 of Antigenics's costs of the merger, costs to sever the
employment of certain Aronex Pharmaceuticals employees, and costs associated
with the closing of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's facility. The fair value of the
Aronex Pharmaceuticals options and warrants has been calculated using an option
pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: life of the
option or warrant -- employees and directors options -- 4 years and non-employee
options and warrants -- remaining contractual life of 6 years; dividend
yield -- nil; risk-free interest rate -- 5.50%; price volatility -- 74.0%. The
final purchase price will be dependent upon the number of shares of Antigenics
common stock actually exchanged in the transaction, which is subject to a
minimum and maximum exchange ratio of 0.0550 and 0.0917 shares of Antigenics
common stock for each share of Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock (1,429 shares
and 2,382 shares of Antigenics common stock, respectively), and the average
closing price of Antigenics common stock for the ten trading days prior to the
second trading day before the consummation date of the merger.

     The estimated purchase price does not include any effect of the issuance of
the contingent value rights issued to Aronex Pharmaceuticals stockholders and
option and warrant holders. The issuance of additional consideration is
dependent upon Aronex Pharmaceuticals receiving FDA approval for ATRAGEN on or
before July 6, 2002. If the approval is received within the required time period
and certain merger transaction expenses are less than $4,500,000, the value of
the contingent value rights at such time will be recorded as additional purchase
price.

     The following are the pro forma adjustments made to reflect the preliminary
allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair value of the net assets
acquired based upon available information. These adjustments are subject to the
determination of the final purchase price as described above and the completion
of valuations as of the date of consummation of the merger. Valuations of
specifically identifiable intangible assets and acquired in-process research and
development are in progress. Consequently, the actual allocation of the purchase
price could differ from that presented below. The preliminary valuation of
acquired in-process research and development below represents the estimated fair
value of products under development at Aronex Pharmaceuticals calculated using
an income approach. This involves estimating the fair value of the acquired
in-process research and development using the present value of the estimated
after-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased in-process
research and development projects. The risk adjusted discount rates range from
45% to 55%, depending on the risks associated with each specific project. Cash
inflows from projects begin primarily in 2005 and 2006, the expected dates of
product approvals. Gross margins on products are estimated at levels consistent
with industry expectations. The preliminary fair values of the acquired
non-current assets and acquired in-process research and development have been
proportionately reduced by the amount that the estimated fair value of the net
assets acquired exceeds the estimated purchase price (negative goodwill).

- ---------------
(1) Reflects the historical Aronex Pharmaceuticals net assets as of March 31,
    2001 adjusted to eliminate deferred revenue of $1,570.

(2) Antigenics will record an immediate write-off of acquired in-process
    research and development costs at the consummation of the merger. The
    write-off is not reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
    statements of operations because it is nonrecurring in nature. This
    nonrecurring charge is reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed
    consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2001 as an increase to
    accumulated deficit.

(3) Reflects the estimated additional transaction-related expenses to be
    incurred and recognized by Aronex Pharmaceuticals between March 31, 2001 and
    the date of the merger. Such expenses have not been reflected in the
    unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations because
    they are nonrecurring in nature.

NOTE B.

     Reflects the elimination of the historical Aronex Pharmaceuticals equity
balances and the issuance of Antigenics's common stock, options and warrants as
consideration for the merger.

NOTE C.

     Reflects the elimination of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's historical deferred
revenue.

NOTE D.

     Reflects the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the merger on
a straight-line basis over 10 years for developed technology and patents and 3
years for assembled workforce.

NOTE E.

     Reflects the reduction in amortization of leasehold improvements that will
be abandoned with the closing of Aronex Pharmaceuticals's facility.

NOTE F.

     No pro forma income tax provision (benefit) is recognized because of a loss
before income taxes in each period and the need to recognize a valuation
allowance on deferred tax assets. Given the history of incurring losses,
Antigenics believes that it is more likely than not that any deferred tax assets
will not be realized.

NOTE G.

     The weighted average number of outstanding common shares outstanding
assumes that the shares issued in the merger (1,676 shares of Antigenics common
stock) are outstanding throughout each period.

Options and warrants to purchase Aronex Pharmaceuticals common stock will become
options and warrants to purchase Antigenics common stock. The convertible note
will become convertible into Antigenics common stock. The pro forma loss before
nonrecurring charges directly attributable to the acquisition and change in
accounting principle and weighted average number of common shares outstanding
used for computing diluted loss before nonrecurring charges directly
attributable to the acquisition and change in accounting principle per common
share are the same as that used for computing basic loss before nonrecurring
charges directly attributable to the acquisition and change in accounting
principle per common share for each period because inclusion of the options and
warrants in the calculation would be antidilutive (i.e., would reduce the loss
per common share).

NOTE H.

     The Adjusted Antigenics statement of operations for the year ended December
31, 2000 has been prepared to reflect Antigenics's acquisition of Aquila
Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. on November 16, 2000 as if it had also occurred on

DIVIDEND INFORMATION

STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

     On October 6, 1999, Aronex Pharmaceuticals adopted a rights agreement,
which was amended on April 24, 2001. The rights agreement, as amended, is
referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the rights plan. Under the
rights plan, Aronex Pharmaceuticals distributed a dividend consisting of one
preferred stock purchase right, or a right, for each share of its common stock
held of record as the close of business on October 18, 1999. Aronex
Pharmaceuticals also distributed and continues to distribute a right for each
share issued thereafter until the earlier of the distribution date (as defined
in the rights plan), redemption of the rights or expiration of the rights. The
rights plan is designed to deter coercive tactics and to prevent an acquirer
from gaining control of Aronex Pharmaceuticals without offering fair value. The
rights will expire upon the earlier of the time immediately prior to completion
of the merger with Antigenics or October 18, 2009, subject to earlier redemption
or exchange. Each right entitles its holder to purchase from Aronex
Pharmaceuticals one one-hundredth of a share of Series One Junior Participating
Preferred Stock at $32.00 per one one-hundredth of a share, subject to standard
anti-dilution adjustments. Generally, the rights become exercisable only if a
person (as defined) acquires beneficial ownership of 20% or more of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's outstanding common stock. Under the April 2001 amendment,
Antigenics and its merger subsidiary were excluded as acquiring persons under
the rights plan but only with respect to the merger contemplated by this proxy
statement/prospectus, and the execution of the merger agreement as well as
completion of the merger were excluded as events that could cause a distribution
date under the rights plan.

     A complete description of the rights, the rights plan between Aronex
Pharmaceuticals and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as rights agent,
and the Series One Junior Participating Preferred Stock is hereby incorporated
by reference from the information appearing under Item 5 of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals's current report on Form 8-K dated October 7, 1999, as amended
on April 24, 2001.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To Aronex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and subsidiaries (a Delaware corporation in the
development stage), as of December 31, 1999 and 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000
and for the period from inception (June 13, 1986) through December 31, 2000.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Aronex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as of December 31, 1999 and 2000, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2000 and for the period from inception (June 13, 1986)
through December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

     As explained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
January 1, 2000, the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue
recognition.

     The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the
financial statements, the Company has operated as a development stage enterprise
since its inception by devoting substantially all of its efforts to raising
capital and performing research and development. In January 2001, the Company
received a non-approval letter from the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for its New Drug Application (NDA) amendment for
ATRAGEN(R). In order to complete the research and development and other
activities necessary to commercialize its products, additional financing will be
required. The Company has not secured any commitments for any such additional
financing. These events raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern. Management's plans with regard to these matters are
also described in Note 1. The accompanying financial statements do not include
any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset
carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might
result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("the Company", "Aronex Pharmaceuticals",
"we", "us" or "our") was incorporated in Delaware on June 13, 1986 and merged
with Triplex Pharmaceutical Corporation ("Triplex") and API Acquisition Company,
Inc. ("API"), formerly Oncologix, Inc. effective September 11, 1995. In 1998, we
formed a subsidiary, Aronex Europe Limited.

     Aronex Pharmaceuticals is a development-stage company that has devoted
substantially all of its efforts to research and product development and has not
yet generated any significant revenues, nor is there any assurance of future
revenues. In addition, we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable
future, and there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete the
transition from a development-stage company to successful operations. The
development activities we engage in involve a high degree of risk and
uncertainty. Our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market our
proprietary products is dependent upon many factors. These factors include, but
are not limited to, the need for additional financing, attracting and retaining
key personnel and consultants, and successfully developing manufacturing, sales
and marketing operations. Our ability to develop these operations may be
immensely impacted by uncertainties related to patents and proprietary
technologies, technological change and obsolescence, product development,
competition, government regulations and approvals, health care reform,
third-party reimbursement and product liability exposure. Further, during the
period required to develop these products, we will require additional funds
which may not be available to us.

     We have operated as a development stage enterprise since our inception by
devoting substantially all of our efforts to raising capital and performing
research and development. In order to complete the development and other
activities necessary to commercialize our products, additional financing will be
required. We have not secured any commitments for any such additional financing.

     The majority of our clinical trials have reached the stage where we have
completed patient enrollment in their current phase. At the current time, we are
gathering clinical trial data for analysis. We anticipate reporting the data at
appropriate scientific meetings. Before we initiate any new clinical trials, we
will analyze each product's likelihood for approval, the cost of the proposed
clinical trial, cash available at such time and the inherent risk profile. We
anticipate these steps will assist us in maximizing shareholder value.

     In January 2001, we received a non-approval letter from the United States
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for our New Drug Application (NDA) amendment
for ATRAGEN(R) for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Following this event, we
reduced expenditures in our research and development plans and activities.
Additionally, we reduced the number of full-time employees in January 2001 from
77 to 29.

     We will continue to require substantial additional funds for our
operations. At December 31, 2000, we had $9.1 million in cash, cash equivalents
and investments. We believe that we can conserve our existing financial
resources to satisfy our capital and operating requirements into the fourth
quarter of 2001.

     The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern. We will, in all likelihood, need to further reduce
our expenditures if we do not obtain additional financial resources by mid 2001.
We retained Robertson Stephens, a San Francisco-based investment bank, to assist
us in pursuing strategic alliances with companies in our industry. Also, we are
actively pursuing other sources of financing. Sources of financing may not be
available, or if available, will be dilutive or may have other adverse effect to
the value of our shares. We may have to close operations and/or seek legal
protection from our creditors. Accordingly, there can be no assurance of our
future success. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying
amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. See "Business -- General"

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  Principles of Consolidation

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aronex
Pharmaceuticals, Triplex, API and Aronex Europe Limited. All material
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short- and Long-Term Investments

     Debt and equity securities that we have the intent and ability to hold to
maturity are classified as "held to maturity" and reported at amortized cost.
Debt and equity securities that are held for current resale are classified as
"trading securities" and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
included in earnings. Debt and equity securities not classified as either
"securities-held-to-maturity" or "trading securities" are classified as
"securities-available-for-sale" and reported at fair value, with unrealized
gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of
stockholders' equity.

     Cash and cash equivalents include money market accounts and investments
with an original maturity of less than three months. Long-term investments at
December 31, 2000 are available for sale securities which are United States
mortgage backed securities with maturity dates over the next 22 years that have
an amortized cost of $821,000 which approximates fair market value and cost. We
currently have no trading securities.

  Furniture, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements

     Furniture and equipment are carried at cost and depreciation is calculated
on the straight-line method using a five-year estimated useful life. Leasehold
improvements are amortized on the straight-line method over the shorter of the
life of the lease or a five-year estimated useful life. Maintenance and repairs
that do not improve or extend the life of assets are expensed as incurred.
Expenditures which improve or extend the life of assets are capitalized.

     A summary of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements is as follows
(in thousands):
