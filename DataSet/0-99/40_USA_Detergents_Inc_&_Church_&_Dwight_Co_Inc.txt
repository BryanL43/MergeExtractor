 * Estimated for purposes of calculating the amount of the filing fee only. This
   calculation assumes (1) the purchase of all of the issued and outstanding
   shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares"), of USA
   Detergents, Inc. (less the 2,142,857 Shares already owned by Church & Dwight
   Co., Inc.) at a price per Share of $7.00 in cash and (2) the cash-out of all
   options to purchase Shares with exercise prices less than $7.00 per Share at
   a cash-out price equal to the difference between $7.00 and the applicable
   exercise price. As of March 30, 2001, based on information provided by USA
   Detergents, Inc., there were approximately (a) 14,192,776 Shares issued and
   outstanding and (b) 1,956,246 options to purchase Shares issued and
   outstanding with exercise prices less than $7.00 per Share (representing an
   aggregate cash-out price of approximately $7,452,546). The amount of the
   filing fee, calculated in accordance with Rule 0-11 of the Securities
   Exchange Act of 1934, equals 1/50th of one percent of the total value of (x)
   the Shares proposed to be acquired and (y) the options to be cashed-out.

    0-11(a)(2) and identify the filing with which the offsetting fee was

     US Acquisition Corp., which is referred to in this Offer to Purchase as
"Purchaser," is offering to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common
stock of USA Detergents, Inc., which is referred to in this Offer to Purchase as
the "Company," for $7.00 net per share in cash. The following are some of the
questions you may have, as a stockholder of USA Detergents, followed by answers
to those questions. We urge you to read carefully the remainder of this Offer to
Purchase and the accompanying Letter of Transmittal because the information in
this Summary Term Sheet is not complete. Additional important information is
contained in the remainder of this Offer to Purchase and the Letter of
Transmittal.

- - WHO IS OFFERING TO BUY MY SECURITIES?

     Our name is US Acquisition Corp. and when this Offer to Purchase mentions
"Purchaser" it refers to us. We are a Delaware corporation formed for the
purpose of making a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of USA
Detergents, Inc. We are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Church & Dwight Co., Inc.,
a Delaware corporation. See The Tender Offer -- Certain Information Concerning
Parent and Purchaser.

- - WHAT SHARES ARE BEING SOUGHT IN THE OFFER?

     We are seeking to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock of
USA Detergents. See Introduction and The Tender Offer -- Terms of the Offer.

- - HOW MUCH ARE YOU OFFERING TO PAY, WHAT IS THE FORM OF PAYMENT AND WILL I HAVE
  TO PAY ANY FEES OR COMMISSIONS?

     We are offering to pay $7.00 per share, net to you, in cash, less any
required withholding of taxes and without the payment of interest. If you are
the record owner of your shares and you tender your shares to us in the offer,
you will not have to pay brokerage fees or similar expenses. If you own your
shares through a broker or other nominee, and your broker tenders your shares on
your behalf, your broker or nominee may charge you a fee for doing so. You
should consult your broker or nominee to determine whether any charges will
apply. We will not be obligated to pay or reimburse you for such broker or
nominee charges. See Introduction. In addition, if you do not complete and sign
the Substitute Form W-9 included in the Letter of Transmittal, you may be
subject to required backup federal income tax withholding. See Instruction 9 to
the Letter of Transmittal.

- - DO YOU HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MAKE PAYMENT?

     We will be provided with approximately $110 million by our parent company,
Church & Dwight Co. Those funds will be used to purchase all shares validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn in the offer and to provide funding for the
merger, which is expected to follow the successful completion of the offer in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger.
The offer is not conditioned upon any financing arrangements. See The Tender
Offer -- Source and Amount of Funds. Church & Dwight Co. is the world's leading
producer of sodium bicarbonate, popularly known as baking soda, a versatile
chemical which performs a broad range of functions such as cleaning,
deodorizing, leavening and buffering. As of and for its fiscal year-ended
December 31, 2000, Church & Dwight Co. had total assets of $455,632,000 and net
income of $33,559,000. See The Tender Offer -- Certain Information Concerning
Parent and Purchaser.

- - HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO TENDER IN THE OFFER?

     You will have at least until 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Friday,
May 18, 2001, to decide whether to tender your shares in the offer. If you
cannot deliver everything that is required in order to make a valid tender by
that time, you may be able to use a guaranteed delivery procedure, which is
described later in this Offer to Purchase. See The Tender Offer -- Terms of the
Offer and -- Procedures for Accepting the Offer and Tendering Shares.

- - CAN THE OFFER BE EXTENDED AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES?

     Yes. Although the offer is initially scheduled to expire at 12:00 midnight,
New York City time, on Friday, May 18, 2001, we may extend the offer from time
to time until June 30, 2001 if specified conditions to the offer have not been
satisfied or if we are required to do so by any rule or regulation of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Furthermore, in the event that all the
conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or waived, but the number of shares
of USA Detergents common stock that have been tendered in the offer is less than
ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of common stock, we may elect to
extend the offer for up to two additional periods of five business days each. We
may also elect to extend the offer for a subsequent offering period of up to
twenty days under Rule 14d-11 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in which
case we will be required to accept for payment and promptly pay for shares of
common stock that have been tendered in the offer prior to our election to
extend. See The Tender Offer -- Terms of the Offer.

- - HOW WILL I BE NOTIFIED IF THE OFFER IS EXTENDED?

     We will make a public announcement if we extend the offer, and we will
inform Mellon Investor Services LLC, the depositary for the offer, of that fact
by not later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after
the day on which the offer was scheduled to expire. See The Tender
Offer -- Terms of the Offer.

- - WHAT ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER?

     We are not obligated to purchase any tendered shares unless the number of
tendered shares, when added to the shares then owned by Church & Dwight Co. and
its affiliates, but excluding any shares held by USA Detergents or its
affiliates, equals at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the shares of USA
Detergents outstanding on a fully-diluted basis. The offer is also subject to a
number of other conditions, including the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976 or similar statutes or regulations and any approvals which may be
required under New Jersey's Industrial Site Recovery Act and similar state
statutes or regulations. See The Tender Offer -- Certain Conditions of the
Offer.

- - HOW DO I TENDER MY SHARES?

     To tender shares, you must deliver the certificates representing your
shares, together with a completed Letter of Transmittal, to Mellon Investor
Services LLC, the depositary for the offer, not later than the time the offer
expires. If your shares are held in street name, the shares can be tendered by
your nominee through the depositary. If you cannot deliver something that is
required by the depositary by the expiration of the offer, you may obtain a
little extra time to do so by having a broker, a bank or other fiduciary, which
is a member of the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program or other
eligible institution, guarantee that the missing items will be received by the
depositary within three (3) New York Stock Exchange trading days. However, the
depositary must receive the missing items within that three (3) trading day
period. See The Tender Offer -- Procedures for Accepting the Offer and Tendering
Shares.

- - WHEN WILL I GET PAID IF I TENDER MY SHARES?

     If all of the conditions of the offer are satisfied or waived and your
shares of USA Detergents are accepted for payment, we will pay you promptly
after the expiration of the offer. See The Tender Offer -- Acceptance for
Payment and Payment for Shares.

- - UNTIL WHAT TIME CAN I WITHDRAW PREVIOUSLY TENDERED SHARES?

     You can withdraw previously tendered shares at any time until the offer has
expired and, if we have not agreed to accept your shares for payment by June 10,
2001, you can withdraw them at any time after such time until we accept the
shares for payment. If you tendered by giving instructions to a broker or bank,
you must instruct the broker or bank to arrange for the withdrawal of your
shares. See The Tender Offer -- Withdrawal Rights.

- - HOW DO I WITHDRAW PREVIOUSLY TENDERED SHARES?

     To withdraw shares, you must deliver to the depositary a written notice of
withdrawal, or a facsimile of one, with the required information while you still
have the right to withdraw the shares. See The Tender Offer -- Terms of the
Offer and  -- Withdrawal Rights.

- - WHAT DOES THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF USA DETERGENTS THINK OF THE OFFER?

     We are making the offer pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
March 30, 2001 and amended as of April 10, 2001, among USA Detergents, Church &
Dwight Co. and us. The board of directors of USA Detergents has unanimously (1)
determined that the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the offer and the merger are
fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders of USA Detergents (other
than Church & Dwight Co. or US Acquisition Corp.); (2) approved the Agreement
and Plan of Merger, the offer, the merger and the transactions contemplated
thereby; and (3) recommended that you accept the offer and, if applicable,
approve and adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger. See Special
Factors -- Background of the Offer.

- - WILL THE TENDER OFFER BE FOLLOWED BY A MERGER IF NOT ALL OF THE PUBLICLY
  TRADED SHARES OF USA DETERGENTS ARE TENDERED IN THE OFFER?

     If we purchase in the offer at least that number of shares which, when
added to the shares then owned by Church & Dwight Co. and its affiliates, but
excluding any shares held by USA Detergents or its subsidiaries, equals at least
fifty-one percent (51%) of the shares of USA Detergents outstanding on a
fully-diluted basis, and all other applicable conditions are met, we will be
merged with USA Detergents. If that merger takes place, Church & Dwight Co. and
its affiliates will own all of the shares of USA Detergents and all remaining
stockholders of USA Detergents will receive the same price paid in the offer:
$7.00 net per share in cash (or, if higher, any other price per share paid in
the offer), without interest. See Introduction and Special Factors -- Purpose of
and Reasons for the Offer and -- Plans for the Company.

- - WILL I HAVE APPRAISAL RIGHTS?

     No appraisal rights are available in connection with the offer. After the
offer, you may be entitled to demand appraisal of your shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, if a vote of the
stockholders of USA Detergents is required. If you are entitled to demand, and
you properly demand, appraisal of your shares pursuant to Section 262 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law, you will not receive cash in the merger, but
rather you will be entitled to payment of the fair value of the shares in
accordance with Section 262; fair value under Section 262 may be less than, more
than or equal to $7.00 net per share in cash. See The Tender Offer -- Appraisal
Rights.

- - IF I DECIDE NOT TO TENDER, HOW WILL THE OFFER AFFECT MY SHARES?

     If we purchase at least ninety percent (90%) of the shares of USA
Detergents outstanding in the offer, we will own a sufficient number of shares
to merge with USA Detergents without a vote of the stockholders of USA
Detergents as provided in the Agreement and Plan of Merger and as permitted
under state law. If the merger takes place, stockholders who did not tender in
the offer will receive the same amount of cash per share in the merger that they
would have received had they tendered their shares in the offer. Therefore, if
the merger takes place, the only difference to you between tendering your shares
and not tendering your shares is that you will be paid earlier if you tender
your shares in the offer. However, until the merger is completed or if the
merger does not take place for some reason, the number of stockholders and
shares of USA Detergents may be so small that there will no longer be an active
public trading market (or, possibly, any trading market) for the shares. Also,
USA Detergents may cease being required to comply with the Securities and
Exchange Commission's rules relating to publicly held companies in the way that
it currently must comply with such rules. See Special Factors -- Purpose of and
Reasons for the Offer, -- Certain Effects of the Offer and -- Plans for the
Company.

- - WHAT HAPPENS IF I TENDER MY SHARES AND YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TENDERED SHARES?

     If any shares of USA Detergents that you tender are not accepted for any
reason, certificates representing such shares will be returned to you or to the
person you specify in your tendering documents. See The Tender
Offer -- Acceptance for Payment and Payment for Shares.

- - WHAT WAS THE MARKET VALUE OF MY SHARES AS OF A RECENT DATE?

     On February 16, 2001, the last trading day before Church & Dwight Co.
announced that it was engaged in discussions with USA Detergents, the last sale
price of the shares reported on The Nasdaq National Market System was $4.25 per
share. On March 30, 2001, the last trading day before Church & Dwight Co. and
USA Detergents announced that they had signed the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
the last sale price of the shares was $5.8125 per share. On April 11, 2001, the
last trading day before we commenced the offer, the last sale price of the
shares was $6.87 per share. We advise you to obtain a recent quotation for
shares of USA Detergents before deciding whether to tender your shares. See The
Tender Offer -- Price Range of Shares; Dividends.

& Co. is acting as the information agent for our tender offer. See the cover

To All Holders of Shares
of Common Stock of USA Detergents, Inc.:

                                  INTRODUCTION

     US Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Purchaser") and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Church & Dwight Co., Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), hereby offers to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares"), of USA Detergents, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), at $7.00 per Share net to the seller in
cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Offer to Purchase (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the
"Offer to Purchase") and Letter of Transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal,"
which, together with the Offer to Purchase, as each may be amended or
supplemented from time to time, collectively constitute the "Offer").

     The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of March 30, 2001 and amended as of April 10, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"),
among the Company, Parent and Purchaser pursuant to which, after completion of
the Offer and satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Purchaser will be
merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company and the Company will be the
surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). On the effective date of
the Merger (the "Effective Time"), (i) each outstanding Share (other than Shares
owned by Parent or Purchaser or any subsidiary or affiliate of Parent or
Purchaser, Shares owned by any of the Company's subsidiaries or held in the
treasury of the Company or Shares held by stockholders who properly exercise
appraisal rights) will by virtue of the Merger, and without any action by the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $7.00 net
per Share in cash (or any higher price per Share paid pursuant to the Offer),
without interest (the "Merger Consideration") and (ii) each share of common
stock of Purchaser then issued and outstanding will be converted into and become
one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. The Merger Agreement is
more fully described in section captioned The Tender Offer -- The Merger
Agreement. Certain United States federal income tax consequences of the sale of
Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, as the case may be, are discussed
in the section captioned The Tender Offer -- Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations.

     THE OFFER IS CONDITIONED UPON, AMONG OTHER MATTERS, (i) THERE BEING VALIDLY
TENDERED AND NOT WITHDRAWN PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE OFFER THAT NUMBER OF
SHARES WHICH, TOGETHER WITH ANY SHARES THEN BENEFICIALLY OWNED BY PARENT OR
PURCHASER, REPRESENTS AT LEAST FIFTY-ONE PERCENT (51%) OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF
OUTSTANDING SHARES ON A FULLY-DILUTED BASIS (INCLUDING ALL SHARES ISSUABLE UPON

     If Purchaser owns at least ninety percent (90%) or more of the outstanding
Shares following the completion of the Offer, then Purchaser intends to effect
the Merger as a "short-form" merger (a "Short-Form Merger") under the applicable
provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), without a vote
of the stockholders of the Company. If a vote of the stockholders of the Company
is necessary to effect the Merger, Parent has agreed in the Merger Agreement to
cause all Shares owned by Parent or Purchaser to be voted in favor of the
approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement. Approval and adoption of the
Merger Agreement by the stockholders of the Company requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the outstanding Shares.

     The Company has informed Purchaser that, as of March 30, 2001, there were
14,192,776 Shares issued and outstanding and 2,640,088 Shares subject to
outstanding stock options and warrants. Of the 2,640,088

shares subject to outstanding stock options and warrants, 1,956,246 Shares are
issuable pursuant to in-the-money Company stock options and warrants that vest
prior to the Effective Time. As of the date of this Offer to Purchase, Parent
beneficially owns 2,142,857 Shares, constituting approximately fifteen percent
(15%) of the outstanding Shares.

     Based on the foregoing, the Minimum Tender Condition would be satisfied if
at least 6,124,510 Shares are validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the
Expiration Date (as defined below in the section captioned The Tender
Offer -- Terms of the Offer). The number of Shares required to be validly
tendered and not withdrawn in order to satisfy the Minimum Tender Condition will
increase to the extent additional Shares are deemed to be outstanding on a
fully-diluted basis under the Merger Agreement.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY (THE "COMPANY BOARD") HAS UNANIMOUSLY
(1) DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE OFFER AND THE MERGER ARE FAIR TO
AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY (OTHER THAN PARENT
OR PURCHASER); (2) APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE OFFER, THE MERGER AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY; AND (3) RECOMMENDED THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS OF
THE COMPANY ACCEPT THE OFFER, TENDER THEIR SHARES AND, IF APPLICABLE, APPROVE
AND ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER.

     On March 30, 2001, PricewaterhouseCoopers Securities, the Company's
financial advisor ("PwCS"), delivered to the Company Board a written opinion to
the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the matters
described in the opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received in the Offer
and the Merger by the Company's stockholders (other than Parent and Purchaser)
is fair to such stockholders from a financial point of view. A copy of PwCS's
written opinion, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached hereto
as Appendix A. Stockholders are urged to carefully read the full text of such
opinion in its entirety.

     Tendering stockholders who are record owners of their Shares and tender
directly to the Depositary (as defined below) will not be obligated to pay
brokerage fees or commissions or, except as otherwise provided in Instruction 6

                                SPECIAL FACTORS

1. BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER.

     In the Spring of 1999, Uri Evan, the Company's chief executive officer,
began discussing with the Company Board ways to improve the Company's operating
efficiencies. Mr. Evan was particularly concerned that the Company was not
maximizing its manufacturing facilities and that it had excess capacity within
such facilities. He believed that this, among other matters, was negatively
affecting the value of the Company's stock and that the Company Board should
continue to review and, if appropriate, pursue strategic alternatives to improve
the Company's stock performance. The Company Board discussed various options
including leasing space within its manufacturing facilities, selling such
facilities, selling the Company, merging with a strategic partner or forming a
joint venture in order to maximize the value of its stock.

     Fuad Sawaya, then a Managing Director in the Investment Banking division of
PaineWebber Incorporated, was asked by Mr. Evan to represent the Company in
discussions involving a potential business combination or strategic investment
with any of several other companies, including Parent. Mr. Evan believed that
Parent would be a suitable partner due to, among other matters, its market
presence and complementary product line.

     Discussions with Parent commenced late in the Spring of 1999 and continued
through the early fall of that same year. Mr. Sawaya also approached several
other companies regarding the possibility of a transaction with the Company
during this time. The discussions with Parent involved a potential acquisition
of the Company by Parent. The negotiations ended in October 1999 as Parent was
unwilling to undertake certain risks involving the Company. None of the other
parties contacted showed an interest in pursuing a transaction with the Company.

     In early 2000, Mr. Evan met with representatives of Parent to discuss the
possibility of a joint venture between the parties to combine certain aspects of
their respective laundry detergent businesses. In particular, the parties
discussed forming a joint venture whereby each company would produce their
liquid and light powder laundry detergents at the Company's manufacturing
facilities while leveraging their existing distribution channels.

     On April 4, 2000, the Company Board met to discuss the status of Mr. Evan's
negotiations with Parent and authorized him to continue negotiations. In
addition, the Company Board adopted a resolution to retain Corporate Capital
Consultants, Inc. to assist the Company by providing certain services in
connection with any proposed transaction including rendering a fairness opinion.
Further, the Company Board authorized a special committee consisting of
non-employee directors including Christopher D. Illick and Richard A. Mandell
(the "Special Committee") to consider and authorize any proposed transaction
with Parent. The Special Committee was authorized to engage independent counsel
to assist in its review of any proposed transaction. In consideration of the
significant time and effort required with respect to their services as members
of the Special Committee, the Company Board agreed to pay each member of the
Special Committee $30,000 and granted each member fully-exercisable options to
purchase up to 30,000 Shares at the exercise price of $3.16, representing the
last sale price on The Nasdaq National Market System on that date.

     Throughout April and May 2000, and until the execution of the agreements on
June 14, 2000, the parties and their respective counsel and financial advisors
negotiated the terms of the joint venture. The parties also negotiated a stock
purchase agreement whereby Parent would (i) purchase an aggregate of
approximately $10 million of shares of the Company's common stock from the
Company and one of its then directors, who was also a significant stockholder,
at a price of $7.00 per share and (ii) agree to the terms of a limited
standstill agreement. In addition, management from both companies met throughout
this period to review and analyze, among other matters, their respective
technologies, operating systems and other due diligence matters, as well as the
integration and synergies of combining each company's laundry detergent
business.

     At various times from its formation until June 14, 2000, the Special
Committee met with counsel to the Special Committee, Willkie, Farr & Gallagher,
to review and discuss the proposed transaction. Meetings were also held with Mr.
Evan and other executive officers of the Company and Sheldon G. Nussbaum, Esq.,
of Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P., counsel to the Company ("Fulbright"), to discuss
certain matters related to the proposed joint venture and stock sale, including
the history of the Company's efforts to pursue various strategic alternatives
and the negotiations with Parent, the price to be paid for the Company's common
stock, the profit sharing and cost structure of the proposed joint venture and
various other terms of the proposed joint venture.

     The Special Committee continued to review and comment on the revised terms
of the proposed transaction, including the terms of a buy-out formula and of a
standstill agreement and related matters. A revised financial analysis was
prepared regarding the fairness of the proposed transaction to the Company's
stockholders from a financial point of view.

     At a meeting of the Special Committee held on June 14, 2000, Corporate
Capital Consultants, Inc. delivered its opinion that the proposed transaction
was fair to the Company's stockholders from a financial point of view. Upon
reviewing the final terms, resolutions and fairness opinion, the Special
Committee unanimously voted in favor of the joint venture and the related stock
purchase and standstill agreements.

     On June 14, 2000, the Company Board ratified the Special Committee's
approval of (i) a limited liability company operating agreement of the joint
venture, named Armus, LLC ("Armus"), (ii) a Stock Purchase Agreement for the
sale of 1,438,602 Shares at a price of $7.00 per Share, constituting an
approximately ten percent (10%) interest in the Company (inclusive of Shares to
be sold by Frederick R. Adler), to Parent and (iii) a Registration Rights
Agreement. In addition, under the terms of the joint venture, Parent was given
an option to purchase all of the Company's interests and assets used in the
joint venture for an amount to be determined through an agreed-upon formula. The
option could be exercised at the earlier of either January 1, 2006 or the
Company's termination of the joint venture on or after January 1, 2007. The
Company was also given an option exercisable at any time after January 1, 2011,
to require Parent to purchase the Company's ownership interests and assets used
in the joint venture based on the same formula. In addition, Parent entered into
a Put and Call Agreement with Mr. Adler whereby, under certain circumstances,
Parent could purchase, and Mr. Adler could cause Parent to purchase, additional
Shares held by Mr. Adler.

     The operating agreement of Armus (the "Operating Agreement") provides for,
among other matters, the contribution by the Company and Parent of (i) a license
to the joint venture of certain of their respective technologies and
intellectual property, (ii) their finished good inventories and (iii) cash
contributions. In addition, the Operating Agreement created a governing board to
manage operations. Three members were appointed by Parent and two by the
Company. Under the Operating Agreement, Parent agreed to manufacture heavy
powder laundry detergents and the Company agreed to manufacture liquid and light
powder laundry detergents in addition to liquid fabric softener products. The
parties also agreed to certain manufacturing, packaging and labeling
specifications.

     The parties then began planning consolidation of their sales organizations
and Armus became operational on January 1, 2001. In January 2001, Parent assumed
responsibility for Armus' accounting and billing services and began to shift
production of certain brands to the Company's manufacturing plants in New Jersey
and Missouri. In addition, the parties began preparations to close Parent's
manufacturing plant in Syracuse, New York and consolidate distribution through
the Company's New Jersey and Missouri plants and Parent's plants in Wyoming and
Ohio. Additionally during this time, Armus began launching new products to the
market.

     In early 2001, Mr. Evan met with the Company's financial advisor, Mr.
Sawaya, who had by then founded a financial advisory firm, Sawaya & Company, LLC
("Sawaya & Co."), to discuss additional options to maximize stockholder value in
the Company. Due to, among other matters, the structure of the Armus joint
venture, the integration of a number of functions of the Company's operations
with those of Parent and the significant ownership in the Company by Parent, it
was concluded that Parent would likely be the party able to offer the highest
value for the Shares. An initial discussion occurred in early January 2001
between Mr. Evan and Robert A. Davies and Zvi Eiref, the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, of Parent, regarding the potential
for an acquisition of the Company by Parent. The senior executives from Parent
expressed an interest in purchasing the Company's interests and assets used in
Armus, but indicated they would not be interested in acquiring the Company as a
whole.

     On January 16, 2001, the Company Board, together with Messrs. Sawaya and
Nussbaum, met and discussed various possibilities available to the Company to
maximize stockholder value. The Company retained the services of Sawaya & Co. to
provide the Company with financial advice with respect to the possibility of a
sale of the Company or a majority of its assets to Parent and authorized Mr.
Sawaya to continue discussions with Parent in this regard within certain
parameters outlined by the Company Board.

     On January 17, 2001, Mr. Sawaya met with Messrs. Davies and Eiref and made
a presentation involving the Company. In his presentation, Mr. Sawaya
highlighted the difficulty the Company would have in entertaining an offer only
for the Armus joint venture. Specifically, the Company would have to incur a
significant tax liability, which would result in an unattractive value to the
stockholders. Furthermore, the

remaining businesses would not provide for a viable public company platform due
to, among other factors, the significant residual overhead that would be
allocated to such businesses resulting in a company with relatively low and
historically decreasing sales and pretax losses exceeding $5 million before any
overhead reductions. Mr. Sawaya's presentation also suggested that the Company
Board would not entertain an offer below $7.00 due to (i) the Company's view of
the intrinsic value of the Armus joint venture, and (ii) the fact that Parent
had agreed to purchase up to fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding Shares at
a price of $7.00 per Share in the recent past. Messrs. Davies and Eiref
reiterated their preference in buying the Company's interests and assets used in
Armus, but indicated a willingness to investigate further a potential
acquisition of the Company so long as a buyer could be found for the Company's
business lines not related to the joint venture. Messrs. Davies and Eiref
indicated that their preliminary views of value for the Company would be
approximately $100 million, which would represent a price per share of
approximately $5.00, after taking into account the Company's indebtedness and
estimated transaction expenses.

     Following this meeting, Mr. Evan indicated a possible interest, depending
on the terms to be negotiated and available financing, in purchasing the assets
of the non-Armus businesses from Parent as part of a transaction involving an
acquisition of all of the outstanding Shares. During the week following the
meeting with Parent, Mr. Evan outlined potential terms of an acquisition of the
non-Armus businesses.

     On January 25, 2001, Messrs. Evan and Sawaya met with Mr. Eiref to discuss
the status of the potential transaction between the Company and Parent. In this
meeting, Mr. Eiref continued to express (i) concern regarding the price per
Share expected by the Company, in light of, among other matters, the operating
results and level of indebtedness of the Company and (ii) the need to condition
a potential transaction for all of the Shares on the subsequent divestiture of
the non-Armus assets. Initial terms of a potential acquisition of the non-Armus
assets were discussed during this meeting. Several subsequent meetings occurred
between various of the Company's and Parent's executive officers and financial
advisors with regard to a possible transaction between the two companies.

     Mr. Evan also met informally with various members of the Company Board
regarding the negotiations with Parent, including his possible involvement in
the purchase of the non-Armus businesses. In addition, the members of the
Company Board, along with Mr. Evan, spoke on various occasions with the
Company's counsel and financial advisor.

     On January 29, 2001, the Company Board (including Mr. Evan), with Theodore
B. Baum absent, met with Mr. Sawaya and Fulbright to discuss the Company's
negotiations with Parent to date. The Company Board discussed various
alternatives available to the Company, including the possible transaction with
Parent, possible alternative transactions with Parent or others, and the
continuation of the Company and the joint venture arrangement as then in
existence. The Company Board also reviewed various aspects of the financial
condition and prospects of the non-Armus assets, and expressed significant
concern about Parent's ability to find a prospective purchaser for these assets
and, if found, the ability of a purchaser to finance the purchase. After such
discussion the Company Board authorized Mr. Evan to continue his negotiations
with Parent on behalf of the Company, provided that Parent agree (i) to a
structure and pricing which would maximize the net after tax consideration to be
paid to the Company's stockholders, and that regardless the amount of such
consideration should be no less than $7.00 per share net to the stockholders,
and (ii) that the disposition of any Company assets not connected with the
Company's laundry care business not be in any way a condition or other
contingency with respect to the Merger Agreement. After the January 29, 2001
meeting of the Company Board, members of the Company Board periodically met and
had telephone conversations with Mr. Evan and Fulbright to discuss the status of
negotiations with Parent.

     Following this meeting, various meetings and discussions continued to occur
between Mr. Evan and representatives of Parent, as well as between financial
advisors of the Company and financial advisors to and senior officers of Parent.

     On February 7, 2001, upon the exercise of the put right granted to Mr.
Adler, Parent purchased an additional 704,255 Shares from Mr. Adler at a price
of $7.00 per Share, increasing Parent's ownership interest to approximately
fifteen percent (15%). On February 20, 2001, Parent filed a Schedule 13D
reporting its increased stock position in the Company and the fact that
discussions were ongoing between the Company and Parent for the possible
purchase of the Company.

     On February 14, 2001, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, counsel to Parent,
circulated a draft Merger Agreement to the Company and its counsel. In addition,
Fulbright began assembling due diligence material regarding the Company for
review by Parent. During the period between February 14, 2001 and March 29,
2001, the Company and Parent negotiated the terms of the Merger Agreement and
the Company's related disclosure schedules. Additionally during this period,
representatives of Parent conducted their due diligence review of the Company.

     On February 16, 2001, Messrs. Baum, Evan and Mandell, being a majority of
the Company Board, together with Mr. Nussbaum of Fulbright, interviewed
financial advisors to assist the Company Board in reviewing the proposed
transaction. The Company Board retained PwCS to analyze and render an opinion as
to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration to be paid
to the Company's stockholders under the Merger Agreement.

     The Company Board met again on March 2, 2001 to review with Messrs. Evan
and Sawaya and Fulbright the status of negotiations regarding the transaction
with Parent, as well as to review the preliminary financial analysis of PwCS.
Messrs. Evan and Sawaya presented the Company Board with a status update on
discussions with Parent. Mr. Nussbaum outlined for the Company Board some of the
issues that were still outstanding with respect to finalizing the Merger
Agreement. Additionally, Mr. Nussbaum reported to the Company Board that Parent
was continuing its due diligence review of the Company, and on various items
about which Parent required additional information. Mr. Nussbaum also reviewed
with the Company Board the mechanics of how the Merger would be finalized and
the Offer process. After a full discussion of these matters, PwCS was invited to
join the meeting and review its preliminary financial analysis of the proposed
transaction.

     PwCS distributed to the Company Board copies of its preliminary financial
analysis with respect to the various models it reviewed in determining the value
of the Company. PwCS outlined the information concerning the Company it had
reviewed in connection with its analysis, and the additional items which still
needed to be reviewed and confirmed prior to the issuance of an opinion. The
Company Board reviewed the documentation and asked various questions of PwCS
regarding its assumptions and findings. After a discussion and question and
answer period, the Company Board requested that PwCS include additional factors
and information in connection with its analysis and opinion. PwCS then collected
its preliminary financial analysis and left the meeting. The Company Board
reviewed some final issues and agreed to be available to meet again the
following week for an update on the status of the negotiations. Additional
conversations continued to take place, on an informal basis, at various times
between the members of the Company Board, the Company's management and Mr.
Nussbaum of Fulbright.

     On March 29, 2001, the parties finalized the Merger Agreement and
disclosure schedules. The Company Board met on March 29, 2001 with Fulbright,
Mr. Sawaya, Richard D. Coslow, the Company's chief financial officer, and PwCS
to review and discuss the final terms of the Merger Agreement and PwCS's
opinion. Mr. Nussbaum informed the Company Board that Parent was in the process
of finalizing the financing necessary for it to complete the transaction, which
it expected to have by the following day. As a result, it was expected that the
Merger Agreement would be executed by the parties the following day. However,
because the terms of the Merger Agreement were not expected to change as a
result of this delay, the Company Board determined to move forward with its
detailed review of the Merger Agreement and the financial analysis. The Company
Board agreed that it would reconvene the following afternoon, subject to
Parent's confirmation that it was prepared to execute the Merger Agreement at
this time, to receive PwCS's opinion and adopt the necessary resolutions to
enter into the Merger Agreement.

     Fulbright then reviewed with the Company Board the final terms and
provisions of the Merger Agreement in detail, referring to the draft Merger
Agreement and additional documentation delivered to the Company Board members
earlier that week. The review also included a specific explanation of those
terms that had changed since the Company Board's review at the March 2, 2001
Board Meeting, as well as isolated provisions of the Merger Agreement which were
proposed to be modified from the draft agreement previously provided to the
Company Board. After Fulbright's review, the Company Board took the opportunity
to ask Fulbright questions regarding, among other matters, certain specific
terms of the Merger Agreement and their fiduciary obligations to the Company's
stockholders in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement. After a general discussion, the Company Board invited PwCS to join
the meeting and present its financial analysis.

     PwCS informed the Company Board that since the Merger Agreement could be
entered into no earlier than the following day, it was prepared to present its
findings to the Company Board to date, and subsequently update and deliver its
opinion when the Company Board was prepared to enter into the definitive Merger
Agreement. PwCS then distributed its written analysis to each Company Board
member and explained the information that PwCS relied upon in preparing its
analysis. PwCS next explained the methodologies and various analyses used and
applied in rendering its opinion. During the presentation, various members of
the Company Board asked questions regarding the analysis which were answered by
PwCS. After reviewing the presentation, the Company Board had an additional
opportunity to ask questions of PwCS. After a general discussion, the Company
Board thanked PwCS for its efforts and PwCS collected the books and reiterated
that it would be available by phone to deliver its oral opinion the following
day.

     Mr. Nussbaum next reviewed the proposed resolutions to be adopted by the
Company Board in connection with the Merger Agreement. In addition, the Company
Board was provided with a written draft of such resolutions as well as other
documents required to be finalized in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. After a general discussion, the Company
Board determined to continue the meeting until the following day.

     On the following day, March 30, 2001, after receiving confirmation that
Parent was prepared to enter into the Merger Agreement, the Company Board, along
with Fulbright and PwCS met again by telephone. After PwCS delivered its oral
opinion as to the fairness of the transaction to the stockholders of the
Company, from a financial point of view (other than to Parent, as to which no
opinion was expressed), the Company Board adopted the appropriate resolutions to
enter into the Merger Agreement and approved the Offer, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated thereby as fair to and in the best interests of the
Company's stockholders. The parties then exchanged signature pages to the Merger
Agreement and PwCS delivered its written opinion later that day.

     On April 9, 2001, Parent requested that the Company amend the Merger
Agreement to provide for an initial expiration date of 25 business days
following announcement of the Offer, rather than the 30 business day period
provided for in the original agreement. Upon approval of the Company Board, the
Company, Parent and Purchaser executed the amendment on April 10, 2001.

2. PURPOSE OF AND REASONS FOR THE OFFER.

     Purpose of the Offer. The purpose of the Offer is to acquire control of,
and the entire equity interest in, the Company. The purpose of the Merger is to
acquire all outstanding Shares not tendered and purchased pursuant to the Offer.
If the Offer is successful, Purchaser intends to consummate the Merger as
promptly as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver of each of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement, but in no event
later than 10:00 a.m. on the second business day, unless another time is agreed
to by the Company, Parent and Purchaser.

     Reasons. Parent and Purchaser believe that significant operating
efficiencies can be achieved through the Merger. Parent already owns 2,142,857
Shares, representing approximately 15% of the outstanding Shares, and currently
operates Armus with the Company on a joint basis. The Merger will allow Parent
to acquire full control of the Company's laundry assets and to integrate those
assets with Parent's existing operations. Based on Parent's operating experience
with Armus, Parent and Purchaser believe that the Merger will ultimately

create significant efficiencies by, among other matters, eliminating duplicative
overhead and improving economies of scale. Parent and Purchaser also believe
that the Merger will improve the market presence of the complementary product
lines of Parent and the Company and will provide Parent with the opportunity to
build on the efficiencies realized in the Armus joint venture.

3. CERTAIN EFFECTS OF THE OFFER.

     Market for the Shares. The purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer will
reduce the number of holders of Shares and the number of Shares that might
otherwise trade publicly and could adversely affect the liquidity and market
value of the remaining Shares held by stockholders other than Purchaser.
Purchaser cannot predict whether the reduction in the number of Shares that
might otherwise trade publicly would have an adverse or beneficial effect on the
market price for, or marketability of, the Shares or whether such reduction
would cause future market prices to be greater or less than the Offer Price.

     Stock Quotation. Inclusion of the Shares on The Nasdaq National Market
System is voluntary, so the Company may terminate that inclusion at any time.
Parent has no intention to cause the Company to terminate the inclusion of the
Shares on The Nasdaq National Market System prior to the Merger. However,
depending upon the number of Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer, the Shares
may no longer meet the standards for continued inclusion in The Nasdaq National
Market System. According to its published guidelines, The Nasdaq National Market
System would give consideration to delisting the Shares if, among other matters,
the number of publicly held Shares falls below 750,000 or the number of holders
of round lots of Shares falls below 400. Shares held by directors or officers of
the Company or their immediate families, or by any beneficial owner of more than
ten percent or more of the Shares, ordinarily will not be considered as being
publicly held for this purpose. In the event the Shares are no longer eligible
for listing on The Nasdaq National Market System, quotations might still be
available from other sources. The extent of the public market for the Shares and
the availability of such quotations would, however, depend upon the number of
holders of such shares at such time, the interest in maintaining a market in
such shares on the part of securities firms, the possible termination of
registration of such shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), as described below and other factors. If, as a
result of the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Shares no longer
meet the criteria for continuing inclusion in The Nasdaq National Market System,
the market for the Shares could be adversely affected.

     If The Nasdaq National Market System were to delist the Shares, it is
possible that the Shares would continue to trade on another securities exchange
or in the over-the-counter market and that price or other quotations would be
reported by such exchange or through other sources. The extent of the public
market for the Shares and the availability of such quotations would depend upon
such factors as the number of stockholders and/or the aggregate market value of
the publicly traded Shares remaining at such time, the interest in maintaining a
market in the Shares on the part of securities firms, the possible termination
of registration under the Exchange Act (as described below) and other factors.
We cannot predict whether the reduction in the number of Shares that might
otherwise trade publicly would have an adverse or beneficial effect on the
market price for or marketability of the Shares or whether it would cause future
market prices to be greater or less than the Offer Price.

     Exchange Act Registration. The Shares are currently registered under the
Exchange Act. The purchase of the Shares pursuant to the Offer may result in the
Shares becoming eligible for deregistration under the Exchange Act. Such
registration of the Shares may be terminated upon application of the Company to
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") if the Shares are not listed
on a national securities exchange and there are fewer than 300 holders of record
of the Shares. Termination of registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act
would substantially reduce the information required to be furnished by the
Company to its stockholders and to the SEC and would make certain provisions of
the Exchange Act no longer applicable to the Company, such as the short-swing
profit recovery provisions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the requirement
of furnishing a proxy statement pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act in
connection with stockholders' meetings and the related requirement of furnishing
an annual report to stockholders, and the requirements of Rule 13e-3 under the
Exchange Act with respect to "going private" transactions. Furthermore, the
ability of "affiliates" of the Company and persons holding "restricted

securities" of the Company to dispose of such securities pursuant to Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"),
may be impaired or eliminated. If registration of the Shares under the Exchange
Act were terminated, the Shares would no longer be "margin securities" or be
eligible for quotation on The Nasdaq National Market System.

     Purchaser believes that the purchase of the Shares pursuant to the Offer
may result in the Shares becoming eligible for deregistration under the Exchange
Act and it would be the intention of Purchaser to cause the Company to make an
application for termination of registration of the Shares as soon as possible
after successful completion of the Merger, if the Shares are then eligible for
such termination.

     Margin Regulations. The Shares are currently "margin securities" under the
Regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
"Federal Reserve Board"), which has the effect, among other things, of allowing
brokers to extend credit on the collateral of the Shares. Depending upon factors
similar to those described above regarding the market for the Shares and stock
quotations, it is possible that, following the Offer, the Shares would no longer
constitute "margin securities" for the purposes of the margin regulations of the
Federal Reserve Board and therefore could no longer be used as collateral for
loans made by brokers.

4. PLANS FOR THE COMPANY.

     Plans for the Company. Except as otherwise set forth in this Offer to
Purchase, it is expected that, immediately following the Merger, the business
operations of the Company will be continued by the Surviving Corporation
substantially as they are currently being conducted. The directors of Purchaser
will be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of
Purchaser will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation. Upon
completion of the Offer and the Merger, Parent intends to conduct a detailed
review of the Company and its assets, corporate structure, capitalization,
operations, policies, management and personnel. After such review, Parent will
determine what actions or changes, if any, would be desirable in light of the
circumstances which then exist.

     Except as described in this Offer to Purchase, neither Parent nor Purchaser
has any current plans or proposals that would relate to or result in (i) any
extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or
liquidation involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) a purchase,
sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, (iii) any change in the Company Board or management, including,
but not limited to, any plans or proposals to change the number or term of
directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the Company Board or to change
any material term of the employment contract of any executive officer, (iv) any
material change in the Company's capitalization, indebtedness or dividend
policy, (v) any other material change in the Company's corporate structure or
business, (vi) a class of securities being delisted from a national securities
exchange or ceasing to be authorized to be quoted in an interdealer quotation
system of a registered national securities association, or (vii) a class of
equity securities of the Company becoming eligible for termination of
registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Exchange Act. Most members of
the Company's current management are not expected to continue with the Surviving
Corporation following the Merger. Also, it is currently contemplated that
certain non-core assets of the Company (which accounted for approximately
fifteen percent (15%) of the Company's revenues in 2000) will be sold to a new
entity owned by certain members of the Company's current management and by
Parent. Any such transaction will be negotiated at arms' length among the
various parties. See -- Certain Effects of the Offer, -- Interests of Certain
Persons in the Offer and the Merger and The Tender Offer -- The Merger
Agreement.

5. POSITION OF PARENT AND PURCHASER REGARDING THE FAIRNESS OF THE OFFER AND THE
   MERGER.

     Parent and Purchaser believe that the Merger Consideration to be received
by the Company's stockholders (other than Parent and Purchaser) pursuant to the
Offer and the Merger is fair to and in the best interests of the Company's
unaffiliated stockholders. Each of Parent and Purchaser is making the statements
included in this Section 5 solely for the purpose of complying with the
requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules under the Exchange Act. The
position of Parent and Purchaser as to the fairness of the Offer and the Merger
is not a recommendation to any holder of Shares as to whether such holder should
tender Shares into the Offer or as to how such holder should vote with regard to
the Merger, if applicable.

     Parent and Purchaser believe that the Offer and the Merger are
substantively and procedurally fair to the Company's unaffiliated stockholders.
Neither Parent nor Purchaser participated in the deliberations of the Company
Board or received advice from PwCS. Parent and Purchaser base their belief
regarding the fairness of the Offer and the Merger on the following factors:

     - the fact that the Offer and the Merger and the other terms and conditions
       of the Merger Agreement were the result of arm's length, good faith
       negotiations between Parent and the Company, each of which acted
       independently and with the assistance of independent financial and legal
       advisors;

     - the recent and historical financial condition and results of operations
       of the Company and the Company's current business strategy and future
       prospects, together with the risks associated with achieving those
       objectives and realizing those prospects in current industry and market
       conditions, the Company's position in such markets and the historical and
       current market prices for the Shares;

     - the terms of the Merger Agreement, including a structure designed to
       result in the holders of Shares receiving cash consideration in the Offer
       and the Merger;

     - the fact that the price per Share to be paid in the Offer and the Merger
       represents a premium of approximately 65% over the $4.25 closing price
       per Share on The Nasdaq National Market System on February 16, 2001 (the
       last full day of trading before the public announcement that Parent was
       engaged in discussions with the Company); a premium of approximately 30%
       over the $5.38 closing price per Share on The Nasdaq National Market
       System one day prior to March 30, 2001; a premium of approximately 35%
       over the $5.19 closing price per Share on The Nasdaq National Market
       System one week prior to March 30, 2001; and a premium of approximately
       57% over the $4.47 closing price per Share on The Nasdaq National Market
       System four weeks prior to March 30, 2001;

     - the Company's prior unsuccessful efforts to solicit bids for the Company
       and the fact that neither Parent nor Purchaser is aware of any current or
       recent offer, inquiry or proposal from any person regarding an
       acquisition of the Company or any significant portion of its assets or
       securities;

     - the fact that the Company Board received an opinion, dated March 30,
       2001, from PwCS that as of that date and based upon and subject to the
       assumptions, factors and limitations set forth in the written opinion,
       the $7.00 per Share cash consideration to be received by holders of
       Shares (other than Parent and Purchaser) in the Offer and the Merger
       pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair to such holders of Shares, from
       a financial point of view; and

     - the fact that the Company Board, by unanimous action, determined that the
       Offer and the Merger are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of
       the Company and its stockholders.

     Neither Parent nor Purchaser found it practicable to assign, nor did they
assign, relative weights to the individual factors considered in reaching their
conclusion as to fairness. Moreover, neither Parent nor Purchaser considered net
book value, liquidation value or going concern value in evaluating the fairness
of the Offer and the Merger to the Company's unaffiliated stockholders.

6. OPINION OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR.

     The Company Board retained PwCS to act as its financial advisor and, as
requested by the Company Board, to render an opinion as to the fairness of the
Merger, from a financial point of view, to the Company's public stockholders.
Prior to being engaged as the financial advisor to the Company Board, PwCS had
no prior professional relationship with the Company.

     At the request of the Company Board, on March 30, 2001, PwCS rendered its
written opinion to the Company Board to the effect that, as of that date and
subject to the assumptions made, matters considered and limits of the review
undertaken by PwCS described in its opinion, the Merger Consideration to be
received by the Company's common stockholders (other than Parent and Purchaser)
pursuant to the Offer and the Merger was fair from a financial point of view to
such stockholders.

     The full text of PwCS' written opinion is attached as Appendix A to this
Offer to Purchase and is hereby incorporated into this Offer to Purchaser by
reference. The following description of PwCS' opinion is only a summary, and you
should read the full opinion for a complete understanding of the opinion's
assumptions, considerations and limitations.

     You should be aware that the PwCS opinion only advises the Company Board
concerning the fairness from a financial point of view of the Merger
Consideration. The opinion does not address the merits of the Company Board's
decision to recommend acceptance of the Offer or approval of the Merger. The
opinion is not a recommendation to you that you tender your Shares or that you
take any other action regarding the Offer or the Merger.

     In preparing its opinion, PwCS, among other things:

          (a) reviewed the Merger Agreement;

          (b) reviewed certain financial and other information relating to the
     Company that was publicly available or furnished to PwCS by the Company
     that PwCS believed to be appropriate for the purposes of rendering its
     opinion, including, but not limited to: (i) the Company's Annual Reports on
     Forms 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 30, 1997 through
     December 30, 1999 and the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
     nine-month period ended September 30, 2000; (ii) the Company's audited
     consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2000;
     (iii) financial projections for and as developed by the Company; and (iv)
     publicly available market information regarding the Company and the
     historical trading price and volume of its common stock;

          (c) met with members of the Company's management to discuss the
     business, operations, historical financial results and future prospects of
     the Company;

          (d) considered certain financial and securities data of the Company
     and compared that data with similar data for other publicly-held companies
     in businesses similar to those of the Company;

          (e) performed a discounted cash flow analysis, a comparable company
     analysis, a comparable transaction analysis and certain other analyses
     which PwCS deemed useful in connection therewith; and

          (f) considered and/or performed such other information, financial
     studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and market
     criteria as PwCS deemed relevant and appropriate for purposes of its
     opinion.

     PwCS did not independently verify any of the information it obtained for
purposes of its opinion. Instead, PwCS assumed the accuracy and completeness of
all such information. PwCS relied upon the Company management's assurances that
information concerning the Company's prospects reflected the best currently
available judgments and estimates of management as to the Company's likely
future financial performance. As to all legal matters, PwCS relied on the advice
of counsel to the Company Board and has assumed that the Merger will be
consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. PwCS did not
make an independent inspection, evaluation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities of the Company, nor did anyone furnish PwCS with any such evaluation
or appraisal. The PwCS opinion is based on market, economic and other conditions
as they existed and could be evaluated at the time the opinion was given.

     No limitations were imposed by the Company or the Company Board on the
scope of PwCS' investigation or the procedures PwCS followed in rendering its
opinion.

     In addressing the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger
Consideration to be received by the Company's common stockholders (other than
Parent or Purchaser), PwCS employed a variety of generally recognized valuation
methodologies and performed those which it believed were most appropriate for
developing its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion involves various
determinations of the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances.
Therefore such an opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. In arriving at its opinion, PwCS did not attribute any
particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made
qualitative judgments about the significance and relevance of each analysis and
factor.

Such analyses resulted in the calculation of ranges of implied per share values
for the Company's common stock, including implied values that were greater than
the Merger Consideration, but PwCS did not consider that any particular implied
value, whether less than or greater than the Merger Consideration, was
determinative of fairness.

     PwCS believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of its analyses, without considering all factors and
analyses, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion.

     In performing its analyses, PwCS made numerous assumptions with respect to
industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. The analyses
performed by PwCS do not purport to be an appraisal and are not necessarily
indicative of actual values, trading values or actual future results that might
be achieved, all of which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by PwCS' analyses.

     In connection with its analyses, PwCS utilized estimates and forecasts of
the Company's future operating results contained in or derived from projections
developed and supplied by the Company's management. Analyses based on forecasts
of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which
may be significantly more or less favorable than the forecasts. The analyses are
inherently subject to uncertainty, being based on numerous factors or events
beyond the control of the Company. Therefore, future results or actual values
may be materially different from these forecasts or assumptions. The PwCS
opinion was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Company Board in
making their determination to approve the Merger Agreement. Consequently, the
analyses described below should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of
either the Company Board with respect to the value of the Company or whether the
Company Board would have been willing to agree to different terms for the Offer
and the Merger.

     The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by PwCS
in connection with rendering the PwCS opinion to the Company Board. For purposes
of the financial analyses from which these per share values are derived, PwCS
assumed that the Company would be operated by a management team with the
perceived ability to achieve the financial results of the projections. The
following analyses reflect substantially the same methodologies used by PwCS in
its preliminary oral presentation to the Company Board on March 2, 2001, and
updated and confirmed in written form to reflect financial information and
market data that was available as of and on March 30, 2001.

     For its evaluations, PwCS calculated a range of values for the Company
using six approaches: (i) a comparable companies analysis; (ii) a comparable
transactions analysis; (iii) a discounted cash flow analysis; (iv) a leveraged
buyout analysis; (v) a premiums paid analysis; and (vi) an analysis of a sale of
the Company's economic interest in and the Company's assets associated with
Armus LLC. In certain cases, investment banks sometimes utilize two other
analyses, (a) a net book value analysis or (b) a liquidation analysis, as
alternative approaches in ascertaining value. PwCS did not believe either of
these to be meaningful methods to derive the value of an operating business,
because neither the net book value of a company nor its value in liquidation
greatly affect its ability to generate future revenues and income.

     In the comparable companies analysis, PwCS determined the implied public
market value of the Company based on the multiples derived by dividing
comparable public company valuations by certain measures of operating
performance such as sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization ("EBITDA"), earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT"), net
income, the median projected earnings per share as developed by certain research
analysts and net book value. Comparable public company multiples provided a
proxy for perceived market value, since they are based on the market's valuation
of comparable companies and industry prospects.

     For all the comparable public companies it selected for the analysis, PwCS
derived various mean and median common stock trading multiples. Sales, EBITDA
and EBIT multiples are based on total enterprise value divided by each financial
measure, respectively. Total enterprise value is defined as the market value of
common stock, plus total debt, less cash and cash equivalents. The remaining
multiples are derived by dividing

the market value of the common stock in aggregate, or per share, as appropriate,
by net income, projected net income and net book value.

     PwCS calculated unleveraged implied equity valuations for the Company based
upon sales, EBITDA and EBIT by multiplying the Company's sales, EBITDA and EBIT
by the valuation multiples of sales, EBITDA and EBIT derived from the comparable
company analysis. From this product, PwCS subtracted total debt and added the
Company's cash and cash equivalents to derive the unlevered equity value. For
valuations based on net income, projected net income and book value, PwCS
multiplied the Company's respective values by the appropriate median multiples
to arrive at implied equity values. In the case of the Company, PwCS was only
able to employ multiples of sales, EBITDA, EBIT and book value, as the Company
experienced losses during the last twelve months.

     In choosing comparable companies for the Company in this valuation, PwCS
examined companies that develop, manufacture and market non-durable household
and personal care consumer products sold to end users through retail specialty
stores, drug or grocery chains, mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs. PwCS'
group of comparable companies consisted of Alberto-Culver Company; Allou Health
& Beauty Care, Inc.; Blythe, Inc.; Church & Dwight Co., Inc.; Clorox Company;
Colgate-Palmolive Company; Del Laboratories, Inc.; Dial Corporation; Gillette
Company; Playtex Products, Inc.; Procter & Gamble Co.; WD-40 Company; and Yankee
Candle Co.

     Results of the comparable companies analysis is summarized in the chart

     The comparable transactions analysis applies a similar methodology as the
comparable companies analysis, but relies upon multiples derived from merger and
acquisition transactions involving comparable companies. These consisted of
sales, EBITDA, EBIT, net income and book value multiples. For all of the
comparable merger and acquisition transactions, we derived various mean
multiples. Sales, EBITDA and EBIT multiples are based on total transaction value
(the enterprise value) divided by each financial measure, respectively. The
remaining multiples are derived by dividing the purchase price by the
appropriate financial item. Purchase price equals the amount paid for the
target's equity (the equity value). Transaction value equals purchase price,
plus the target's outstanding interest-bearing debt, less cash and cash
equivalents purchased.

     PwCS calculated implied equity valuations for the Company by multiplying
its sales, EBITDA and EBIT by the median sales, EBITDA and EBIT multiples
derived in the analysis, then subtracting total debt and adding cash and cash
equivalents. For valuations based on net income and net book value, PwCS
multiplied USAD's respective values by the appropriate median multiples to
arrive at equity value. PwCS was only able to employ multiples of sales, EBITDA
and book value, because the valuation based on the Company's operating profit
(adjusted for net debt) and net income were negative.

     In choosing comparable transactions for the Company valuation, PwCS
examined companies or brands which are manufactured and marketed as non-durable,
household and personal care consumer products

distributed to end users through specialty retail stores, drug or grocery story
chains, mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs. The group of comparable
transactions consisted of the acquisition of Block Drug Company; Concord
Beverage Co.'s private label business and Vintage brand; Chattem, Inc.'s Ban
line of deodorant; Dial Corporation housecleaning brands; Fort James
Corporation; Revlon's Plusbelle hair care brand; Scrub Free, Delicare and Clean
Shower brands; Colgate-Palmolive's Baby Magic brand; Block Drug Company's Lava
business; American Safety Razor Company; First Brands Corp.; Dep Corp.; Loren
Products; S.C. Johnson's Spray'n'Wash, Glass Plus, Yes and Vivid brands; and
Tambrands, Inc.

     In the discounted cash flow analysis, PwCS analyzed cash flows derived from
projections for the Company that were developed by the Company's management team
and reviewed by PwCS. PwCS discounted the cash flows using a range of discount
rates based upon its estimation of an investor's expected rate of return for a
risk capital investment in the Company. The discounted cash flow analysis
derives implied equity values based on the present value of future net cash
flows, less current total interest-bearing debt, plus current total cash and
cash equivalents and combines the present value of five years of free cash flow
projections with the present value of the estimated terminal value of the
business beyond the forecast period.

     Unlike the market-based valuation approaches, the discounted cash flow
valuation utilizes estimates of future, rather than historical, financial
performance. The cash flows were discounted using a Weighted Average Cost of
Capital ("WACC") derived from the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The WACC is the
cost of debt times the percentage of debt to the sum of the debt and the equity,
plus the cost of equity times the percentage of equity to the sum of the debt
and the equity.

     The cost of debt is the product of the Company's weighted average interest
rate on its debt. The cost of equity is the product of the risk free rate
(Ibbotson Associates 2000 Yearbook's 20 year U.S. Treasury Bond Yield of 6.8%),
plus the Company's (beta)eta multiplied by the sum of (i) the equity risk
premium (Ibbotson Associates 2000 Yearbook's S&P 500 Equity Premium of 9.4%) and
(ii) the size premium (Ibbotson Associates 2000 Yearbook's Expected
micro-capitalization equity size premium of 2.2%). PwCS discounted the cash
flows using a range of discount rates based upon the WACC PwCS calculated for
the Company. PwCS developed this range by increasing and decreasing the
Company's WACC by 100 basis points.

     For purposes of this analysis, annual free cash flow equals deleveraged net

change in working capital. In the last year of the analysis, we calculated a
terminal value for the business based on the median EBIT multiple (7.8) paid in
the acquisitions of four closely-comparable consumer products companies that
closed during the past 30 months multiplied by the Company's 2005 Projected
EBIT.

     In the leveraged buyout analysis, PwCS estimated the amount a financial
buyer would expect to pay for the Company, assuming the maximum amount of debt
and equity financing which would enable an equity investor to achieve returns of
25% to 35%. PwCS' analysis was based on operating projections and general
assumptions developed by the Company's management and reviewed by PwCS. To
complete this analysis, PwCS constructed capital structures that meet the
estimated risk/return requirements of private equity investors and senior and
subordinated lenders. The sum of the senior debt and equity, less estimated fees
to consummate such a transaction, provided an implied price which a financial
buyer reasonably could be expected to pay for the Company's common stock.

     The leveraged buyout analysis is summarized in the table which follows:

     The premiums paid analysis compares the market price of the Company's
common stock prior to the announcement of a transaction with the price after the
announcement. Based on an efficient market theory, the pre-announcement price
reflects the market's perception about the value of the Company as a going
concern, while the proposed acquisition price reflects the value of the
consideration being offered by Parent, plus or minus an amount associated with
the markets estimation of other factors such as uncertainty of Parent's or the
Company's abilities to close a transaction or the relative likelihood that
another potential acquirer might bid for the Company.

     To determine the premiums one might expect to be paid in a tender for the
stock of a company similar to the Company, PwCS analyzed the premiums paid in
every transaction that was announced and closed from January 1, 1990 through
February 28, 2001, with enterprise values less than $200 million. Because of
day-to-day market fluctuations, particularly for a small capitalization stock,
and transaction information leaks, in addition to analyzing the closing price of
the Company's common stock immediately before the announcement, PwCS also
analyzed the stock's closing price one week and four weeks before the
announcement of the transaction. This allowed PwCS to calculate a range of
prices for the Company's common stock.

     PwCS presented the analysis contained herein prior to a public announcement
that Parent and the Company have executed the Merger Agreement governing the
Offer and the Merger. For this analysis, PwCS used February 20, 2001 as the date
of the announcement, because on February 20, 2001, Parent filed a Schedule 13D
with the SEC disclosing that Parent and the Company were engaged in discussions
with respect to a possible transaction. Those discussions led to the execution
of the Merger Agreement.

     Results of the premiums paid analysis is summarized in the table below:

     In its sixth analysis, PwCS considered the value that would be generated if
Parent were to purchase the Company's economic interest in and the Company's
assets associated with Armus LLC (the "Armus Assets") for cash today. PwCS
estimated the purchase price Parent would be willing to pay for the Armus Assets
by analyzing the present value of the projected cash flows to the Company from
Armus which management derived from the projections for Armus' operating income
for 2001 through 2005 (as provided by the management of Armus LLC) and adding
the present value of the estimated terminal value of the business beyond the
forecast period. PwCS discounted the cash flows using Parent's WACC

     For purposes of this analysis, the annual free cash flow to the Company
from Armus equals deleveraged net income (defined as the Company's Armus profit
participation as contractually specified in the Armus LLC operating agreement,
less taxes at 40%), plus depreciation associated with the Armus Assets
(estimated by the Company's management to be 88% of the Company's projected
depreciation), less capital expenditures (estimated by the Company's management
to be 88% of the Company's projected capital expenditures), less the change in
working capital required to support the operation of the Armus Assets.

     In the last year of the analysis, PwCS calculated a terminal value for the
business based on a contractual acquisition multiple (contained in the Armus LLC
operating agreement) of the average of 2004 and 2005 EBITDA. PwCS then taxed the
proceeds from the sale of the Armus Assets at a rate of 43% (the rate management
estimates would be applicable to the gain on the sale of the Armus Assets). To
the net after-tax cash generated by the assumed sale of the Armus Assets, PwCS
added the present value of five years of free cash flow projections for the
Company without the Armus Assets and the present value of the estimated terminal
value of the business without the Armus Assets beyond the forecast period.

     To accomplish this, PwCS analyzed cash flows derived from projections for
the Company without the Armus Assets that were developed by the Company's
management team and reviewed by PwCS. The cash flows were discounted using the
Company's WACC. PwCS calculated a terminal value for the business based on the
median EBIT multiple (7.8) paid in the acquisitions of four closely-comparable
consumer products companies that have closed during the past 30 months,
multiplied by the Company's 2005 projected EBIT without the Armus Assets.

     PwCS' analysis of a sale of the Armus Assets is summarized in the table
which follows:

     PwCS did not ascribe different weightings to each analysis because in every
analysis, the Merger Consideration exceeded the median values for the Company's
equity that PwCS calculated. Pursuant to its engagement letter with PwCS, dated
February 16, 2001, the Company Board agreed to pay to PwCS an aggregate fee of
approximately $275,000 for its services in connection with the Offer and the
Merger, all of which has been paid. The engagement letter also provides that the
Company will reimburse PwCS for its reasonable travel, legal and other
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with PwCS' role thereunder and
will indemnify PwCS and its affiliates from and against certain liabilities.
These liabilities include liabilities under the federal securities laws in
connection with the engagement of PwCS by the Company Board.

     The Company Board retained PwCS on the basis of its experience with mergers
and acquisitions, financings and advising boards of directors and shareholders
regarding strategic alternatives. PwCS is regularly engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers, acquisitions and
private placements of securities.

7. INTENT TO TENDER

     Based on information provided by the Company, Parent and Purchaser believe
that each executive officer and director of the Company currently intends to
tender all Shares then held of record or beneficially owned by such person to
Purchaser in the Offer (other than Shares which may be acquired upon exercise of
stock options), except for Daniel Bergman and persons who would by tendering
incur liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. Mr. Bergman may sell a
portion of his Shares or gift a portion of his Shares to a charitable trust
prior to the consummation of the Offer.

                                THE TENDER OFFER

1. TERMS OF THE OFFER.

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (including, if
the Offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of such extension or
amendment), Purchaser will accept for payment and pay the Offer Price for all
Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to 12:00 midnight, New
York City time, on Friday, May 18, 2001 (the "Expiration Date"). If Purchaser
extends the deadline for tendering Shares (in accordance with the Merger
Agreement), the term "Expiration Date" will mean the latest time and date on
which the Offer, as so extended, expires.

     The Offer is conditioned upon the Minimum Tender Condition; that is upon
there having been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn that number of
Shares, which together with any Shares then beneficially owned by Purchaser and
Parent, represents at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the total number of
Shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (including Shares issuable upon
exercise of all in-the-money Company stock options and warrants that vest prior
to the Effective Time, but excluding Shares held by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries). The Offer also is conditioned upon expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, or similar statutes and
regulations, and the other conditions described in the section captioned
- -- Certain Conditions of the Offer.

     Extension of the Offer. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Offer,
the Merger Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
described below, Purchaser reserves the right, at any time and from time to time
in its sole discretion, to extend the period during which the Offer is open by
giving oral or written notice of such extension to the Depositary. During any
such extension, all Shares previously tendered and not withdrawn will remain
subject to the Offer, subject to the right of a tendering stockholder to
withdraw such stockholder's Shares. See -- Withdrawal Rights. There can be no
assurance that Purchaser will exercise its right to extend the Offer.

     Purchaser also expressly reserves the right, at any time and from time to
time, to modify or amend the terms and conditions of the Offer in any respect.
However, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Purchaser has agreed that, without
the prior written consent of the Company, it will not make any change that (a)
increases the Minimum Tender Condition; (b) changes the form of consideration to
be paid; (c) decreases the price per Share or the number of Shares sought in the
Offer; (d) imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in the
Merger Agreement; (e) changes the Expiration Date, except as set forth in the
Merger Agreement; or (f) is adverse to the holders of the Shares.

     Without the consent of the Company, Parent shall cause Purchaser to (i)
extend the Offer for one or more additional periods of ten business days each,
if any conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied (other than conditions
which are not capable of being satisfied) or waived; or (ii) extend the Offer
for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of
the SEC or staff thereof applicable to the Offer or for any period required by
any other law applicable to the Offer. Furthermore, if all the conditions to the
Offer are satisfied or waived but the number of Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn is less than ninety percent (90%) of the then outstanding number of
Shares, without the consent of the Company, Parent may cause Purchaser to: (x)
extend the Offer for up to two additional periods of five business days each
beyond the latest Expiration Date; and/or (y) extend the Offer for a subsequent
offering period (as provided in Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act) of up to
twenty days in order to acquire over ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding
Shares.

     The rights reserved in the foregoing paragraphs are in addition to the
rights set forth in the section captioned -- Certain Conditions of the Offer.

     Any extension, delay, termination, waiver or amendment will be followed as
promptly as practicable by public announcement. An announcement, in the case of
an extension, will be made no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
next business day after the previously scheduled expiration of the Offer, in
accordance with the public announcement requirements of Rule 14e-1(d). Subject
to applicable law (including Rules 14d-4(d) and 14d-6(c) under the Exchange Act,
which require that material changes be

promptly disseminated to stockholders in a manner reasonably designed to inform
them of such changes) and without limiting the manner in which Purchaser may
choose to make any public announcement, Purchaser shall have no obligation to
publish, advertise or otherwise communicate any such public announcement other
than by issuing a press release to the Dow Jones News Service.

     Subject to the Merger Agreement, if Purchaser makes a material change in
the terms of the Offer or the information concerning the Offer or waives a
material condition of the Offer, Purchaser will disseminate additional tender
offer materials (including by public announcement as set forth below) and extend
the Offer to the extent required by Rules 14d-4(d) and 14e-1 under the Exchange
Act. These rules generally provide that the minimum period during which a tender
offer must remain open following material changes in the terms of the offer or
information concerning the offer, other than a change in price or a change in
the percentage of securities sought, will depend upon the facts and
circumstances then existing, including the relative materiality of the changed
terms or information. In the SEC's view, an offer should remain open for a
minimum of five business days from the date the material change is first
published, sent or given to stockholders, and, if material changes are made with
respect to information that approaches the significance of price and the
percentage of securities sought, a minimum of ten business days may be required
to allow for adequate dissemination and investor response. With respect to a
change in price, a minimum ten business day period from the date of the change
is generally required to allow for adequate dissemination to stockholders.
Accordingly, if, prior to the Expiration Date, Purchaser increases or decreases
the consideration offered pursuant to the Offer, and if the Offer is scheduled
to expire at any time earlier than the tenth business day from the date that
notice of the increase or decrease is first published, sent or given to holders
of Shares, Purchaser will extend the Offer at least until the expiration of such
tenth business day. For purposes of the Offer, a "business day" means any day
other than a Saturday, Sunday or a federal holiday and consists of the time
period from 12:01 a.m. through 12:00 midnight, New York City time.

     Pursuant to, but subject to certain conditions in, the Merger Agreement,
Purchaser has agreed to (i) accept for payment all Shares validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as permitted under applicable law,
and (ii) pay for such Shares promptly thereafter.

     The Company has provided Purchaser with the Company's stockholder list and
security position listing for the purpose of disseminating the Offer to holders
of Shares. This Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal will be
mailed to record holders of Shares whose names appear on the Company's
stockholder list and will be furnished, for subsequent transmittal to beneficial
owners of Shares, to brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies and
similar persons whose names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on the
stockholder list or, if applicable, who are listed as participants in a clearing
agency's security position listing.

2. ACCEPTANCE FOR PAYMENT AND PAYMENT FOR SHARES.

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (including, if
the Offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any such extension
or amendment), Purchaser will accept for payment, purchase and pay for all
Shares which have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
at the earliest time following expiration of the Offer when all conditions to
the Offer described in the section captioned -- Certain Conditions of the Offer
have been satisfied or waived by Purchaser. Subject to the Merger Agreement and
any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under
the Exchange Act (relating to Purchaser's obligation to pay for or return
tendered Shares promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer),
Purchaser expressly reserves the right to delay the acceptance for payment of or
the payment for any tendered Shares in order to comply in whole or in part with
any applicable laws, including, without limitation, the HSR Act and similar
statutes and regulations and New Jersey's Industrial Site Recovery Act and
similar state statutes and regulations. See -- Certain Legal Matters; Regulatory
Approvals.

     For purposes of the Offer, Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted for
payment (and thereby purchased) Shares validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn as, if and when Purchaser gives oral or written notice to the
Depositary of Purchaser's acceptance for payment of such Shares pursuant to the
Offer. Upon

the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, payment for Shares
accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made by deposit of the
purchase price for the Shares with the Depositary, which will act as agent for
tendering stockholders for the purposes of receiving payments from Purchaser and
transmitting payments to tendering stockholders. Under no circumstances will
Purchaser pay interest on the purchase price for the Shares, regardless of any
extension of the Offer or any delay in making payment.

     In all cases, Purchaser will pay for Shares purchased in the Offer only
after timely receipt by the Depositary of (i) the certificates representing the
Shares (the "Share Certificates") or confirmation (a "Book-Entry Confirmation")
of a book-entry transfer of such Shares into the Depositary's account at The
Depository Trust Company (the "Book-Entry Transfer Facility") pursuant to the
procedures set forth in the section captioned -- Procedures for Accepting the
Offer and Tendering Shares; (ii) the appropriate Letter of Transmittal (or a
facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with any required
signature guarantees or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's
Message (as defined below) in lieu of the Letter of Transmittal; and (iii) any
other documents required under the Letter of Transmittal.

     "Agent's Message" means a message transmitted by a Book-Entry Transfer
Facility to, and received by, the Depositary and forming a part of a Book-Entry
Confirmation, which message states that the Book-Entry Transfer Facility has
received an express acknowledgment from the participant in the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility tendering the Shares which are the subject of the Book-Entry
Confirmation that the participant has received and agrees to be bound by the
terms of the Letter of Transmittal and that Purchaser may enforce the Letter of
Transmittal against the participant.

     If Purchaser does not purchase any tendered Shares pursuant to the Offer
for any reason, or if a holder of Shares submits Share Certificates representing
more Shares than are tendered, Share Certificates representing unpurchased or
untendered Shares will be returned, without expense to the tendering stockholder
(or, in the case of Shares tendered by book-entry transfer into the Depositary's
account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility pursuant to the procedure set forth
in the section captioned -- Procedures for Accepting the Offer and Tendering
Shares, such Shares will be credited to an account maintained at the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility), as promptly as practicable following the expiration or
termination of the Offer.

     If, prior to the Expiration Date, Purchaser increases the Offer Price,
Purchaser will pay the Offer Price, as increased, to all holders of Shares that
are purchased in the Offer, whether or not the Shares were tendered before the
increase in the Offer Price.

     Purchaser reserves the right to transfer or assign, in whole or in part,
from time to time, to one or more direct or indirect subsidiaries of Parent, the
right to purchase all or any portion of the Shares tendered pursuant to the
Offer, but any such transfer or assignment will not relieve Purchaser of its
obligations under the Offer and will in no way prejudice the rights of tendering
stockholders to receive payment for Shares validly tendered and accepted for
payment pursuant to the Offer.

3. PROCEDURES FOR ACCEPTING THE OFFER AND TENDERING SHARES.

     Valid Tenders. To tender Shares pursuant to the Offer, a stockholder must
comply with one of the following: (a) a properly completed and duly executed
Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof) in accordance with the
instructions of the Letter of Transmittal, with any required signature
guarantees, Share Certificates to be tendered and any other documents required
by the Letter of Transmittal must be received by the Depositary at one of its
addresses set forth on the back cover of this Offer to Purchase prior to the
Expiration Date, (b) such Shares must be properly delivered pursuant to the
procedures for book-entry transfer described below and a confirmation of such
delivery received by the Depositary, which confirmation must include an Agent's
Message if the tendering stockholder has not delivered a Letter of Transmittal,
prior to the Expiration Date, or (c) the tendering stockholder must comply with
the guaranteed delivery procedures set forth below.

     Book-Entry Transfer. The Depositary will establish accounts with respect to
the Shares at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility for purposes of the Offer within
two business days after the date of this Offer to Purchase. Any financial
institution that is a participant in the system of the Book-Entry Transfer
Facility may

make a book-entry delivery of Shares by causing the Book-Entry Transfer Facility
to transfer such Shares into the Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer
Facility in accordance with the Book-Entry Transfer Facility's procedures for
such transfer. However, although delivery of Shares may be effected through
book-entry transfer at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility, either the Letter of
Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed,
together with any required signature guarantees, or an Agent's Message in lieu
of the Letter of Transmittal, and any other required documents, must, in any
case, be received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the
back cover of this Offer to Purchase on or prior to the Expiration Date, or the
tendering stockholder must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedure
described below.

     DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY'S PROCEDURES DOES NOT CONSTITUTE DELIVERY
TO THE DEPOSITARY. THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF SHARE CERTIFICATES, THE LETTER OF
TRANSMITTAL AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH THE
BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY, IS AT THE OPTION AND RISK OF THE TENDERING
STOCKHOLDER, AND THE DELIVERY WILL BE DEEMED MADE ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY
THE DEPOSITARY (INCLUDING, IN THE CASE OF A BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER, A BOOK-ENTRY
CONFIRMATION). IF DELIVERY IS BY MAIL, REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT
REQUESTED, PROPERLY INSURED, IS RECOMMENDED. IN ALL CASES, SUFFICIENT TIME
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY.

     Signature Guarantees. No signature guarantee is required on the Letter of
Transmittal where Shares are tendered (i) by a registered holder of Shares who
has not completed either the box labeled "Special Delivery Instructions" or the
box labeled "Special Payment Instructions" on the Letter of Transmittal or (ii)
for the account of a bank, broker, dealer, credit union, savings association or
other entity which is a member in good standing of a recognized Medallion
Program approved by the Securities Transfer Association Inc., including the
Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program (STAMP), the Stock Exchange
Medallion Program (SEMP) and the New York Stock Exchange Medallion Signature
Program (MSP), or any other "eligible guarantor institution" as defined in Rule
17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act (each of the foregoing, an "Eligible
Institution"). In all other cases, all signatures on a Letter of Transmittal
must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. See Instruction 1 of the Letter
of Transmittal.

     If a Share Certificate is registered in the name of a person or persons
other than the signer of the Letter of Transmittal, or if payment is to be made
or delivered to, or a Share Certificate for unpurchased Shares is to be issued
or returned to, a person other than the registered holder, then the Share
Certificate must be endorsed or accompanied by an appropriate duly executed
stock power, in either case signed exactly as the name of the registered holder
appears on the Share Certificate, with the signature on such Share Certificate
or stock power guaranteed by an Eligible Institution as provided in the Letter
of Transmittal. See Instructions 1 and 5 of the Letter of Transmittal.

     Guaranteed Delivery. If a stockholder desires to tender Shares pursuant to
the Offer and the Share Certificates evidencing such stockholder's Shares are
not immediately available or such stockholder cannot deliver the Share
Certificates and all other required documents to the Depositary prior to the
Expiration Date, or such stockholder cannot complete the procedure for delivery
by book-entry transfer on a timely basis, the stockholder's Shares may
nevertheless be tendered; provided that all of the following conditions are
satisfied:

          (i) the tender is made by or through an Eligible Institution;

          (ii) the Depositary receives, as described below, a properly completed
     and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery, substantially in the form
     made available by Purchaser, on or prior to the Expiration Date; and

          (iii) the Depositary receives the Share Certificates (or a Book-Entry
     Confirmation) evidencing all tendered Shares, in proper form for transfer,
     in each case together with the Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile
     thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with any required signature
     guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message),
     and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal, within three
     (3) New York Stock Exchange trading days after the date of execution of
     such Notice of Guaranteed Delivery.

     The Notice of Guaranteed Delivery may be delivered by hand or mail or
transmitted by facsimile transmission to the Depositary and must include a
guarantee by an Eligible Institution in the form set forth in the form of Notice
of Guaranteed Delivery made available by Purchaser.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Purchaser will pay for
Shares only after timely receipt by the Depositary of (i) Share Certificates
representing, or Book-Entry Confirmation with respect to, the Shares; (ii) a
properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile
thereof), together with any required signature guarantees (or, in the case of a
book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message); and (iii) any other documents required
by the Letter of Transmittal.

     Determination of Validity. All questions as to the validity, form,
eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance for payment of any tender
of Shares will be determined by Purchaser in its sole discretion, which
determination will be final and binding on all parties. Purchaser reserves the
absolute right to reject any and all tenders determined by it not to be in
proper form or the acceptance for payment of which may, in the opinion of its
counsel, be unlawful. Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Purchaser
also reserves the absolute right to waive any condition of the Offer or any
defect or irregularity in the tender of any Shares of any particular stockholder
of the Company, whether or not similar defects or irregularities are waived in
the case of other stockholders of the Company.

     Subject to the Merger Agreement, Purchaser's interpretation of the terms
and conditions of the Offer (including the Letter of Transmittal and the
instructions thereto) will be final and binding. No tender of Shares will be
deemed to have been validly made until all defects and irregularities have been
cured or waived. None of Parent, Purchaser, or any of their respective
affiliates or assigns, the Depositary, the Information Agent or any other person
will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or irregularities in
tenders or incur any liability for failure to give any such notification.

     Appointment as Proxy. By executing the Letter of Transmittal, a tendering
stockholder irrevocably appoints designees of Purchaser as such stockholder's
agents, attorneys-in-fact and proxies, with full power of substitution, in the
manner set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, to the full extent of such
stockholder's rights with respect to the Shares tendered by such stockholder and
accepted for payment by Purchaser and with respect to any and all other Shares
or other securities or rights issued or issuable in respect of those Shares on
or after the date of this Offer to Purchase. All such powers of attorney and
proxies will be considered irrevocable and coupled with an interest in the
tendered Shares. This appointment will be effective when, and only to the extent
that, Purchaser accepts such Shares for payment. Upon such acceptance for
payment, all other powers of attorney and proxies given by such stockholder with
respect to such Shares and such other securities or rights prior to such
acceptance for payment will be revoked without further action, and no subsequent
powers of attorney or proxies may be given, nor may any subsequent written
consent be executed by such stockholder (and, if given or executed, will not be
deemed to be effective) with respect thereto. The designees of Purchaser will,
with respect to the Shares for which the appointment is effective, be empowered
to exercise all voting and other rights of such stockholder as they, in their
sole discretion, may deem proper at any annual or special meeting of the
Company's stockholders or any adjournment or postponement thereof, or by written
consent in lieu of any such meeting or otherwise. In order for Shares to be
deemed validly tendered, immediately upon the acceptance for payment of such
Shares, Purchaser or its designee must be able to exercise full voting rights to
the extent permitted under applicable law with respect to such Shares.

     Tender Constitutes Binding Agreement. Purchaser's acceptance for payment of
Shares tendered pursuant to any of the procedures described above will
constitute a binding agreement between Purchaser and the tendering stockholder
upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer.

4. WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS.

     Tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable, except that
such Shares may be withdrawn (i) at any time prior to the Expiration Date and
(ii) unless theretofore accepted for payment by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer,
at any time after June 10, 2001 (or such later date as may apply if the Offer is
extended). See -- Terms of the Offer.

     If Purchaser extends the Offer, is delayed in its acceptance for payment of
Shares, or is unable to accept Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer for any
reason, then, without prejudice to Purchaser's rights under the Offer, the
Depositary may, nevertheless, on behalf of Purchaser, retain tendered Shares,
and such Shares may not be withdrawn except to the extent that tendering
stockholders are entitled to and duly exercise withdrawal rights as described in
this Section 4. Any such delay will be by an extension of the Offer to the
extent required by law.

     For a withdrawal to be effective, a written or facsimile transmission
notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the Depositary at one of its
addresses set forth on the back cover page of this Offer to Purchase. Any such
notice of withdrawal must specify the name of the person who tendered the Shares
to be withdrawn, the number of Shares to be withdrawn and (if Share Certificates
have been tendered) the name of the registered holder of such Shares, if
different from that of the person who tendered such Shares. If Share
Certificates representing Shares to be withdrawn have been delivered or
otherwise identified to the Depositary, then, prior to the physical release of
such Share Certificates, the serial numbers shown on such Share Certificates
must be submitted to the Depositary and the signature on the notice of
withdrawal must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution, except in the case of
Shares tendered for the account of an Eligible Institution. If Shares have been
tendered pursuant to the procedure for book-entry transfer as set forth in the
section captioned -- Procedures for Accepting the Offer and Tendering Shares,
the notice of withdrawal must specify the name and number of the account at the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility to be credited with the withdrawn Shares, in which
case a notice of withdrawal will be effective if delivered to the Depositary by
any method of delivery described in the first sentence of this paragraph.

     Withdrawals of Shares may not be rescinded. Any Shares properly withdrawn
will be considered not validly tendered for purposes of the Offer. However,
withdrawn Shares may be tendered again at any time prior to the Expiration Date
by following one of the procedures described in the section captioned
- -- Procedures for Accepting the Offer and Tendering Shares.

     All questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of
any notice of withdrawal will be determined by Purchaser, in its sole
discretion, which determination will be final and binding. None of Parent,
Purchaser, or their respective affiliates or assigns, the Depositary, the
Information Agent or any other person will be under any duty to give
notification of any defects or irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or
incur any liability for failure to give any such notification.

5. MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS.

     The following is a summary of the material United States federal income tax
consequences to the Company's stockholders of the sale of Shares pursuant to the
Offer and the exchange of Shares for cash pursuant to the Merger. This summary
does not purport to be a description of all tax consequences that may be
relevant to the Company's stockholders, and assumes an understanding of tax
rules of general application. It does not address special rules which may apply
to the Company's stockholders based on their tax status, individual
circumstances or other factors unrelated to the Offer or the Merger. All
stockholders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the
particular tax consequences to them (including the application and effect of any
state, local or foreign income and other tax laws) of the Offer and the Merger.

     The receipt of cash pursuant to the Offer or the Merger will constitute a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and may also constitute a taxable
transaction under applicable state, local, foreign income and other tax laws.
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a tendering stockholder would generally
recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount
of cash received by the stockholder pursuant to the Offer or the Merger and the
stockholder's tax basis for the Shares tendered and purchased pursuant to the
Offer or exchanged pursuant to the Merger. If tendered Shares are held by a
tendering stockholder as capital assets, that gain or loss will be capital gain
or loss. Any such capital gain or loss will be long term if, as of the date of
the disposition of the Shares, the tendering stockholder held such Shares for
more than one year or will be short term if, as of such date, the stockholder
held such Shares for one year or less.

     Backup U.S. Federal Income Tax Withholding. Under U.S. federal income tax
law, the amount of any payments made by the Depositary to stockholders of the
Company (other than certain exempt stockholders, including, among others, all
corporations and certain foreign individuals), pursuant to the Offer or the
Merger may be subject to backup withholding tax at a rate of 31%. To avoid
backup withholding tax with respect to payments made pursuant to the Offer or
the Merger, each stockholder must provide the Depositary with such stockholder's
correct taxpayer identification number or social security number and certify
under penalties of perjury that such stockholder is not subject to backup
federal income tax withholding by completing the Substitute Form W-9 in the
Letter of Transmittal. If backup withholding applies with respect to a
stockholder or if a stockholder fails to deliver a completed Substitute Form W-9
to the Depositary or otherwise establish an exemption, the Depositary is
required to withhold 31% of any payments made to such stockholder. See
Instruction 8 of the Letter of Transmittal.

     The foregoing discussion may not be applicable to certain types of
stockholders of the Company, including stockholders who acquired Shares through
the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation, individuals
who are not citizens or residents of the United States, foreign corporations, or
entities that are otherwise subject to special tax treatment under the Code
(such as insurance companies, tax-exempt entities and regulated investment
companies).

10. SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS.

     The Offer is not conditioned upon any financing arrangements.

     Parent and Purchaser estimate that the total amount of funds required to
purchase all of the outstanding Shares that Parent or its affiliates do not own
pursuant to the Offer and Merger and to pay related fees and expenses will be an
aggregate maximum amount of approximately $110 million.

     Facilities and the Use of Proceeds.  Parent and Purchaser expect to obtain
debt financing in an aggregate maximum amount of up to approximately $200
million. The debt financing will be used to partially fund the Offer, the Merger
and the related fees and expenses and partially to fund Parent's ongoing working
capital requirements. The funds necessary to purchase the Shares will be
provided to Parent and Purchaser by The Chase Manhattan Bank ("Chase") in the
form of a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility") available in an
amount of up to approximately $200 million. Chase has committed to provide the
Revolving Facility pursuant to a commitment letter, dated March 30, 2001 (the
"Commitment Letter").

     Rates and Rate Index.  The Commitment Letter provides that the applicable
interest rate will be either (1) the ABR (as described below) or (2) the
Eurodollar Rate (as described below) plus 1.0%. The ABR means the highest of (i)
the rate of interest publicly announced by Chase as its prime rate in effect at
its principal office in New York City, (ii) the secondary market rate for
three-month certificates of deposit (adjusted for statutory reserve
requirements) plus 1% and (iii) the federal funds effective rate from time to
time plus 0.5%. The Eurodollar Rate means the rate (adjusted for statutory
reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities) for eurodollar deposits for a
period equal to one, two, three or six months (as selected by the borrower)
appearing on Page 3750 of the Telerate screen.

     Maturities.  The Revolving Facility has a final maturity date of six months
from the date of the closing.

     Guaranties.  The Revolving Facility will be guaranteed by each of Parent's
direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries.

     Interest Payments, Mandatory Prepayments and Default Rate.  With respect to
the Revolving Facility, interest must be paid quarterly in arrears or, in the
case of Eurodollar Rate advances, at the maturity of the applicable interest
period or, in the case of interest periods in excess of three months, every
three months. The net proceeds of (i) any sale or issuance of stock, (ii) any
incurrence of debt for borrowed money or (iii) any sale of assets outside the
ordinary course of business must be applied to reduce the Revolving Facility.
The default rate is 2% over the rate of interest.

     Other Terms, Conditions, and Covenants.  Among other conditions to be
negotiated, the Commitment Letter from Chase is subject to the following
conditions: (i) there not occurring or becoming known to Chase any event,
development or circumstance that has had or would reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on the business, operations, property, condition
(financial or otherwise) or prospects of the Parent and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or the Company, (ii) Chase not becoming aware of any information or
other matter affecting Parent, the Company or the Offer and the Merger that in
Chase's judgment is inconsistent in a material and adverse manner with any such
information or other matter disclosed to Chase prior to the date of the
Commitment Letter, (iii) there not having occurred a material disruption of or
material adverse change in financial, banking or capital market conditions that,
in Chase's good faith judgment, would materially impair the syndication of the
Revolving Facility, (iv) Chase's satisfaction that prior to and during the
syndication of the Revolving Facility there shall be no competing offering,
placement or arrangement of any debt securities or bank financing (excepting any
bank financing arranged by JP Morgan to replace the Revolving Facility) by or on
behalf of Parent or any affiliate thereof, (v) the negotiation, execution and
delivery on or before the earlier of the consummation of the Offer and May 31,
2001 of definitive documentation with respect to the Revolving Facility
satisfactory to Chase and (vi) the receipt of requisite third party approvals.

     The Commitment Letter provides that Parent will provide periodic financial
statements and projections, compliance certificates and other documents that
Chase may request. Parent also is required to comply with certain financial
covenants, such as a minimum EBITDA for the most recent twelve-month period
ending prior to the closing of the Revolving Facility, which will be calculated
and tested quarterly on a consolidated basis using generally accepted accounting
principles, and which will have compliance levels as set forth in the final
documentation. Additionally, Parent will be subject to other covenants that are
customary for facilities of the type extended by Chase.

     Representations and Warranties and Indemnity.  Parent will provide to Chase
all customary and appropriate representations and warranties. Parent also will
indemnify Chase and its respective directors, officers, agents, and employees
from and against all losses, claims, damages, expenses, or liabilities incurred
in connection with the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter or the
proposed use of proceeds of such financing other than with respect to claims or
damages arising from Chase's own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

     Fees and Expenses.  The fees for the Revolving Facility include (i) a
structuring and arrangement fee of $500,000 payable on the earlier of the
closing date or the termination of the Commitment Letter, (ii) a funding fee in
an amount equal to 0.25% of the portion of the Revolving Facility allocated to
Chase on the closing date, payable on the closing date, (iii) an administrative
fee in the amount of $25,000, payable on the closing date, (iv) funding or
upfront fees payable to other lenders having allocated portions of the Revolving
Facility, in amounts to be negotiated, (v) a commitment fee of 0.25% per annum
payable to Chase for the period from the date of the Commitment Letter to the
date of closing, payable on the earlier of the closing date or the termination
of the Commitment Letter and (vi) a commitment fee of 0.25% per annum calculated
on the unused portion of the Revolving Facility and payable quarterly in
arrears.

     Parent also will bear all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees and
appraisal and audit costs, incurred by Chase with respect to the completion of
due diligence, negotiation, documentation and the closing of the Revolving
Facility.

     The foregoing summary of the Revolving Facility is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the Commitment Letter, which is included as Exhibit (b)
to the Schedule TO relating to the Offer.

11. THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Merger
Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Appendix B to this Offer to Purchase.
The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement,
which is deemed to be incorporated by reference herein. The following summary
may not contain all of the information important to you, and accordingly, we
encourage you to read the entire Merger Agreement. Capitalized terms used in the
following summary and not otherwise defined in this Offer to Purchase have the
meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement.

     The Offer. The Merger Agreement provides that Purchaser will commence the
Offer and that, upon the terms and subject to prior satisfaction or waiver of
the Minimum Tender Condition and the other conditions of the Offer, as set forth
in the section captioned -- Certain Conditions of the Offer, Purchaser will
purchase all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.
The Merger Agreement further provides that, without the prior written consent of
the Company, no change in the terms and conditions of the Offer may be made that
(i) increases the Minimum Tender Condition; (ii) changes the form of
consideration to be paid; (iii) decreases the price per Share or the number of
Shares sought in the Offer; (iv) imposes additional conditions to the Offer; (v)
changes the Expiration Date, except as set forth in the Merger Agreement; or
(vi) is adverse to the holders of the Shares.

     Without the consent of the Company, Parent shall cause Purchaser to (i)
extend the Offer for one or more additional periods of ten business days each,
if any conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied (other than conditions
which are not capable of being satisfied) or waived; or (ii) extend the Offer
for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of
the SEC or staff thereof applicable to the Offer or for any period required by
any other law applicable to the Offer. Furthermore, if all the conditions to the
Offer are satisfied or waived but the number of Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn is less than ninety percent (90%) of the then outstanding number of
Shares, without the consent of the Company, Parent may cause Purchaser to: (x)
extend the Offer for up to two additional periods of five Business Days each
beyond the latest Expiration Date; provided that Purchaser shall accept for
payment and promptly pay for Shares that have been validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer at the earliest time permitted by law after the
earlier of (1) the expiration of any such five-Business Day period at the end of
which such ninety percent (90%) threshold is reached or (2) the expiration of
the last such five-Business Day period; and/or (y) extend the Offer for a
subsequent offering period (as provided in Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act)
of up to twenty days in order to acquire over ninety percent (90%) of the
outstanding Shares; provided that Purchaser shall accept for payment and
promptly pay for Shares that have been validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer, prior to the date of extension, and otherwise meets the
requirements of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act.

     Directors. The Merger Agreement provides that promptly upon the purchase of
and payment for the Shares pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall be entitled to
designate such number of directors (rounded up to the next whole number) on the
Company Board that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on
the Company Board (giving effect to the election of any additional directors
pursuant to the Merger Agreement) multiplied by (ii) the percentage that the
number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent and/or Purchaser (including Shares
accepted for payment) bears to the total number of Shares outstanding. The
Company has agreed to take all action necessary to cause Parent's designees to
be elected or appointed to the Company Board, including increasing the number of
directors and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors. At such
time, to the extent requested by Parent, the Company will use its best efforts
to cause Purchaser's designees to constitute the number of members (rounded up
to the next whole number) on each committee of the Company Board and on each
board of directors of each subsidiary of the Company (and

each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as such individuals
represent on the Company Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties will
use their best efforts to ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, the Company
will retain at least two directors who were directors of the Company on the date
of the Merger Agreement (the "Continuing Directors"); provided, however, that if
there are fewer than two Continuing Directors for any reason, the Continuing
Director or other directors of the Company, as the case may be, shall designate
a person or persons to fill such vacancy or vacancies. The Company's obligation
to appoint Parent's designees to the Company Board is subject to certain
provisions of the Exchange Act. From and after the time that Parent's designees
are elected or appointed to the Company Board until the Effective Time, the
approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required to
authorize: (i) any termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company; (ii) any
amendment of the Merger Agreement requiring action by the Company Board; (iii)
any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action of Parent or
Acquisition under the Merger Agreement; (iv) any waiver of compliance with any
of the agreements or conditions of the Merger Agreement for the benefit of the
Company; (v) any consent or action by the Company Board under the Merger
Agreement; and (vi) any other action of the Company in connection with the
Merger Agreement which adversely affects the holders of Shares (other than
Parent or Purchaser) or holders of Stock Options (as defined below).

     The Merger. The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, Purchaser will be
merged with and into the Company. Following the Merger, the separate existence
of Purchaser will cease and the Company will continue as the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). The Company, as the Surviving
Corporation, will succeed to and assume all of the rights and obligations of
both the Company and Purchaser. Also following the Merger, the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Purchaser will be the Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and the directors and officers of
Purchaser will become the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation.
The Merger Agreement provides that the closing of the Merger will take place as
promptly as practicable but in no event later than the second business day after
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Merger. At the closing, the
Company, Parent and Purchaser will file the necessary documents with Delaware
public officials to make the Merger effective.

     Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, each Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding (i) Shares held
by Parent or Purchaser or any subsidiary or affiliate of Parent or Purchaser,
(ii) Shares held by any of the Company's subsidiaries, (iii) Shares held in the
treasury of the Company and (iv) Shares for which appraisal rights are properly
demanded and perfected under Section 262 of the DGCL) will, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or the
holder, be converted into and become the right to receive the highest price paid
per Share pursuant to the Offer, without interest. At the Effective Time, (i)
Shares held by Parent or Purchaser or any subsidiary or affiliate of Parent or
Purchaser and Shares held by any of the Company's subsidiaries and (iii) Shares
held in the treasury of the Company (excluding Shares held in any Company
benefit plan) will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to
exist, and no cash or other consideration will be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor. Moreover, at the Effective Time, each share of common stock
of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will
be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

     Company Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase Shares (a "Stock Option" or collectively "Stock Options") issued
pursuant to the Company's 1995 Stock Option Plan, as amended and restated, the
Company's Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors, as amended and restated
(together, the "Option Plans"), or any other plan or instrument, whether vested
or unvested, will be canceled in exchange for a single lump sum cash payment
(less any applicable income or employment tax withholding) payable by Parent at
the Effective Time equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares subject to
any Stock Option vested at or immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
any Stock Option which becomes vested on or prior to the Effective Time in
accordance with the terms of an automatic acceleration provision in existence as
of the date of the Merger Agreement and disclosed to Parent), multiplied by (ii)
the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such
Stock Option. This cash payment will be paid only if the exercise price per
Share of the Stock Option is less than the Merger Consideration.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company has agreed to use its best efforts
to take all actions necessary to effectuate the foregoing.

     Representations and Warranties. The Merger Agreement contains customary
representations and warranties of the parties. These include customary
representations and warranties of the Company with respect to, among other
matters, organization and qualification, subsidiaries, capitalization,
authority, SEC filings, financial statements, governmental approvals,
litigation, compliance with laws, employee matters, environmental matters, tax
matters, property and intellectual property matters. The Merger Agreement also
contains customary representations and warranties of Parent and Purchaser with
respect to, among other matters, organization, authority and financing. The
representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement expire at the
Effective Time of the Merger.

     Conduct of Business. From the date of the Merger Agreement until the
Effective Time, unless Parent consents in writing, and except as contemplated by
the Merger Agreement or in a Schedule attached thereto, neither the Company nor
any of its subsidiaries will: (i) amend its Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws (or other similar governing instrument); (ii) issue, sell or deliver any
shares of any class of capital stock or any other securities or equity
equivalents, except for the issuance and sale of Shares pursuant to Stock
Options previously granted or the issuance and sale of securities by a
subsidiary of the Company to any entity which is wholly owned by the Company;
(iii) take any action to accelerate the exercisability or vesting of Stock
Options (except to the extent that such Stock Options automatically accelerate
under their existing terms), permit cash payments to holders of Stock Options

existing terms of such Stock Options; (iv) split, combine or reclassify any
shares of its capital stock; (v) declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other
distribution in respect of its capital stock; (vi) redeem or otherwise acquire

Company or its subsidiaries; (xii) mortgage or pledge any of its material
assets, tangible or intangible, or create or suffer to exist any material lien
thereupon; (xiii) enter into, adopt, amend or terminate any employee benefit
agreement, trust, plan, fund or other arrangement in any manner or increase in

employee or pay any benefit not contemplated by any plan and arrangement as in
effect as of the date hereof, except as otherwise permitted by the Merger
Agreement; (xiv) acquire, sell, lease or dispose of any assets in any single
transaction or series of related transactions having a fair market value in
excess of $100,000 in the aggregate; (xv) change any of the accounting
principles or practices used by it; (xvi) revalue in any respect any of its
assets including without limitation writing down the value of inventory or
writing-off notes or accounts receivable; (xvii) acquire any corporation,
partnership or other business organization or division thereof or any equity
interest therein; (xviii) enter into any contract or agreement that would be

any research and/or development project that is currently ongoing, except as

the Shares, except as otherwise permitted by the Merger Agreement; (xxiv) take
any action outside of its ordinary course of business, consistent with past
practices; or (xxv) otherwise take or agree to take any of the foregoing
actions.

     Stockholder Approval. If Company stockholder approval of the Merger is
required by law, the Company has agreed to, as promptly as practicable following
the expiration of the Offer, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
special meeting of its stockholders (a "Special Meeting") for the purpose of
obtaining such approval. If a Special Meeting is required, the Company will
prepare and file a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC and promptly respond
to any comments of the SEC or its staff. The Company also will cause a
definitive proxy statement to be prepared and disseminated to the Company's
stockholders. Subject to its fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Company
Board will recommend to its stockholders that they vote in favor of the Merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent or Purchaser acquires beneficial
ownership of at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Shares, the
parties shall take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to
become effective as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer
without a Special Meeting in accordance with the short-form merger provisions of
Section 253 of the DGCL. Parent has agreed to cause all Shares owned by Parent
and Purchaser to be voted in favor of approval of the Merger.

     Access to Information. The Merger Agreement provides that from the date of
the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company will, and will cause
each of its subsidiaries to, give Parent and its representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to its officers, employees, properties,
books and records, and will furnish promptly to Parent and its representatives
financial and operating data and other information concerning the business of
the Company and its subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request upon
reasonable notice thereof.

     Confidentiality. Parent, Purchaser and the Company have mutually agreed,
subject to certain exceptions, to keep confidential all confidential information
and documents ("Confidential Information") exchanged between each other in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and to
use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

     Further Actions. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company has agreed to use all of their respective best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to complete and make effective the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable, including, without limitation, (i)
cooperating in the preparation and filing of the Offer Documents and any other
filings that may be required under governmental legal requirements; (ii)
obtaining all consents necessary, proper or advisable for the completion of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (iii) contesting any legal
proceeding relating to the Merger; (iv) executing any additional instruments
necessary to complete the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (v)
taking any additional action after the Effective Time necessary to carry out the
purposes of the Merger Agreement; and (vi) causing the Effective Time to occur
as soon as practicable after the completion of the Offer.

     Inquiries and Negotiations. The Company has agreed to immediately cease,
and cause its subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees,
representatives and agents to immediately cease, any discussions or negotiations
with any parties with respect to any Third Party Acquisition (as defined below).
Furthermore, the Company will not, and will not authorize or permit any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
representatives or agents to, directly or indirectly, encourage, solicit,
participate in or initiate discussions or negotiations with or provide any
non-public information to any person or group (other than Parent and Purchaser
or any designees of Parent and Purchaser) concerning any Third Party
Acquisition. The term "Third Party Acquisition" means (i) the acquisition of the
Company by merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, purchase of stock or assets or otherwise by any person (which
includes a "person" as such term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange
Act) other than Parent, Purchaser or any affiliate thereof (a "Third Party");
(ii) the acquisition by a Third Party of all, or a material portion of all, the
Company's assets; (iii) the acquisition by a Third Party of fifteen percent
(15%) or more of the outstanding Shares; (iv) the adoption by the Company of a
plan of liquidation or the declaration or payment of an extraordinary dividend;
(v) the repurchase by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of more than
fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding Shares; or (vi) the acquisition by the
Company or any subsidiary by merger, purchase of stock or assets, joint venture
or otherwise of a direct or

indirect ownership interest or investment in any business whose annual revenues,
annual net income or total assets is equal or greater than fifteen percent (15%)
of the annual revenues, annual net income or total assets of the Company.

     The Merger Agreement also requires the Company to notify Parent promptly in
the event that the Company receives any proposal or inquiry concerning a Third
Party Acquisition, including the material terms and conditions thereof and the
identity of the party submitting such proposal, and shall keep Parent updated on
material developments affecting such proposal or inquiry concerning the Third
Party Acquisition. Prior to furnishing any information or engaging in additional
discussions with respect to a Third Party Acquisition, the Company shall obtain
from the Third Party an executed confidentiality and standstill agreement
substantially similar to the confidentiality and standstill provisions to which
the Company and Parent are subject. If, however, the Company obtains from the
Third Party a confidentiality agreement without standstill provisions
substantially similar to the standstill provisions pursuant to which the Parent
is bound, then Parent will, to the extent of the difference, be relieved of
compliance with the standstill provisions to which it would otherwise be
subject. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall provide Parent with
not less than five business days' notice and pay to Parent all amounts due to
Parent under the Merger Agreement prior to the execution by the Company of any
agreement (excluding any confidentiality and standstill agreement) with respect
to a Third Party Acquisition or a public announcement relating to the approval
of a Third Party Acquisition.

     If required by the fiduciary duties of the Company Board, as determined in
good faith by the Company Board after consultation with legal counsel, the
Company's Board of Directors may withdraw its recommendation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or approve or recommend a Superior Proposal
(as defined below), but in each case only (i) after providing written notice to
Parent advising Parent that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal,
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and
identifying the person making such Superior Proposal and (ii) if Parent does
not, within five business days after Parent's receipt of such notice of a
Superior Proposal, make an offer which the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with, and duly considering the advice of, a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be as favorable to the Company's
stockholders as the Superior Proposal. The term "Superior Proposal" means any
bona fide Third Party Acquisition proposal which the Company Board by a majority
vote determines in good faith (after consultation with, and duly considering the
advice of, a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be more
favorable to the Company's stockholders than the Offer and the Merger.

     If the Merger is not completed for any one of the following reasons: (i)
the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company Board because the Company
Board has entered into or publicly announced its intention to enter into an
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal; (ii) the Merger Agreement is
terminated by Parent and Purchaser because (A) the Company Board has withdrawn,
modified or changed its approval or recommendation of the Offer, the Merger
Agreement or the Merger or has recommended any Third Party Acquisition, or (B)
any Third Party has become the beneficial owner of fifty percent (50%) or more
of the outstanding Shares; (iii) the Merger Agreement is terminated by Parent
and Purchaser because a representation or warranty made by the Company in the
Merger Agreement is not true and correct in all material respects and has
resulted in, or is reasonably likely to result in, the failure to satisfy any of
the conditions to the Offer, or the Company has failed to observe or perform any
of its material obligations under the Merger Agreement, and within twelve months
thereafter the Company enters into an agreement with respect to a Third Party
Acquisition or a Third Party Acquisition occurs involving any party with whom
the Company negotiated or provided information to prior to the termination of
the Merger Agreement; or (iv) the Merger Agreement is terminated because the
purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer has not been completed on or prior to
June 30, 2001 at a time when the Minimum Tender Condition is not satisfied,
there is outstanding a publicly announced offer by a Third Party to complete a
Third Party Acquisition, and no other condition to the Offer is unsatisfied, and
within twelve months thereafter the Company enters into an agreement with
respect to a Third Party Acquisition or a Third Party Acquisition occurs
involving any party with whom the Company negotiated or provided information to
prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement; then the Company will be
obligated to pay to Parent and Purchaser within five business days following the
occurrence of any of the foregoing, a fee of $4,000,000. In addition, if the
Merger Agreement is

terminated pursuant to either clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) in the preceding
sentence, then the Company will be obligated to reimburse Parent, Purchaser and
their affiliates for all out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred by any of
them, up to a maximum of $2,000,000. In no event will the Company be liable for
termination fees and expenses in excess of $5,000,000.

     Notification of Certain Matters. Each of the Company and Parent has agreed
to give prompt notice to the other of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur,
of any event that would likely cause any of their respective representations or
warranties to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) any material failure of the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it under the Merger Agreement.

     Indemnification. The Merger Agreement requires Parent to provide, until the
sixth anniversary of the closing date of the Merger, to the directors and
officers who currently are covered by the Company's existing insurance and
indemnification policy an insurance and indemnification policy that provides
coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time that is no less
favorable than the Company's existing policy or, if substantially equivalent
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that
Parent shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the coverage in excess
of 150% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of the
Merger Agreement. After the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who has been prior to the date of
the Merger Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or
officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries against all losses, claims,
damages, costs, expenses (including without limitation reasonable counsel fees
and expenses), settlement, payments or liabilities arising out of or in
connection with the fact that such person is or was an officer or director of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or pertaining to the Merger Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, in each case to the
fullest extent required or permitted under applicable law or under the Surviving
Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or indemnification
agreements.

     Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all
such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Shares (including
derivative securities with respect to the Shares) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

     Publicity. The Company, Parent and Purchaser agree that they will not issue
any press release or make any other public announcement concerning the Merger
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby without the prior consent of
the other party, except such public disclosure required by law or as reasonably
determined to be prudent upon the good faith exercise of the fiduciary duties of
the board of directors of any party hereunder. In any event, an announcing party
must notify the other parties to the Merger Agreement of the material details of
any release or statement at least one business day prior to the public
announcement.

     New Jersey Environmental Approvals. The Company will comply with all
obligations under New Jersey's Site Recovery Act and the Brownfield Contaminated
Site Remediation Act and all applicable regulations, orders or directives
adopted thereunder or pertaining thereto (collectively, "ISRA"). In particular,
the Company will seek to obtain, as promptly as practicable, all approvals by
the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (the "NJDEP") under ISRA
necessary to complete the Merger. In the alternative, the Company may elect to
seek a determination from the NJDEP that compliance with ISRA is not required.

     Employee Benefit Matters. The Merger Agreement provides that from and after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will honor all material
employment, severance, consulting and salary continuation agreements between the
Company and any current or former director or executive officer of the Company.
For a period of not less than two years following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will provide to current and former employees of the
Company employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, not less favorable than
those provided to such employees immediately before the Effective Time.

     Conditions to the Merger. The respective obligations of Company and
Purchaser to complete the Merger are subject to the fulfillment of the following
conditions: (i) the Merger Agreement having been duly approved by the holders of
the outstanding Shares, if required, in accordance with applicable law and the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company; (ii) no statute, rule,
regulation, executive order, decree, ruling or injunction having been enacted,
entered, promulgated or enforced by any United States court or United States

having terminated or expired; (iv) any applicable approval under ISRA having
been obtained from the NJDEP; and (v) Purchaser having accepted for payment and
paid for Shares pursuant to the Offer.

merger abandoned at any time prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the
Offer as follows: (i) by mutual written consent of Parent, Purchaser and the
Company; (ii) by Parent and Purchaser or by the Company, if either (A) any court
of competent jurisdiction or other governmental entity has issued a final order,
decree or ruling that restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the Offer or the
Merger, or (B) the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer has not been
completed on or prior to June 30, 2001; (iii) by the Company Board, if (A) the
Company Board has entered into or publicly announced its intention to enter into
an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, (B) any representation or
warranty made by Parent or Purchaser in the Merger Agreement is not true and

result in, the failure to satisfy any of the conditions to the Offer, or Parent
or Purchaser has failed to observe or perform any of its material obligations
under the Merger Agreement (C) Parent or Purchaser has terminated the Offer, or
the Offer has expired without Parent or Purchaser purchasing any Shares, or (D)
Parent or Purchaser has failed to commence the Offer on or prior to ten business
days following the date of initial public announcement of the Offer or has
failed to pay for the Shares in accordance with the terms of the Offer; or (iv)
by Parent and Purchaser, if (A) an event has occurred or failed to occur, which
event if occurring or failing to occur after the commencement of the Offer would
result in a failure to satisfy any of the conditions to the Offer, and Parent or
Purchaser fails to commence the Offer on or prior to ten business days following
the date of initial public announcement of the Offer, (B) the Company Board has
withdrawn, modified or changed its approval or recommendation of the Offer, the
Merger Agreement or the Merger or has recommended any Third Party Acquisition,
(C) any Third Party has become the beneficial owner of fifty percent (50%) or

respects and has resulted in, or is reasonably likely to result in, the failure
to satisfy any of the conditions to the Offer, or the Company has failed to
observe or perform any of its material obligations under the Merger Agreement.
In the event of termination and abandonment of the Merger Agreement, the Merger
will become void and no party will have any further liability to any other
party, except for confidentiality obligations, amounts owed under the section
captioned -- The Merger Agreement; Inquiries and Negotiations and liability for
the breach of obligations under the Merger Agreement.

     Amendment. The Merger Agreement may be amended by the Company, Parent and
Purchaser at any time before or after approval, if necessary, of the Merger by
the stockholders of the Company. After obtaining stockholder approval, however,
no amendment may be made which would require stockholder approval under
applicable law without obtaining such stockholder approval.

     Waiver. Each of the Company and Parent may (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of or any document
provided by the other party, or (iii) waive compliance by the other party with
any of the agreements or conditions contained in the Merger Agreement.

12. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.

     The Merger Agreement provides that from the date of the Merger Agreement
until the Effective Time, unless the Parent has consented in writing, the
Company may not declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other distribution
(whether in cash, stock or property or any combination thereof) in respect of
its capital stock, make any other actual, constructive or deemed distribution in
respect of its capital stock or otherwise make any payments to stockholders in
their capacity as such, or redeem or otherwise acquire any of its

securities or any securities of any of its subsidiaries, except for the payment
of dividends or distributions by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to the
Company or another wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

13. CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the Merger Agreement,
and in addition to and not in limitation of Purchaser's rights to extend and
amend the Offer (subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement), and subject to
any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC including Rule 14e-l(c) under
the Exchange Act relating to Purchaser's obligation to pay for or return any
tendered Shares after termination of the Offer, Purchaser shall not be required
to accept for payment or pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, if (i)
the Minimum Tender Condition has not been satisfied; (ii) any applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act or similar statutes or regulations has not expired or
terminated; (iii) any applicable approval under ISRA has not been obtained from
the NJDEP; or (iv) at any time after the date of the Merger Agreement and before
the Expiration Date, any of the following events shall occur and be continuing:

          (a) there has been instituted or pending any action, suit or
     proceeding, or any statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order or injunction
     promulgated, entered, enforced, enacted, issued or deemed applicable to the
     Offer or the Merger by any domestic or foreign court or other governmental
     entity which directly or indirectly (i) prohibits, or makes illegal, the
     acceptance for payment, payment for or purchase of Shares or the completion
     of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the
     Merger Agreement, (ii) renders Purchaser unable to accept for payment, pay
     for or purchase some or all of the Shares or (iii) imposes material
     limitations on the ability of Parent effectively to exercise full rights of
     ownership of the Shares, including the right to vote the Shares purchased
     by it on all matters properly presented to the Company's stockholders;

          (b)(i) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
     the Merger Agreement are not true and correct (except to the extent that
     the aggregate of all breaches thereof would not have a material adverse
     effect on the Company) at the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the
     completion of the Offer with the same effect as if made at and as of the
     completion of the Offer, (ii) the Company has failed to perform, in any
     material respect, its covenants and obligations contained in the Merger
     Agreement, which failure to perform has not been cured within the earlier
     of ten business days after Parent or Purchaser gives written notice thereof
     to the Company or the Expiration Date, or (iii) there has occurred since
     the date of the Merger Agreement any events or changes which have a
     material adverse effect on the Company; or

          (c) all other necessary consents and approvals from governmental
     entities have not been obtained on terms and conditions reasonably
     satisfactory to Parent;

which, with respect to any of the foregoing clauses (a), (b) or (c), in the good
faith judgment of Parent or Purchaser, in any such case, and provided that
Parent and Purchaser have performed all of their respective obligations under
the Merger Agreement relating to such condition, makes it inadvisable to proceed
with the Offer or the acceptance for payment of or payment for the Shares; or

          (d)(i) a tender offer or exchange offer for fifteen percent (15%) or
     more of the outstanding Shares is commenced, and the Company Board, within
     ten business days after such tender offer or exchange offer is so
     commenced, either fails to recommend against acceptance of such tender
     offer or exchange offer by its stockholders or takes no position with
     respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its
     stockholders; or (ii) any Third Party has entered into a definitive
     agreement or agreement in principle with the Company with respect to a
     Third Party Acquisition;

          (e) the Company Board has withdrawn, or modified or changed in a
     manner adverse to Parent and Purchaser (including by amendment of the
     Schedule 14D-9), its recommendation of the Merger Agreement, the Offer or
     the Merger, or recommended another proposal or offer, or the Company Board
     has resolved to do any of the foregoing; or

          (f) the Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
     terms.

     The conditions set forth above are for the sole benefit of Parent and
Purchaser and may be waived by Parent and Purchaser, in whole or in part at any
time and from time to time, in the sole discretion of Parent and Purchaser. The
failure by Parent and Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing
rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall
be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.

14. CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS; REGULATORY APPROVALS.

     General. Purchaser is not aware of any material pending legal proceeding
relating to the Offer. Based on its examination of publicly available
information filed by the Company with the SEC and other publicly available
information concerning the Company, Purchaser is not aware of any governmental
license or regulatory permit that appears to be material to the Company's
business that might be adversely affected by Purchaser's purchase of the Shares
as contemplated herein or, except as set forth below, of any approval or other
action by any government or governmental administrative or regulatory authority
or agency, domestic or foreign, that would be required for the purchase or
ownership of Shares by Purchaser or Parent as contemplated herein. Should any
such approval or other action be required, Purchaser currently contemplates
that, except as described below under the section captioned -- Certain Legal
Matters; Regulatory Approvals; State Takeover Statutes, such approval or other
action will be sought. There can be no assurance that any such approval or other
action, if needed, would be obtained or would be obtained without substantial
conditions or that if such approval were not obtained or such other action were
not taken, adverse consequences might not result to the Company's business, or
certain parts of the Company's business might not have to be disposed of, any of
which could cause Purchaser to elect to terminate the Offer without the purchase
of Shares thereunder under certain conditions. See -- Certain Conditions of the
Offer.

     State Takeover Statutes. A number of states (including Delaware, where the
Company is incorporated) have adopted laws which purport, to varying degrees, to
apply to attempts to acquire corporations that are incorporated in, or which
have substantial assets, stockholders, principal executive offices or principal
places of business or whose business operations otherwise have substantial
economic effects in, such states. Except as described herein, Purchaser does not
know whether any of these laws will, by their terms, apply to the Offer or the
Merger or any other business combination between Purchaser or any of its
affiliates and the Company. To the extent that certain provisions of these laws
purport to apply to the Offer or the Merger or other business combination,
Purchaser believes that there are reasonable bases for contesting such laws. In
1982, in Edgar v. MITE Corp., the Supreme Court of the United States invalidated
on constitutional grounds the Illinois Business Takeover Statute which, as a
matter of state securities law, made takeovers of corporations meeting certain
requirements more difficult. However, in 1987 in CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of
America, the Supreme Court held that the State of Indiana could, as a matter of
corporate law, constitutionally disqualify a potential acquiror from voting
Shares of a target corporation without the prior approval of the remaining
stockholders where, among other matters, the corporation is incorporated in, and
has a substantial number of stockholders in, the state. Subsequently, in TLX
Acquisition Corp. v. Telex Corp., a Federal District Court in Oklahoma ruled
that the Oklahoma statutes were unconstitutional insofar as they apply to
corporations incorporated outside Oklahoma in that they would subject such
corporations to inconsistent regulations. Similarly, in Tyson Foods, Inc. v.
McReynolds, a Federal District Court in Tennessee ruled that four Tennessee
takeover statutes were unconstitutional as applied to corporations incorporated
outside Tennessee. This decision was affirmed by the United States Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

     Section 203 of the DGCL, in general, prevents an "interested stockholder"
(including a person who owns or has the right to acquire fifteen percent (15%)
or more of the corporation's outstanding voting stock) from engaging in a
"business combination" (defined to include mergers and certain other actions)
with a Delaware corporation for a period of three years following the date such
person became an interested stockholder. The Company Board has taken all
appropriate action so that neither Parent nor Purchaser is or will be considered
an "interested stockholder" pursuant to Section 203 of the DGCL.

     Neither Parent nor Purchaser has determined whether any other state
takeover laws or regulations will by their terms apply to the Offer or the
Merger, and except as set forth above, neither Purchaser nor Parent have
attempted to comply with any state takeover statutes in connection with the
Offer or the Merger. Purchaser

and Parent reserve the right to challenge the validity or applicability of any
state law allegedly applicable to the Offer or the Merger, and nothing in this
Offer to Purchase nor any action taken by Parent or Purchaser in connection with
the Offer is intended as a waiver of that right. In the event it is asserted
that one or more state takeover statutes is applicable to the Offer or the
Merger and an appropriate court does not determine that it is inapplicable or
invalid as applied to the Offer or the Merger, Purchaser might be required to
file certain information with, or to receive approvals from, the relevant state
authorities or holders of Shares, and Purchaser might be unable to accept for
payment or pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, or be delayed in
continuing or consummating the Offer or the Merger. In such case, Purchaser may
not be obligated to accept for payment or pay for any tendered Shares.
See -- Certain Conditions of the Offer.

     Antitrust in the United States. Under the HSR Act and the rules that have
been promulgated thereunder by the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), certain
acquisition transactions may not be consummated unless certain information has
been furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the
"Antitrust Division") and the FTC and certain waiting period requirements have
been satisfied. The purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer is subject to such
requirements.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the HSR Act, Purchaser expects to file a
Notification and Report Form with respect to the Offer and Merger with the
Antitrust Division and the FTC on or about April 10, 2001. The waiting period
applicable to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer is scheduled to
expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, fifteen days after such filing.
However, prior to such time, the Antitrust Division or the FTC may extend the
waiting period by requesting additional information or documentary material
relevant to the Offer from Purchaser. If such a request is made, the waiting
period will be extended until 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the tenth day
after substantial compliance by Purchaser with such request. Thereafter, such
waiting period can be extended only by court order.

     Any extension of the waiting period will not give rise to any withdrawal
rights not otherwise provided for by applicable law. See -- Withdrawal Rights.
If Purchaser's purchase of Shares is delayed pursuant to a request by the
Antitrust Division or the FTC for additional information or documentary material
pursuant to the HSR Act, the Offer will be extended in certain circumstances.
See -- Certain Conditions of the Offer.

     The Antitrust Division and the FTC scrutinize the legality under the
antitrust laws of transactions such as the purchase of Shares by Purchaser
pursuant to the Offer. At any time before or after the consummation of any such
transactions, the Antitrust Division or the FTC could take such action under the
antitrust laws of the United States as it deems necessary or desirable in the
public interest, including seeking to enjoin the purchase of Shares pursuant to
the Offer or seeking divestiture of the Shares so acquired or divestiture of
substantial assets of Parent or the Company. Private parties (including
individual states) may also bring legal actions under the antitrust laws of the
United States. Purchaser does not believe that the consummation of the Offer
will result in a violation of any applicable antitrust laws. However, there can
be no assurance that a challenge to the Offer on antitrust grounds will not be
made, or if such a challenge is made, what the result will be. See -- Certain
Conditions of the Offer, including conditions with respect to litigation and
certain governmental actions and -- The Merger Agreement for certain termination
rights.

     New Jersey Environmental Approvals. The Company must comply with ISRA in
order to complete the Merger. The requirements of ISRA relate to compliance with
certain environmental regulations prior to transferring property within the
State of New Jersey pursuant to the Merger. The Company may seek a determination
the NJDEP that compliance with ISRA is not required by reason of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement for its facilities in New
Jersey. If the NJDEP approves such a determination for any facility, such
approval will fulfill the Company's obligations with respect to compliance with
ISRA under the Merger Agreement for that facility. If such a determination is
denied for any facility or the Company elects not to seek such a determination,
then the Company must make all filings necessary to obtain all NJDEP approvals
pursuant to ISRA that would allow the Merger to be completed in full compliance
with ISRA. There can be no assurance that such approvals by the NJDEP under ISRA
will be obtained.

15. APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

     No appraisal rights are available in connection with the Offer.

     If Purchaser acquires at least ninety percent (90%) of the Shares pursuant
to the Offer, the Merger may be completed without a stockholders' meeting and
without the approval of the Company's stockholders.

     If less than ninety percent (90%) of the Shares are acquired pursuant to
the Offer and a stockholder vote is required to approve the Merger, holders of
Shares may have appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under certain
circumstances. If the Shares are not listed on a national securities exchange or
quoted on the Nasdaq National Market System on the record date fixed to
determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote on the
Merger, the holders of Shares will have appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL.

     Holders of Shares at the Effective Time who have appraisal rights and do
not wish to accept the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger will have the
right to seek an appraisal and to be paid the "fair value" of their Shares as of
the Effective Time (exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger) judicially determined and paid to
it in cash provided that such holder complies with the provisions of Section 262
of the DGCL.

     The following is a brief summary of the statutory procedures to be followed
in order to dissent from the Merger and perfect appraisal rights under Delaware
law. This summary is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL, the text of which is set forth
in Schedule II hereto. Any stockholder considering demanding appraisal is
advised to consult legal counsel. Dissenters' rights, if any, will not be
available unless and until the Merger (or a similar business combination) is
completed.

     Stockholders of record who desire to exercise their appraisal rights must
fully satisfy all of the following conditions. A written demand for appraisal of
Shares must be delivered to the Secretary of the Company (x) before the taking
of the vote on the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement if the Merger
is not being effected without a vote of stockholders pursuant to Section 253 of
the DGCL (a "short-form merger"), but rather is being completed following
approval thereof at a meeting of the Company's stockholders (a "long-form
merger") or (y) within twenty days after the date that the Surviving Corporation
mails to the stockholders a notice (the "Notice of Merger") to the effect that
the Merger is effective and that appraisal rights are available (and includes in
such notice a copy of Section 262 and any other information required thereby) if
the Merger is being effected as a short-form merger without a vote or meeting of
the Company's stockholders. If the Merger is effected as a long-form merger,
this written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any
proxy or vote abstaining from or against the approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement, and neither voting against, abstaining from voting, nor failing to
vote on the Merger Agreement will constitute a demand for appraisal within the
meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. In the case of a long-form merger, any
stockholder seeking appraisal rights must hold the Shares for which appraisal is
sought on the date the demand is made and continuously hold such Shares through
the Effective Time, and otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL.

     In the case of both a short-form merger and a long-form merger, a demand
for appraisal must be executed by or for the stockholder of record, fully and
correctly, as such stockholder's name appears on the stock certificates. If
Shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee,
guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by the fiduciary. If Shares
are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in
common, such demand must be executed by all joint owners. An authorized agent,
including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for
appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the
record owner and expressly disclose the fact that, in exercising the demand, he
is acting as agent for the record owner.

     A record owner, such as a broker, who holds Shares as a nominee for others,
may exercise appraisal rights with respect to Shares held for all or less than
all beneficial owners of Shares as to which the holder is the record owner. In
such case the written demand must set forth the number of Shares covered by such
demand. Where the number of Shares is not expressly stated, the demand will be
presumed to cover all Shares

outstanding in the name of such record owner. Beneficial owners who are not
record owners and who intend to exercise appraisal rights should instruct the
record owner to comply strictly with the statutory requirements with respect to
the exercise of appraisal rights before the date of any meeting of stockholders
of the Company called to approve the Merger in the case of a long-form merger
and within twenty days following the mailing of the Notice of Merger in the case
of a short-form merger.

     Stockholders who elect to exercise appraisal rights must mail or deliver
their written demands to: Secretary, USA Detergents, Inc., 1735 Jersey Avenue,
North Brunswick, New Jersey 08902. The written demand for appraisal should
specify the stockholder's name and mailing address, the number of Shares covered
by the demand and that the stockholder is thereby demanding appraisal of such
shares. In the case of a long-form merger, the Company must, within ten days
after the Effective Time, provide notice of the Effective Time to all
stockholders who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and have not voted
for approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement.

     In the case of a long-form merger, stockholders electing to exercise their
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL must not vote for the approval
and adoption of the Merger Agreement or consent thereto in writing. Voting in
favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, or delivering a
proxy in connection with the stockholders meeting called to approve the Merger
Agreement (unless the proxy votes against, or expressly abstains from the vote
on, the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement), will constitute a waiver
of the stockholder's right of appraisal and will nullify any written demand for
appraisal submitted by the stockholder.

     Regardless of whether the Merger is effected as a long-form merger or a
short-form merger, within 120 days after the Effective Time, either the Company
or any stockholder who has complied with the required conditions of Section 262
of the DGCL and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights may file a
petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair
value of the Shares of the dissenting stockholders. If a petition for an
appraisal is timely filed, after a hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court
of Chancery will determine which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights
and thereafter will appraise the Shares owned by such stockholders, determining
the fair value of such Shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with a fair rate of
interest to be paid, if any, upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In
determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is to take into account
all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., et al., the Delaware Supreme
Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value
in an appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of value by any techniques or
methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and
otherwise admissible in court" should be considered and that "[f]air price
obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of
a company." The Delaware Supreme Court stated that in making this determination
of fair value the court must consider "market value, asset value, dividends,
earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts which were
known or which could be ascertained as of the date of merger which throw any
light on future prospects of the merged corporation . . . ." The Delaware
Supreme Court has construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that "elements of
future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or
susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of
speculation, may be considered." However, the court noted that Section 262
provides that fair value is to be determined "exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger."

     Stockholders who in the future consider seeking appraisal should have in
mind that the fair value of their Shares determined under Section 262 of the
DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the Merger Consideration if
they do seek appraisal of their Shares, and that opinions of investment banking
firms as to fairness from a financial point of view are not necessarily opinions
as to fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Moreover, Parent intends to
cause the Surviving Corporation to argue in any appraisal proceeding that, for
purposes thereof, the "fair value" of the Shares is less than that paid in the
Offer. The cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery
deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a dissenting
stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that all or a portion of
the expenses incurred by any dissenting stockholder in connection with the
appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable

attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata
against the value of all Shares entitled to appraisal. In the absence of such a
determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.

     Any stockholder who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section
262 of the DGCL will not, after the Effective Time, be entitled to vote for any
purpose the Shares subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or
other distributions on such Shares, except for dividends or other distributions
payable to stockholders of record at a date prior to the Effective Time.

     At any time within sixty days after the Effective Time, any former holder
of Shares shall have the right to withdraw his or her demand for appraisal and
to accept the Merger Consideration. After this period, such holder may withdraw
his or her demand for appraisal only with the consent of the Company as the
Surviving Corporation. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware
Court of Chancery within 120 days after the Effective Time, stockholders' rights
to appraisal shall cease and all stockholders shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration. Inasmuch as the Company has no obligation to file such a
petition, and Parent has no present intention to cause or permit the Surviving
Corporation to do so, any stockholder who desires such a petition to be filed is
advised to file it on a timely basis. However, no petition timely filed in the
Delaware Court of Chancery demanding appraisal shall be dismissed as to any
stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery
deems just.

     Failure to take any required step in connection with the exercise of
appraisal rights may result in the termination or waiver of such rights.

     APPRAISAL RIGHTS CANNOT BE EXERCISED AT THIS TIME. THE INFORMATION SET
FORTH ABOVE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY WITH RESPECT TO ALTERNATIVES
AVAILABLE TO STOCKHOLDERS IF THE MERGER IS COMPLETED. STOCKHOLDERS WHO WILL BE
ENTITLED TO APPRAISAL RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER WILL RECEIVE
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING APPRAISAL RIGHTS AND THE PROCEDURES TO BE
FOLLOWED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH BEFORE SUCH STOCKHOLDERS HAVE TO TAKE ANY
ACTION RELATING THERETO.

     STOCKHOLDERS WHO SELL SHARES IN THE OFFER WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE
APPRAISAL RIGHTS WITH RESPECT THERETO BUT, RATHER, WILL RECEIVE THE PRICE PAID
IN THE OFFER.

     The foregoing summary of the rights of objecting stockholders under the
DGCL does not purport to be a complete statement of the procedures to be
followed by stockholders of the Company desiring to exercise any available
dissenters' rights. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by
reference to Section 262 of the DGCL. The preservation and exercise of
dissenters' rights require strict adherence to the applicable provisions of the
DGCL.

as Depositary in connection with the Offer. The Information Agent may contact
holders of Shares by mail, telephone, facsimile or personal interview and may

17. MISCELLANEOUS.

     Neither Purchaser nor Parent is aware of any jurisdiction where the making
of the Offer is prohibited by any administrative or judicial action pursuant to
any valid state statute. If either Purchaser or Parent becomes aware of any
valid state statute prohibiting the making of the Offer or the acceptance of the
Shares, Parent and Purchaser will make a good faith effort to comply with that
state statute. If, after a good faith effort, Purchaser and Parent cannot comply
with the state statute, the Offer will not be made to, nor will tenders be
accepted from or on behalf of, the holders of Shares in that state.

     NO PERSON HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO GIVE ANY INFORMATION OR TO MAKE ANY
REPRESENTATION ON BEHALF OF PARENT OR PURCHASER NOT CONTAINED HEREIN OR IN THE

              SECTION 262 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW

262. APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

     (a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of
stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this
section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through
the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied
with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the
merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to Section 228
of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the
fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances
described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section,
the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a stock corporation
and also a member of record of a nonstock corporation; the words "stock" and
"share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words and also
membership or membership interest of a member of a nonstock corporation; and the
words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in one or more shares, or fractions thereof,
solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

     (b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or
series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to Section 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to
Section 251(g) of this title), Section 252, Section 254, Section 257, Section
258, Section 263 or Section 264 of this title:

          (1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section
     shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which
     stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed
     to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at
     the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
     consolidation, were either (i) listed on a national securities exchange or
     designated as a national market system security on an interdealer quotation
     system by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or (ii) held
     of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no
     appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the
     constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require
     for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation
     as provided in subsection (f) of Section 251 of this title.

          (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, appraisal rights
     under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series
     of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required
     by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to
     Sections 251, 252, 254, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for
     such stock anything except:

             a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from
        such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

             b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts
        in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in
        respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the
        merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities
        exchange or designated as a national market system security on an
        interdealer quotation system by the National Association of Securities
        Dealers, Inc. or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

             c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository
        receipts described in the foregoing subparagraphs a. and b. of this
        paragraph; or

             d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and
        cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts
        described in the foregoing subparagraphs a., b. and c. of this
        paragraph.

          (3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation
     party to a merger effected under Section 253 of this title is not owned by
     the parent corporation immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights
     shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.
                                      SII-1

     (c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that
appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of
incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision,
the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and
(e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

     (d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

          (1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights
     are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a
     meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to
     the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the
     record date for such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal
     rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) hereof that
     appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the
     constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this
     section. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such
     stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of
     the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of
     such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
     informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the
     stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's
     shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not
     constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must
     do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after
     the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or
     resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent
     corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in
     favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the
     merger or consolidation has become effective; or

          (2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to Section
     228 or Section 253 of this title, each constituent corporation, either
     before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or within ten days
     thereafter, shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of
     stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights
     of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights
     are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of
     such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of
     this section; provided that, if the notice is given on or after the
     effective date of the merger or consolidation, such notice shall be given
     by the surviving or resulting corporation to all such holders of any class
     or series of stock of a constituent corporation that are entitled to
     appraisal rights. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective
     date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders
     of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder
     entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing
     of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting
     corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be
     sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the
     stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the
     appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify
     stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either
     (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the
     effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders
     of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are
     entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or
     consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send
     such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such
     effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more
     than 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice
     need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights
     and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with
     this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of
     the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either
     notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be
     prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of
     determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each
     constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be
     not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that
     if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or
     consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record
     date

                                      SII-2

     is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record
     date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on
     which the notice is given.

     (e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has
complied with subsections (a) and (d) hereof and who is otherwise entitled to
appraisal rights, may file a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a
determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder shall have the right to
withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered
upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of
the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) hereof, upon written request, shall be
entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from
the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not
voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands
for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such
shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days
after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the
surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the
period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) hereof,
whichever is later.

     (f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a
copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which
shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in
Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be
filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be
accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or
resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses
therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at
least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as
the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication
shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the
surviving or resulting corporation.

     (g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the
stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to
appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an
appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to
submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder
fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to
such stockholder.

     (h) After determining the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the Court
shall appraise the shares, determining their fair value exclusive of any element
of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or
consolidation, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid upon
the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the
Court shall take into account all relevant factors. In determining the fair rate
of interest, the Court may consider all relevant factors, including the rate of
interest which the surviving or resulting corporation would have had to pay to
borrow money during the pendency of the proceeding. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate
in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, permit discovery
or other pretrial proceedings and may proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior
to the final determination of the stockholder entitled to an appraisal. Any
stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting
corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted
such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is
required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally
determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this
section.

     (i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares,
together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Interest may be simple or

                                      SII-3

compound, as the Court may direct. Payment shall be so made to each such
stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the
case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the
corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may
be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether
such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any
state.

     (j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed
upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the
fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.

     (k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no
stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of
this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive
payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or
other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior
to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that
if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in
subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the
surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's
demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as
provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written
approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal
shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court
of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the
Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems
just.

     (l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the
shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they
assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and
unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

(Last amended by Ch. 339, L. '98, eff. 7-1-98.)

March 30, 2001

Board of Directors
USA Detergents, Inc.
1735 Jersey Avenue
North Brunswick, New Jersey 08902

Dear Sirs:

     We understand that USA Detergents, Inc. (the "Company"), US Acquisition
Corp. (the "Acquiror") and Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (the "Parent") have
proposed entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 30,
2001 (the "Agreement"), pursuant to which Acquiror will commence a tender offer
(the "Tender Offer") for 100% of the common stock outstanding, par value $0.01
per share (the "Common Stock"), of the Company (other than shares held by the
Parent) for $7.00 per share of Common Stock (the "Consideration") and, upon
consummation thereof, merge Acquiror with and into the Company and the separate
corporate existence of Acquiror shall thereupon cease (the "Transaction"). You
have provided us with a draft copy of the Agreement in substantially final form.

     You have asked us to render our opinion, as investment bankers, as to
whether the Consideration for the shares of Common Stock is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the stockholders of the Company, other than the
Parent.

     In connection with our opinion, we have:

          (a) reviewed the Agreement;

          (b) reviewed certain financial and other information relating to the
     Company that was publicly available or furnished to us by the Company that
     we believe appropriate for purposes of rendering this opinion, including,
     but not limited to: (i) the Company's Annual Reports on Forms 10-K for the
     three years ended December 30, 1997 through December 30, 1999 and the
     Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine-month period ended
     September 30, 2000; (ii) the Company's audited consolidated financial
     statements for the year ended December 30, 2000; (iii) financial
     projections for and as developed by the Company; and (iv) publicly
     available market information regarding the Company and the historical
     trading price and volume of its Common Stock;

          (c) met with members of the Company's management to discuss the
     business, operations, historical financial results and future prospects of
     the Company;

          (d) considered certain financial and securities data of the Company
     and compared that data with similar data for other publicly-held companies
     in businesses similar to those of the Company;

          (e) performed a discounted cash flow analysis, a comparable company
     analysis, a comparable transaction analysis and certain other analyses
     which we deemed useful in connection therewith; and

          (f) considered and/or performed such other information, financial
     studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and market
     criteria as we deemed relevant and appropriate for purposes of this
     opinion.

     The opinion expressed below is subject to the following qualifications and
limitations:

          1. In arriving at our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed,
     without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all
     financial and other information that was publicly available or furnished to
     us by the Company. With respect to the financial forecasts examined by us,
     we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting
     the best currently available estimates and judgments of the Company's
     management as to the future financial performance of the Company.

          2. We have not been requested to, and did not, solicit third party
     indications of interest in acquiring all or any part of the Company.

                                       A-1

          3. Our services with respect to the Transaction do not constitute, nor
     should they be construed to constitute in any way, a review or audit of, or
     any other procedures with respect to any financial information, nor should
     such services be relied upon by any person to disclose weaknesses in
     internal controls or financial statement errors or irregularities.

          4. Our opinion does not address, and should not be construed to
     address, either the underlying business decision to effect the Transaction
     or whether the consideration to be received by the stockholders in the
     Transaction represents the highest price obtainable. We express no view as
     to the federal, state or local tax consequences of the Transaction.

          5. Our opinion is based on business, economic, market and other
     conditions as they exist as of the date hereof or as of the date of the
     information provided to us.

          6. This opinion is effective as of the date hereof. We have no
     obligation to update the opinion unless requested by you in writing to do
     so and expressly disclaim any responsibility to do so in the absence of any
     such request.

     Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the
date hereof, the Consideration to be received for the shares of Common Stock by
the stockholders of the Company is fair to such stockholders of the Company,
other than the Parent (as to which no opinion is being expressed), from a
financial point of view.

     We will receive a fee as compensation for our services in rendering this
opinion. In addition, we wish to advise you that in October, 2000,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an indirect stockholder of ours, provided valuation
services to the Parent in connection with its acquisition of Enamelon, Inc.

     Provided that it is reproduced in full, this opinion may be included in any
disclosure document filed by the Company in connection with the consummation of
the Transaction with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or otherwise
required to be made publicly available. Except as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence, any disclosure of this opinion, including that contained in
any document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or distributed to
the stockholders of the Company, and any description of this opinion, may not be
made without the prior written review and approval of PwCS, in all instances not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

     Our advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the
information of the Board of Directors of the Company and its evaluation of the
proposed Transaction, and our opinion is not intended to be and does not
constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should
vote on the proposed Transaction.

                                          Very truly yours,

                                          /s/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS

                                     AMONG

                           CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC.,

                              USA DETERGENTS, INC.

                           DATED AS OF MARCH 30, 2001

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of March 30, 2001, is entered
into by and among CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
US ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation ("Purchaser") and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent, and USA DETERGENTS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").

     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and
Purchaser has, in light of and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, (a) determined that a business combination between Parent and the
Company is fair to their respective stockholders and in the best interests of
such stockholders and (b) accordingly has approved a merger of Purchaser with
and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein (the "Merger"); and

     WHEREAS, by resolutions duly adopted, the respective Boards of Directors of
the Company, Parent and Purchaser have approved and adopted this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, the Company, Parent and
Purchaser hereby agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1

                                   THE OFFER

     SECTION 1.1. The Offer.

     (a) Provided that this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with
Article 7 and none of the events or conditions set forth in Annex I hereto has
occurred and is existing, then, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
public announcement of the terms of this Agreement, but in no event later than
ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), an offer (the
"Offer") for all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (individually a "Share" and, collectively, the "Shares")
at a price per Share of $7.00, net to the seller in cash (the "Offer Price").
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, accept for payment Shares
that have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer at the
earliest time permitted by law, subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions to the Offer (but not waiver of the Minimum Condition). The
obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares tendered
shall be subject only to (i) the condition that at least fifty-one percent (51%)
of the Shares (including all Shares then owned by Parent and/or Purchaser, which
for this purpose will be deemed to be validly tendered and not withdrawn) on a
fully-diluted basis (including for purposes of such calculation all Shares
issuable upon exercise or conversion of all Stock Options (as defined below),
warrants and convertible securities having an exercise or conversion price of
$7.00 per Share or less that vest prior to the Effective Time (as defined
below), but excluding any Shares held by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries), be validly tendered and not withdrawn (the "Minimum Condition"),
and (ii) the other conditions set forth in Annex I hereto. Purchaser expressly
reserves the right to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in
the terms and conditions of the Offer; provided, however, that, without the
prior written consent of the Company, no change may be made that (u) increases
the Minimum Condition; (v) changes the form of consideration to be paid; (w)
decreases the price per Share or the number of Shares sought in the Offer; (x)
imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to the Minimum Condition and those
set forth in Annex I; (y) changes the Expiration Date (as defined below), except
as provided in this Agreement; or (z) is adverse to the holders of the Shares.
No Shares held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries will be tendered in the
Offer.

     (b) The Offer will initially be scheduled to expire thirty (30) Business
Days following the commencement thereof (the initial "Expiration Date," and any
expiration date established pursuant to an authorized extension of the Offer, as
so extended, also an "Expiration Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, without the consent of the
Company: (i) extend the Offer for one

                                       B-1

or more additional periods of ten (10) Business Days each if any conditions to
the Offer have not been satisfied (other than conditions which are not capable
of being satisfied) or waived; or (ii) extend the Offer for any period required
by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or the staff thereof applicable
to the Offer or for any period required by any other law applicable to the
Offer. Furthermore, if all the conditions to the Offer, including, without
limitation, the Minimum Condition, are satisfied or waived but the number of
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn is less than ninety percent (90%) of
the then outstanding number of Shares, Purchaser may, and Parent may cause
Purchaser to, without the consent of the Company: (x) extend the Offer for up to
two (2) additional periods of five (5) Business Days each beyond the latest
Expiration Date; provided that Purchaser shall accept for payment and promptly
pay for Shares that have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer at the earliest time permitted by law after the earlier of (1) the
expiration of any such five-Business Day period at the end of which such ninety
percent (90%) threshold is reached or (2) the expiration of the last such
five-Business Day period; and/or (y) extend the Offer for a subsequent offering
period (as provided in Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act) of up to twenty (20)
days in order to acquire over ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Shares;
provided that Purchaser shall accept for payment and promptly pay for Shares
that have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, prior
to the date of extension under this clause (y), and otherwise meets the
requirements of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act.

     (c) As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is commenced, Parent and
Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, and including all
exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO
shall contain as an exhibit or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase
(or portions thereof) and forms of the related letter of transmittal and summary
advertisement. Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Schedule TO, the Offer to
Purchase and all amendments or supplements thereto (which collectively
constitute the "Offer Documents") to comply in all material respects with the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable laws.
Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information becomes false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and
Purchaser further shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and the other Offer Documents as so corrected
to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel
shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser shall provide the
Company and its counsel with any comments Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO, promptly
after receipt of such comments, and shall provide the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposed response of Parent and
Purchaser with respect to such comments.

     (d) Without in any way limiting Section 1.2(a) hereof, the Company hereby
waives and represents that the Company's Board of Directors has agreed to waive,
solely for the purposes of the Offer and the Merger, the provisions of Section 7
of that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 14, 2000 (the "Stock
Purchase Agreement"), by and among Parent, the Company and Frederick R. Adler.

     SECTION 1.2. Company Action.

     (a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents that the
Company's Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has (i)
unanimously determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including, without limitation, the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and
in the best interests of the Company's stockholders; (ii) unanimously approved
and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including,
without limitation, the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the
requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), including,
without limitation, Section 203 of the DGCL; and (iii) unanimously resolved to
recommend acceptance of the Offer and approval and adoption of this Agreement
and the Merger by its stockholders; provided, however, that such recommendation
may be withdrawn, modified or amended, as provided in Section 5.5 hereof. The
Company hereby consents to the inclusion of such recommendation and approval in
the Offer Documents. The
                                       B-2

Company has been advised that all of its directors who own Shares intend to
tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer.

     (b) As soon as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced, the
Company shall file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that will reflect,
subject to Section 5.5 hereof, the recommendations of the Company's Board of
Directors referred to above. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to
comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and other applicable laws. Parent and its counsel shall
be given an opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to its
being filed with the SEC. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with
any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments
and shall provide Parent and its counsel an opportunity to participate in the
response of the Company to such comments. The Company, Parent and Purchaser each
shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that it becomes false or misleading in any material
respect. The Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9
as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws.

     (c) The Company shall, or cause its transfer agent to, promptly furnish
Parent with a list of its stockholders of record, mailing labels and any
available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all
record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in
stock depositories, in each case true and correct as of the most recent
practicable date. The Company shall provide to Parent such additional
information (including updated lists of stockholders of record, mailing labels
and lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may
reasonably request in connection with the Offer. Parent and Purchaser and their
agents shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels,
listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer
and the Merger and, if this Agreement is terminated, Parent and Purchaser shall,
upon request, deliver, and shall use their reasonable efforts to cause their
agents to deliver, to the Company (or destroy) all copies and any extracts or
summaries from such information then in their possession or control.

     SECTION 1.3. Directors.

     (a) Promptly upon the purchase of and payment for such number of Shares by
Parent or Purchaser that satisfy the Minimum Condition, Parent shall be entitled
to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on
the Company's Board of Directors that equals the product of (i) the total number
of directors on the Company's Board of Directors (giving effect to the election
of any additional directors pursuant to this Section 1.3) multiplied by (ii) the
percentage that the number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent and/or
Purchaser (including Shares accepted for payment) bears to the total number of
Shares outstanding. The Company shall take all action necessary to cause
Parent's designees to be elected or appointed to the Company's Board of
Directors, including increasing the number of directors and seeking and
accepting resignations of incumbent directors. At such time, to the extent
requested by Parent, the Company shall also use its best efforts to cause
individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up
to the next whole number, on (x) each committee of the Board of Directors and
(y) each Board of Directors of each subsidiary of the Company (and each
committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as such individuals
represent on the Company's Board of Directors as permitted by the rules of The
Nasdaq Stock Market. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.3, the
parties hereto shall use their respective best efforts to ensure that at least
two (2) of the members of the Company's Board of Directors shall, at all times
prior to the Effective Time, be directors of the Company who were directors of
the Company on the date hereof (the "Continuing Directors") (which, in the case
of Parent, shall include the voting of all Shares held by it for the election of
such persons as directors of the Company); provided that if there are in office
fewer than two Continuing Directors for any reason, the Company's Board of
Directors shall cause a person designated by the remaining Continuing Director
to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for all
purposes of this Agreement, or if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other
directors of the Company then in office shall designate two (2) persons to fill
such vacancies who will not be
                                       B-3

officers or employees or affiliates of the Company, Parent or Purchaser or any
of their respective subsidiaries and such persons shall be deemed to be
Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement.

     (b) The Company's obligations to appoint Parent's designees to the
Company's Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all
actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect
to the Company and its directors and officers, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1
require in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3, so long as
Parent has provided to the Company on a timely basis the information referred to
in the following sentence. Parent shall supply to the Company in writing and be
solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its nominees,
directors, officers and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

     (c) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees pursuant to
Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the
Continuing Directors shall be required to authorize (and such authorization
shall constitute the authorization of the Company's Board of Directors and no
other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other
director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) any termination of this
Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this Agreement requiring action by
the Company's Board of Directors, any extension of time for performance of any
obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Purchaser, any waiver of compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the
Company, any consent or action by the Company's Board of Directors hereunder and
any other action of the Company hereunder which adversely affects the holders of
Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser) or holders of Stock Options (as defined
below).

                                   ARTICLE 2

                                   THE MERGER

     SECTION 2.1. The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time (defined below), in accordance with this
Agreement and the DGCL, Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company.
Following the Merger, the separate existence of Purchaser shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation.

     SECTION 2.2. Effect of the Merger. The Merger will have the effects set
forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Purchaser shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation and all the debts, liabilities and duties of Purchaser
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

     SECTION 2.3. Closing. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, and
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the obligations of
the parties to effect the Merger set forth herein, the completion of the Merger
(the "Closing") will take place as promptly as practicable, but in no event
later than 10:00 a.m. on the second (2nd) Business Day following the
satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions (other than conditions which, by
their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to those
conditions) to the obligations of the parties to effect the Merger set forth
herein (the "Closing Date"), at the offices of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, New
York, New York, unless another time, date or place is agreed to by the parties
hereto.

     SECTION 2.4. Completion of the Merger. Upon the Closing, the parties hereto
shall cause the Merger to be completed by filing with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware a properly executed certificate of merger (the "Merger
Certificate") in accordance with the DGCL, which shall be effective upon filing
or on such later date as may be agreed by the parties and specified therein (the
time of such effectiveness being the "Effective Time").

     SECTION 2.5. Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers.

     (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of Purchaser in effect at the
Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation (except that such Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended to
provide that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "USA Detergents,
Inc.") until thereafter
                                       B-4

amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and as provided by the DGCL.
The Bylaws of Purchaser in effect at the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and the DGCL.

     (b) From and after the Effective Time and until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation's
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, (i) the directors of Purchaser at the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the
officers of Purchaser at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation.

     SECTION 2.6. Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of Shares or any
shares of capital stock of Purchaser:

          (a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
     Purchaser that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
     Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable
     share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
     Corporation;

          (b) Each Share that is owned by Parent or Purchaser or any subsidiary
     or affiliate of Parent or Purchaser, or by any of the Company's
     subsidiaries or held in the treasury of the Company, but not Shares held in
     any Company benefit plan (collectively, the "Excluded Shares"), shall
     automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash
     or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
     therefor;

          (c) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
     Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares and any Dissenting Shares
     (as defined below)) shall be converted into the right to receive the
     highest price paid per Share pursuant to the Offer, without interest (the
     "Merger Consideration"); and

          (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
     outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder
     who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing
     and who has properly demanded, and perfected, appraisal rights for such
     Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (if Section 262 of the
     DGCL provides for appraisal rights for such Shares in the Merger)
     ("Dissenting Shares"), will not be converted into the right to receive the
     Merger Consideration. Instead, such holder of Dissenting Shares will be
     entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of the Dissenting Shares
     in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, unless and
     until such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such
     holder's right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If after the
     Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise
     loses such holder's right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such
     holder's Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been
     converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
     Consideration, if any, to which the holder is entitled, without interest or
     dividends thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of
     any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares and, prior to
     the Effective Time, Parent will have the right to participate in all
     negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
     shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
     with respect to, settle or offer to settle any such demands for appraisal.

     SECTION 2.7. Exchange of Certificates.

     (a) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with Mellon Investor
Services LLC, or such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent and
Purchaser (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, for
exchange in accordance with this Article 2, through the Exchange Agent an amount
of cash equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section
2.6 (such amount of cash is hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"), in
exchange for outstanding Shares.

     (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented

                                       B-5

outstanding Shares (the "Certificates") whose shares were converted into the
right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6: (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check representing the
Merger Consideration for the Shares represented by such Certificate, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, a check representing the proper amount of Merger Consideration
may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is
presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.7, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the appropriate amount
of Merger Consideration.

     (c) In the event that any Certificate for Shares has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange therefor, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the appropriate amount of
Merger Consideration, as may be required pursuant to this Agreement; provided,
however, that Parent or the Exchange Agent, may, in its discretion, require the
delivery of a suitable bond and/or indemnity.

     (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the
stockholders of the Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any stockholders of the Company who have
not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to
Parent as general creditors for payment of their claims for Merger
Consideration.

     (e) Neither Parent nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of Shares
for any amount of cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     SECTION 2.8. Stock Options.

     (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option or warrant to purchase
Shares (a "Stock Option" or, collectively, the "Stock Options") issued pursuant
to (i) the Company's 1995 Stock Option Plan, as amended and restated; (ii) the
Company's Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors, as amended and restated
(clauses (i) and (ii), together, the "Option Plans"); or (iii) any other plan or
instrument, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled in exchange for a
single lump sum cash payment (less any applicable income or employment tax
withholding) payable by Parent at the Effective Time equal to the Cash-Out Price
(as defined below). The "Cash-Out Price" will be paid only if the exercise price
per Share of the Stock Option is less than the Merger Consideration and will be
equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares subject to any Stock Option
vested immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any Stock Option which
becomes vested on or prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of
an automatic acceleration provision in existence as of the date hereof and
disclosed to Parent hereunder), multiplied by (ii) the excess of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such Stock Option.

     (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its best efforts to
take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms of the Option
Plans or the Stock Options) and obtain such consents as are necessary to give
effect to the transactions contemplated by Section 2.8(a).

                                   ARTICLE 3

                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

     The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser that, except as
set forth in the Company's disclosure schedule attached hereto (the "Company
Disclosure Schedule," which will be arranged so that

                                       B-6

each exception will specifically identify the numbered and lettered section of
this Agreement to which the exception relates) or the SEC Reports:

     SECTION 3.1. Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

     (a) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization and has all requisite power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its businesses as now being
conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in good
standing or to have such power and authority would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) on the Company.

     (b) The Company has heretofore delivered to Parent accurate and complete
copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (or similar governing
documents), as currently in effect, of the Company and each of its subsidiaries.
Each of the Company and each of its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed
and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the property
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions
where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

     SECTION 3.2. Capitalization of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

     (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 30,000,000
Shares and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 14,192,776 Shares and
no shares of preferred stock are issued and outstanding. All of the outstanding
Shares have been validly issued, and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. All of the outstanding Shares have been issued in compliance
with all applicable United States federal and state and foreign securities laws.
Other than (x) as set forth in the first sentence of this Section 3.2(a); (y) an
aggregate of 1,975,000 Shares reserved for issuance for awards under Option
Plans, of which 1,561,564 Shares are subject to outstanding Stock Options issued
under such Option Plans; and (z) an aggregate of 1,078,524 Shares subject to
outstanding Stock Options issued outside of the Options Plans, there are no
other outstanding (i) shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the
Company; (ii) securities of the Company or its subsidiaries convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or voting securities of
the Company; (iii) options or other rights to acquire from the Company or its
subsidiaries, or obligations of the Company or its subsidiaries to issue, any
capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or exercisable
or exchangeable for capital stock or voting securities of the Company; and (iv)
equity equivalents, interests in the ownership or earnings of the Company or its
subsidiaries or other similar rights (clauses (i) through (iv) above,
collectively, "Company Securities"). There are no outstanding obligations of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any Company Securities. There are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or
other agreements or understandings to which the Company is a party or by which
it is bound relating to the voting or registration of any shares of capital
stock of the Company.

     (b) Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each
subsidiary of the Company as of the date hereof and shows the jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization of each such subsidiary. Other than as set forth
in Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all of the outstanding
capital stock of the Company's subsidiaries (other than directors' qualifying
shares in the case of certain foreign subsidiaries) is owned by the Company,
directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien (as defined below) or any
other limitation or restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote
or sell the same, except as may be provided as a matter of law). There are no
securities of the Company or its subsidiaries convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for, no options or other rights to acquire from the Company or its
subsidiaries, and no other contract, understanding, arrangement or obligation
(whether or not contingent) providing for the issuance or sale, directly or
indirectly, of, any capital stock or other ownership interests in, or any other
securities of, any subsidiary of the Company. There are no outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding shares of capital stock or other
ownership interests in any subsidiary of the Company. "Lien" means, with respect
to any asset (including, without limitation, any security) any mortgage, lien,
pledge, charge, security interest or encumbrance of any kind in respect of such
asset or any agreement to grant any of the foregoing.
                                       B-7

     (c) The Shares constitute the only class of equity securities of the
Company or its subsidiaries registered or required to be registered under the
Exchange Act.

     SECTION 3.3. Authority Relative to this Agreement. The Company has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and, subject (if required) to the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company in accordance with the DGCL and the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (the "Stockholder Approval"), to
complete the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly and validly authorized by the Company's Board of Directors and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to complete the transactions contemplated hereby,
except, with respect to completion of the Merger, the Stockholder Approval (if
required). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
agreement of Parent and Purchaser, constitutes a valid, legal and binding
agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its
terms, except that the enforcement hereof may be limited by (a) bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or
relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (b) general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law) (clauses (a) and (b), the "Enforceability
Exceptions").

     SECTION 3.4. SEC Reports; Financial Statements.

     (a) The Company has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be
filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 1998, each of which, as amended, has
complied in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the Exchange Act,
each as in effect on the dates such forms, reports and documents were filed. The
Company has heretofore delivered, made available or promptly shall deliver or
make available to Parent, in the form filed with the SEC (including any
amendments thereto and all exhibits), (i) its Annual Reports on Form 10-K for
each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999 and a draft of its
Annual Report on Form 10-K, provided on March 28, 2001 by counsel to the
Company, (ii) all definitive proxy statements relating to the Company's meetings
of stockholders (whether annual or special) held since January 1, 1998 and (iii)
all other reports or registration statements filed by the Company with the SEC
since January 1, 1998 (clauses (i) through (iii), collectively, the "SEC
Reports"). None of the SEC Reports, including, without limitation, any financial
statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference therein,
contained, when filed, or, if amended, to the extent amended on the date of
filing of such amendment, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The consolidated
balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows (including the related notes thereto) of the
Company included in the SEC Reports comply in form and substance in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto (each as then in effect), have been
prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (as then in
effect) applied on a consistent basis (except as otherwise noted therein), and
present fairly the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of their respective dates and their consolidated
results of operations and its cash flows for the periods presented therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments).

     (b) The Company has heretofore made, or promptly shall make, available to
Parent a complete and correct copy of any amendments or modifications, which are
or will be required to be filed with the SEC but have not yet been so filed, to
agreements, documents or other instruments which previously have been filed by
the Company with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act.

     SECTION 3.5. Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Offer Documents will, at the time the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC or
disseminated to the holders of Shares, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the

                                       B-8

statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. Each of the Schedule 14D-9 and the other documents required to be
filed by the Company with the SEC in connection with the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, will comply as to form, in all
material respects, with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act and will not, at the time such document is filed with the SEC or
disseminated to the holders of Shares, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

     SECTION 3.6. Consents and Approvals; No Violations. Except for filings,
permits, authorizations, consents and approvals as may be required under, and
other applicable requirements of, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, state
securities or blue sky laws, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), and ISRA (as defined below), and except for
applicable foreign governmental approvals and the filing and recordation of the
Merger Certificate as required by the DGCL and other appropriate documents with
the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is authorized to do business, no filing with or notice to, and no
permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any court or tribunal or
administrative, governmental or regulatory body, agency or authority, whether
domestic or foreign (a "Governmental Entity"), is necessary for the execution
and delivery by the Company of this Agreement or the completion by the Company
of the transactions contemplated hereby, except where the failure to obtain such
permits, authorizations, consents or approvals or to make such filings or give
such notices would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as set forth in Section 3.6 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company nor the completion by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any
provision of the respective Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (or similar
governing documents) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (ii) result in a
violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time
or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination, amendment,
cancellation or acceleration or any Lien) under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract,
agreement or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound, except for such violations, breaches and
defaults (or rights of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration or
Liens) as to which requisite waivers or consents have been obtained or which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company; or (iii) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, or any law,
statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries
or any of their respective assets, except for such violations which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
The purchase by Parent of 2,142,857 Shares on June 14, 2000 (including the put
and call agreement with Frederick Adler and the subsequent exercise of the put
agreement) constituted a transaction approved by the board of directors of the
Company as set forth in Section 203(a)(1) of the DGCL.

     SECTION 3.7. No Default. None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is
in breach, default or violation in any material respect (and no event has
occurred which with notice or the lapse of time or both would constitute a
breach, default or violation by the Company or any of its subsidiaries in any
material respect) of any term, condition or provision of (i) its Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws (or similar governing documents); (ii) any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or other instrument or
obligation to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by
which any of them or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound,
except for such breaches, defaults and violations which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; or (iii) any
order, writ, injunction, decree, or any law, statute, rule or regulation
applicable to the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets, except for such breaches, defaults and violations which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. Each note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract,
agreement or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound is in full force and effect (except for those
deficiencies which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company) and is not subject to any
                                       B-9

default thereunder of which the Company has any knowledge by any party obligated
to the Company or any subsidiary thereunder.

     SECTION 3.8. No Undisclosed Liabilities; Absence of Changes. Except as set
forth on Schedule 3.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since September 30,
2000: (a) the business of the Company and its subsidiaries has been carried on
only in the ordinary and usual course of business, consistent with past
practice, and, other than in the ordinary course of business, there has not
occurred any change which, individually or in the aggregate, has resulted or
would result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and (b) except as
specifically set forth in the SEC Reports, this Agreement or the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has taken
or omitted to take any action which would constitute a breach of Section 5.1
hereof had it been taken subsequent to the date hereof. Section 3.8 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a detailed list of all "earn-out" or
similar obligations (of whatever form, name or description, related to the past,
present or future performance of the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any
portions of any of their respective businesses) of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, arising out of or related to acquisitions of persons (whether by
merger, stock purchase, share exchange, asset purchase, or otherwise) by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries and which obligations either have not expired
by their own terms or with respect to which there exist as of the date hereof or
may exist in the future any liabilities of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to any person, whether fixed or contingent, liquidated or
unliquidated, accrued or unaccrued. Section 3.8 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule also sets forth a list of the Company's current outstanding debt,
including, without limitation, the current outstanding principal balances under
each of the loan facilities with FINOVA Capital Corporation.

     SECTION 3.9. Litigation. Except as set forth in Section 3.9 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and the SEC Reports, there is no suit, claim, action,
proceeding or investigation (collectively, a "Proceeding") pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets which would have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the completion of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree
which would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on

person. Except under appropriate confidentiality obligations, there has been no
disclosure by the Company of material confidential information or other Trade
Secrets that derive commercial value from not being generally known to the
public.

     (e) The Company or one of its subsidiaries either owns the entire right,
title and interest in, to and under, or has acquired a license to use, any and
all Intellectual Property Assets relating to the conduct of their businesses in
the manner that such businesses have heretofore been or are presently being
conducted or as contemplated to be conducted pursuant to the Company's current
business plan, and no other Intellectual Property Rights are necessary for the
unimpaired continued operation of such businesses after the Effective Time in

may seek an appropriate protective order. If, in the absence of a protective
order, a party is nonetheless compelled to disclose Confidential Information,
such party may disclose such Confidential Information; provided, however, that
such party shall provide the other party written notice of the information to be
disclosed as far in advance of its disclosure as practicable and, upon the
request of and at the expense of such other party, such party shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment
will be accorded to such Confidential Information. "Confidential Information"
does not include information which was or becomes generally available on a
non-confidential basis.

     (c) No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.3 or belief contemplated by
Section 5.6(c) will affect, add to, subtract from or otherwise alter any
representations or warranties of the parties hereto or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties hereto to effect the Merger.

     SECTION 5.4. Best Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 5.5 hereof, each of the
parties hereto shall use all of their respective best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to complete
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable, including, without limitation, (a) cooperating in the
preparation and filing of the Offer Documents, any filings that may be required
under the HSR Act or similar governmental legal requirements, and any amendments
to any thereof; (b) obtaining consents of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary, proper or advisable for the completion of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (c) contesting any legal proceeding, whether
judicial or administrative, relating to the Merger, including, without
limitation, seeking to have any stay imposed or temporary restraining order
entered by any Governmental Entity vacated or reversed; and (d) executing any
additional instruments necessary to complete the transactions contemplated
hereby, subject in all instances to any required Stockholder Approval. Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall use
all of their respective best efforts to cause the Effective Time to occur as
soon as practicable after the completion of the Offer. In case at any time after
the Effective Time any further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, the proper directors and officers of each party hereto shall
take all such necessary action. Parent shall cause Purchaser to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement.

                                       B-24

     SECTION 5.5. Inquiries and Negotiations.

     (a) The Company, its subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers,
employees, representatives and agents shall immediately cease any discussions or
negotiations with any parties with respect to any Third Party Acquisition (as
defined below). Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall, nor shall
the Company authorize or permit any of its or their respective directors,
officers, employees, representatives or agents to, directly or indirectly,
encourage, solicit, participate in or initiate discussions or negotiations with
or provide any non-public information to any person or group (other than Parent
and Purchaser or any designees of Parent and Purchaser) concerning any Third
Party Acquisition; provided, however, that (i) nothing herein shall prevent the
Company's Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Company's
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act with regard to any tender offer; (ii) if the Company receives
an unsolicited proposal for a Third Party Acquisition from a Third Party,
nothing herein shall prevent the Company or its representatives from making such
inquiries or conducting such discussions as the Company's Board of Directors,
after consultation with legal counsel, may deem necessary to inform itself for
the purpose of exercising its fiduciary duties, and (iii) if the Company
receives an unsolicited proposal for a Third Party Acquisition from a Third
Party that the Company's Board of Directors by a majority vote determines in its
good faith judgment (after consultation with, and duly considering the advice
of, a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) is reasonably
likely to result in a Superior Proposal, the Company and its representatives may
conduct such additional discussions or provide such information as the Company's
Board of Directors shall determine, but only if, prior to such provision of
information or additional discussion, (A) such Third Party has entered into a
confidentiality and standstill agreement substantially similar to Section 5.3
hereof and Section 7 of the Stock Purchase Agreement which agreement contains
provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply with the provisions of
this Section 5.5; provided, that if the Company enters into a confidentiality
agreement without standstill provisions substantially similar to those contained
in the Stock Purchase Agreement, then Parent will, to the extent of the
difference, be relieved of compliance with the Stock Purchase Agreement's
standstill provisions and (B) the Company's Board of Directors determines in its
good faith judgment, after consultation with legal counsel, that it is required
to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties. The Company shall
promptly notify the Parent in the event it receives any proposal or inquiry
concerning a Third Party Acquisition including the terms and conditions thereof
and the identity of the party submitting such proposal. The Company shall advise
the Parent from time to time of the status and any material developments
concerning the same.

     (b) Except as set forth in this Section 5.5(b), the Company's Board of
Directors shall not withdraw, change or modify its recommendation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or approve or recommend, or cause the Company
to enter into any agreement with respect to, any Third Party Acquisition.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
the Company's Board of Directors determines in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with legal counsel, that it is required to do so in order to comply
with its fiduciary duties, the Company's Board of Directors may withdraw its
recommendation of the transactions contemplated hereby or approve or recommend a
Superior Proposal (as defined below), but in each case only (i) after providing
written notice to Parent (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") advising Parent that
the Company's Board of Directors has received a Superior Proposal, specifying
the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the
person making such Superior Proposal and (ii) if Parent does not, within five
(5) Business Days after Parent's receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal,
make an offer which the Company's Board of Directors determines in its good
faith judgment (after consultation with, and duly considering the advice of, a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be as favorable to the
Company's stockholders as such Superior Proposal; provided, however, the Company
shall not be entitled to enter into any agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal (excluding a confidentiality and standstill agreement pursuant to
Section 5.5(a)) unless and until this Agreement is terminated by its terms
pursuant to Article 7 and the Company has paid all amounts due to Parent and
Purchaser thereunder.

     (c) "Third Party Acquisition" means the occurrence of any of the following
events: (i) the acquisition of the Company by merger, reorganization,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, purchase of stock or assets
or otherwise by any person (which includes a "person" as such term is defined in

                                       B-25

Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than Parent, Purchaser or any
affiliate thereof (a "Third Party"); (ii) the acquisition by a Third Party of
all, or a material portion of all, the Company's assets; (iii) the acquisition
by a Third Party of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the outstanding Shares;
(iv) the adoption by the Company of a plan of liquidation or the declaration or
payment of an extraordinary dividend; (v) the repurchase by the Company or any
of its subsidiaries of more than fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding
Shares; or (vi) the acquisition by the Company or any subsidiary by merger,
purchase of stock or assets, joint venture or otherwise of a direct or indirect
ownership interest or investment in any business whose annual revenues, annual
net income or total assets is equal or greater than fifteen percent (15%) of the
annual revenues, annual net income or total assets of the Company.

     (d) "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide Third Party Acquisition
proposal which the Company's Board of Directors by a majority vote determines in
its good faith judgment (after consultation with, and duly considering the
advice of, a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be more
favorable to the Company's stockholders than the Offer and the Merger.

     SECTION 5.6. Notification of Certain Matters, Etc. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of
(i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event that such party believes
would be likely to cause any of its representations or warranties contained in
this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time
from the date hereof to the Effective Time and (ii) any material failure of the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any director, officer, employee or
agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that failure
to give such notice shall not constitute a waiver of any defense that may be
validly asserted.

     SECTION 5.7. Indemnification.

     (a) Parent shall provide, until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing
Date, the directors and officers of the Company who are currently covered by the
Company's existing insurance and indemnification policy an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the
Effective Time (the "D&O Insurance"), including, without limitation, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that is no less favorable than the
Company's existing policy or, if substantially equivalent coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, that Parent shall not be
required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of one hundred
fifty percent (150%) of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
date hereof, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as possible for
such amount.

     (b) After the Effective Time, Parent shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or
has been prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
(the "Indemnified Persons") against (i) all losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses (including without limitation reasonable counsel fees and expenses),
settlement, payments or liabilities arising out of or in connection with any
claim, demand, action suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in
part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, the fact that such person is or
was a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, whether or
not pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time and whether or not asserted or claimed prior to or at or after the
Effective Time (the "Indemnified Liabilities") and (ii) all Indemnified
Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of,
or pertaining to, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in
each case to the fullest extent required or permitted under applicable law or
under the Surviving Corporation's certificate of incorporation, bylaws,
indemnification agreements in effect at the date hereof (as disclosed to Parent
in the Company Disclosure Schedule), or otherwise as permitted by contracts
identified on Schedule 5.7 hereto, including provisions relating to the
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any action or suit. In the
event of any claim (a "Claim") for indemnification by an Indemnified Person
hereunder, the Surviving Corporation shall control the defense of such Claim
with counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that the
Indemnified Person shall be permitted to participate in the defense of such
Claim through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation and
selected by the Indemnified Person, at the Indemnified Person's expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is any conflict between the Surviving

                                       B-26

Corporation and any Indemnified Person or there are additional defenses
available to any Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person shall be permitted
to participate in the defense of such Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable
to the Surviving Corporation selected by the Indemnified Person, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of more than one (1) counsel for all Indemnified Persons in any single
Claim. It is acknowledged that the SEC investigation and related actions against
the Company and certain of its current and former directors, officers and
employees, as disclosed in the section captioned "Legal Proceedings" in the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999
(the "Investigation"), will continue to be treated as separate Claims hereunder
and, accordingly, each such person who has been entitled to separate counsel in
connection with the Investigation immediately prior to the Effective Time will
continue to be entitled to separate counsel in connection with the Investigation
after the Effective Time; the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be
obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of each such counsel. Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event any Indemnified Person participates in the
defense of any Claim and the Surviving Corporation is required to pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such Indemnified Party's legal counsel pursuant
to the two immediately preceding sentences, then Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to periodically advance to such Indemnified Person its
reasonable legal and other expenses (including the reasonable costs of any
investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith), subject to the
provision by such Indemnified Person of an undertaking to reimburse the amounts
so advanced in the event of a final, nonappealable determination by a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be
indemnified for such expenses. The Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for
any settlement effected without its written consent (including, without
limitation, any settlement effected without its written consent in connection
with the Investigation), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Each
Indemnified Person is intended to be a third party beneficiary of this Section
5.7 and may specifically enforce its terms. This Section 5.7 shall not limit or
otherwise adversely affect any rights any Indemnified Person may have under any
agreement with the Company or under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation,
Bylaws, indemnification agreements in effect at the date hereof (as disclosed to
Parent in the Company Disclosure Schedule), or otherwise as permitted by
contracts identified on Schedule 5.7 hereto, including provisions relating to
the advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any action or suit.

     (c) In the event that Parent or Purchaser or any of their successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person or entity and is
not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any person or entity, then, and in each such case, to the extent
necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Section 5.7, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and Purchaser assume the
obligations of Parent and Purchaser set forth in this Section 5.7.

     SECTION 5.8. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Shares
(including derivative securities with respect to the Shares) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
such steps to be taken in accordance with the No-Action Letter, dated January
12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.

     SECTION 5.9. Resignation of Directors and Officers. After the completion of
the Offer and to the extent requested by Parent, the Company shall cause each of
the directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries to tender their
resignations effective on or before the Effective Time.

     SECTION 5.10. Public Announcements. Parent, Purchaser and the Company, as
the case may be, shall consult with, and obtain the approval of, one another
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without
limitation, the Offer and the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with The Nasdaq Stock Market or as reasonably determined to be prudent upon the
                                       B-27

good faith exercise of the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of any
party hereunder; provided, however, that in any event, the announcing party
shall notify the other parties hereto of the material details of any such
release or statement at least one (1) Business Day prior to the public
announcement thereof.

     SECTION 5.11. ISRA Procedures.

     (a) At is own cost and expense, the Company shall comply with all
obligations pursuant to ISRA (as defined below) resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. At the Company's option, the Company may seek a
determination from NJDEP that compliance with ISRA is not required by reason of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the form of an application
for a letter of ISRA nonapplicability (an "LNA") for each facility or place of
business in New Jersey owned or operated by the Company. If NJDEP approves an
LNA for any site, the LNA shall fulfill the Company's obligations under this
Section 5.11 for such site (each, a "Site"). The Company shall (i) provide
Parent and Purchaser with drafts of all submissions to NJDEP regarding ISRA
exemption or compliance, at least three (3) Business Days in advance of
submission to NJDEP, for review and approval by Parent and Purchaser (which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld); (ii) provide notice to Parent and
Purchaser of any meetings with NJDEP concerning ISRA compliance at least three
(3) Business Days in advance of such meetings; and (iii) permit Parent and
Purchaser to attend any such meetings. Except to the extent already in place
prior to the date hereof or required of the Company under its settlement
agreement, dated February 21, 2001, with the Okonite Company (as disclosed to
Parent in the Company Disclosure Schedule), the Company shall not request any
NJDEP ISRA approvals based upon the use of Engineering Controls, Deed Notices,
Classification Exception Areas (as such terms are defined under ISRA), or other
non-residential remediation standards without the prior written approval of
Parent and Purchaser (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld).

     (b) "ISRA" means, collectively, New Jersey's Industrial Site Recovery Act
(N.J.S.A. sec.13:1K-6, et seq.) and the Brownfield and Contaminated Site
Remediation Act (formerly known as the Hazardous Discharge Site Remediation Act,
N.J.S.A. sec.58:10B-1, et seq.), both as amended, and all applicable
regulations, orders or directives adopted thereunder or pertaining thereto.

     (c) "NJDEP" means the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and
its successors.

     SECTION 5.12. Employee Benefits. For a period of not less than two (2)
years following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide to
current and former employees of the Company employee benefits that are, in the
aggregate, not less favorable than those provided to such employees immediately
before the Effective Time. The foregoing will not be interpreted to prevent (i)
the amendment or termination of any particular Employee Plan or employment
agreement to the extent permitted by, and in accordance with, its terms, as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time and as described in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the SEC Reports or (ii) the termination of employment or
the reduction of, or other change in, the compensation or employee benefits of
any individual employee of the Company.

                                   ARTICLE 6

                            CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

     SECTION 6.1. Conditions to the Obligations of the Parties. The respective
obligations of each party to complete the Merger are subject to the fulfillment
at or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

          (a) this Agreement has been duly approved and adopted by the holders
     of the outstanding Shares, if required, in accordance with applicable law
     and the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company; provided,
     that Parent and Purchaser shall vote, or cause to be voted, all Shares then
     owned or controlled by them in favor of the Merger;

          (b) no statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, ruling or
     injunction has been enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by any United
     States court or United States governmental authority which prohibits,
     restrains or enjoins the completion of the Merger; provided that the party
     invoking this condition has complied with its obligations under Section 5.4
     hereof;

                                       B-28

          (c) any waiting period applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act has
     terminated or expired and, to the extent required, the Commission of the
     European Union has approved the Merger under Regulation (EEC) No. 4064/89
     of the Council of the European Union, or such approval shall have been
     deemed granted;

          (d) any applicable approval under ISRA has been obtained by the
     Company from NJDEP in accordance with Section 5.11; and

          (e) Purchaser has accepted for payment and paid for all Shares validly
     tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

                                   ARTICLE 7

                          TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT

             (i) any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or
        other Governmental Entity in the United States or other jurisdiction
        where the Company has material assets or operations has issued a final
        order, decree or ruling or taken any other final action restraining,
        enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Offer or the Merger and such
        order, decree, ruling or other action is or shall have become final and
        nonappealable; or

             (ii) the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer has not been
        completed on or prior to the date three (3) months from the date hereof;

        clause (ii) shall be tolled during (A) the period during which any party
        shall be subject to a non-final order, decree, ruling or action
        restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Offer or the Merger,
        but not more than an additional three (3) months or (B) any additional

        provided, further, that no party may terminate this Agreement pursuant

             (i) (A) the Company's Board of Directors has entered into or
        publicly announced its intention to enter into an agreement or an
        agreement in principle with respect to a Superior Proposal, in strict
        compliance with Section 5.5 hereof; provided, however, that the right to
        terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(i)(A) shall not
        be available if (1) the Company has breached any obligation under
        Section 5.5 hereof; (2) prior to or concurrently with any purported
        termination under this Section 7.1(c), the Company has failed to pay any
        fee that it is required to pay pursuant to Section 7.3; or (3) the
        Company has failed to provide Parent and Purchaser with at least five
        (5) Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to terminate

        this Agreement is not true and correct in all material respects when
        made and has resulted in, or is reasonably likely to result in, the
        failure to satisfy any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex
        I hereto, or Parent or Purchaser has failed to observe or perform in any
        material respect any of its material obligations under this Agreement;
        provided, that prior to exercising such right of termination pursuant to
        this Section 7.1(c)(i)(B), the Company has provided prompt written
        notice to Parent of such misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
        failure to observe or perform; provided, further, that the Company shall

        three (3) Business Days following such delivery (it being agreed that,
        in such event, the Offer shall be extended as necessary at least until
        the end of such cure period); provided, however, that the right to
        terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(i)(B) shall not
        be available if the Company is in material breach of any of its
        obligations hereunder; or

             (ii) if Parent or Purchaser has terminated the Offer, or the Offer
        has expired without Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, purchasing
        any Shares pursuant thereto; provided, however, that the right to
        terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(ii) shall not
        be available if the Company is in material breach of any of its

        accordance with the terms of the Offer; provided, however, that the
        right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(iii)
        shall not be available if the Company is in material breach of any of
        its obligations hereunder.

          (d) by Parent and Purchaser, if neither Parent nor Purchaser is in
     material breach of any of their respective obligations hereunder and:

             (i) an event has occurred or failed to occur, which event if
        occurring or failing to occur after the commencement of the Offer would
        result in a failure to satisfy any of the conditions to the Offer set
        forth in Annex I hereto, and Parent or Purchaser fails to commence the
        Offer on or prior to ten (10) Business Days following the date of the
        initial public announcement of the Offer;

             (ii) (A) (1) the Company's Board of Directors has withdrawn,

        executed, or has announced its intention to enter into, an agreement in
        principle or definitive agreement relating to any Third Party
        Acquisition with any Third Party (or the Company's Board of Directors
        resolves to do any of the foregoing);

             (B) any Third Party has become, after the date hereof, the

        or

             (C) any representation or warranty made by the Company in this
        Agreement is not true and correct when made and has resulted in, or is
        reasonably likely to result in, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company
        or the failure to satisfy any of the conditions to the Offer set forth
        in Annex I hereto, or the Company has failed to observe or perform in
        any material respect any of its material obligations under this
        Agreement; provided, that prior to exercising such right of termination
        pursuant to this Section 7.1(d)(ii)(C), Parent and Purchaser have
        provided prompt written notice to the Company of such misrepresentation,
        breach of warranty or failure to observe or perform; provided, further,
        that neither Parent nor Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this
        Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(d)(ii)(C) if the condition
        resulting in such misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure to
        observe or perform is cured (1) in the event such notice is delivered on
        or prior to the fourth (4th) Business Day prior to the then-scheduled
        Expiration Date, not later than the earlier of (y) such Expiration Date
        and (z) ten (10) Business Days following delivery of such notice and (2)
        in the event such notice is delivered on or after the third (3rd)
        Business Day prior to the then-scheduled Expiration Date, not later than
        three (3) Business Days following such delivery (it being agreed that,
        in such event, the Offer shall be extended as necessary at least until
        the end of such cure period).

                                       B-30

     SECTION 7.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination and
abandonment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect without any liability on the part of
any party hereto or its affiliates, directors, officers or stockholders other
than the provisions of Sections 5.3(b), 7.2 and 7.3 hereof. Nothing contained in
this Section 7.2 will relieve any party from liability for any breach of its
covenants, agreements or obligations set forth in this Agreement.

     SECTION 7.3. Fees and Expenses.

     (a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to:

          (i) Sections 7.1(c)(i)(A), (d)(ii)(A) or (d)(ii)(B);

          (ii) Section 7.1(d)(ii)(C) and within twelve (12) months thereafter
     the Company enters into an agreement with respect to a Third Party
     Acquisition or a Third Party Acquisition occurs involving any party (or any
     affiliate thereof) (A) with whom the Company (or its agents) had
     negotiations with a view to a Third Party Acquisition; (B) to whom the
     Company (or its agents) furnished information with a view to a Third Party
     Acquisition; or (C) who had submitted a proposal for a Third Party
     Acquisition, in the case of each of clauses (A), (B) and (C), after the
     date hereof and prior to such termination; or

          (iii) Section 7.1(b)(ii) at a time when (A) the Minimum Condition is
     not satisfied; (B) there shall be outstanding a publicly announced offer by
     a Third Party to complete a Third Party Acquisition; and (C) no other
     condition to the Offer is unsatisfied, and within twelve (12) months
     thereafter the Company enters into an agreement with respect to a Third
     Party Acquisition or a Third Party Acquisition occurs, in either case
     involving the Third Party referred to above;

then Parent and Purchaser would suffer direct and substantial damages, which
damages cannot be determined with reasonable certainty. To compensate Parent and
Purchaser for such damages the Company shall pay to Parent the amount of
$4,000,000.00 as liquidated damages within five (5) Business Days (or such
lesser time as may be specified herein) following (x) such termination referred
to in Section 7.3(a)(i) or (y) the entering into of the agreement for a Third
Party Acquisition or the occurrence of the Third Party Acquisition which
triggers the obligation to make the payment pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(ii) or
(iii). Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the amount to be paid
pursuant to this Section 7.3(a) represents liquidated damages and not a penalty.

     (b) In addition, if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(c)(i)(A) or if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(ii), the Company shall reimburse Parent, Purchaser and their affiliates
(not later than five (5) Business Days after submission to the Company of
written statements therefor) for all out-of-pocket fees and expenses actually
incurred by any of them in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby (including, without
limitation, fees and costs payable to investment bankers and their legal counsel
and to legal counsel, accountants and financial printers engaged by Parent,
Purchaser or their affiliates); provided, however, that the Company will not be
liable hereunder for any fees and expenses in excess of $2,000,000.00; provided
further that in no event shall the amounts paid pursuant to this Section 7.3(b)
and the amounts paid pursuant to Section 7.3(a) exceed an aggregate of
$5,000,000.00.

     (c) Except as specifically provided in this Section 7.3, each party shall
bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

                                   ARTICLE 8

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

     SECTION 8.1. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by
the Company, Parent and Purchaser at any time before or after approval of the
Merger by the stockholders of the Company but, after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made which requires the approval of such stockholders under
applicable law without such approval. This Agreement, including the Company
Disclosure Schedule and the

                                       B-31

other attachments hereto, may be amended only by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

     SECTION 8.2. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
each party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other party; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any
document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto; or (c) waive
compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of any party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument, in writing, signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its
rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

     SECTION 8.3. Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties. The
representations and warranties made herein shall not survive beyond the earlier
of the Effective Time or a termination of this Agreement. This Section 8.3 shall
not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties hereto that by its terms
requires performance after the Effective Time.

     SECTION 8.4. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the Company
Disclosure Schedule and the other attachments hereto, and the Confidentiality
Agreement referred to in Section 5.3(b) constitute the entire agreement between
the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
other prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings both written and
oral between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

     SECTION 8.5. Binding Effect; Assignability. This Agreement and all of the
provisions hereof will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder may be
assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the
other parties, nor is this Agreement intended to confer upon any other person
except the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder; provided, however,
that Purchaser may assign any or all of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to any subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment will relieve
Purchaser of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such
obligations.

     SECTION 8.6. Validity. This Agreement will be severable, and the invalidity
or unenforceability of any term or provision hereof will not affect the validity
or enforceability of this Agreement or of any other term or provision hereof, so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby
are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Furthermore, in
lieu of any invalid or unenforceable term or provision, the parties hereto
intend that there be added as a part of this Agreement a valid and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such invalid or unenforceable provision as may
be possible.

     SECTION 8.7. Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given (and shall be
deemed to have been duly given upon receipt) by delivery in person, by facsimile
