Dear Sensory Science Stockholder:

     You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of stockholders of
Sensory Science Corporation, which will begin at   :   .m., local time, on
day,             , 2001 at                          . At the special meeting,
you will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve and adopt the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 31, 2001, among Sensory
Science, SONICblue Incorporated and Phoenix I Acquisition Corp., a subsidiary of
SONICblue, and the merger, as described in the attached proxy
statement/prospectus. SONICblue is a leader in the converging Internet, digital
media and consumer device markets. SONICblue holds significant financial assets,
global marketing capabilities and a focused technology portfolio that includes
Rio(R) digital audio players, HomeFree(TM) home networking solutions,
Diamond(TM) Internet access products and frontpath(TM) Information Applications.
As a result of the merger, Sensory Science will become a wholly owned subsidiary
of SONICblue.

     If the merger is completed, holders of Sensory Science common stock will
receive 0.0913 of a share of SONICblue common stock for each share of Sensory
Science common stock that they hold, based on the current market price of
SONICblue's common stock, subject to downward adjustment if SONICblue's stock
price increases prior to the closing of the merger. However, Sensory Science
stockholders will receive at least 0.0710 of a share of SONICblue common stock
for each share of Sensory Science common stock that they hold. SONICblue
stockholders will continue to own their existing shares after the merger.
SONICblue stock, after the closing of the merger, will continue to be SONICblue
stock. SONICblue will issue approximately        million shares of SONICblue
common stock to Sensory Science stockholders in the merger, based on the number
of outstanding shares of Sensory Science on                , 2001. These shares
will represent approximately      % of the outstanding SONICblue common stock
after the merger. Shares of SONICblue common stock will be listed on the Nasdaq
National Market under the ticker symbol "SBLU."

     The Sensory Science Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR
approval of the merger and the merger agreement.

     We cannot complete the merger unless Sensory Science stockholders approve
the merger. YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. Approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and approval of the merger requires the affirmative vote of at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of Sensory Science common stock. Whether or
not you plan to attend the meeting, it is critical that your shares be
represented. Accordingly, please mark, date, sign and return promptly your proxy
in the enclosed envelope. You may attend the meeting and vote your shares in
person if you wish, even if you have previously returned your proxy.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGER ON PAGE 12, CAREFULLY BEFORE VOTING.

WHY WE RECOMMEND THE MERGER

We recommend the merger because we believe that the resultant company will be
able to offer a strengthened product portfolio with expanded distribution
channels.

To review a more detailed explanation of our reasons for the merger, see pages
31 through 35.

The Sensory Science board believes that the merger is advisable, fair to you and
in your best interest and recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the
merger agreement and the merger.

OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR (SEE PAGES 35 THROUGH 41)

In deciding to approve the merger, the Sensory Science board considered the
opinion of Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co., Inc., its financial advisor. Sensory
Science received an opinion from Gerard Klauer Mattison dated January 31, 2001
as to the fairness of the exchange ratio to the holders of Sensory Science
common stock from a financial point of view. This opinion is attached as Annex
D. You may read this opinion for a discussion of the assumptions made, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with its
opinion.

WHAT YOU WILL RECEIVE IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 79)

Based on the price of SONICblue's common stock on April 18, 2001, Sensory
Science stockholders would receive 0.0913 of a share of SONICblue common stock
for each share of Sensory Science common stock that they hold.

Assuming the average price of SONICblue's common stock in the ten trading days
immediately prior to the effective time is equal to or below $5.5213, as a
result of the merger, Sensory Science stockholders will receive 0.0913 of a
share of SONICblue common stock for each share of Sensory Science common stock.
This exchange ratio is subject to adjustment as discussed below.

If, in the ten trading days immediately prior to the effective time, SONICblue's
stock price is between $5.5213 and $7.0988, the exchange ratio will be equal to
$0.504 divided by the trading average for the ten days. If SONICblue's average
stock price for the ten trading days is equal to or above $7.0988, the exchange
ratio will be 0.0710.

SONICblue will not issue any fractional shares. SONICblue will pool and sell all
of the fractional interests in SONICblue common stock. Sensory Science
stockholders will receive a cash payment in the amount of the proceeds from this
sale of their fractional shares in the market.

Examples:

  - Assuming the average stock price of SONICblue's common stock in the ten
    trading days immediately prior to the effective time is $5.25, below
    $5.5213, the exchange ratio is 0.0913. If you own 500 shares of Sensory
    Science common stock, you will receive 45 shares of SONICblue common stock
    and a cash payment for the sale proceeds of 0.65 of one share of SONICblue
    common stock, rounded to the nearest one cent. The value of the stock that
    you will receive will change as the price of SONICblue common stock changes
    after the merger.

  - Assuming the average stock price of SONICblue's common stock in the ten
    trading days immediately prior to the effective time is $6.25, which is
    between $5.5213 and $7.0988, the exchange ratio will be .0806. If you own
    500 shares of Sensory Science common stock, you will receive 40 shares of
    SONICblue common stock and a cash payment for the sale proceeds of 0.30 of
    one share of SONICblue common stock, rounded to the nearest one cent. The
    value of the stock that you will receive will change as the price of
    SONICblue common stock changes after the merger.

  - Assuming the average stock price of SONICblue's common stock in the ten
    trading days immediately prior to the effective time is $7.25, which is
    above $7.0988, the exchange ratio will be 0.0710. If you own 500 shares of
    Sensory Science common stock, then after the merger you will receive 35
    shares of SONICblue common stock and a cash payment for the sale proceeds
    for 0.50 of one share of SONICblue common stock, rounded to the nearest one
    cent. The value of the stock that you will receive will change as the price
    of SONICblue common stock changes after the merger.

  - On             , 2001, the last per-share sales price of SONICblue common
    stock on the Nasdaq National Market was $          . Applying the exchange
    ratio of        to the last SONICblue per-share sales price, holders of
    Sensory Science common stock would be entitled to receive SONICblue common
    stock with a market value of approximately $          for each share of
    Sensory Science common stock. However, the market prices for Sensory Science
    and SONICblue common stock and the exchange ratio are likely to change
    before the merger. You are urged to obtain current price quotes for Sensory
    Science and SONICblue common stock. See "Risk Factors" on page 12.

The shares of SONICblue common stock will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq
National Market under the ticker symbol "SBLU."

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (SEE PAGE 42)

The merger is intended to qualify as a nontaxable transaction, and we expect
that the exchange of your shares of Sensory Science stock for shares of
SONICblue stock will generally not cause you to recognize any gain or loss for
federal income tax purposes. You will, however, have to recognize gain, if any,
in connection with any cash you receive in lieu of fractional shares of
SONICblue stock.

Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences of the merger to you
will depend on the facts of your own situation. You should consult with your own
tax advisor for a full understanding of all tax consequences of the merger to
you.

OWNERSHIP OF SONICBLUE AFTER THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 74)

Applying an exchange ratio of 0.0913, SONICblue will issue approximately 1.3
million shares of its common stock to Sensory Science stockholders in the
merger. The shares of SONICblue common stock to be issued to Sensory Science
stockholders in the merger will represent approximately   % of the outstanding
SONICblue common stock after the merger. This information is based on the number
of SONICblue and Sensory Science shares outstanding on             , 2001 and
does not take into account stock options or other equity-based awards or any
other shares which may be issued before the merger.

STOCKHOLDER VOTE REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 87)

Approval of the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Sensory Science common stock. As of the record date,
Sensory Science's directors, executive officers and their affiliates
beneficially owned in

the aggregate                of Sensory Science's outstanding common stock
entitled to vote at the Sensory Science stockholders meeting.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE (SEE PAGES 43 AND 87)

The holders of Sensory Science common stock do not have any right to an
appraisal of the value of their shares in connection with the merger.

THE INTERESTS OF CERTAIN SENSORY SCIENCE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE MERGER
MAY DIFFER FROM YOUR INTERESTS (SEE PAGE 44)

When you consider the Sensory Science board's recommendation that Sensory
Science stockholders vote in favor of the merger, you should be aware that a
number of Sensory Science officers and directors may have interests in the
merger that may be different from, or in addition to, yours.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (SEE PAGE 41)

We expect the merger to be accounted for as a purchase.

COMPLETION OF THE MERGER IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS (SEE PAGE 83)

The completion of the merger depends upon meeting a number of conditions,
including the following:

  - approval of the merger by the stockholders of Sensory Science;

  - absence of any law or court order prohibiting the merger;

  - receipt of an opinion of counsel that the merger will qualify as a
    reorganization for tax purposes;

  - absence of a material adverse effect on SONICblue or Sensory Science during
    the period from January 31, 2001 until the closing of the merger; and

  - material accuracy as of closing of the representations and warranties made
    by SONICblue and Sensory Science, respectively.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT MAY BE TERMINATED (SEE PAGE 84)

Either SONICblue or Sensory Science can terminate the merger agreement if any of
the following occurs:

  - we do not complete the merger by the end date, September 30, 2001;

  - Sensory Science stockholders do not approve the transaction;

  - a law or court order permanently prohibits the merger; or

  - a material breach by either party of one of the covenants, representations
    or warranties in the merger agreement which remains uncured for 30 days
    after delivery of written notice of a breach.

Neither party can terminate the merger agreement for the reasons described in
the first bullet above if the merger has not closed because that party is in
material breach of its obligations under the merger agreement.

FEES MAY BE PAYABLE ON TERMINATION (SEE PAGE 84)

Sensory Science must pay SONICblue a termination fee of $404,000 in cash if the
merger agreement is terminated in any of the following circumstances:

  - Sensory Science breached a covenant, representation or warranty that
    remained uncured;

  - Sensory Science stockholders do not approve the merger and prior to the
    Sensory Science stockholders' meeting a proposal by a third party for an
    alternative transaction was made to Sensory Science or its stockholders; or

  - a proposal by a third party for an alternative transaction was made to
    Sensory Science or its stockholders and the merger agreement is thereafter
    terminated because the merger is not completed by September 30, 2001.

CREDIT AGREEMENT AND WARRANT ISSUED BY SENSORY SCIENCE (SEE PAGES 85-86)

SONICblue and Sensory Science have entered into a credit agreement, under which
SONICblue has agreed to lend up to $3 million to Sensory Science. The credit
agreement details the means

by which Sensory Science may request loans, and specifies that $500,000 of the
proceeds must be used for Sensory Science's iCache line of business. In
connection with the loan, Sensory Science has granted SONICblue a warrant to
purchase up to 5,357,143 shares of its common stock, which on an as-if assumed
basis is approximately 27% of Sensory Science's outstanding common stock on
April 11, 2001. The warrant terminates on the later to happen of the first
anniversary of SONICblue's loan to Sensory Science, or the date on which Sensory
Science's indebtedness to SONICblue is paid in full. The credit agreement, as
amended, is attached as Annex B and the common stock purchase warrant is
attached as Annex C. We encourage you to read them.

SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL DATA

     The following selected unaudited pro forma combined financial data have
been derived from and should be read together with the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements and related notes beginning on page 46.
This information is based on the historical consolidated balance sheets and
related historical consolidated statements of operations of SONICblue and
Sensory Science giving effect to the merger using the purchase method of
accounting for business combinations. This information also gives effect to
SONICblue's pending acquisition of ReplayTV, Inc. and the transfer of
SONICblue's graphics chips assets to S3 Graphics Co., Ltd., a joint venture
between VIA Technologies, Inc. and a wholly owned subsidiary of SONICblue, which
was completed in January 2001. This information assumes the proposed merger, the
proposed acquisition of ReplayTV and the transfer to S3 Graphics Co., Ltd.
occurred on January 1, 2000. This information is for illustrative purposes only.
The companies may have performed differently had they always been combined. You
should not rely on the selected unaudited pro forma combined financial data as
being indicative of the historical results that would have been achieved had the
companies always been combined or the future results that the combined company
will experience after the merger.

HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA PER SHARE DATA

     Set forth below are the net income (loss) and book value per common share
data separately for SONICblue and Sensory Science on a historical basis, for
SONICblue on a pro forma combined basis and on a pro forma combined basis per
Sensory Science equivalent share. The net loss per common share for Sensory
Science for the year ended December 31, 2000 was derived by adding the results
for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 with the results for the three
months ended March 31, 2000. The exchange ratio for the merger is 0.0913 of a
share of SONICblue common stock for each share of Sensory Science common stock,
subject to adjustment.

     The SONICblue pro forma data was derived by combining the historical
consolidated financial information of SONICblue, Sensory Science, and ReplayTV
using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations and reflecting
the disposition of graphics chips assets to VIA as described under "Unaudited
Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements" beginning on page 46.

     The Sensory Science equivalent share pro forma information shows the effect
of the merger from the perspective of an owner of Sensory Science common stock.
For purposes of the selected unaudited pro forma combined financial data, we
have assumed that 0.0913 shares of SONICblue common stock will be

exchanged for each outstanding share of Sensory Science common stock. See "The
Merger Agreement" beginning on page 79 for a detailed description of the
conversion ratio.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     In addition to the other information that we have included in this proxy
statement/prospectus, you should carefully read and consider the following
factors in evaluating the proposal to be voted on at the special meeting of
Sensory Science stockholders.

RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE MERGER

SONICBLUE WILL FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN INTEGRATING SENSORY SCIENCE AND,
AS A RESULT, MAY NOT REALIZE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS OF THE MERGER.

     In deciding that the merger is in the best interests of our respective
stockholders, the SONICblue board of directors and the Sensory Science board of
directors considered the potential complementary effects of combining our
companies. However, the process of integrating separate businesses, especially
businesses as geographically separated as Sensory Science, located in Arizona,
and SONICblue, located in California, involves a number of special risks,
including:

     - the possibility that the business cultures of our two companies may not
       be compatible;

     - the diversion of limited management resources from regular business
       concerns to integration considerations;

     - unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems;

     - challenges in retaining the employees of Sensory Science;

     - difficulties in retaining customers and contract manufacturers;

     - potential adverse effects on operating results; and

     - the possibility that the benefits expected from the merger may not
       materialize.

     If we are unable to effectively integrate our two companies, the benefits
of the merger will not be realized and, as a result, SONICblue's operating
results and the market price of SONICblue's common stock may be adversely
affected.

THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF SONICBLUE COMMON STOCK RECEIVED BY SENSORY SCIENCE
STOCKHOLDERS WILL FLUCTUATE BETWEEN 0.0710 AND 0.0913 OF A SHARE OF SONICBLUE
COMMON STOCK FOR EACH SHARE OF SENSORY SCIENCE COMMON STOCK. THE VALUE OF THE
SONICBLUE COMMON STOCK THAT SENSORY SCIENCE STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE WILL CHANGE AS
THE PRICE OF SONICBLUE COMMON STOCK CHANGES PRIOR TO THE MERGER.

     Upon consummation of the merger, each share of Sensory Science common stock
will be converted into a fraction of a share of SONICblue common stock equal to
the exchange ratio. If the average closing sale price of SONICblue common stock
during the ten trading day period ending on the trading day immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger is less than $7.0988 but more than $5.5213, the
exchange ratio will be calculated by dividing $0.504 by the average closing sale
price. If the average closing sale price is equal to or less than $5.5213, the
exchange ratio will be 0.0913. However, if the average closing price is equal to
or greater than $7.0988, the exchange ratio will be 0.0710. Therefore, while the
exchange ratio, which determines the number of shares of SONICblue common stock
you will receive, has a 0.0710 minimum and is subject to fluctuation to adjust
for changes in SONICblue common stock between $7.0988 and $5.5213, you will not
receive a greater number of shares if SONICblue's common stock falls below
$5.5213.

     Sensory Science cannot terminate the merger agreement on the basis that
SONICblue's stock price falls below $5.5213. Fluctuations in the trading price
of SONICblue's common stock cannot be predicted during any period, including the
ten day trading period prior to the effective time.

     There will be no other adjustments for changes in the market price of
either Sensory Science common stock or SONICblue common stock outside this
specified trading range, and neither SONICblue nor Sensory Science is permitted
to abandon the merger nor is Sensory Science permitted to resolicit the

vote of its stockholders solely because of changes in the market price of
SONICblue or Sensory Science common stock. Accordingly, the specific dollar
value of SONICblue common stock you will receive upon completion of the merger
will depend on the market value of SONICblue common stock for the ten day
trading period prior to the completion of the merger. The market price of
SONICblue's common stock has historically been extremely volatile, and you
should expect it to continue to be volatile. You should consult a stock price
listing to determine the value of the SONICblue common stock to be issued in the
merger.

RISK FACTORS RELATED TO SENSORY SCIENCE IF THE MERGER IS NOT CONSUMMATED

SENSORY SCIENCE MAY BE UNABLE TO SECURE ALTERNATIVE FINANCING IN SUFFICIENT TIME
TO PROVIDE WORKING CAPITAL TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS AND AVOID ACTIONS THAT WOULD
SEVERELY IMPAIR SENSORY SCIENCE'S FUTURE VIABILITY.

     In recent periods, sales of Sensory Science's products have declined,
leading to deterioration in its financial condition and decreases in the value
of Sensory Science's common stock. Sensory Science's product sales have not
generated sufficient cash for it to operate effectively or to fund necessary
marketing, inventory purchase and product development programs.

     If the merger is not consummated, Sensory Science will attempt to
restructure, with the assistance of its major suppliers, to support these
suppliers' distribution needs. Should these parties be unable or unwilling to
provide Sensory Science with sufficient working capital, Sensory Science may be
unable to secure alternative financing. As a result, Sensory Science will likely
incur ongoing operating expenses, other cash needs and liquidity constraints
that will impair its ability to purchase products for sale and thereafter its
ability to continue operations. Under those circumstances, Sensory Science would
become increasingly unable to meet current financial obligations and could
consequently face creditor foreclosure on its assets.

A CHANGE IN FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SENSORY SCIENCE'S
LIQUIDITY.

     Sensory Science funds its cash requirements through a combination of cash
flows from operations, loans under a line of credit from Congress Financial
Corporation, a line of credit from a major supplier and a loan from SONICblue.
During its fiscal year, the seasonality of Sensory Science's product sales
generally requires incremental investments in working capital, primarily in
inventories and receivables. Sensory Science's primary source of funds for
financing its operations is the Congress line of credit, under which Sensory
Science may borrow up to a maximum of $30.0 million, limited by a borrowing base
determined by specific inventory and receivable balances. The Congress line of
credit, as amended, expires in November 2002, at which time Sensory Science may
have to enter into a new line of credit. Sensory Science has also fully utilized
its line of credit with a major supplier. In connection with the merger,
SONICblue loaned Sensory Science $3.0 million with a one year term, subject to
certain conditions. Sensory Science's ability to purchase products sold in the
marketplace to meet customer demand has been severely limited by the
unavailability of funds under its lines of credit and its inability to obtain
additional financing. An adverse change in Sensory Science's credit
arrangements, combined with the likely difficulty in obtaining alternative
funding, would have a material adverse affect on Sensory Science's liquidity.

PRICE CUTTING IN RESPONSE TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES COULD RESULT IN DECREASING
PROFIT MARGINS AND DETERIORATING OPERATING RESULTS FOR SENSORY SCIENCE.

     The consumer electronics industry is subject to significant price
competition. From time to time, Sensory Science has reduced the prices for some
of its products to respond to competitive and consumer pressures and to maintain
market share. Any further reductions in Sensory Science's prices to respond to
these pressures would have an adverse impact on its profit margins and
liquidity. In addition, if Sensory Science's sales volumes fail to grow
sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins, its results of operations would
be materially adversely affected. The impact of these factors increases if
Sensory Science does not have the resources to continue to develop new digital
consumer products and otherwise respond to issues relating to the future
obsolescence of the VCR as the primary home video recording device. Sensory
Science believes that a more diversified product portfolio that would occur as a
result of the merger may

mitigate the adverse impact of decreasing margins. A failure to consummate the
merger may therefore expose Sensory Science to more adverse effects of
decreasing margins than would be experienced if the merger is consummated.

THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A FAILURE TO CONSUMMATE THE MERGER MAY MAKE IT HARDER FOR
SENSORY SCIENCE TO OBTAIN PRODUCTS FOR SALE AND MAINTAIN ITS DISTRIBUTION
CHANNELS, IMPAIRING SENSORY SCIENCE'S OPERATING RESULTS.

     If the merger is not consummated, Sensory Science's suppliers and
distributors may become less willing to invest time and resources in Sensory
Science's operations because of Sensory Science's existing liquidity concerns.
Any diminution in Sensory Science's ability to obtain products for sale or sales
support in its distribution channels could adversely affect Sensory Science's
sales and operating margins.

RISK FACTORS RELATED TO SONICBLUE

SONICBLUE HAS RECENTLY CHANGED THE FOCUS OF ITS BUSINESS AND MAY BE UNSUCCESSFUL
OR EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES IN IMPLEMENTING THIS CHANGE. IF THIS OCCURS,
SONICBLUE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE OPERATING PROFITABILITY.

     In January 2001, SONICblue completed the transfer of its graphics chips
business to S3 Graphics Co., Ltd., a joint venture between VIA Technologies,
Inc. and a wholly owned subsidiary of SONICblue. SONICblue is realigning its
resources to focus on its digital media, consumer electronics, Internet
appliance and home networking businesses. SONICblue has a limited operating
history with these businesses, and its shift in focus may prove to be
unsuccessful. In addition, the industry is new and continually evolving.
SONICblue's digital media, consumer electronics, Internet appliance and home
networking businesses compete with larger, more established competitors, and
SONICblue may be unable to achieve market success. SONICblue's profitability
depends on its ability to successfully implement its new business strategy.

SONICBLUE EXPERIENCED NET OPERATING LOSSES IN THE PAST AND MAY EXPERIENCE NET
OPERATING LOSSES AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.

     SONICblue had net income of $312.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2000, primarily from recognizing a one time gain of $884.2 million on the United
Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC, shares but not as a result of income from
operations. SONICblue had a net loss of $30.8 million for 1999, and SONICblue's
sales during that time consisted of primarily older generation and lower price
products that were sold into markets with significant price competition. With
the completion of the transfer of SONICblue's graphics chips business,
SONICblue's ability to achieve operating profitability depends on its success in
refocusing its business resources and in executing its business plan for its
refocused business. In addition, SONICblue must achieve positive gross margins
at a level sufficient to offset its operating expenses. SONICblue experienced
negative gross margins in 2000 and could continue to experience negative gross
margins. SONICblue cannot assure you that it will be able to achieve operating
profitability. If SONICblue is unable to achieve operating profitability or
incurs future losses and negative cash flow, its stock price would likely
decline.

SONICBLUE DEVELOPS AUDIO PRODUCTS FOR A NEW MARKET, WHICH MAY NOT DEVELOP IF
CONSUMERS DO NOT ACCEPT DIGITAL AUDIO AS THEIR PREFERRED METHOD OF LISTENING TO
MUSIC.

     The market for digital audio products is new and evolving. SONICblue's
digital audio products play music that consumers download from the Internet or
CDs. The success of SONICblue's digital audio products depends in part on
consumers using the Internet, rather than using solely traditional sources, such
as record stores where they buy CDs or cassette tapes, as a source of music. If
consumers do not access music on the Internet, or from their CDs, and download
it for use on SONICblue's products, a market for SONICblue's products may not
develop or may be limited.

A REDUCTION IN THE AVAILABILITY OR EASE OF DOWNLOADING MUSIC FROM THE INTERNET
WILL HURT THE SALES OF SONICBLUE'S PRODUCTS.

     SONICblue's digital audio products play music downloaded from the Internet
and CDs. Currently, litigation is pending that could decrease the availability
of downloadable music available on the Internet. The five major record companies
have sued Napster.com, an Internet service that allows its users to swap songs.
The lawsuits maintain that the swapping of music between different users free of
charge is a violation of the copyright laws in the United States. If the record
companies prevail in the litigation, and Napster or companies offering similar
services are forced to limit the selection of music available for download or
are forced to go out of business, there would be a reduction in the amount of
music available to consumers on the Internet. In March 2001, the court issued an
injunction that orders Napster to police the trading of songs on its web site.

     Some web sites and record companies are working to provide fee-based
downloading of copyright-protected music files. If these web sites are
unsuccessful in providing copyright-protected music files or if consumers find
the downloading too difficult or expensive, acceptance of the Internet as a
source of music would decline. In addition, the rate at which the major record
companies make their music available for digital purchases may discourage the
use of digital audio players or reduce SONICblue's sales. Some record companies
and Internet companies have announced plans to create CDs or digital music that
cannot be copied or can only be copied a limited number of times, which would
also limit the ability of users to download music from their own CD collections
or share their music with others. New copyright protection measures, such as
these, increased fees associated with making multiple copies of music from
personal collections, or changes in copyright laws, could diminish the ability
of consumers to download music to Rio players. Reductions in the availability or
ease of downloading music from the Internet, or limitations on copying from
personal CDs, could impair the use and sale of SONICblue's digital audio
products.

SONICBLUE HISTORICALLY HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT CONCENTRATION AND CURRENTLY
DEPENDS ON THE HEALTH OF THE DIGITAL AUDIO PLAYER MARKET. THIS MEANS THAT A
DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR A SINGLE PRODUCT, OR IN THE DIGITAL AUDIO PLAYER AND
CONSUMER ELECTRONICS MARKET IN GENERAL, COULD SEVERELY IMPACT SONICBLUE'S
OVERALL REVENUES AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

     SONICblue's revenues have historically been dependent on the markets for
graphics/video chips for PCs and on its ability to compete in those markets.
With the completion of the transfer of the graphics chips assets to a joint
venture between VIA and a wholly owned subsidiary of SONICblue, SONICblue's
remaining businesses continue to have significant product concentration.
SONICblue is dependent on the markets for digital audio players, modems, home
networking and other consumer electronics products. SONICblue's business would
be materially harmed if it were unsuccessful in selling digital audio players,
including its Rio players. Historically, over 75% of the net sales of
SONICblue's subsidiary, Diamond, have come from sales of graphics and video
accelerator subsystems. Excluding the graphics board business, the Rio players
have historically accounted for over 90% of the remainder of Diamond's sales. In
2000, Rio players and products accounted for 12.2% of SONICblue's net sales. A
decline in demand or average selling prices for digital audio players, modem and
home networking products would have a material adverse effect on SONICblue's
sales and operating results.

BECAUSE SONICBLUE'S LARGEST FINANCIAL ASSET IS ITS SHARES OF UNITED
MICROELECTRONICS CORPORATION, THE VOLATILITY OF SONICBLUE COMMON STOCK MAY BE
INFLUENCED BY THE VOLATILITY OF UMC'S STOCK PRICE.

     SONICblue's largest financial asset is its UMC shares. The market price of
UMC's stock is subject to volatility due to general market conditions as well as
actual or anticipated changes in UMC's business prospects or quarterly or yearly
operating results. The downturn in the semiconductor industry and the economy in
general appears to be more severe than previously anticipated. There is a great
deal of uncertainty regarding when the semiconductor industry will recover from
this down cycle. Because the UMC shares are SONICblue's largest asset, when the
price per share of UMC's stock increases or declines, the price of SONICblue's
common stock on the Nasdaq National Market tends to follow

changes in UMC's stock price. Fluctuations in the price of SONICblue common
stock caused by changes in UMC's stock price may or may not reflect SONICblue's
actual or anticipated business prospects or quarterly results. Also,
fluctuations in UMC's stock price may cause fluctuations in SONICblue's stock
price when there is no material news regarding SONICblue or any change in its
results.

BECAUSE THE PRICE OF THE UMC SHARES HAS DECLINED SINCE SONICBLUE RECORDED THEIR
CARRYING VALUE, SONICBLUE MAY NEED TO REPORT A LOSS IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE
IF IT DETERMINES THAT THE DECLINE IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS NOT
TEMPORARY.

     At December 31, 2000, the carrying value of the UMC shares on SONICblue's
consolidated balance sheet was $635.0 million, and the market value of both
SONICblue's short-term and long-term investment in UMC had declined to $407.2
million. It was determined that the decline from the carrying value at December
31, 2000 and the original cost basis was related to the downturn in the
semiconductor industry as a whole and was temporary in nature due to the
historically cyclical nature of the industry. Subsequent to year end, the market
value of the investment in UMC remained significantly below cost. As of March
31, 2001, SONICblue's 252 million UMC shares held as of that date were worth
approximately $408 million, based on the closing price of UMC shares on the
Taiwan Stock Exchange on that date and the U.S. dollar to New Taiwan Dollar
exchange rate prevailing on that date. The downturn in the semiconductor
industry and the economy in general appears to be more severe than previously
anticipated. There is a great deal of uncertainty regarding when the
semiconductor industry will recover from this down cycle. Should SONICblue
conclude that the decline in value is other than temporary, it will report a
significant loss in other income and expense at that time. Fluctuations in the
value of SONICblue's portfolio investments, including the UMC shares, could
negatively impact SONICblue's financial condition.

THE INFORMATION APPLIANCE MARKET IS NEW AND EVOLVING, AND SONICBLUE'S FRONTPATH
SUBSIDIARY MAY NOT SUCCEED IN DEVELOPING AND BRINGING TO MARKET INFORMATION
APPLIANCES FOR THE HOME AND VERTICAL MARKETS.

     SONICblue's frontpath subsidiary is engaged in the development of
information appliances. The market for information appliances is new and may not
develop as SONICblue anticipates, if at all. The potential size of this market
opportunity and the timing of its development are uncertain. Broad acceptance of
information appliances will depend on many factors, including the willingness of
large numbers of consumers to use devices other than PCs to access the Internet,
and the development of content and applications that are accessible from
information appliances.

     A number of companies who have attempted to develop and enter the
information appliance market have not succeeded in bringing products to market
or have discontinued them or scaled back their information appliance divisions.
frontpath's new product, ProGear, has been released in limited quantities but
has not yet been produced or deployed in volume. If frontpath is unable to
obtain manufacturing capacity and develop efficiencies to successfully produce
ProGear in volume, it will be unable to supply information appliances in the
vertical markets. frontpath's development of products for the home depends upon
its ability to successfully manufacture and deploy information appliances in
volume. If the market for information appliances does not develop or develops
more slowly than SONICblue anticipates, or if SONICblue fails to meet the demand
of that market or otherwise fails to achieve market penetration or price
stability for its information appliance products, frontpath will experience
losses that will harm SONICblue's operating results.

SALES OF DIGITAL MEDIA AND CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS DEPEND UPON THE WIDESPREAD
AVAILABILITY AND ADOPTION OF BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS.

     SONICblue's home networking products and digital audio players, as well as
future consumer-oriented frontpath information appliances, rely or will rely on
high-speed access to the Internet to provide compelling content. Since SONICblue
does not have control over the reliability, availability and quality of
broadband access and related services, it cannot guarantee that broadband access
will be available to all

consumers who wish to use information appliances. Factors that may impede market
acceptance of broadband services and products that rely on high-speed Internet
access include:

     - limited geographical service areas and lack of availability of
       cost-effective, high-speed service;

     - inconsistent quality and reliability of broadband service;

     - lack of interoperability among multiple vendors' network equipment;

     - congestion in service providers' networks; and

     - inability to meet demands for increasing bandwidth.

     These factors will likely affect SONICblue's ability to develop a market
for and obtain market acceptance of its products, particularly its information
appliances. frontpath has invested, and is continuing to invest, substantial
resources to develop its information appliances. frontpath would be unlikely to
generate significant revenues from sales of its information appliances, and will
have expended significant resources on products for which it is generating
limited or no revenues, if broadband access is not available and adopted on a
widespread basis.

SONICBLUE'S BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT ON THE INTERNET AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE.

     The acceptance and sale of SONICblue's products could decrease if the
infrastructure of the Internet does not continue to be developed and maintained.
For example, if consumers do not have the necessary speed and data capacity for
downloading music, rendering the Internet too slow of a method for obtaining
music, consumers may choose not to download music, which will decrease demand
for SONICblue's digital audio products. In addition, SONICblue's success will
depend in large part on increased use of the Internet which in turn can increase
demand for high-speed communications products and the products that benefit from
high-speed connections. SONICblue's success will also depend on businesses and
consumers using the Internet more frequently for applications that use
multimedia content and that require high bandwidth. Recent growth in Internet
use has caused frequent periods of performance degradation. Any perceived
degradation in the performance of the Internet as a whole could undermine the
benefits of SONICblue's connectivity and digital media products, such as
frontpath information appliances and Rio digital audio players. The performance
of SONICblue's products depends on the speed and reliability of the Internet
infrastructure itself. As a result, the emergence and growth of the market for
SONICblue's products will depend on improvements being made to the entire
Internet infrastructure.

THE JOINT VENTURE WITH VIA WILL REQUIRE SONICBLUE TO PAY SPECIFIED LIQUIDATED
DAMAGES IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR, AND EARN-OUT PAYMENTS TO SONICBLUE FROM THE
JOINT VENTURE ARE SUBJECT TO THE JOINT VENTURE MEETING AGGRESSIVE PROFITABILITY
GOALS.

     The investment agreement with VIA provides that, upon occurrence of certain
events, SONICblue will pay liquidated damages, subject to a maximum damages cap.
Despite the cap, liquidated damages payments could harm SONICblue's financial
condition or results of operations. In addition, SONICblue will receive earn-out
payments only if the new venture meets aggressive profitability goals specified
in the joint venture agreement. There can be no assurance that the joint venture
will be able to meet these profitability goals.

SONICBLUE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE GROWTH AND EXPANSION OF ITS
BUSINESS.

     In the past two years, and particularly following its merger with Diamond,
SONICblue has experienced a significant expansion in the overall level of its
business and the scope of its operations, including manufacturing, research and
development, marketing, technical support, customer service, sales

and logistics. This expansion has resulted in significant challenges, and a need
for substantial investment in, infrastructure, process development and
information systems, including:

     - attracting, integrating and retaining key employees;

     - integration of management information, product data management, internal
       control, accounting, telecommunications and networking systems;

     - establishment of a significant worldwide web and e-commerce presence;

     - consolidation of geographically dispersed manufacturing and distribution
       facilities;

     - coordination of suppliers, rationalization of distribution channels,
       establishment and documentation of business processes and procedures; and

     - integration of various functions and groups of employees.

     SONICblue may not successfully address these challenges. SONICblue's future
operating results will depend in large measure on its ability to implement
operating, manufacturing and financial procedures and controls, improve
communication and coordination among the different operating functions,
integrate functions such as sales, procurement and operations, strengthen
management information and telecommunications systems, and continue to hire
additional qualified personnel in key areas. SONICblue may be unable to manage
these activities and implement these additional procedures, controls and systems
successfully. Any failure to do so could cause SONICblue's short-term and
long-term operating results to suffer.

SONICBLUE'S QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL OPERATING RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS
CAUSED BY MANY FACTORS, ANY OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN SONICBLUE'S FAILURE TO
ACHIEVE ITS REVENUE OR PROFITABILITY EXPECTATIONS.

     SONICblue's quarterly and annual results of operations have varied
significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary in the future due
to a number of factors, many of which are beyond SONICblue's control. Any one or
more of the factors listed below or other factors could cause SONICblue to fail
to achieve its revenue or profitability expectations. The failure to meet market
expectations would likely cause a decline in SONICblue's stock price. These
factors include:

     - SONICblue's ability to develop, introduce, produce in volume quantities
       and market successfully new or enhanced products;

     - SONICblue's ability to introduce and market products in accordance with
       market demand and short design cycles;

     - changes in the relative volume of sales of various products with
       sometimes significantly different margins;

     - market acceptance of and changes in demand for SONICblue's products;

     - rapid changes in electronic commerce on which SONICblue or its customers
       may not capitalize or which erode SONICblue's current business base;

     - gains or losses of significant customers, distributors or strategic
       relationships;

     - unpredictable volume and timing of customer orders;

     - the availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components for
       SONICblue's products, including flash memory;

     - substantial disruption in SONICblue's suppliers' operations, either as a
       result of natural disaster, equipment failure or other cause;

     - fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or
       manufacturing yields and related manufacturing costs;

     - the timing of new technological advances, product announcements or
       introductions by SONICblue or by its competitors;

     - product obsolescence and the management of product transitions and
       inventory;

     - production delays;

     - decreases in the average selling prices of products;

     - rates of product return in excess of those forecasted or expected;

     - seasonal fluctuations in sales;

     - general consumer electronics industry conditions, including changes in
       demand and associated effects on inventory and inventory practices; and

     - general economic conditions, including economic conditions in North
       America, Asia and Europe in particular, that could affect the timing of
       customer orders and capital spending and result in order cancellations or
       rescheduling.

     Some or all of these factors could adversely affect demand for SONICblue's
products and its future operating results.

     Most of SONICblue's operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short
term. SONICblue may be unable to rapidly adjust spending to compensate for any
unexpected sales shortfall, which could harm its quarterly operating results.
Because the lead times of firm orders are typically short in the consumer
products industry, SONICblue does not have the ability to predict future
operating results with any certainty.

     Because of the above factors, you should not rely on period-to-period
comparisons of results of operations as an indication of future performance.

THE DEMAND FOR SONICBLUE'S PRODUCTS HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN WEAKER IN CERTAIN
QUARTERS, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO COMPARE ITS QUARTERLY RESULTS.

     Due to industry seasonality, demand for digital audio and other consumer
electronic products is strongest during the fourth quarter of each year and is
generally slower in the period from March through August. This seasonality may
become more pronounced and material in the future to the extent that:

     - a greater proportion of SONICblue's sales consist of sales into the
       retail/mass merchant channel;

     - SONICblue's net revenues become increasingly based on
       entertainment-related products, including products such as its Rio
       digital music players; or

     - to the extent SONICblue expands its European sales, it may experience
       relatively weak demand in the third calendar quarter due to historically
       weak summer sales in Europe.

     In addition, SONICblue generally ships more products in the third month of
each quarter than in either of the first two months of the quarter, with levels
of shipment in the third month being higher towards the end of the month. This
pattern is likely to continue and makes future quarterly operating results less
predictable. Because the consumer products market experiences substantial
seasonal fluctuations, with more sales occurring toward the end of the year,
SONICblue's quarterly results will be difficult to compare.

THE MARKETS IN WHICH SONICBLUE OPERATES ARE INTENSELY AND INCREASINGLY
COMPETITIVE, AND IF IT IS UNABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, ITS REVENUES COULD
DECLINE.

     The consumer digital media, consumer electronics, Internet appliance and
home networking markets in which SONICblue competes are intensely competitive
and are likely to become more competitive in the future. Because of this
competition, SONICblue faces a constant and increasing risk of losing customers
to its competitors. The competitive environment also creates downward pressure
on prices and requires higher

spending to address the competition, both of which tend to keep gross margins
lower. SONICblue believes that the principal competitive factors for its
products are:

     - performance and quality;

     - ability to conform and adapt to, or upgrade for, current and evolving
       industry standards, including audio formats;

     - access to customers and distribution channels;

     - reputation for quality and strength of brand;

     - manufacturing capabilities and cost of manufacturing;

     - price;

     - product support; and

     - ability to bring new products to the market in a timely manner.

     Many of SONICblue's current and potential competitors have substantially
greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and other
resources. Some of these competitors may also have greater name recognition and
market presence, longer operating histories, greater market power and product
breadth, lower cost structures and larger customer bases. As a result, these
competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies
and changes in customer requirements. In addition, some of SONICblue's principal
competitors may have the advantage of producing their own component parts and
therefore benefit from capacity, cost and technical advantages. For example,
Intel makes flash memory, a key component in digital audio players, and has
recently introduced a digital audio player.

     In some markets where SONICblue is a relatively new entrant, such as
modems, home networking, sound cards and consumer electronics, including digital
audio or Internet music players and Internet appliances, it faces dominant
competitors that include Compaq (Internet appliances and digital audio players),
3Com (home networking and modems), Creative Technology under the name Creative
Labs (modems and digital audio players), Handspring (personal digital
assistants, or PDAs, and digital audio player add-ons to PDAs), Gateway (home
networking, home network digital audio players and Internet appliances), Intel
(home networking and digital audio players), Motorola (Internet appliances and
handheld consumer electronics), Palm (PDAs), Samsung (digital audio players,
digital audio player mobile telephones and Internet appliances), Sony (consumer
electronic music, digital audio players and a recently announced Internet
appliance) and Thompson Multimedia (digital audio players). Some of SONICblue's
products face a variety of competitive sources. For example, digital audio
players compete against traditional stereos and CD players, and frontpath
information appliances face competition from manufacturers of stand alone
Internet appliances, wireless portable Internet appliances, PDAs, and
manufacturers of PCs. In addition, the markets in which SONICblue competes are
expected to become increasingly competitive as PC products support increasingly
more robust multimedia functions and companies that previously supplied products
providing distinct functions (for example, companies today primarily in the
sound, modem, microprocessor or motherboard markets) emerge as competitors
across broader or more integrated product categories.

SONICBLUE OPERATES IN MARKETS THAT ARE HIGHLY CYCLICAL AND VULNERABLE TO SHARP
DECLINES IN DEMAND AND AVERAGE SELLING PRICES.

     SONICblue operates in the digital media and consumer electronics markets.
These markets have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience,
significant downturns. In the event of a downturn, SONICblue would likely
experience significantly reduced demand for its products and may be pressured to
reduce average selling prices. Although SONICblue is changing its focus to
concentrate on its Internet-related and digital media businesses, substantially
all of its revenues during 1999 and 2000 were derived from products sold for use
in or with personal computers. In the near term, SONICblue expects to

continue to derive most of its revenues from the sale of digital audio products,
such as the Rio players. Changes in demand in digital media and consumer
electronics markets could be large and sudden. Since retailers often build
inventories during periods of anticipated growth, they may be left with excess
inventories if market growth slows or if they have incorrectly forecasted
product transitions. In these cases, the retailers may abruptly stop purchasing
additional inventory from suppliers like SONICblue until the excess inventory
has been used. This suspension of purchases or any reduction in demand for
SONICblue's products would negatively impact its revenues and financial results.
SONICblue may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in results of
operations due to these general industry conditions.

IF SONICBLUE IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND MARKET NEW AND ENHANCED
PRODUCTS, ITS AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND GROSS MARGINS WILL LIKELY DECLINE.

     SONICblue must continue to develop new products in order to maintain
average selling prices and gross margins. As the markets for its products
develop and competition increases, SONICblue anticipates that product life
cycles will shorten and average selling prices will decline. In particular,
average selling prices and, in some cases, gross margins, for each of its
products will decline as products mature. A decline in selling prices may cause
the net sales in a quarter to be lower than those of a preceding quarter or
corresponding quarter in a prior year, even if more units were sold during that
quarter than in the preceding or corresponding quarter of a prior year. To
minimize the effect of declining average selling prices, SONICblue must
successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new
higher-end and higher-margin products to market in time to meet market demand.
The availability of new products is typically restricted in volume early in a
product's life cycle. If customers choose to wait for the new version of a
product instead of purchasing the current version, SONICblue's ability to secure
the manufacture of sufficient volumes of these new products to meet customer
demand will be limited. If this happens, SONICblue's revenues and operating
margins could be harmed.

     Historically, the gross profit margins on the products of Diamond were
lower than the margins on SONICblue's products. As a result of the Diamond
merger, SONICblue's average gross margins have been lower than they were prior
to the Diamond merger, thereby decreasing SONICblue's average gross margins. In
addition, because the products remaining in SONICblue's refocused business
include Diamond products such as the Rio players, SONICblue's average gross
margins will likely be lower after the transfer of the graphics chips assets to
the joint venture between VIA and a wholly owned subsidiary of SONICblue than
prior to the transfer.

IF SONICBLUE FAILS TO IDENTIFY NEW PRODUCT OPPORTUNITIES OR DEVELOP AND MARKET
NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS, IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY.

     The markets for which SONICblue's products are designed are intensely
competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving
industry standards and short product life cycles. For example, the life cycles
of the Rio audio players typically range from 12 to 18 months. If SONICblue
fails to introduce new products successfully within a given time frame,
SONICblue could lose revenues and market share. Further, continued failure to
develop, introduce and market competitive new products that meet customer
demands on time could also damage SONICblue's brand name, reputation and
relationships with its customers and cause longer-term harm to its financial
condition. SONICblue may not successfully enter the various product markets that
it identifies. In addition, the sale of new products may not become significant
or profitable. To succeed in this environment, SONICblue must anticipate the
features and functionality that customers will demand. SONICblue must then
incorporate those features and functionality into products that meet the design,
performance, quality and pricing requirements of the digital media and consumer
electronics markets in which it competes and the timing requirements of retail
selling seasons. SONICblue believes this will require expenditures for research
and development in the future consistent with its historical research and
development expenditures related to its current refocused businesses. SONICblue
has in the past experienced delays in completing the development and
introduction of new products and may experience similar delays in the future. In
the past, SONICblue's business was

seriously harmed when it developed products that failed to achieve significant
market acceptance and therefore was unable to compete successfully in its
markets. This type of failure could occur again in the future.

SONICBLUE MUST MANAGE PRODUCT TRANSITIONS SUCCESSFULLY IN ORDER TO REMAIN
COMPETITIVE.

     The introduction of a new product or product line is a complex task,
involving significant expenditures in research and development, training,
promotion and channel development, and management of existing product
inventories to reduce the cost associated with returns and slow moving channel
inventory. As new products are introduced, SONICblue attempts to monitor closely
the inventory of products to be replaced, and to phase out their manufacture in
a controlled manner. There can be no assurance that product transitions will be
executed without harming SONICblue's operating results. Failure to develop
products with required features and performance levels or any delay in bringing
a new product to market could significantly reduce SONICblue's revenues and harm
SONICblue's competitive position.

SONICBLUE DEPENDS ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS FROM WHOM IT DOES NOT HAVE A
GUARANTEE OF ADEQUATE SUPPLIES, INCREASING THE RISK THAT A LOSS OF OR PROBLEMS
WITH A SINGLE SUPPLIER COULD RESULT IN IMPAIRED MARGINS, REDUCED PRODUCTION
VOLUMES, STRAINED CUSTOMER RELATIONS AND LOSS OF BUSINESS.

     SONICblue obtains several of the components used in its products, including
flash memory for its Rio players and LCD screens and Transmeta chips for its
frontpath information appliances, from single or limited sources. If component
manufacturers do not allocate a sufficient supply of components to meet its
needs or if current suppliers do not provide components of adequate quality or
compatibility, SONICblue may have to obtain these components from distributors
or on the spot market at a higher cost. SONICblue rarely has guaranteed supply
arrangements with its suppliers, and suppliers may not be able to meet its
current or future component requirements. If SONICblue is forced to use
alternative suppliers of components, it may have to alter its product designs to
accommodate these components. Alteration of product designs to use alternative
components could cause significant delays and reduce its production of the
related products. In addition, from time to time SONICblue has experienced
difficulty meeting certain product shipment dates to customers for various
reasons. These reasons include component delivery delays, component shortages
and component quality deficiencies. Delays in the delivery of components,
component shortages and supplier product quality deficiencies will likely
continue to occur in the future. These delays or problems have in the past and
could in the future result in impaired margins, reduced production volumes,
strained customer relations and loss of business. For example, flash memory
components, which are used in SONICblue's Rio digital audio players,
significantly increased in price in September 1999 due in part to supply
interruptions arising from the earthquake in Taiwan. In addition, industry-wide
demand for flash memory components has increased dramatically, causing increases
in price and shortages in supply. These price increases and shortages may have
an adverse impact on SONICblue's gross margin in future periods.

     Also, in an effort to avoid actual or perceived component shortages,
SONICblue may purchase more of certain components than it may otherwise require.
Excess inventory resulting from over-purchases, obsolescence or a decline in the
market value of such inventory could result in inventory write-offs, which would
have a negative effect on SONICblue's financial results as happened in the first
and second quarters of 1998. Although these over-purchases related to the
graphics chips business, they could occur with respect to other products.
Similarly, prior to SONICblue's acquisition of Diamond, Diamond's perception of
component shortages caused Diamond to over-purchase certain components and pay
surcharges for components that subsequently declined in value in the second,
third and fourth quarters of 1998. In addition, SONICblue's inventory sell-offs
or sell-offs by its competitors could trigger channel price protection charges,
further reducing its gross margins and profitability.

IF A NEW STORAGE MEDIUM BECOMES THE INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR DIGITAL AUDIO AND
SONICBLUE IS UNABLE TO ADAPT ITS PRODUCTS, SONICBLUE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE.

     SONICblue's digital audio players currently include flash memory as their
storage medium. If the digital audio industry adopts a new storage medium as the
industry standard instead of flash memory, SONICblue may not be able to adapt
its products to be compatible with the storage medium. Further, even if
SONICblue is able to adapt its products to a new industry standard storage
medium, SONICblue may experience component shortages, particularly if that
storage medium is based on technology that is proprietary in nature or produced
by a limited number of suppliers.

IF SONICBLUE IS UNABLE TO PREDICT MARKET DEMAND FOR ITS INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS, AND
FOCUS ITS INVENTORIES AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS TO MEET MARKET DEMAND, IT COULD
LOSE SALES OPPORTUNITIES AND EXPERIENCE DECLINES IN REVENUES.

     SONICblue offers a variety of products within each product line or
division. In order to arrange for the manufacture of sufficient quantities of
products and avoid excess inventories, SONICblue needs to accurately predict
market demand for each product. For example, if SONICblue predicted that
consumers would purchase the Rio Volt and plans its manufacturing accordingly,
but instead consumer demand is for the Rio 800, SONICblue would have excess
inventory of the Rio Volt and lost sales opportunities for the Rio 800, as well
as lost market share and brand confidence. SONICblue expects that it will become
even more difficult to forecast demand as it introduces and supports multiple
products and product lines and as competition in the market for its products
intensifies. Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause
problems in SONICblue's operations. SONICblue may not be able to accurately
predict market demand in order to properly allocate its manufacturing and
distribution resources among its products. As a result, SONICblue may experience
declines in its revenues and lose, or fail to gain, market share.

DEMAND FOR SONICBLUE'S DIGITAL AUDIO PRODUCTS MAY DECREASE IF THE SAME
CAPABILITIES PROVIDED BY ITS PRODUCTS BECOME AVAILABLE IN OR AS ADD-ONS TO OTHER
PERSONAL ELECTRONICS PRODUCTS.

     Excluding sales of graphics chips products, a majority of SONICblue's net
sales in 2000 were derived from the sale of digital audio players. There is a
trend within the personal electronics industry for functionality from individual
products to be integrated with other personal electronics products. For example,
Samsung, Fuji, Handspring and others have developed or announced plans to
develop personal electronic products, such as mobile telephones, digital cameras
or PDA plug-ins that integrate digital audio functions. These products could
significantly reduce the demand for SONICblue's products. As a result of these
trends of technology migration and product integration, SONICblue's success
largely depends on its ability to continue to develop products that incorporate
new and rapidly evolving technologies into its products.

     SONICblue must continue to expand the scope of its research and development
efforts to provide the latest in digital audio technology products, which will
require that it hire and retain engineers skilled in these areas and promote
additional coordination among its design and engineering groups. Alternatively,
SONICblue may find it necessary or desirable to license or acquire technology to
enable it to provide these functions. This technology may not be available for
license or purchase on terms acceptable to SONICblue, if at all.

SONICBLUE DEPENDS ON THIRD PARTIES FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF ITS PRODUCTS.

     SONICblue relies on independent subcontractors to manufacture, assemble
and/or test its products. SONICblue procures its components, assembly and test
services and assembled products through purchase orders, and it does not have
specific volume purchase agreements with each of its subcontractors. Most of its
subcontractors could cease supplying the services, products or components at any
time with limited or no penalty. If SONICblue needs to replace a key
subcontractor, it could incur significant manufacturing set-up costs and delays.
Also, SONICblue may be unable to find suitable replacement subcontractors.

SONICblue's emphasis on maintaining low internal and channel inventory levels
may exacerbate the effects of any shortage that may result from the use of
sole-source subcontractors during periods of tight supply or rapid order growth.
Further, some of SONICblue's subcontractors are located outside the United
States, which may present heightened process control, quality control,
political, infrastructure, transportation, tariff, regulatory, legal, import,
export, economic or supply chain management risks.

     SONICblue faces competition for access to manufacturers and manufacturing
capacity. Many of the companies competing with SONICblue for this capacity have
longer operating histories and greater financial and market resources than
SONICblue. SONICblue may not be able to maintain access to adequate capacity of
high quality manufacturing if its subcontractors choose to offer their services
to other companies who can negotiate better terms due to their market presence,
pay higher prices, engage more manufacturing capacity or offer other incentives.
As SONICblue develops new products, such as its frontpath information
appliances, it will require manufacturing capacity to produce quantities to meet
market demand. If SONICblue is unable to obtain and maintain access to high
quality manufacturing capacity for its existing and future products, it will not
be able to fill distributor or customer orders, and its revenues will decline.

SONICBLUE'S PRODUCTS COULD HAVE DEFECTS OR COMPATIBILITY ISSUES, WHICH COULD BE
COSTLY TO CORRECT AND COULD RESULT IN THE REJECTION OF ITS PRODUCTS AND DAMAGE
TO ITS REPUTATION, AS WELL AS LOST REVENUES, DIVERTED DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES AND
INCREASED SERVICE COSTS AND WARRANTY CLAIMS.

     SONICblue's products could have design defects that could cause them to
malfunction. Product components may contain undetected errors or "bugs" when
first supplied to SONICblue that, despite testing by SONICblue, are discovered
only after SONICblue's products have been installed and used by customers. From
time to time, SONICblue has become aware of problems with components, product
designs and other defects. Errors or defects in SONICblue's products may arise
in the future, and, if significant or perceived to be significant, could result
in rejection of SONICblue's products, product returns or recalls, damage to
SONICblue's reputation, lost revenues, diverted development resources and
increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims. Errors or
defects in SONICblue's products could also result in product liability claims.

     SONICblue includes, or bundles, third party software, including operating
systems, with its hardware products. For example, SONICblue includes software
with its Rio players that the purchaser may use to download and store MP3 or WMA
files on the player. SONICblue also incorporates third party software in its
frontpath information appliances. The software products and SONICblue's hardware
products are complex and may contain undetected errors or failures when first
introduced or as new versions are released. SONICblue has distributed updates to
Rio players in the past when required to improve sound quality or to correct
minor audio problems. SONICblue generally provides warranties for its retail
products allowing the return or repair of defective products. Despite testing by
SONICblue, its suppliers or current or potential customers, errors may be found
in new products after commencement of commercial shipments. These errors could
result in loss of or delay in market acceptance or product acceptance or in
warranty returns. Losses, delays or damage to SONICblue's reputation due to
product defects would likely harm SONICblue's business, financial condition and
results of operations.

     Additionally, new versions or upgrades to operating systems, independent
software vendor titles or applications may require upgrades to the software
products SONICblue bundles with its hardware products, or the software products
that purchasers of SONICblue's products may obtain from other sources such as
the Internet, to maintain compatibility with the new versions or upgrades. The
sources for the software SONICblue bundles, or the other sources for purchasers
of SONICblue's products to obtain software, may not be successful in developing
new versions, upgrades or enhancements to their software products. If producers
of software experience delays or are unable to maintain compatibility with new
audio formats, operating systems and independent software vendor titles or
applications, the demand for SONICblue's products and SONICblue's reputation
could suffer. Loss of sales and damaged reputation could harm SONICblue's
revenues and profitability.

SONICBLUE IS SUBJECT TO RISKS RELATING TO PRODUCT RETURNS AND PRICE PROTECTION,
WHICH COULD LIMIT SONICBLUE'S REVENUES.

     SONICblue often grants limited rights to customers and distributors to
return unsold inventories of its products in exchange for new products, also
known as "stock rotation." SONICblue also often grants price protection on
unsold inventory, which allows customers to receive a price adjustment on
existing inventory when its published price is reduced. Also, some of
SONICblue's retail customers may accept returned products from their own retail
customers. These products are then returned to SONICblue for credit. SONICblue
has experienced a significant percentage of returns of its Rio players.
SONICblue estimates returns and potential price protection on unsold inventory
in its distribution channel and accrues reserves for estimated returns,
including warranty returns and price protection. Since the fourth quarter of
1998, it reserves the gross margin associated with channel inventory levels that
exceed four weeks of demand. SONICblue may be faced with further significant
price protection charges as its customers move to reduce channel inventory
levels of current products, such as its Rio 500, as new product introductions
are made.

     In an environment of slower demand and abundant supply of products, price
declines and channel promotional expenses are more likely to occur and, should
they occur, are more likely to have a significant impact on SONICblue's
operating results. Further, in this environment, high channel inventory levels
may result in substantial price protection charges. These price protection
charges have the effect of reducing net sales and gross margin. Consequently, in
taking steps to bring its channel inventory levels down to a more desirable
level, SONICblue may cause a shortfall in net sales during one or more
accounting periods. These efforts to reduce channel inventory might also result
in price protection charges if prices are decreased to move product out to final
consumers, having a further adverse impact on operating results. Any estimates,
reserves or accruals may be insufficient and any future price reductions may
seriously harm its operating results.

SONICBLUE DEPENDS ON SALES THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS. IF RELATIONSHIPS WITH OR SALES
THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS DECLINE, ITS OPERATING RESULTS WILL BE HARMED.

     SONICblue sells its products through a network of domestic and
international distributors, and directly to major retailers/mass merchants.
SONICblue's future success is dependent on the continued viability and financial
stability of its customer base. Retail channels historically have been
characterized by rapid change, including periods of widespread financial
difficulties and consolidation and the emergence of alternative sales channels,
such as direct mail order, telephone sales and electronic commerce on the
worldwide web. SONICblue may be unable to retain its distributors. Also, its
distributors may cancel or reschedule orders, and in the event of canceled
orders, these orders may not be replaced by other sales. In addition, sales to
any particular distributor may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.
The loss of, or a reduction in, sales to any of SONICblue's key distribution
customers as a result of changing market conditions, competition or customer
credit problems could materially and adversely affect its operating results.
Likewise, changes in distribution channel patterns, such as increased electronic
commerce via the Internet and increased use of mail-order catalogues, could
affect SONICblue in ways not yet known. For example, the rapid emergence of
Internet-based e-commerce, in which products are sold directly to consumers at
low prices, is putting substantial strain on some of SONICblue's traditional
distribution channels.

     Inventory levels of SONICblue's products in the two-tier distribution
channels generally are maintained in a range of one to two months of customer
demand. These channel inventory levels tend toward the low end of the
months-of-supply range when demand is stronger, sales are higher and products
are in short supply. Conversely, during periods when demand is slower, sales are
lower and products are abundant, channel inventory levels tend toward the high
end of the months-of-supply range. Frequently, in these situations, SONICblue
attempts to ensure that distributors devote a greater degree of their working
capital, sales and logistics resources to SONICblue's products instead of to the
products of SONICblue's competitors. Similarly, SONICblue's competitors attempt
to ensure that their own products are receiving a disproportionately higher
share of the distributors' working capital and logistics resources. SONICblue
may experience significant decreases in revenues if its competitors are able to
secure more resources than

SONICblue is able to secure from distributors during periods of slower demand or
if periods of slower demand result in price protection charges.

SONICBLUE'S ABILITY TO MARKET AND DISTRIBUTE ITS PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN PART UPON
ITS CURRENT AND FUTURE RELATIONSHIPS WITH ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS, OR
OEMS, AND OTHER STRATEGIC PARTNERS TO MARKET AND DISTRIBUTE SONICBLUE'S PRODUCTS
UNDER THEIR OWN BRAND NAMES.

     In addition to direct distributors of SONICblue's products, SONICblue also
depends upon OEMs and other strategic partners to market and distribute its
products. For example, SONICblue has packaged for Dell a digital audio receiver
that streams digital audio from a home computer to the receiver, and through a
strategic partnership with Nike, SONICblue has developed a digital audio player
that is designed for fitness enthusiasts. If SONICblue is unable to obtain and
maintain relationships with OEMs and strategic partners, it will not be able to
increase sales of its products and achieve market acceptance as efficiently, and
its revenues may decline.

SONICBLUE RELIES ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER PROPRIETARY INFORMATION THAT
MAY NOT BE ADEQUATELY PROTECTED AND THAT MAY BE EXPENSIVE TO PROTECT.

     The markets in which SONICblue competes are characterized by vigorous
protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. SONICblue relies on a
combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, employee and
third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect its
intellectual property. If SONICblue is unable to adequately protect its
intellectual property, its business may suffer from the piracy of its technology
and the associated loss of sales. Also, the protection provided to SONICblue's
proprietary technology by the laws of foreign jurisdictions, many of which offer
less protection than the United States, may not be sufficient to protect its
technology. It is common in the personal electronics and Internet device
industries for companies to assert intellectual property infringement claims
against other companies. Therefore, SONICblue's products may also become the
target of infringement claims. These infringement claims or any future claims
could cause SONICblue to spend significant time and money to defend its
products, redesign its products or develop or license a substitute technology.
SONICblue may be unsuccessful in acquiring or developing substitute technology
and any required license may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms, if
at all. In addition, an adverse result in litigation could require SONICblue to
pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale and
importation of infringing products, or discontinue the use of certain processes.
Any of these events could materially harm SONICblue's business.

     Litigation by or against SONICblue could result in significant expense and
could divert the efforts of its technical and management personnel, regardless
of the outcome of such litigation. However, even if claims do not have merit,
SONICblue may be required to dedicate significant management time and expense to
defending itself if it is directly sued, or assisting its customers in their
defense of these or other infringement claims pursuant to indemnity agreements.
This could have a negative effect on SONICblue's financial results.

SONICBLUE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT, RETAIN OR INTEGRATE KEY PERSONNEL, WHICH
MAY PREVENT IT FROM SUCCEEDING.

     SONICblue may not be able to retain its key personnel or attract other
qualified personnel in the future. SONICblue's success will depend upon the
continued service of key management personnel. The loss of services of any of
the key members of SONICblue's management team or its failure to attract and
retain other key personnel could disrupt operations and have a negative effect
on employee productivity and morale, decreasing production and harming its
financial results. In addition, the competition to attract, retain and motivate
qualified technical personnel, such as engineers, as well as qualified sales and
operations personnel, is intense. SONICblue has at times experienced, and
continues to experience, difficulty recruiting qualified software and hardware
development engineers.

SONICBLUE DEPENDS ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF THIRD PARTY DEVELOPERS AND PUBLISHERS
THAT DEVELOP SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT WILL OPERATE WITH AND FULLY UTILIZE THE
CAPABILITIES OF ITS RIO PLAYERS.

     Only a limited number of software developers are producing software that
enables the download and use of digital audio players. SONICblue does not create
the software that is required to download or convert from CDs music to run on
its players but bundles third party software with its players. If SONICblue is
not able to license and bundle the software, or if users are not otherwise able
to obtain software free of charge or at an acceptable price, then demand for
SONICblue's digital audio players will decline. Likewise, difficult to use or
defective software could negatively impact SONICblue's product sales and
revenues.

SONICBLUE HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

     Export sales accounted for 56%, 70% and 89% of net sales in 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. Approximately 33% of export sales in 2000 were to affiliates
of United States customers. In addition, a substantial proportion of SONICblue's
products are manufactured, assembled and tested by independent third parties in
Asia. As a result, SONICblue is subject to the risks of conducting business
internationally, including:

     - unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory
       requirements;

     - fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, which could increase the price in local
       currencies of SONICblue's products in foreign markets or increase the
       cost of wafers and components purchased by SONICblue;

     - delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain
       technology;

     - tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions;

     - potentially longer payment cycles;

     - greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection;

     - potentially adverse tax treatment; and

     - the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws.

     In the past, SONICblue has experienced an adverse impact associated with
the economic downturn in Asia that contributed to decreases in net sales. In
addition, SONICblue's international operations are subject to general
geopolitical risks, such as political and economic instability and changes in
diplomatic and trade relationships. The People's Republic of China and Taiwan
have in the past experienced and are currently experiencing strained relations,
and a worsening of relations or the development of hostilities between them
could disrupt operations at the manufacturing facilities of SONICblue's
subcontractors and affect its Asian customers.

SONICBLUE HAS A SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF DEBT, WHICH MAY HARM ITS ABILITY TO OBTAIN
ADDITIONAL FINANCING OR ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS LIQUIDITY.

     At December 31, 2000, SONICblue had total debt and other long-term
liabilities outstanding of $107 million, including a $70 million line of credit
secured by SONICblue's shares of UMC. Foreclosure on the UMC shares would harm
SONICblue's financial condition. The degree to which SONICblue is leveraged
could harm its ability to obtain additional financing for working capital or
other purposes and could make SONICblue more vulnerable to economic downturns
and competitive pressures. SONICblue's significant leverage could also adversely
affect its liquidity, as a substantial portion of available cash from operations
may have to be applied to meet debt service requirements. In the event of a cash
shortfall, SONICblue could be forced to reduce other expenditures to be able to
meet such debt service requirements.

MINORITY INVESTMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SONICBLUE'S LIQUIDITY AND EARNINGS.

     SONICblue holds minority interests in companies having operations or
technology in areas within its strategic focus. Some of these investments are in
research and development, start-up or development stage companies or companies
where operations are not yet sufficient to establish them as going concerns. As
a result, SONICblue may be called upon under contractual or other terms to
provide funding for operations of these companies and may share in their losses.
Adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying
investments could result in SONICblue incurring losses or an inability to
recover the carrying value of its investments.

SONICBLUE MAY PURSUE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS AND COULD FAIL TO SUCCESSFULLY
INTEGRATE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES.

     SONICblue has engaged in acquisitions in the past, has recently announced
proposed acquisitions of Sensory Science and ReplayTV, and expects to evaluate
acquisition opportunities in the future that could provide additional product or
services offerings, technologies or additional industry expertise. Any proposed
or future acquisition could result in difficulties assimilating acquired
operations and products, diversion of capital and management's attention away
from other business issues and opportunities and amortization of acquired
intangible assets. Integration of acquired companies may result in problems
related to integration of technology and management teams. SONICblue could fail
to integrate the operations, personnel or products that it may acquire in the
future. If SONICblue fails to successfully integrate acquisitions or achieve any
anticipated benefits of an acquisition, its operations and business could be
harmed.

SONICBLUE IS A PARTY TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ALLEGING SECURITIES VIOLATIONS THAT
COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON SONICBLUE.

     Since November 1997, a number of complaints have been filed in federal and
state courts seeking unspecified damages on behalf of an alleged class of
persons who purchased shares of SONICblue's common stock at various times
between April 18, 1996 and November 3, 1997. The complaints name as defendants
SONICblue, certain of its officers and former officers, and certain directors of
SONICblue, asserting that they violated federal and state securities laws by
misrepresenting and failing to disclose certain information about SONICblue's
business. In addition, certain stockholders have filed derivative actions in the
state courts of California and Delaware seeking recovery on behalf of SONICblue,
alleging, among other things, breach of fiduciary duties by such individual
defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative action in Delaware have not taken
any steps to pursue their case. The derivative cases in California State court
have been consolidated, and plaintiffs have filed a consolidated amended
complaint. The court has entered a stipulated order in those derivative cases
suspending court proceedings and coordinating discovery in them with discovery
in the class actions in California State courts. On plaintiffs' motion, the
federal court has dismissed the federal class actions without prejudice. The
class actions in California State court have been consolidated, and plaintiffs
have filed a consolidated amended complaint. SONICblue has answered that
complaint. Discovery is proceeding. On January 22, 2001, four of the insurance
carriers which issued directors and officers insurance to SONICblue filed suit
against all parties named as defendants in the securities litigation, claiming
that the carriers have no obligation to provide coverage under the California
Insurance Code. While management intends to defend the actions against SONICblue
vigorously, there can be no assurance that an adverse result or settlement with
regard to these lawsuits would not have a material adverse effect on SONICblue's
financial condition or results of operations.

     SONICblue has received from the SEC a request for information relating to
SONICblue's restatement announcement in November 1997. SONICblue has responded
and intends to continue to respond to such requests.

     SONICblue has also been defending several putative class action lawsuits
naming Diamond, which were filed in June and July 1996 and June 1997 in the
California Superior Court for Santa Clara County and the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California. Certain former executive officers and
directors of Diamond are also named as defendants. The plaintiffs purport to
represent a class of all

persons who purchased Diamond's common stock between October 18, 1995 and June
20, 1996, or the Class Period. The complaints allege claims under the federal
securities laws and California law. The plaintiffs allege that Diamond and the
other defendants made various material misrepresentations and omissions during
the Class Period. The complaints do not specify the amount of damages sought. On
March 24, 2000, the District Court for the Northern District of California
dismissed the federal action without prejudice. The parties have tentatively
agreed to settle this matter, subject to final documentation and court approval,
for a payment of $15.0 million. SONICblue funded $4.5 million of the settlement
on November 1, 2000. SONICblue previously accrued this amount in connection with
the merger with Diamond. SONICblue believes that Diamond's insurance covers the
remaining $10.5 million of the settlement and Diamond's insurers have funded
that amount into the settlement.

     C3 Sales, Inc. filed suit against SONICblue on October 6, 1999 in the
Harris County (Houston), Texas District Court. The petition sought a judicial
declaration that a Sales Representative Agreement entered into between C3 and
SONICblue on May 19, 1999 was a valid contract that governed the relationship
between the two parties. On November 8, 1999, SONICblue answered acknowledging
that the May 19, 1999 agreement was a contract between the two parties. C3
failed to respond to informal requests by SONICblue to dismiss the declaratory
relief action on grounds that no justiciable controversy existed between the
parties. On December 3, 1999, SONICblue filed a summary judgment motion seeking
judgment against C3 on the grounds that no issues of material fact remain to be
determined regarding the declaratory judgment sought by C3. C3 responded by
filing an amended petition raising new matters. Specifically, C3's new claims
allege that the Sales Representative Agreement applies to Diamond products, and
that certain commissions due under the agreement have not been paid. SONICblue
intends to defend this action vigorously.

                                   THE MERGER

GENERAL

     Sensory Science's board of directors is using this proxy
statement/prospectus to solicit proxies from the holders of Sensory Science
common stock for use at the Sensory Science special meeting. At the special
meeting, holders of Sensory Science common stock will be asked to vote upon
approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     Sensory Science has had discussions from time to time over the past several
years with various parties regarding the potential for entering into a strategic
business relationship with Sensory Science. As a part of this process, Sensory
Science and SONICblue had discussions on January 6, 2000. Kenneth Potashner,
Chief Executive Officer of SONICblue, and Andrew Wolfe, Chief Technology Officer
of SONICblue, met with Roger Hackett, Chief Executive Officer of Sensory
Science, and Edward Brachocki, Vice President of Business Development of Sensory
Science, at a trade show and discussed the companies' respective products and
business objectives.

     Executives of Sensory Science and SONICblue had various discussions from
January 2000 to June 2000 regarding a potential business relationship between
the companies. During that period, on February 3, 2000, Mr. Hackett reported at
a regular meeting of the Sensory Science board on the various contacts with
SONICblue and on other strategic initiatives that Sensory Science was pursuing
at that time. The board determined that, although it was interested in the
discussions with SONICblue and with others, the main priority was to pursue a
particular joint venture with another technology company.

     Throughout June 2000, Sensory Science also had several discussions with
Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co., Inc. On June 22, 2000, Sensory Science formally
engaged Gerard Klauer Mattison as its financial advisor in connection with the
various strategic initiatives it was pursuing.

     On June 30, 2000, there was a meeting between Mr. Hackett, Mr. Brachocki,
Thomas Linnen, Chief Financial Officer of Sensory Science, and Stephen Maine,
Vice President of Technology for Sensory Science, and Mr. Potashner and Janet
Leising, then Vice President of Business Development of SONICblue. SONICblue
indicated its interest in pursuing a consumer electronics products strategy and
indicated an interest in a business combination with Sensory Science.

     Between July and November of 2000, Gerard Klauer Mattison contacted
approximately 65 entities it considered to be possible strategic partners of
Sensory Science and engaged in further preliminary discussions with over 40
companies that had expressed an interest in a business combination with Sensory
Science, including SONICblue. Of these companies, 13, including SONICblue,
engaged in further discussions with Sensory Science. During this time period,
Gerard Klauer Mattison provided Sensory Science's senior management with
periodic updates as to the results of these discussions.

     Between July and September 2000, there were several due diligence meetings
at Sensory Science with interested parties. During this time Sensory Science met
with seven companies.

     On August 31, 2000 Sensory Science and SONICblue met at SONICblue's
headquarters. In attendance at that meeting were Mr. Hackett, Mr. Brachocki, Mr.
Linnen, special outside counsel for Sensory Science, representatives of Gerard
Klauer Mattison and Mr. Potashner, William McFarland, Interim Chief Financial
Officer of SONICblue, counsel to SONICblue and a representative of Lehman
Brothers, investment bankers for SONICblue. At the meeting, SONICblue indicated
that based on Sensory Science's most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, it
would reevaluate its interest in pursuing a business combination with Sensory
Science.

     Throughout September, Gerard Klauer Mattison continued to contact parties
and engage in numerous discussions with various technology, media and other
consumer electronic products companies regarding the potential for a business
combination or other strategic initiative with Sensory Science. At the same

time, Mr. Brachocki and Mr. Maine continued to work with Ms. Leising of
SONICblue regarding the interplay of the technologies of SONICblue's frontpath
information appliance and Sensory Science's media appliance.

     On October 25, 2000, Mr. Potashner and Mr. Hackett discussed SONICblue's
potential acquisition of, or investment in, Sensory Science's media appliance
business. No terms were agreed upon during the discussions.

     In December 2000 and early January 2001, representatives of Sensory Science
and SONICblue discussed the possibility of a business combination between the
companies, and representatives of SONICblue presented initial terms upon which
SONICblue would be willing to consider a stock-for-stock merger between Sensory
Science and SONICblue.

     During the first two weeks of January 2001, SONICblue representatives met
with representatives of Sensory Science to commence a due diligence review.

     On January 19, 2001, Mr. Potashner contacted Mr. Hackett and indicated that
SONICblue would continue to pursue the acquisition of Sensory Science but that
its board would not approve the acquisition based on pricing terms initially
proposed in December and that SONICblue would work on an alternative pricing
proposal.

     On January 22, 2001, Mr. Potashner indicated that SONICblue would be
willing to pursue the acquisition of Sensory Science upon the exchange ratio
terms set forth in the merger agreement.

     On January 26, 2001, Mr. Hackett, Mr. Linnen, counsel for Sensory Science
and representatives of Gerard Klauer Mattison met at SONICblue's headquarters
with Mr. Potashner, Mr. Wolfe and counsel for SONICblue to negotiate the terms
upon which the parties would be willing to proceed with the negotiations of a
definitive merger agreement for a business combination. After discussions
regarding the terms, a letter of intent was negotiated and signed.

     On January 29, 2001, the Sensory Science board met at a special meeting to
discuss the transaction with SONICblue and to discuss alternatives to that
transaction. At that board meeting, Gerard Klauer Mattison presented its
preliminary findings regarding the fairness, from a financial point of view, of
the transaction and posed questions to and answered questions from Sensory
Science's board.

     On January 30, 2001, the board of directors of SONICblue approved the
merger, the merger agreement and the credit agreement.

     On January 31, 2001, representatives of Sensory Science and SONICblue and
their respective counsel had numerous discussions to negotiate the terms of a
definitive merger agreement.

     On January 31, 2001, the Sensory Science board again held a special meeting
to review the advisability of entering into the transaction with SONICblue. At
that meeting Gerard Klauer Mattison presented its opinion as to the fairness,
from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of Sensory Science, reviewed
the assumptions on which it based its opinion, and posed and responded to the
board's questions regarding the transaction. After lengthy discussions regarding
various issues relating to the transaction, the board approved the transaction
and authorized Mr. Hackett to execute a merger agreement and related transaction
documents.

     The transaction documents were executed and their execution was announced
in a joint press release on February 1, 2001.

SENSORY SCIENCE'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     At a meeting held on January 31, 2001, the Sensory Science board
unanimously approved the merger agreement, unanimously found the merger to be
fair to, advisable and in the best interests of its stockholders and unanimously
resolved to recommend that its stockholders adopt and approve the merger
agreement and the merger.

     In reaching its decision, the Sensory Science board consulted with its
senior management, and financial and legal advisors, and considered a number of
factors. In view of the complexity and wide variety of information and factors
considered by the board, the board did not find it practical to quantify, rank
or otherwise assign any relative or specific weights to the factors it
considered. In addition, the board did not reach any specific conclusion with
respect to each of the factors it considered, or any aspect of any particular
factors. Instead, the board conducted an overall analysis of the factors it
considered. In considering those factors, individual members of the board may
have given weight to different factors. The board considered all of those
factors as a whole and believed that those factors supported its decision.

     The Sensory Science board identified certain material benefits that it
expects will result from the merger as well as certain risks in connection with
the merger in addition to other merger considerations. Sensory Science's board
believes that the combination of the two companies will provide Sensory Science
with the necessary resources to continue its digital products strategy while
strengthening SONICblue's growing digital products portfolio and providing both
companies with new marketing and distribution opportunities. The Sensory Science
board determined that Sensory Science and SONICblue share a common vision of
convergence in the digital marketplace, and believes that this combination will
better enable Sensory Science to continue its mission of providing award-winning
digital products.

     Recently, Sensory Science product sales have been declining, leading to a
deteriorating financial condition and negatively impacting the value of its
common stock. The Sensory Science board considered the merger in the context of
its anticipated operating expenses, the potential default situation under its
third-party secured lines of credit, and its other cash needs and liquidity
constraints, including its ability to secure alternative sources of financing
and Sensory Science's ability to purchase products for sale. The severity of its
current liquidity constraints only became evident in the month leading up to the
signing of the merger agreement due to a decline in sales and subsequent
problems with obtaining product for sale and declining margins on available
product sold to customers. Sensory Science's board believes that the merger
represents the only currently available transaction which will provide Sensory
Science the cash necessary to enable it to fund its ongoing operations, to avoid
foreclosure on its assets by existing creditors and to provide a reasonable
opportunity to enable it to achieve its strategic objectives.

     The Sensory Science board considered that should Sensory Science not
consummate the merger, Sensory Science might have been unable to secure
alternative financing in sufficient time to provide working capital to continue
operations and avoid actions that would severely impair its future prospects.
Sensory Science may also become increasingly unable to meet current obligations
with certain vendors to pay for products.

     The Sensory Science board believes that the financial resources and
management depth of the combined company could allow it to yield more continuing
value for its stockholders. In particular, the board believes that the combined
company will create a stronger, more competitive industry participant in the
industries in which Sensory Science competes, with enhanced prospects for
continued viability, by:

     - expanding the combined company's product line to provide a strengthened
       technology portfolio of products, including converging Internet, digital
       audio and video, and other digital media and consumer device products;

     - allowing the combined company to leverage the complementary products,
       channels, partners, technology, logistics, critical skills, and
       manufacturing approaches of each company;

     - integrating technological and engineering resources and production
       experience to both accelerate product development and allow the combined
       company to respond more quickly and effectively to technological change,
       increased competition and customer demands;

     - providing Sensory Science with a materially stronger balance sheet and
       cash position than it has standing alone;

     - expanding the combined company's sales and distribution channels; and

     - creating significant opportunities for cost reduction through the
       integration of operations with SONICblue and the elimination of redundant
       overhead expenses and duplicative administrative functions.

     The Sensory Science board also considered the following factors supporting
the merger:

     - that the merger would create more value to the holders of Sensory Science
       common stock by providing the holders of Sensory Science common stock the
       opportunity to hold an investment in a larger enterprise with greater
       market capitalization and liquidity;

     - the expectation that the merger would allow Sensory Science the
       opportunity to participate in a higher growth segment space by allowing
       management to focus on emerging markets and technologies;

     - the ability to complete the merger as a reorganization for United States
       federal income tax purposes in which Sensory Science stockholders
       generally would not recognize any gain or loss, except for any gain or
       loss recognized in connection with cash received for fractional shares of
       SONICblue common stock; and

     - the board of directors' belief, and considering advice from counsel, that
       the parties should be able to consummate the merger, including satisfying
       the conditions to the merger requiring receipt of necessary regulatory
       approvals in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

     The Sensory Science board considered the following potentially negative
factors in its deliberations concerning the merger:

     - the risk that the merger might not be consummated and the effect of the
       public announcement of the merger on Sensory Science's sales, operating
       results and stock price and ability to attract and retain key management,
       sales and marketing and other employees;

     - the risk associated with fluctuations in Sensory Science and SONICblue
       stock prices prior to the closing of the merger such that the per share
       value of the consideration received by holders of Sensory Science common
       stock might be significantly less than the price per share implied by the
       exchange ratio immediately prior to the announcement of the merger;

     - the challenges of integrating the operations of Sensory Science and
       SONICblue;

     - the risk that the combined company may not be able to realize, fully or
       at all, the anticipated benefits of the merger;

     - the possibility that Sensory Science's stockholders may not approve the
       merger, or even if the merger is approved by Sensory Science's
       stockholders, it may not be completed;

     - the possibility that potential disruption to existing and prospective
       relationships could result from the announcement of the merger;

     - the risk that class action lawsuits against SONICblue could divert
       management's attention and resources;

     - the risk of an adverse impact on the financial results of SONICblue after
       the merger due to results of purchase accounting;

     - the risk of market confusion and potential delay or loss of orders;

     - the substantial charges to be incurred in connection with the merger,
       including transaction expenses, the costs of integrating the two
       businesses, and employee retention and severance costs;

     - the risk that the transaction would not be viewed by the IRS as meeting
       all requirements to qualify as a reorganization pursuant to which Sensory
       Science stockholders' receipt of SONICblue common stock would generally
       not be taxable;

     - the loss of control over Sensory Science's future operations following
       the merger; and

     - other applicable risks described in this proxy statement/prospectus under
       "Risk Factors" on page 12.

     In the course of its deliberations, the Sensory Science board also
considered the following additional factors, among others:

     - the opinion of Sensory Science's financial advisor, Gerard Klauer
       Mattison, that as of January 31, 2001, and based on and subject to the
       assumptions, considerations and limitations stated in the Gerard Klauer
       Mattison opinion, which is described in the section entitled "Opinion of
       Financial Advisor to Sensory Science" beginning on page 35, the exchange
       ratio to be offered to the holders of Sensory Science common stock in the
       merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Sensory Science
       stockholders;

     - the analysis presented by Sensory Science's financial advisors;

     - historical information concerning the business, operations, financial
       condition, results of operations, technology, management, competitive
       position, and prospects of Sensory Science as a stand-alone business,
       including results of operations during Sensory Science's most recent
       fiscal periods;

     - the current and historical economic and market condition and industry
       environment in the digital consumer products business, including market
       prices, volatility and trading data for Sensory Science's common stock;

     - the likely impact of the merger on Sensory Science's employees;

     - the terms of the merger agreement;

     - the expected accounting treatment of the merger;

     - the terms of the merger agreement regarding third party proposals,
       including Sensory Science's ability to terminate the merger agreement in
       order to accept a superior proposal and the potential payment to
       SONICblue of a termination fee;

     - the interests that certain of Sensory Science's executive officers and
       directors may have with respect to the merger in addition to their
       interests as holders of Sensory Science's common stock generally, as
       discussed in the section entitled "Interests of Certain Persons in the
       Merger" on page 44;

     - the impact of the merger on customers;

     - the results of Sensory Science's due diligence process; and

     - the fact that Sensory Science's stockholders will have an opportunity to
       vote on the proposed merger.

     The board concluded that the potential benefits of the merger to Sensory
Science's stockholders outweighed the potential risks and unanimously approved
the merger and the merger agreement.

     THE SENSORY SCIENCE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED THE MERGER AND THE
MERGER AGREEMENT AND BELIEVES THAT THE MERGER AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT ARE
ADVISABLE, FAIR TO, AND IN THE BEST INTEREST OF SENSORY SCIENCE AND ITS
STOCKHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, THE SENSORY SCIENCE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT
SENSORY SCIENCE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AND THE MERGER
AGREEMENT.

SONICBLUE'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     SONICblue believes that the merger of Sensory Science with SONICblue will
facilitate the development of a new SONICblue business unit to focus on
video-based media servers and client products. SONICblue also expects its
proposed acquisition of ReplayTV, Inc., a privately owned company located in
Mountain View, California, to contribute to the development of this business
unit. SONICblue believes that the merger has the potential to produce benefits
to the combined company that would not be obtainable to either company on an
independent basis. In particular, SONICblue expects to utilize Sensory Science's
established consumer market sales channels to sell existing Sensory Science
products, existing

SONICblue products and new products as they are developed. The potential
benefits of the merger also include the future integration of SONICblue's
existing products with Sensory Science's present and in-development technology
to develop products for the new business unit. In addition, SONICblue
anticipates that the addition of Sensory Science's engineers will strengthen
SONICblue's engineering force. SONICblue believes that the merger will result in
a company better positioned to become a leader in the wireless home network,
including video based, wireless products.

OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO SENSORY SCIENCE

     Sensory Science retained Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co., Inc. as its
financial advisor to assist it and its board of directors in the consideration
of valuation, financial and other matters relating to the merger.

     At a meeting of Sensory Science's board on January 29, 2001, Gerard Klauer
Mattison & Co., Inc., in its role as financial advisor, presented its
preliminary findings regarding the fairness, from a financial point of view, of
the exchange ratio to be received by holders of shares of Sensory Science common
stock in the merger as set forth in a term sheet dated January 26, 2001. At the
meeting, Gerard Klauer Mattison reviewed the assumptions on which it based its
preliminary findings, discussed Sensory Science's deteriorating financial
condition and limited prospects and both posed and answered questions from
Sensory Science's board.

     At the meeting of Sensory Science's board on January 31, 2001, Gerard
Klauer Mattison, in its role as financial advisor to Sensory Science, rendered
its written opinion that, as of January 31, 2001, and based upon and subject to
the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limits
of review as set forth in its opinion, the exchange ratio to be received by
holders of shares of Sensory Science common stock in the merger was fair from a
financial point of view to such holders.

     THE FULL TEXT OF THE WRITTEN OPINION OF GERARD KLAUER MATTISON DATED
JANUARY 31, 2001 IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX D TO THIS DOCUMENT. THE OPINION SETS
FORTH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, PROCEDURES FOLLOWED, MATTERS
CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS ON THE SCOPE OF THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY GERARD
KLAUER MATTISON IN RENDERING ITS OPINION. WE URGE YOU TO READ THE ENTIRE OPINION
CAREFULLY. GERARD KLAUER MATTISON'S OPINION IS DIRECTED TO THE SENSORY SCIENCE
BOARD AND ADDRESSES ONLY THE FAIRNESS OF THE EXCHANGE RATIO FROM A FINANCIAL
POINT OF VIEW TO HOLDERS OF SHARES OF SENSORY SCIENCE'S COMMON STOCK AS OF THE
DATE OF THE OPINION. GERARD KLAUER MATTISON'S OPINION DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER
ASPECT OF THE MERGER AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY HOLDER OF
SENSORY SCIENCE COMMON STOCK AS TO WHETHER THAT HOLDER SHOULD VOTE IN FAVOR OF
THE MERGER. THIS SUMMARY IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL
TEXT OF GERARD KLAUER MATTISON'S OPINION.

     In connection with rendering its opinion, Gerard Klauer Mattison reviewed
and analyzed, among other things, the following:

     - a letter of understanding, dated January 26, 2001, which outlined the
       terms of the merger;

     - a draft, dated January 31, 2001, of the merger agreement;

     - certain publicly available financial statements and other information of
       Sensory Science and SONICblue;

     - certain internal business, operating and financial information, including
       financial forecasts and other information which described Sensory
       Science's growing working capital deficit position, declining average
       selling prices on certain key products and other factors which affected
       liquidity, furnished to Gerard Klauer Mattison by Sensory Science;

     - the historical financial results and financial condition of Sensory
       Science and SONICblue, comparing Sensory Science's financial results with
       those of other companies and businesses that Gerard Klauer Mattison
       deemed relevant;

     - the reported prices and trading activity of SONICblue common stock and
       Sensory Science common stock, comparing their performance with those of
       other publicly traded companies that Gerard Klauer Mattison deemed
       relevant; and

     - the financial terms of the merger and compared them with the financial
       terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other recent
       transactions that Gerard Klauer Mattison deemed relevant.

     In addition, in arriving at its opinion, Gerard Klauer Mattison held
discussions with Sensory Science's senior management and Sensory Science
representatives and the senior management of SONICblue regarding the business,
operations, financial condition and prospects of Sensory Science and SONICblue
both before and after giving effect to the merger, as well as other matters
Gerard Klauer Mattison considered relevant to its inquiry.

     Gerard Klauer Mattison also reviewed with Sensory Science's senior
management and Sensory Science representatives Sensory Science's anticipated
operating expenses, the potential for default under Sensory Science's
third-party secured line of credit, other cash needs and liquidity constraints,
including the ability of Sensory Science to secure alternative sources of
financing. The severity of Sensory Science's current liquidity constraints had
only become recently evident.

     Gerard Klauer Mattison also performed such other financial studies,
analyses, and investigations and reviewed such other information as it
considered appropriate for purposes of its opinion. In formulating its opinion,
Gerard Klauer Mattison relied on:

     - the fact that Sensory Science's decision to enter into the merger
       agreement was preceded by (1) a seven month engagement to discuss
       financing opportunities and (2) a concurrent seven month process during
       which merger and financing proposals were solicited by or on behalf of
       Sensory Science from potential parties which included parties that
       Sensory Science believed were logical merger partners or minority
       investors, and

     - Sensory Science's assessment that the merger represented the only
       currently available transaction to Sensory Science that would provide the
       cash necessary to enable Sensory Science to fund its ongoing operations
       to avoid foreclosure on its assets by existing creditors and to provide a
       reasonable opportunity to enable Sensory Science to achieve its strategic
       objectives.

     Gerard Klauer Mattison understood that Sensory Science would be unable to
secure alternative financing in sufficient time to provide working capital to
continue operations and avoid actions that would severely impair its future
prospects; and Sensory Science was under close weekly scrutiny with its
creditors and was unable to meet current obligations with certain vendors to pay
for products. Based on Gerard Klauer Mattison's discussions, investigations and
analysis, it appeared to Gerard Klauer Mattison that Sensory Science would not
be able to pay its obligations as they became due or continue its operations in
the absence of consummation of the merger. In coming to this conclusion, it was
Gerard Klauer Mattison's assumption that even with drastic measures there would
be no assurance that such measures would provide anything more than a temporary
solution to Sensory Science's working capital deficit leading Sensory Science
ultimately to seek protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws. Gerard
Klauer Mattison believed that the market price of Sensory Science common stock,
as of January 31, 2001, did not yet reflect Sensory Science's grave financial
condition and prospects.

     Gerard Klauer Mattison also conducted other such analyses and performed
such other investigations and considered such other matters as it deemed
necessary to arrive at its opinion, including its assessment of general
economic, market and monetary conditions.

     In its review and analysis and in formulating its opinion, Gerard Klauer
Mattison relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy
and completeness of all of the financial and other information publicly
available or furnished or otherwise communicated to it. With respect to the
financial forecasts, projections and other information provided to or otherwise
reviewed by it, Gerard Klauer Mattison assumed that such forecasts, projections
and other information were reasonably prepared on bases

reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments at
the time of Sensory Science's or SONICblue's management, as the case may be, as
to the expected future competitive, operating and financial performance of
Sensory Science and SONICblue, respectively. Gerard Klauer Mattison assumed no
responsibility for and expresses no view as to such forecasts and projections or
the assumptions on which they were based.

     Gerard Klauer Mattison further assumed that the final form of the merger
agreement would not vary in any regard that was material to its analysis and
that the transactions contemplated thereby would be consummated in accordance
with its terms. Gerard Klauer Mattison also assumed that the representations and
warranties of each party to the merger agreement and all related documents were
true and correct, that each party to such documents would perform all covenants
and agreements required to be performed by such party under the documents and
that all conditions to the consummation of the merger would be satisfied without
waiver thereof. Gerard Klauer Mattison also assumed that all governmental,
regulatory or other consents or approvals, if any, will be obtained and that in
the course of obtaining any such consents or approvals, no restrictions will be
imposed or amendments or modifications made that would have a material adverse
effect on the merger.

     Gerard Klauer Mattison has not made or been provided with an independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities, contingent or otherwise,
of Sensory Science and Gerard Klauer Mattison has not made a physical inspection
of the properties or assets of Sensory Science.

     In arriving at its opinion, Gerard Klauer Mattison did not ascribe a
specific range of values to Sensory Science or SONICblue, but rather made its
determination as to fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange
ratio to be offered to Sensory Science's stockholders in the merger on the basis
of the financial and comparative analyses as summarized below. The preparation
of a fairness opinion involves various determinations as to the most appropriate
and relevant method of financial and comparative analysis and the application of
these methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, such an opinion is not
readily susceptible to summary description. Gerard Klauer Mattison believes that
its analyses must be considered as a whole and that considering any portions of
such analyses and factors without considering all analyses and factors could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion.

     The following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses
performed by Gerard Klauer Mattison in connection with its preliminary findings
and the preparation of its opinion letter dated as of January 31, 2001. Some of
these summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular
format. In order to understand fully the financial analyses used by Gerard
Klauer Mattison, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary.
The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial
analyses. Considering the data set forth below in the tables without considering
the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the
methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of Gerard Klauer Mattison's financial analyses.

     Comparable Publicly Traded Companies Analysis. Gerard Klauer Mattison
compared selected financial information for Sensory Science with publicly
available information of selected comparable companies. Specifically, the
comparable companies considered by Gerard Klauer Mattison included: Boston
Acoustics Inc., Cobra Electronics Corporation, Emerson Radio Corporation, Harman
International Industries, Koss Corporation, and Ultrak, Inc.

     For each of the relevant comparable companies, Gerard Klauer Mattison
calculated and analyzed enterprise value multiples of certain historical
financial criteria, such as revenue, and common equity market value multiples of
certain historical financial criteria, such as book value, as of January 31,
2001.

     The following table presents the implied exchange ratio based on
calculation of multiples to the last twelve months' revenue and book value for
the selected comparable companies:

                                             LOW                  HIGH                 MEAN                MEDIAN
                                      ------------------   ------------------   ------------------   ------------------

                                      --------   -------   --------   -------   --------   -------   --------   -------

  Revenue(1)(2).....................   0.16x         NM     1.53x     0.7712     0.64x     0.2402     0.45x     0.1285
Equity Value/Book Value.............    0.5x     0.0166      4.8x     0.1702      2.1x     0.0748      2.0x     0.0693

- -------------------------
(1) Enterprise value equals total market capitalization plus long term debt less
    cash and equivalents.

(2) LTM refers to last twelve months.

     Based on the observed last twelve months revenue and book value multiples
of these selected companies, Gerard Klauer Mattison estimated an implied
exchange ratio range of Sensory Science's common stock for SONICblue common
stock of 0.0166 to 0.7712. Gerard Klauer Mattison noted that an exchange ratio
of 0.0710 pursuant to the merger agreement is within the above range and was
between the mean and median implied exchange ratios determined by Equity
Value/Book Value multiple and lower than the median and mean implied exchange
ratios determined by the Enterprise Value/Last Twelve Months Revenue multiple.
Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself
a meaningful method of using peer group data.

     No company included in the peer group is identical to Sensory Science. In
selecting and evaluating the comparable companies, Gerard Klauer Mattison made
judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Because of the
inherent differences between the business, operations, financial condition and
prospects of Sensory Science and the business, operations, financial condition
and prospects of the companies included as the relevant comparable companies,
Gerard Klauer Mattison believed it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not,
rely solely on the quantitative results of the comparable company analysis.
Accordingly, Gerard Klauer Mattison also looked at trends in certain historical
financial metrics and ratios, such as sales, working capital, book value,
operating income, debt/equity, and compared differences in quarterly and annual
trends of these metrics between Sensory Science and the companies included in
the comparable company analysis. This analysis did not lead to specific
conclusions regarding the implied exchange ratio, but rather were part of Gerard
Klauer Mattison's evaluation of the relevancy of the analysis of the comparable
companies with regard to the particular circumstances of the merger.

     Comparable Transactions Analysis. The comparable transactions analysis
provides a benchmark based on the consideration paid in selected comparable
transactions. For this analysis, Gerard Klauer Mattison compared statistics
based on publicly available information for selected transactions in the
consumer electronics and other related sectors to the relevant financial
statistics for Sensory Science. The following table presents the selected
transactions utilized in Gerard Klauer Mattison's analysis:

                    ACQUIROR                                    TARGET
                    --------                                    ------

Recoton Corp. ..................................  International Jensen Inc.

     For this analysis, Gerard Klauer Mattison reviewed publicly available
information to determine the purchase prices and multiples in the comparable
transactions. The following table summarizes the range of implied exchange
ratios based on calculation of multiples to the last twelve months revenue and
book value for the selected comparable transactions:

                                             LOW                  HIGH                 MEAN                MEDIAN

- -------------------------
(1) Enterprise value equals total market capitalization plus long term debt less
    cash and equivalents.

(2) LTM refers to last twelve months.

     Based on the observed last twelve months revenue and book value multiples
of these selected transactions, Gerard Klauer Mattison estimated an implied
exchange ratio range of Sensory Science's common stock for SONICblue common
stock of 0.0616 to 0.2247. Gerard Klauer Mattison noted that exchange ratio of
0.0710 pursuant to the merger agreement is within the above range and was
between the mean and median implied exchange ratios determined by Equity
Value/Book Value multiple. The ratio was also lower than the median and mean
implied exchange ratios determined by the Enterprise Value/ Last Twelve Months
Revenue multiple.

     No transaction included in the comparable transactions analysis is
identical to the merger of Sensory Science with SONICblue. Gerard Klauer
Mattison made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance,
general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters.
Many of these matters are beyond the control of Sensory Science, such as the
impact of competition on the business of Sensory Science, industry growth and
the absence of any material adverse changes in the financial condition and
prospects of Sensory Science, the industry or the financial markets in general.

     Discounted Equity Value Analysis. The discounted equity value analysis
provides a net present value of the projected equity value of Sensory Science at
the end of 2001. Gerard Klauer Mattison calculated the present value of the
projected future equity value of Sensory Science using internal financial
planning data prepared by the management of Sensory Science. Gerard Klauer
Mattison estimated a range of theoretical values for Sensory Science based on
the net present value of Sensory Science's equity value at December 31, 2001
based upon applying a range of multiples to projected earnings before interest
and taxes of $1.5 million. Gerard Klauer Mattison applied a range of discount
rates of 15.0% to 25.0% and a range of multiples of 10.0x to 20.0x of forecasted
2001 earnings before interest and taxes. Both the equity discount rates and
multiples were based on consumer electronic industry cost of capital and trading
ranges, respectively. This analysis yielded the following results:

                                                   LOW                 HIGH              MEAN             MEDIAN

     Gerard Klauer Mattison observed that the offered exchange ratio of 0.0710
of a share of SONICblue common stock per share of Sensory Science's common stock
was within the range of implied exchange ratios from the equity values resulting
from its discounted equity value analysis. The offered exchange ratio was higher
than the median and mean implied exchange ratios determined by the discounted
equity value analysis.

     Historical Stock Trading Analysis. Gerard Klauer Mattison reviewed the
recent stock price performance of Sensory Science common stock and compared it
with the performance of the Nasdaq National Market as well as a stock price
index comprised of seven publicly traded companies deemed by Gerard Klauer
Mattison to be reasonably comparable to Sensory Science. Specifically, the
comparable

company index consisted of: Boston Acoustics Inc., Cobra Electronics
Corporation, Emerson Radio Corporation, Harman International Industries, Koss
Corporation and Ultrak, Inc.

     Gerard Klauer Mattison noted that Sensory Science's common stock price had
under-performed both of the specified indices on a relative basis over the last
twelve months. Sensory Science declined 79% while the comparable company index
remained flat and Nasdaq increased 14%.

     Gerard Klauer Mattison also compared the exchange ratio of 0.0710, pursuant
to the merger agreement, to selected average historical ratios of the closing
market prices of Sensory Science common stock to SONICblue common stock over
various periods ending January 31, 2001. Gerard Klauer Mattison observed the
following:

     Pro Forma Merger Analysis. Gerard Klauer Mattison reviewed and analyzed
certain pro forma financial effects of the merger on holders of SONICblue common
stock based on the following:

     - the exchange ratio;

     - Sensory Science 2001 projections and the SONICblue 2001 projections,
       excluding potential synergies;

     - purchase accounting treatment; and

     - an assumption for analytical purposes that the merger will be completed
       on December 31, 2000.

     Gerard Klauer Mattison analyzed the potential pro forma effects of the
merger on SONICblue's projected earnings per share as derived through generally
accepted accounting principles, called GAAP EPS, and projected cash earnings per
share, called Cash EPS, which is calculated by adding amortization of goodwill
per share to GAAP EPS. Gerard Klauer Mattison performed this analysis because
Wall Street analysts and investors use projected GAAP EPS and Cash EPS as
valuation benchmarks, along with other valuation benchmarks, and due to the
uncertainty surrounding the ultimate amount of goodwill caused by the
transaction, thus causing uncertainty in determining a precise GAAP EPS
estimate. This analysis indicated that the merger would have no material impact
to SONICblue's GAAP EPS or Cash EPS in 2001. The actual results achieved by the
combined company may vary from projected results. The variations could be
material.

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and, because of
this, a fairness opinion is not easily summarized. Gerard Klauer Mattison
believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all of
its analyses, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its
opinion. In addition, Gerard Klauer Mattison may have given various analyses and
factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed
various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result,
the ranges of exchange ratios resulting from any particular analysis described
above should not be taken to be Gerard Klauer Mattison's view of the actual
value of Sensory Science. In performing its analyses, Gerard Klauer Mattison
made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business
and economic conditions and other matters. Many of these matters are beyond the
control of Sensory Science and any estimates contained in Gerard Klauer
Mattison's analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual
values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested
by such estimates.

     Gerard Klauer Mattison conducted the analyses described above solely as
part of its analysis of the fairness of the exchange ratio to be received by
holders of shares of Sensory Science common stock pursuant to the merger from a
financial point of view and in connection with the delivery of its opinion to

Sensory Science's board. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which Sensory Science might actually be sold.

     The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger were determined
through arm's-length negotiations between Sensory Science and SONICblue and were
approved by Sensory Science's board of directors. Gerard Klauer Mattison
provided advice to Sensory Science during these negotiations. Gerard Klauer
Mattison did not, however, recommend any specific exchange ratio to Sensory
Science or that any specific exchange ratio constituted the only appropriate
exchange ratio for the merger.

     Sensory Science's board retained Gerard Klauer Mattison based upon Gerard
Klauer Mattison's qualifications, experience and expertise in investment
banking. As part of Gerard Klauer Mattison's investment banking business, it is
regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings,
recapitalizations, underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted
securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.
Gerard Klauer Mattison may in the future perform certain financial advisory
services for Sensory Science or SONICblue or their affiliates for which Gerard
Klauer Mattison may receive a fee.

     In connection with Gerard Klauer Mattison's engagement, Sensory Science
requested that Gerard Klauer Mattison evaluate the fairness, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Sensory Science common stock of the exchange
ratio provided for in the merger. Under the terms of an engagement letter dated
January 2001, between Sensory Science and Gerard Klauer Mattison, Sensory
Science agreed to pay Gerard Klauer Mattison a fee of $175,000 for rendering its
fairness opinion, which fee was earned and payable in cash upon date of delivery
of the opinion, but has not yet been delivered. This fee will not be credited
against the financial advisory fees described below. Under the terms of another
Gerard Klauer Mattison engagement letter, dated June 22, 2000, Sensory Science
agreed to pay Gerard Klauer Mattison a financial advisory fee in the event of a
sale transaction in an amount not to be less than $500,000. In addition to the
above described compensation, Sensory Science agreed to reimburse Gerard Klauer
Mattison for all of its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with its engagements including, but not limited to, fees, disbursements and
other charges of its legal counsel; expenses related to due diligence efforts
including research reports and outside consultants; and travel-related expenses.
In addition, Sensory Science has also agreed to indemnify Gerard Klauer Mattison
and its affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents and employees
and each person, if any, controlling Gerard Klauer Mattison or any of its
affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses, including certain
liabilities under the federal securities laws, related to or arising out of
Gerard Klauer Mattison's engagement.

     In the ordinary course of business, Gerard Klauer Mattison may actively
trade the securities of Sensory Science, SONICblue or any other parties involved
in the transaction, for its own account and for the accounts of its customers
and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such
securities.

DIRECTORS OF SONICBLUE

     Upon completion of the merger, the board of directors of SONICblue will
remain unchanged. The board is comprised of five members. Information about the
directors and executive officers of SONICblue may be found beginning on page 72.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     SONICblue intends to account for the acquisition of Sensory Science under
the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, "Business Combinations."
Accordingly, SONICblue will record at its cost the acquired assets less
liabilities assumed, with the excess of such cost over the estimated fair value
of such net assets reflected as goodwill. Additionally, certain costs directly
related to the acquisition will be reflected as additional purchase price in
excess of the net assets acquired. SONICblue's statement of income will include
the operations of Sensory Science after the effective date of the merger.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

     The following is a discussion of the material federal income tax
consequences of the merger to the holders of Sensory Science stock and is based
on the opinion of Snell & Wilmer L.L.P., tax counsel to Sensory Science, dated
as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, that the merger will be
treated for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization qualifying under the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
or the Code. SONICblue has filed the opinion with the SEC as an exhibit to the
registration statement related to this proxy statement/prospectus. See "Where
You Can Find More Information" on page 98. It is a condition to the obligations
of Sensory Science to complete the merger that on the closing date it shall
receive an additional legal opinion from its tax counsel that the merger
constitutes a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
for federal income tax purposes. Although the merger agreement allows Sensory
Science to waive this condition to closing, Sensory Science currently does not
anticipate doing so. This condition to closing may also be satisfied by
SONICblue receiving a tax opinion. If Sensory Science does waive this condition,
the merger will continue despite any possible federal income tax consequences to
you. Sensory Science does not intend to inform you if the condition is waived
nor to resolicit the vote of Sensory Science stockholders as a result of such a
waiver.

     In delivering its opinion regarding the merger as of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, tax counsel relied, and in delivering the closing date
opinion, tax counsel will rely, on (1) representations and covenants made by
SONICblue and Sensory Science, including those contained in certificates of
officers of SONICblue and Sensory Science, and (2) specified assumptions,
including an assumption regarding the completion of the merger in the manner
contemplated by the merger agreement. In addition, in the opinion dated as of
the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, tax counsel has assumed, and tax
counsel's ability to provide the closing date opinion will depend on, the
absence of changes in existing facts or in law between the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus and the closing date. If any of those representations,
covenants or assumptions is inaccurate or if any such change in fact or law
occurs, then tax counsel may not be able to provide the required closing date
opinion and the tax consequences of the merger could differ from those described
in the opinion that tax counsel has delivered. The Internal Revenue Service, or
the IRS, may not adopt tax counsel's opinion and may adopt a contrary position,
which may be sustained by the courts. Neither SONICblue nor Sensory Science
intends to obtain a ruling from the IRS with respect to the tax consequences of
the merger.

     The discussion below is based upon the Code, the regulations promulgated
under the Code, IRS rulings, and judicial and administrative rulings in effect
as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. The discussion below does not address all aspects of federal
income taxation that may be relevant to a stockholder in light of the
stockholder's particular circumstances or to those Sensory Science stockholders
subject to special rules, such as stockholders who are not citizens or residents
of the United States, stockholders that are foreign corporations, foreign
estates or foreign trusts, financial institutions, mutual funds, certain
pass-through entities, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers or
brokers in securities, stockholders who acquired their Sensory Science stock
pursuant to the exercise of options or similar derivative securities or
otherwise as compensation or stockholders who hold their Sensory Science stock
as part of a hedge, appreciated financial position, straddle or conversion
transaction. This discussion assumes that Sensory Science stockholders hold
their respective shares of Sensory Science stock as capital assets within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code.

     Assuming that the merger is treated as a reorganization for federal income
tax purposes qualifying under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code, the
following will be the material federal income tax consequences thereof:

     Federal Income Tax Consequences to Sensory Science Stockholders. Holders of
shares of Sensory Science stock will (1) not recognize any gain or loss for
federal income tax purposes as a result of the exchange of their shares of
Sensory Science stock for SONICblue common stock in the merger except with
respect to cash received instead of a fractional share of SONICblue common
stock, (2) have a tax basis in the SONICblue common stock received in the merger
equal to the tax basis of the Sensory

Science stock surrendered in the merger less any tax basis of the Sensory
Science stock surrendered that is allocable to a fractional share of SONICblue
common stock for which cash is received and (3) have a holding period with
respect to the SONICblue common stock received in the merger that will include
the holding period of the Sensory Science stock surrendered in the merger.

     To the extent that a holder of shares of Sensory Science stock receives
cash instead of a fractional share of SONICblue common stock, the holder will be
required to recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes, measured by
the difference between the amount of cash received and the portion of the tax
basis of the holder's shares of Sensory Science stock allocable to such
fractional share of SONICblue common stock. This gain or loss will be a capital
gain or loss and will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the share of
Sensory Science stock exchanged for the fractional share of SONICblue common
stock was held continuously for more than one year at the effective time of the
merger.

     Under the Code, a holder of Sensory Science stock may be subject, under
certain circumstances, to backup withholding at a rate of 31% with respect to
the amount of cash, if any, received in lieu of a fractional share of SONICblue
stock unless the holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or a correct
taxpayer identification number, and otherwise complies with applicable
requirements of the backup withholding rules. Any amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules are not an additional tax and may be refunded or
credited against the holder's federal income tax liability, provided the
required information is furnished to the IRS.

     WE INTEND THIS DISCUSSION TO PROVIDE ONLY A SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL FEDERAL
INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER. WE DO NOT INTEND THAT IT BE A COMPLETE
ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
MERGER. IN ADDITION, WE DO NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY VARY WITH, OR
ARE CONTINGENT UPON, A STOCKHOLDER'S PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES. MOREOVER, WE DO
NOT ADDRESS ANY NON-INCOME TAX OR ANY FOREIGN, STATE OR LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES
OF THE MERGER. ACCORDINGLY, WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR TO
DETERMINE YOUR UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN INCOME OR OTHER
TAX CONSEQUENCES RESULTING FROM THE MERGER, WITH RESPECT TO YOUR INDIVIDUAL
CIRCUMSTANCES.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Holders of Sensory Science common stock are not entitled to appraisal
rights under Delaware law in connection with the merger. Appraisal rights under
Delaware law are not available in connection with the merger because the shares
of SONICblue common stock that Sensory Science stockholders will be entitled to
receive in the merger will be listed on the Nasdaq National Market at the
closing and because Sensory Science common stock was traded on the American
Stock Exchange as of the record date. For more information about your rights as
a Sensory Science stockholder, see "Information about the Meeting and Voting" on
page 87.

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS CONSEQUENCES; STOCK TRANSFER RESTRICTION AGREEMENTS

     This proxy statement/prospectus does not cover any resales of the SONICblue
common stock to be received by the stockholders of Sensory Science upon
completion of the merger, and no person is authorized to make any use of this
proxy statement/prospectus in connection with any such resale.

     However, all shares of SONICblue common stock received by Sensory Science
stockholders in the merger will be freely transferable, except that shares of
SONICblue common stock received by persons who are deemed to be "affiliates" of
Sensory Science under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, at the time of the
Sensory Science meeting may be resold by them only in transactions permitted by
Rule 145 under the 1933 Act or as otherwise permitted under the 1933 Act.
Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of Sensory Science for such purposes
generally include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by or are
under common control with Sensory Science and include directors and executive
officers of Sensory Science. The merger agreement requires Sensory Science to
cause each of such affiliates to execute a written agreement to the effect that
such persons will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the shares
of SONICblue common stock issued to them in the merger in violation of the 1933
Act or the related SEC rules.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

     In considering the recommendation of the Sensory Science board with respect
to the merger agreement, Sensory Science stockholders should be aware that
certain members of the management of Sensory Science and the Sensory Science
board have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition
to, the interests of the other stockholders of Sensory Science generally.

INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INSURANCE

     For six years after the merger becomes effective, SONICblue has agreed to
indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law and under Sensory
Science's charter documents, the individuals who on or before the closing were
directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives of Sensory Science or
its subsidiaries with respect to all acts or omissions before the closing by
these individuals in these capacities. SONICblue has further agreed to cause
Sensory Science to honor all of its indemnification agreements. SONICblue has
also agreed to provide, for three years after the closing, directors' and
officers' liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring before
the closing covering each person currently covered by Sensory Science's
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy, up to 200% of the per annum
rate of premium paid by Sensory Science. See "The Merger Agreement And Related
Agreements -- Covenants -- Indemnification" on page 80.

SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS

     Sensory Science has a separation agreement with Roger B. Hackett, its
President and Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to which Mr. Hackett will
receive 2.99 times his annual base salary in a lump sum payment upon the closing
of the merger. Mr. Hackett's separation agreement includes a restrictive
covenant that restricts him from competing against Sensory Science for one year.
It is a condition to closing the merger that the non-competition sections of Mr.
Hackett's separation agreement be amended to include the digital television
market.

     Mr. Hackett and Kenneth F. Potashner, the Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer of SONICblue, have agreed to discuss Mr. Hackett's role in the
combined company following the closing of the merger but as of this date, no
employment terms have been established.

     Sensory Science also has a separation agreement with Thomas Linnen, its
Chief Financial Officer. If SONICblue cannot find a mutually agreeable position
for Thomas Linnen in the merged company, he will be terminated. If Mr. Linnen is
terminated, SONICblue will forgive the then outstanding balance of approximately
$32,000 of Mr. Linnen's loan referenced in his offer letter from Sensory Science
dated May 26, 1999, and he will receive six months severance at his base salary
as provided in that offer letter.

STOCK OPTION PLANS

     At the effective time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Sensory Science common stock will cease to represent a right to acquire shares
of Sensory Science common stock. Instead, each of these options will constitute
an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as applied to the Sensory
Science stock option prior to the effective time, the number, rounded down to
the nearest whole number, of shares of SONICblue common stock determined by
multiplying:

     - the number of shares of Sensory Science common stock subject to the
       option immediately before the effective time by

     - the exchange ratio.

The exercise price of each option will be a price per share of Sensory Science
common stock, rounded to the nearest whole cent, equal to:

     - the per share exercise price for Sensory Science common stock that
       otherwise could have been purchased under the Sensory Science stock
       option divided by

     - the exchange ratio.

                 COMPARATIVE PER-SHARE MARKET PRICE INFORMATION

     SONICblue common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market and Sensory
Science common stock is listed on the American Stock Exchange. SONICblue's

(1) Through April 18, 2001.

     On January 31, 2001, the last full trading day before the public
announcement of the proposed merger, the last reported closing price was $7.6875
per share for SONICblue common stock and $0.64 per share for Sensory Science
common stock. On             , 2001, the most recent practicable date prior to
the printing of this proxy statement/prospectus, the last reported closing price
was $     per share for SONICblue common stock and $          per share for
Sensory Science common stock. We urge you to obtain current market quotations
prior to making any decision as to how to vote your shares with respect to the
merger. See "Risk Factors" on page 12.

     Following the merger, SONICblue common stock will continue to be traded on
the Nasdaq National Market under the ticker symbol "SBLU."

     As of             , 2001, there were approximately        stockholders of
record of SONICblue common stock and approximately                stockholders
of record of Sensory Science common stock. SONICblue and Sensory Science have
not declared or paid cash dividends on their respective capital stock in the
past, and they do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
Both companies currently intend to retain future earnings for the development of
their businesses. Further, Sensory Science's credit agreement with Congress
Financial Corporation does not allow it to pay cash dividends without the
consent of the lender.

          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements include:

     - unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the
       year ended December 31, 2000;

     - unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31,
       2000; and

     - the accompanying notes to unaudited pro forma condensed combined
       financial statements.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31,
2000 reflects the financial position of SONICblue after giving effect to the
acquisitions of Sensory Science and ReplayTV, Inc. ("ReplayTV") and the transfer
of SONICblue's graphics chips assets as if these transactions occurred on
December 31, 2000.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the
year ended December 31, 2000 assumes the acquisitions of Sensory Science and
ReplayTV and the disposition of the graphics chips business occurred on January
1, 2000. The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and based on management's
estimates. Based on the timing of the closing of the transaction, the
finalization of the integration plans and other factors, final adjustments may
differ materially from those presented in these pro forma financial statements.

     The historical Sensory Science unaudited condensed combined statement of
operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 have been derived from
the historical annual and interim financial statements included in Forms 10-K
and 10-Q that have been filed with the SEC. The statements of operations for the
nine months ended December 31, 2000 were added to the results for the three
months ended March 31, 2000 to arrive at the results of operations for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2000. The historical ReplayTV unaudited
condensed combined financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of
normal recurring accruals, necessary to present fairly the financial position
and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not
include the effects of the March 2001 sale of SONICblue's professional graphics
division because such effects are not material to SONICblue's financial position
and results of operations.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are not
necessarily indicative of what the actual financial results would have been had
the transactions described above taken place on January 1, 2000, or December 31,
2000. In addition, they do not purport to indicate the future results of
operations or financial position of Sensory Science, ReplayTV, VIA Technologies,
Inc., ("VIA"), S3 Graphics Co., Ltd. or SONICblue.

     These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the SONICblue historical consolidated financial
statements and related notes included in this proxy statement/prospectus and
Sensory Science's consolidated financial statements and related notes
incorporated into this proxy statement/prospectus by reference.

                              FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

  Disposition of Graphic Chips Business to VIA

     On January 3, 2001, SONICblue completed the transactions contemplated by
the Amended and Restated Investment Agreement, dated as of August 28, 2000
between SONICblue, VIA and a joint venture. At the closing, SONICblue completed
the transfer of its graphics chips assets and liabilities to a joint venture
("JV") owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of SONICblue and VIA. Under the terms
of the agreement, SONICblue received 13 million shares of its stock as initial
payment from VIA and 100 million shares of Class A Common Stock of the JV.
SONICblue has announced its intention to cancel the 13 million shares which are
currently held as treasury shares. The agreement provides that, upon occurrence
of certain events, SONICblue shall pay damages subject to a maximum damages cap.
Also, SONICblue may receive earn-out payments if the new venture meets certain
profitability goals. The effect of the earn-out payments, if any, has not been
included in the unaudited pro forma financial statements.

     The agreement provides that the Class A shareholder, Class B shareholder
(VIA) and Class C shareholder (an independent third party) shall have 50%, 48%
and 2%, respectively, of the voting power of JV, irrespective of the actual
number of outstanding shares of such class with respect to the election of
directors, and own 0.1%, 99.4% and 0.5%, respectively, of the economic interest
of JV.

     At closing, SONICblue granted a wholly owned subsidiary of VIA a warrant
(the "Warrant") to purchase up to 2 million shares of SONICblue common stock at
an exercise price of $10.00 per share, for an aggregate exercise price of $20
million. The Warrant expires on January 3, 2005, unless terminated earlier
pursuant to its terms. The fair value of the Warrant is recorded in the pro
forma balance sheet.

  Acquisition of Sensory Science

     Under the terms of the merger agreement between SONICblue and Sensory
Science, each outstanding share of Sensory Science common stock shall be
exchanged for at least 0.0710 of a share of SONICblue common stock. This
exchange ratio is conditional upon the average closing price of SONICblue's
stock during the ten trading days prior to the closing date remaining above
$7.0988. If the ten-day average falls between $5.5213 and $7.0988, the exchange
ratio equals the quotient (rounded to four decimal places) obtained by dividing
$0.504 by the ten-day average. If the ten-day average falls below $5.5213, the
exchange ratio shall equal 0.0913. Since the current market price of SONICblue
stock is currently below $5.5213, the pro forma financial statements have been
prepared under the assumption that the exchange ratio will be 0.0913. The merger
agreement also calls for the conversion of outstanding options and warrants to
purchase shares of Sensory Science common stock into options and warrants to
purchase shares of SONICblue common stock using the applicable exchange ratio.
The acquisition is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization and to be
accounted for as a purchase.

  Acquisition of ReplayTV

     On March 26, 2000 SONICblue announced that it had signed a definitive
agreement to acquire ReplayTV. Under the terms of the agreement, SONICblue will
issue an aggregate of 15.5 million shares of its common stock and options and
warrants to purchase shares of SONICblue common stock in exchange for all of
ReplayTV's outstanding equity interests, and ReplayTV will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of SONICblue. The agreement also provides that if the value of the
SONICblue common stock to be issued to stockholders of ReplayTV at the closing
of the transaction is less than $80 million, ReplayTV may terminate the
agreement unless SONICblue, at its option, either pays additional cash or issues
additional shares to bring the value at closing to $80 million. The acquisition
is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization and to be accounted for as a
purchase. Completion of the transaction is subject

to regulatory and ReplayTV stockholder approval, and the satisfaction of other
customary closing conditions.

ADJUSTMENTS

     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements give effect
to the following pro forma adjustments (in thousands, except share data):

          (1) To reflect the elimination of assets transferred to and
     liabilities assumed by the JV in exchange for 13 million shares of
     SONICblue common stock and 100 million Class A shares of the JV and to
     record the fair value of the issuance of the Warrant of $10,380.

          (2) To eliminate the operating results of the disposed graphics chips
     assets for the year ended December 31, 2000.

          (3) To record the elimination of Sensory Science's common stock and
     accumulated deficit and the issuance of SONICblue common stock.

          (4) To record the purchase price in respect to the Sensory Science
     acquisition and estimated goodwill and intangibles in the amount of $7,334
     together with estimated amortization of goodwill and intangibles of $1,467
     for the year ended December 31, 2000 (five-year amortization period). The
     purchase price includes $1,500 of estimated transaction costs and excludes
     the effect of the assumption of Sensory Science options and warrants,
     because the valuation of these securities is not currently available.
     Estimated transaction costs consist primarily of Securities and Exchange
     Commission, or SEC, filing fees, fees and expenses of investment bankers,
     attorneys and accountants, and financing printing and other related
     charges.

          (5) To record the elimination of ReplayTV's preferred and common stock
     and accumulated deficit and the issuance of SONICblue common stock.

          (6) To record the purchase price in respect to the ReplayTV
     acquisition and estimated goodwill and intangibles in the amount of $99,997
     together with estimated amortization of goodwill and intangibles of $19,999
     for the year ended December 31, 2000 (five-year amortization period). The
     purchase price assumes the minimum number of shares to be issued under the
     agreement, includes $950 of estimated transaction costs and excludes the
     effect of the assumption of ReplayTV options and warrants, because the
     valuation of these securities is not currently available. The actual number
     of shares to be issued is subject to the terms as described on page 49.

     frontpath. Through its wholly owned subsidiary frontpath, inc., SONICblue
pursues opportunities in the information appliance home and vertical markets
such as medical, education, travel and entertainment. frontpath is introducing
portable solutions to bring the power of the Internet to businesses by offering
a broadband, wireless information appliance focused on customized applications
and personalized information for anywhere, anytime use.

     Access. The Access business unit develops products under the Diamond brand,
including the Diamond Mako personal digital assistant, or PDA, HomeFree
networking products and Supra fax/modems. Access is focused on delivering
products that allow consumers to tie Internet appliances, or iAppliances, and PC
peripherals together and to enable multiple device or user access to a
high-speed Internet connection or a virtual private network.

     SONICblue sells its products through distributors, retailers, e-commerce
websites, including its own on-line e-store, mail order catalogs and national
reseller organizations. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, SONICblue has
sales, marketing, customer care and technical facilities in several locations,
including Albany, Oregon; Austin, Texas; Billerica, Massachusetts; Vancouver,
Washington; Hong Kong, P.R.C.; Paris, France; Saarbrucken, Germany; Seoul,
Korea; Singapore; Starnberg, Germany; Sydney, Australia; Taiwan, R.O.C.; Tokyo,
Japan; and Winnersh, U.K.

     SONICblue was incorporated as S3 Incorporated on January 9, 1989 in the
State of Delaware and changed its name to SONICblue Incorporated in November
2000. SONICblue operates in one principal industry segment.

BACKGROUND

     Prior to the transfer in January 2001 of its graphics chips business to S3
Graphics Co., Ltd., a joint venture between VIA Technologies, Inc., or VIA, and
a wholly owned subsidiary of SONICblue, SONICblue was a leading supplier of
graphics and multimedia accelerator subsystems for personal computers, or PCs,
for more than ten years. In September 1999, SONICblue made a significant
strategic shift by merging with Diamond Multimedia Systems, Inc., an established
PC original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, and retail provider of
communications and home networking solutions, PC graphics and audio add-in
boards, digital audio players and information appliances. Diamond products
included the Rio line of digital audio players, the Stealth and Viper series of
video accelerators, the Monster series of gaming accelerators, the Fire series
of NT workstation 3-D graphics accelerators, the Supra series of modems and the
HomeFree line of home networking products. The merger with Diamond established
SONICblue as a single graphics solutions provider, including the silicon, board
and software elements, in the retail, commercial and OEM PC graphics markets.

     In November 1999, SONICblue and VIA established a joint venture to design,
produce and market high-performance integrated graphics and core logic chip sets
to the volume OEM desktop and notebook PC markets. The joint venture, S3-VIA
Inc., was jointly funded with access to both SONICblue's and

VIA's technology as well as distribution rights for developed products between
SONICblue and VIA. At December 31, 2000, SONICblue owned 50.1% of the voting
common stock of S3-VIA and, accordingly, consolidated the accounts of S3-VIA
Inc. in its consolidated financial statements. In January 2001, SONICblue's
interest in S3-VIA was transferred, along with SONICblue's graphics chip
business, to S3 Graphics Co., Ltd., another joint venture between VIA and a
wholly owned subsidiary of SONICblue, as described in "Recent Developments"
below.

     In January 2000, SONICblue publicly announced that it was exploring
business transactions intended to increase stockholder value by separating its
graphics chips division from its other business. In February 2000, SONICblue
purchased substantially all of the assets of Number Nine Visual Technology
Corporation, a supplier of graphics accelerator subsystems for PCs using
SONICblue graphics chips. The acquisition of the assets of Number Nine, a
supplier to IBM, allowed SONICblue to consolidate its graphics business with IBM
into a single source distribution model and furthered SONICblue's strategy of
becoming a single graphics solution provider to the PC graphics market. The
acquisition also added skilled hardware and software engineering resources to
SONICblue's existing teams.

     In August 2000, SONICblue announced the shut-down of its Diamond video and
gaming accelerator business. In September 2000, SONICblue formed frontpath as a
wholly owned subsidiary to develop information appliances, such as accessible
wireless portable devices to allow businesses and consumers to live connected at
home, at work and at play.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     In November 2000, SONICblue acquired U.K. digital audio equipment
manufacturer Empeg Limited, known as empeg, for $1.9 million. One of the first
companies to design and bring to market digital audio players for automobiles,
empeg has become a part of SONICblue's Rio division, and empeg's technology
formed the basis for the recently introduced Rio Car audio player.

     In January 2001, SONICblue completed the transfer of its graphics chips
assets to S3 Graphics Co., Ltd., another joint venture between VIA and a wholly
owned subsidiary of SONICblue. The joint venture will manufacture and distribute
graphics products and conduct related research and development activities.
Pursuant to the joint venture agreement with VIA, SONICblue received 13 million
shares of SONICblue common stock as payment, and the joint venture assumed
certain liabilities relating to the graphics chips business. Upon the occurrence
of events specified in the investment agreement between SONICblue and VIA,
SONICblue must pay specified liquidated damages, subject to a maximum damages
cap. Under the joint venture agreement, SONICblue will also receive earn-out
payments if the new venture meets specified profitability goals. At closing,
SONICblue issued to a wholly owned subsidiary of VIA a warrant to purchase up to
2 million shares of SONICblue common stock at an exercise price of $10.00 per
share, for an aggregate exercise price of $20 million.

     In February 2001, SONICblue announced that it signed a definitive agreement
to acquire Sensory Science, which is the subject of this proxy
statement/prospectus. Pending the consummation of the acquisition of Sensory
Science, SONICblue has made a loan to Sensory Science in the amount of $3
million and has obtained a warrant to purchase 5,357,143 shares of Sensory
Science common stock.

     In March 2001, SONICblue signed a definitive agreement to acquire ReplayTV,
Inc., a developer of personal television technology. Under the terms of the
agreement, SONICblue will issue an aggregate of 15.5 million shares of common
stock and options and warrants to purchase shares of SONICblue common stock in
exchange for all of ReplayTV's outstanding equity, and ReplayTV will become a
wholly owned subsidiary of SONICblue. The agreement also provides that if the
value of the SONICblue common stock to be issued to stockholders of ReplayTV at
the closing of the transaction is less than $80 million, ReplayTV may terminate
the agreement unless SONICblue, at its option, either pays additional cash or
issues additional shares to bring the value at closing to $80 million. In
connection with the proposed acquisition of ReplayTV, SONICblue has made loans
to Replay in the amount of $10 million and agreed to loan ReplayTV up to an
additional $6 million.

     In March 2001, SONICblue completed the sale to ATI Technologies, Inc. of
its professional graphics division, based in Starnberg, Germany, which produced
the Fire GL line of graphics accelerators. Under the terms of an Asset Purchase
Agreement, SONICblue received $2.7 million in cash and is eligible to receive
further financial consideration of up to $7.3 million, contingent upon the Fire
GL graphics business, as operated by ATI, achieving future performance targets.

PRODUCTS

     Rio Digital Audio Players. The Rio 300 and Rio 500 were SONICblue's first
portable digital audio players, followed by the Rio 600, Rio 800 and Rio 800
Extreme. Rio players allow users to enjoy near-compact disc, or CD, quality
audio that has been uploaded to the device from a PC's hard drive in the MP3
compression format or Windows Media, or WMA, format. Users may download music
from the Internet and transfer music from personal CDs and other digital formats
for upload to, and playback using, a Rio player. The handheld Rio player uses
flash memory and is battery powered.

     Diamond shipped the industry's first hand-held digital audio player in
November 1998. In 1999, as competitors entered the market with similar first
generation devices, Diamond introduced the second-generation Rio 500 handheld
player. The PC and Macintosh-compatible Rio 500 stores and plays up to two hours
of music with improved fidelity and gives users more freedom to manage their
audio content, compared to the Rio 300, and uses a universal serial bus, or USB,
connection for faster upload speeds. Models developed after the Rio 300 are also
upgradeable to support future audio formats. In 2000, SONICblue introduced the
Rio 600 and Rio 800, with up to one and two hours of music storage,
respectively. For the fitness enthusiast, the Rio division partnered with Nike
to deliver the psa[play 60 and psa[play 120 digital audio players, both built
for exercise and high endurance activities. The recently released Rio 800
Extreme plays up to 12 hours of music based on its 384 megabytes, or MB, of
memory, consisting of 256MB on-board memory with a 128MB backpack, a clip on or
external memory device.

     The Rio division has also introduced two models of clip-on Rio memory
backpacks which offer an extra hour or two hours of storage for owners of Rio
600 and Rio 800 players.

     In January 2001, SONICblue began shipping the Rio Volt, a portable CD
player that plays standard music CDs and recordable CDs containing MP3 and WMA
files.

     In addition to its handheld Rio devices, SONICblue has also been developing
other digital audio products for use in consumers' homes, offices and
automobiles. SONICblue recently introduced the Rio Car, a removable in-dash
digital audio player with models ranging from 10 gigabytes, or GB, to 60GB, or
up to 1,000 hours of music, based on technology from empeg, and the Rio Digital
Audio Receiver, a device that uses existing phone lines to stream digital music
from a home computer to any room in which a receiver is located. The Rio
division is developing new products that will give users other ways to enjoy
digital audio, including a Rio boombox.

     Diamond Mako. SONICblue announced the launch of the Diamond Mako connected
organizer in October 2000, the first product to be released under an agreement
with Psion Computers PLC. The Mako is a PDA focused on mobile productivity,
combining organizer, spreadsheet, word-processing, e-mail and web-browsing
applications in a clamshell design that fits in a user's pocket. It includes a
full keyboard, 480-by-160 pixel display and 16MB of memory. Mobile connectivity
is available through an optional 56 kilobits per second, or 56K, travel modem or
through a compatible data and infrared modem phone linked to a network service
provider. The Diamond Mako synchronizes with PCs via its serial port docking
station, and users can connect to other PDAs via the standard infrared port to
beam contact data back and forth.

     HomeFree Home Networking and Digital Subscriber Line, or DSL, Residential
Gateway Products. SONICblue's Diamond brand HomeFree communications products
allow users to network multiple PCs throughout their home via phone or power
lines to share Internet access, content and peripheral devices and to engage in
multiple platform applications such as head-to-head gaming.

     SONICblue's HomeFree Phoneline USB uses a USB connection and is currently
the only cross-platform (Windows and Macintosh-compatible) home networking
product on the market. SONICblue's HomeFree Phoneline 10 million bits per
seconds, or Mbps, networking product allows users to share Internet access,
content and peripheral devices, transferring information at speeds of up to
10Mbps. In addition, the recently announced HomeFree Asymmetric Digital
Subscriber Line, or ADSL, Residential Gateway allows users to network their DSL
Internet connection throughout their entire household. In January 2001,
SONICblue announced the HomeFree Powerline, a home networking solution based on
Intellon Corporation's PowerPacket powerline technology, which allows multiple
PCs to share broadband Internet connections, MP3 music, video and peripherals,
such as printers and scanners, as well as play multiplayer games by plugging
into a common power outlet, transferring information at speeds of up to 10Mbps.

     In December 1999, SONICblue and Covad Communications, Inc., a nationwide
DSL service provider, agreed to jointly market and sell SONICblue's HomeFree
Phoneline and Residential Gateway products with Covad's services, providing
consumers with a one-stop shopping DSL solution.

     Supra Modems. Under the Diamond brand, SONICblue markets a family of
dial-up fax/data modems that include the SupraExpress and SupraMax family of
modems. The SupraExpress family of modems are external fax/data modems that
connect via a serial cable or USB interface, support the 56K International
Telecommunications Union, or ITU, standard (V.90) and are PC and/or Macintosh
compatible. The SupraMax family of modems are internal fax/data modem solutions
that connect via the Peripheral Component Interconnect, or Industry Standard
Architecture, interface for legacy configurations, while providing an upgraded
56K connection.

     frontpath Information Appliances. SONICblue is exploring and developing a
range of Internet devices that are intended to combine its existing expertise in
home networking, consumer design and ease of use with core technology from
industry-leaders such as Transmeta, Cirrus Logic and others. frontpath's first
product, the ProGear Information Appliance, is a web pad based on Transmeta's
Crusoe processor. The Linux-based ProGear is a wireless, fully portable,
broadband-based product which combines a 10.4 inch liquid crystal display screen
with touchscreen technology and handwriting recognition and provides the full
range of media content, including e-mail, web browser, personal organizer,
customer applications, MP3s and ebooks.

     SONICblue's successful development, manufacture and marketing of its
current and future products are subject to a number of risks discussed in the
section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations -- Factors That May Affect Results."

SONICBLUE'S INVESTMENTS

     In October 1999, SONICblue caused RioPort, Inc., formerly RioPort.com,
Inc., which was a wholly owned subsidiary of SONICblue, to sell shares of its
preferred stock to third party investors. RioPort is developing an integrated
platform for acquiring, managing and experiencing music and spoken audio
programming from the Internet. As a result, SONICblue retains a minority
investment in RioPort and accounts for its investment using the equity method.
In addition, in November 1999, SONICblue received $10.9 million for the sale to
RioPort of OneStep, LLC, a software development company. In June 2000, RioPort
sold additional preferred stock to third party investors. As part of this
financing, SONICblue invested an additional $10.7 million in RioPort,
maintaining its percentage ownership of RioPort. In the fourth quarter 2000,
RioPort sold additional preferred stock to third party investors. As of December
31, 2000, SONICblue held approximately 33% of RioPort's outstanding stock.

     In 1995, SONICblue entered into a joint foundry venture with United
Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC, to build United Semiconductor Corporation,
or USC, a semiconductor manufacturing facility in Taiwan, R.O.C. In January
2000, USC merged with UMC and, as a result of the merger, SONICblue received 252
million UMC shares in exchange for 252 million USC shares. SONICblue also
received a 20% stock dividend, or approximately 50.4 million shares of UMC
stock, in April 2000, increasing SONICblue's holdings to approximately 302
million shares. SONICblue sold 15 million shares of UMC

stock in 2000 and 25 million shares in the first quarter of 2001 on the Taiwan
Stock Exchange. Under the terms of the USC merger with UMC and the laws of
Taiwan, 50% of the UMC shares received by SONICblue are classified as restricted
because they are subject to restrictions on their sale that lapse over a
three-year period from the date of the merger. At December 31, 2000,
approximately 126 million shares were restricted and are recorded as a long-term
investment at cost. The unrestricted shares are recorded as a current asset and
are valued at market in accordance with SFAS 115. At December 31, 2000, the
market value of both SONICblue's short-term and long-term investment in UMC had
declined by $519.8 million below its original cost basis. It was determined that
this decline was related to the downturn in the semiconductor industry as a
whole and was temporary in nature due to the historically cyclical nature of the
industry. The available-for-sale portion of SONICblue's investment was
marked-to-market through other comprehensive income as required by SFAS 115.
Subsequent to the year-end, the market value of SONICblue's investment in UMC
remained significantly below SONICblue's cost. The downturn in the semiconductor
industry and the economy in general appears to be more severe than previously
anticipated. There is a great deal of uncertainty regarding when the
semiconductor industry will recover from this down cycle. SONICblue is
continuing to evaluate its need to reduce the value of its investment. Should
SONICblue conclude that the decline in value is other than temporary, it will
report a loss in other income and expense at that time. As of March 31, 2001,
SONICblue's 252 million UMC shares held as of that date were worth approximately
$408 million, based on the closing price of UMC shares on the Taiwan Stock
Exchange on that date and the U.S. dollar to New Taiwan Dollar exchange rate
prevailing on that date. The value of SONICblue's UMC shares fluctuates based on
the trading price of UMC shares on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. No assurance can
be given that SONICblue would realize the $408 million value as of March 31,
2001 if it were to liquidate its investment.

     During 2000, in addition to the further investment in RioPort, SONICblue
made a number of investments in companies that are developing technology in
areas such as semiconductors, user interfaces, networking, peripherals and
digital audio music content including ComSilica, Inc., CyberPIXIE.com, Inc.,
DataPlay, Inc., Entridia Corporation, Epic Technologies Inc., ETC Music, Inc.,
Intellon Corporation and KB Gear Interactive, Inc.

MARKETS AND STRATEGY

     SONICblue's business strategy is to identify emerging markets and
customers' needs, to use its technological expertise to quickly provide
integrated, easy to install and use, high-performance multimedia and
connectivity solutions for the PC platform, and to use its worldwide channels to
achieve broad distribution and support of its products. SONICblue aims to expand
its position as a leader in multimedia and connectivity products for the home,
enabling consumers to create, access and experience compelling new media content
from their desktops and through the Internet. SONICblue's objectives for 2001
include: capitalizing on new technologies such as digital audio over the
Internet, digital video over the Internet, information appliances, broadband
modems and home networking; expanding international sales; increasing
penetration of the market for its digital audio players; and, in connection with
its proposed acquisitions of ReplayTV and Sensory Science, expanding its digital
media products to include video and personal television.

     Recognizing the rapid conversion of consumer electronic products from
analog to digital technology, the convergence of consumer and computing systems
into new and evolving information access devices and the PC's inherent position
as the most advanced and well-positioned digital platform, SONICblue intends to
leverage its PC and consumer technology expertise to develop new products for
both computer and consumer applications that exploit these trends. Through
several recent acquisitions and investments, SONICblue has been able to add to
its technical expertise and expand its product offerings while further improving
its distribution channels and market presence both domestically and
internationally.

SALES, MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT

     SONICblue sells its products through independent domestic and international
distributors and directly to retailers, mass merchants and other resellers.
SONICblue also sells its retail products in the

United States through e-commerce web sites, including its own on-line store,
mail-order catalogs and national reseller organizations. SONICblue is currently
seeking to expand its penetration of e-commerce, retail and mass-merchant
consumer electronics channels.

     SONICblue has been making significant efforts to expand its retail sales
channels through international penetration in Europe, Latin America, and the
Asia-Pacific region, including Japan. The requirements of these regions are,
however, substantially different from one another and from the North American
market. The inability of SONICblue to successfully penetrate any of these
channels or to manage them on a profitable basis could have a material adverse
effect on future operating results. Additional information regarding geographic
areas is included in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Export sales accounted for 56%, 70% and 89% of sales in 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. Approximately 33% of export sales in 2000 were to affiliates
of United States customers. SONICblue's efforts to expand international
distribution of its products have historically subjected SONICblue to the risks
of conducting business internationally. Presently, SONICblue's efforts to expand
international distribution of current products as well as S3 Graphics Co., Ltd.,
the joint venture between VIA and wholly owned subsidiary of SONICblue, continue
to subject SONICblue to the risks of conducting business internationally,
including those set forth under "Risk Factors -- Risk Factors Related to
SONICblue -- SONICblue Has Significant Exposure to International Markets."

     SONICblue maintains a customer service and technical support organization
focused on providing value to customers beyond the purchase of SONICblue's
products. In this regard, SONICblue provides on-line customer service and
technical support to retail customers via e-mail and telephone and an artificial
intelligence "wizard" accessible through SONICblue's web site, as well as
through facsimile and direct telephonic communication. SONICblue supports the
online community through its presence on the Internet, where technical support,
frequently asked questions and a searchable knowledge base can be found.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

     SONICblue believes that continued investment in research and development
are critical to its ability to introduce, on a timely basis and at competitive
prices, new and enhanced products incorporating the latest technology and
addressing emerging market needs. SONICblue's research and development staff
consisted of 321 employees at December 31, 2000 and 181 employees at March 1,
2001, subsequent to the transfer of the graphics chips business to S3 Graphics
Co., Ltd., the joint venture between VIA and a wholly owned subsidiary of
SONICblue. SONICblue's engineers are engaged in the development of new products
such as web pads, new generations of the Rio player, home networking devices,
and other emerging PC and Internet multimedia functions. SONICblue's software
engineers are engaged in ongoing development of software and firmware drivers to
enhance the performance of video and audio accelerators, analog and digital
modems, and various information appliances, as well as upgrades to SONICblue's
proprietary software utility applications. Research and development expenses,
which included the graphics chips business, were $83.4 million, $73.9 million
and $78.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.

     SONICblue also endeavors to work closely with third parties that are
strategic to SONICblue's business. Specifically, SONICblue works with suppliers
of audio, modem and other multimedia chipsets in an effort to select the
appropriate advanced components for SONICblue's new digital media products.
SONICblue seeks to develop in a timely manner the software required to
incorporate multimedia chipsets into SONICblue's products, and SONICblue's
products into the evolving architecture and capabilities of the PC and the
Internet. SONICblue also works with leading PC hardware, operating system and
software applications suppliers in an effort to stay abreast of emerging
opportunities and new standards in the market. There can be no assurance that
SONICblue's development efforts will be successful, or that SONICblue will be
able to introduce competitive new products into the marketplace in a timely
manner.

MANUFACTURING METHODOLOGY

     SONICblue uses an international network of independent electronics assembly
subcontractors, principally located in Asia, to assemble and test its products.
SONICblue generally procures its current hardware products on a turnkey basis
from its subcontract manufacturing suppliers and anticipates that, in the
future, the only products not being procured primarily on a turnkey basis will
be new products in their launch phase.

     SONICblue packages the assembled products its receives from its
subcontractors with software, manuals and additional hardware components,
placing such materials in retail packaging for the retail and mass-merchant
channel. While SONICblue uses several electronics assembly subcontractors to
minimize the risk of business interruption, there can be no assurance that a
problem will not arise with one or more of these suppliers that could adversely
affect operating results.

     There can be no assurance that SONICblue will obtain sufficient sources of
supply of product to meet customer demand in the future. Obtaining sufficient
flash memory is particularly difficult during periods of high growth, and may
become substantially more difficult if SONICblue's product requirements increase
significantly.

     Although SONICblue extensively tests its software and hardware products
prior to their introduction, it is possible that design errors may be discovered
after initial product sampling, resulting in delays in volume production or
recall of products sold. The occurrence of any such errors could have a material
adverse effect on SONICblue's reputation, product introduction schedule and
operating results.

COMPETITION

     The markets in which SONICblue operates are extremely competitive, and
SONICblue expects that competition will increase. SONICblue competes directly
against a large number of suppliers of audio subsystems, PDAs, information
appliances, home networking products and PC communications products. In the
digital audio player market, competitors include Audiovox, Casio, Creative
Technology, and its U.S. entity, Creative Labs, Intel, Thompson Multimedia,
Samsung and Sony. In the areas of Internet appliances, home networking and
modems, SONICblue faces competition from companies such as 3Com, Compaq, D-link,
Intel, Linksys, NetGear, Netpliance, NIC, Motorola and Zoom Telephonics.
Competitors in the PDA market include Handspring, Palm, Sharp and Symbian.

     SONICblue's markets are expected to become increasingly competitive as
multimedia and connectivity functions continue to converge, the price of the
average PC declines and companies that previously supplied products providing
distinct functions, such as companies in the audio, video, modem and networking
markets, emerge as competitors across broader product categories and in the
emerging category of PC and information appliances. SONICblue may also face
competition from integrated or add-on products, such as digital phones or
digital cameras that incorporate audio player functions or PDAs that have
optional plug-in audio players.

     SONICblue believes that its ability to compete successfully depends upon a
number of factors both within and outside of its control, including product
performance, product features, product availability, price, brand strength,
quality, timing of new product introductions by SONICblue and its competitors,
the emergence of new digital audio and PC standards, customer support and
industry and general economic trends. SONICblue believes that it competes
favorably with respect to these factors. There can be no assurance that
SONICblue will have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing,
distribution and support capabilities to compete successfully. SONICblue's
future success will be highly dependent upon the successful development and
introduction of new products that are responsive to market needs. There can be
no assurance that SONICblue will be able to successfully develop or market any
such products.

LICENSES, PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

     SONICblue, when appropriate, files United States patent applications for
its technology. SONICblue has also built its patent portfolio substantially
through acquisitions, including patent purchases and cross-licenses as well as
through its acquisition of Diamond. SONICblue currently has a total of 96 United
States patents which it has been issued or has acquired and 27 United States
patent applications. SONICblue attempts to protect its trade secrets and other
proprietary information through agreements with its customers, suppliers,
employees and consultants, and through other security measures. Although
SONICblue intends to protect its rights vigorously, there can be no assurance
that these measures will be successful or that any issued patents will provide
SONICblue with adequate protection with respect to the covered products,
technology or processes.

     SONICblue has applied to the United States Patent and Trademark Office for
registration of a number of trademarks and also holds common law rights in a
number of trademarks. SONICblue has also applied for trademark registration of
some of its trademarks in certain foreign jurisdictions. There can be no
assurance that SONICblue will obtain the registrations for which it has applied.
If SONICblue's use of a registered or unregistered trademark were found to
violate a third party's common law or statutory trademark rights, SONICblue's
business could be adversely affected.

     In addition, the laws of certain countries in which SONICblue's products
are or may be developed, manufactured or sold, including China, Japan and
Taiwan, may not protect SONICblue's products and intellectual property rights to
the same extent as the laws of the United States.

BACKLOG

     Sales of SONICblue's products are often made pursuant to standard purchase
orders that are cancelable without significant penalties. In addition, purchase
orders are subject to price renegotiations and to changes in quantities of
products and delivery schedules in order to reflect changes in customers'
requirements and manufacturing availability. SONICblue's business, and to a
large and growing extent that of the entire consumer electronics and personal
computer connectivity industries, are characterized by seasonality, short lead
time orders and quick delivery schedules. In addition, SONICblue's actual
shipments depend on the manufacturing capacity of SONICblue's suppliers and the
availability of products from such suppliers. As a result of these factors,
SONICblue does not believe that its backlog at any given time is a meaningful
indicator of future sales.

EMPLOYEES

     At December 31, 2000, SONICblue employed 813 individuals, of whom 130 were
employed in operations, 321 in research and development, 169 in sales, marketing
and technical support and 193 in administration and other support functions.
Subsequent to the transfer of the graphics chips business to the joint venture
between VIA and a wholly owned subsidiary of SONICblue, at March 1, 2001,
SONICblue employed 535 individuals, of whom 78 were employed in operations, 181
in research and development, 169 in sales, marketing and technical support and
107 in administration and other support functions. Competition for personnel in
the digital media, consumer electronics, Internet appliance and home networking
industries is intense, as is competition for all categories of personnel in the
Silicon Valley where many of SONICblue's employees are located. SONICblue
believes that its future success will depend, in part, on its ability to
continue to attract, train, motivate, retain and manage highly skilled
technical, marketing and management personnel.

     None of SONICblue's employees are represented by a labor union or is
subject to a collective bargaining agreement. SONICblue believes that its
relations with its employees are good.

PROPERTIES

     SONICblue's principal administrative, sales, marketing, research and
development facilities in Santa Clara, California consists of one building of
approximately 150,000 square feet of space which is leased by

SONICblue through January 2008. SONICblue relocated to its Santa Clara
facilities in 1997, at which time it leased and occupied both its current space
and an adjacent building also consisting of approximately 150,000 square feet.
SONICblue developed both buildings in partnership with a real estate developer
during 1995 and 1996. In October 1998, SONICblue sublet one of the buildings for
the remaining term of the lease. In June 1999, SONICblue assigned its entire
interest in the partnership to the developer for $7.8 million.

     SONICblue leases administrative facilities in San Jose, California. One
building of approximately 30,000 square feet is leased by SONICblue through
January 2003. In February 2000, SONICblue terminated the lease for a second
80,000 square foot building. Additionally, SONICblue leases an 83,000 square
foot facility in Milpitas, California, primarily for assembly and logistics,
which is leased through January 2004. SONICblue also leases research and
development and administrative facilities in Vancouver, Washington, expiring in
May 2001 which will not be renewed, in Starnberg, Germany through 2001 and
Winnersh, U.K. through May 2011, with three, five and 10-year cancellation
options, respectively. SONICblue also leases a 38,000 square foot facility in
Albany, Oregon, expiring in July 2002. During the first quarter of 2001,
SONICblue entered into a new lease for a 44,000 square foot facility in Tigard,
Oregon expiring in June 2008, and plans to move its operations from its
Vancouver, Washington facility.

     SONICblue also leases sales or research and development offices in Atlanta,
Georgia; Dallas, Houston and Austin, Texas; Chicago, Illinois; Huntsville,
Alabama; Miami and Orlando, Florida; Billerica, Massachusetts; Red Bank, New
Jersey; and Raleigh, North Carolina. SONICblue leases international sales,
distribution or technical support offices in the metropolitan areas of Paris,
France; Saarbrucken, Germany; Tokyo, Japan; Seoul, South Korea; and Taipei,
Taiwan as well as warehouses in Singapore and Hong Kong in order to provide
sales, distribution and technical support to customers in the United States and
Asia.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     Since November 1997, a number of complaints have been filed in federal and
state courts seeking unspecified damages on behalf of an alleged class of
persons who purchased shares of SONICblue's common stock at various times
between April 18, 1996 and November 3, 1997. The complaints name as defendants
SONICblue, certain of its officers and former officers, and certain directors of
SONICblue, asserting that they violated federal and state securities laws by
misrepresenting and failing to disclose certain information about SONICblue's
business. In addition, certain stockholders have filed derivative actions in the
state courts of California and Delaware seeking recovery on behalf of SONICblue,
alleging, among other things, breach of fiduciary duties by such individual
defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative action in Delaware have not taken
any steps to pursue their case. The derivative cases in California State court
have been consolidated, and plaintiffs have filed a consolidated amended
complaint. The court has entered a stipulated order in those derivative cases
suspending court proceedings and coordinating discovery in them with discovery
in the class actions in California State courts. On plaintiffs' motion, the
federal court has dismissed the federal class actions without prejudice. The
class actions in California State court have been consolidated, and plaintiffs
have filed a consolidated amended complaint. SONICblue has answered that
complaint. Discovery is proceeding. On January 22, 2001, four of the insurance
carriers which issued directors and officers insurance to SONICblue filed suit
against all parties named as defendants in the securities litigation, claiming
that the carriers have no obligation to provide coverage under the California
Insurance Code. While management intends to defend the actions against SONICblue
vigorously, there can be no assurance that an adverse result or settlement with
regard to these lawsuits would not have a material adverse effect on SONICblue's
financial condition or results of operations.

     SONICblue has received from the SEC a request for information relating to
SONICblue's restatement announcement in November 1997. SONICblue has responded
and intends to continue to respond to such requests.

     SONICblue has also been defending several putative class action lawsuits
naming Diamond, which were filed in June and July 1996 and June 1997 in the
California Superior Court for Santa Clara County and the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California. Certain former executive officers and
directors of Diamond are also named as defendants. The plaintiffs purport to
represent a class of all persons who purchased Diamond's common stock between
October 18, 1995 and June 20, 1996, or the Class Period. The complaints allege
claims under the federal securities laws and California law. The plaintiffs
allege that Diamond and the other defendants made various material
misrepresentations and omissions during the Class Period. The complaints do not
specify the amount of damages sought. On March 24, 2000, the District Court for
the Northern District of California dismissed the federal action without
prejudice. The parties have tentatively agreed to settle this matter, subject to
final documentation and court approval, for a payment of $15.0 million.
SONICblue funded $4.5 million of the settlement on November 1, 2000. SONICblue
previously accrued this amount in connection with the merger with Diamond.
SONICblue believes that Diamond's insurance covers the remaining $10.5 million
of the settlement and Diamond's insurers have funded that amount into the
settlement.

     Sega Corporation initiated a claim for arbitration in Tokyo, Japan against
Diamond in December 1998. The claim, which arose out of an agreement entered
into between Sega and Diamond in September 1995, in which Sega agreed to provide
Diamond with Sega game software that Diamond would bundle with its 3-D graphics
board, "The Edge," was settled in March 2001.

     C3 Sales, Inc. filed suit against SONICblue on October 6, 1999 in the
Harris County (Houston), Texas District Court. The petition sought a judicial
declaration that a Sales Representative Agreement entered into between C3 and
SONICblue on May 19, 1999 was a valid contract that governed the relationship
between the two parties. On November 8, 1999, SONICblue answered acknowledging
that the May 19, 1999 agreement was a contract between the two parties. C3
failed to respond to informal requests by SONICblue to dismiss the declaratory
relief action on grounds that no justiciable controversy existed between the
parties. On December 3, 1999, SONICblue filed a summary judgment motion seeking
judgment against C3 on the grounds that no issues of material fact remain to be
determined regarding the declaratory judgment sought by C3. C3 responded by
filing an amended petition raising new matters. Specifically, C3's new claims
allege that the Sales Representative Agreement applies to Diamond products, and
that certain commissions due under the agreement have not been paid. SONICblue
intends to defend this action vigorously.

     On January 6, 2000, PhoneTel Communications, Inc. filed a complaint for
patent infringement against a group of defendants, including Diamond, in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The settlement
of this lawsuit was effective in April 2001.

     The digital media, consumer appliance and home networking industries are
characterized by frequent litigation, including litigation regarding patent and
other intellectual property rights. SONICblue is party to various legal
proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although the ultimate
outcome of these matters is not presently determinable, management believes that
the resolution of all such pending matters will not have a material adverse
effect on SONICblue's financial position or results of operations.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

     You should read this together with the SONICblue financial statements and
other financial information included in this document. This document contains
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. SONICblue's
actual results may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking
statements. Please see "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking
Statements" elsewhere in this document.

OVERVIEW

     SONICblue Incorporated, previously known as S3 Incorporated, designs,
develops and markets products for the digital media, consumer electronics,
internet appliance and home networking markets. SONICblue's products include the
Rio line of digital music players, the HomeFree line of home

networking products and the Supra line of modems. Prior to the transfer in
January 2001 of its graphics chips business to a joint venture between VIA
Technologies, Inc., or VIA, and a wholly owned subsidiary of SONICblue,
SONICblue was a leading supplier of graphics and multimedia accelerator
subsystems for PCs for over ten years.

     In September 1999, SONICblue made a significant strategic shift by merging
with Diamond Multimedia Systems, Inc., or Diamond, an established PC original
equipment manufacturer, or OEM, and retail provider of communications and home
networking solutions, PC graphics and audio add-in boards, digital audio players
and Internet appliances. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase, and,
accordingly, the results of operations of Diamond and the estimated fair value
of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in SONICblue's
consolidated financial statements as of September 24, 1999, the effective date
of the purchase.

     In October 1999, SONICblue announced that it caused RioPort, Inc., formerly
RioPort.com Inc., which was a wholly owned subsidiary, to sell shares of its
preferred stock to third party venture capital and strategic investors. RioPort
is developing an integrated platform for acquiring, managing and experiencing
music and spoken audio programming from the Internet. As a result of the
preferred stock financing, SONICblue retained a minority investment in RioPort
and accounts for its investment using the equity method. In addition, in
November 1999, SONICblue received $10.9 million for the sale of OneStep, LLC to
RioPort. In June 2000, RioPort sold additional preferred stock to third party
investors. As part of this financing, SONICblue invested an additional $10.7
million in RioPort, maintaining its percentage ownership of RioPort. In the
fourth quarter of 2000, RioPort sold additional preferred stock to third party
investors. As of December 31, 2000, SONICblue held approximately 33% of
RioPort's outstanding stock.

     In November 1999, SONICblue established a joint venture with VIA to bring
high-performance integrated graphics and core logic chip sets to the volume OEM
desktop and notebook PC markets. The joint venture, S3-VIA Inc., was jointly
funded, with access to both SONICblue's and VIA's technology as well as
distribution rights for developed products between SONICblue and VIA. At
December 31, 2000, SONICblue owned 50.1% of the voting common stock of S3-VIA
and accordingly, SONICblue consolidated the accounts of S3-VIA in its
consolidated financial statements. In January 2001, SONICblue's interest in
S3-VIA was transferred, along with SONICblue's graphics chip business, to S3
Graphics Co., Ltd., another joint venture between VIA and a wholly owned
subsidiary of SONICblue, as described below.

     In August 2000, SONICblue began the shutdown of its Diamond
Multimedia-branded graphics add-in board business. SONICblue will continue to
supply and support its OEM customers, channel partners and end-users for the
existing line of Diamond Multimedia-branded PC graphics add-in cards, but has
ceased development of follow-on products. The shut-down did not extend to
SONICblue's professional graphics division, headquartered in Germany, which
continued to develop and market its line of Fire GL graphics accelerators. As
discussed below, SONICblue sold the professional graphics division to ATI
Technologies, Inc. in March 2001.

     In September 2000, SONICblue formed frontpath, inc. as a wholly owned
subsidiary to develop Information Appliances, such as accessible wireless
portable devices to allow businesses and consumers to live connected at home, at
work and at play.

     In November 2000, SONICblue acquired U.K. digital audio equipment
manufacturer Empeg Limited, known as empeg, for $1.9 million. This acquisition
was accounted for as a purchase. One of the first companies to design and bring
to market digital audio players for automobiles, empeg has become a part of
SONICblue's Rio division, and empeg's technology formed the basis for the
recently introduced Rio Car audio player.

     In January 2001, SONICblue completed the transfer of its graphics chips
assets to S3 Graphics Co., Ltd., a joint venture between VIA and a wholly owned
subsidiary of SONICblue. The joint venture will manufacture and distribute
graphics products and conduct related research and development activities.
Pursuant to the joint venture agreement with VIA, SONICblue received 13 million
shares of SONICblue

common stock as payment, and the joint venture assumed certain liabilities
relating to the graphics chips business. Upon the occurrence of events specified
in the investment agreement between SONICblue and VIA, SONICblue must pay
specified liquidated damages, subject to a maximum damages cap. Under the joint
venture agreement, SONICblue will also receive earn-out payments if the new
venture meets specified profitability goals. SONICblue, through its wholly owned
subsidiary, owns all of the outstanding shares of Class A stock of the joint
venture, which represents 50% of the voting power of the joint venture with
respect to the election of directors and 0.1% of the economic interest of the
joint venture. At closing, SONICblue issued to a wholly owned subsidiary of VIA
a warrant to purchase up to 2 million shares of SONICblue common stock at an
exercise price of $10.00 per share, for an aggregate exercise price of $20
million.

     In February 2001, SONICblue announced that it signed a definitive agreement
to acquire Sensory Science, which is the subject of this proxy
statement/prospectus. Pending the consummation of the acquisition of Sensory
Science, SONICblue has made a loan to Sensory Science in the amount of $3
million and has obtained a warrant to purchase 5,357,143 shares of Sensory
Science common stock.

     In March 2001, SONICblue signed a definitive agreement to acquire ReplayTV,
Inc., a developer of personal television technology. Under the terms of the
agreement, SONICblue will issue an aggregate of 15.5 million shares of common
stock and options and warrants to purchase shares of SONICblue common stock in
exchange for all of ReplayTV's outstanding equity, and ReplayTV will become a
wholly owned subsidiary of SONICblue. The agreement also provides that if the
value of the SONICblue common stock to be issued to stockholders of ReplayTV at
the closing of the transaction is less than $80 million, ReplayTV may terminate
the agreement unless SONICblue, at its option, either pays additional cash or
issues additional shares to bring the value at closing to $80 million. In
connection with the proposed acquisition of ReplayTV, SONICblue has made loans
to Replay in the amount of $10 million and agreed to loan ReplayTV up to an
additional $6 million.

     In March 2001, SONICblue completed the sale to ATI Technologies of its
professional graphics division, based in Starnberg, Germany, which produces the
Fire GL line of graphics accelerators. Under the terms of an Asset Purchase
Agreement, SONICblue received $2.7 million in cash and is eligible to receive
further financial consideration of up to $7.3 million, contingent upon the Fire
GL graphics business, as operated by ATI, achieving future performance targets.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The results of operations of SONICblue include the results of Diamond
beginning in September 1999 and the results of empeg beginning in November 2000.
The results also include the results from the Diamond Multimedia-branded
graphics add-in board business, since the acquisition of Diamond, and its
graphics chip business. SONICblue began the shut down of its Diamond
Multimedia-branded graphics add-in boards business in August 2000, and it
transferred the assets of its graphics chips business to a joint venture in
January 2001. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on
page F-26 for unaudited pro forma information giving effect to the transfer of
the graphics chips assets to the joint venture.

  Net Sales

     SONICblue's products are used in, and its business is dependent upon, the
PC industry and growth of the Internet. Sales of SONICblue's products are
primarily in the United States, Asia and Europe. Net sales were $536.7 million
in 2000, an increase of 52% from $352.6 million in 1999. Net sales increased
from 1999 to 2000 because of the acquisition of Diamond in 1999 and the
inclusion of the revenue of Diamond products in SONICblue's financial results of
operations beginning on September 24, 1999. Net sales in 2000 consisted
primarily of SONICblue's graphics chips, Diamond brand graphics add-in cards,
modem and communications products and Rio digital audio players, while net sales
for 1999 consisted primarily of SONICblue's graphics chips. Net sales for 2000
for SONICblue's graphics chips were $226.9 million.

     Sales increased from 1998 to 1999 because of the acquisition of Diamond and
the inclusion of the revenue of Diamond products in SONICblue's financial
results of operations beginning on September 24, 1999. In addition, SONICblue
introduced products into new markets such as add-in graphics cards and replaced
older generation products in the desktop and laptop PC markets, resulting in an
increased volume of product shipments and higher average selling prices.

     SONICblue expects that the percentage of its net sales represented by any
one product or type of product may change significantly from period to period as
new products are introduced and existing products reach the end of their life
cycles. Due to competitive price pressures, SONICblue's products experience
declining average selling prices over time, which at times can be substantial.

     Export sales accounted for 56%, 70% and 89% of net sales in 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. Approximately 33% of export sales in 2000 were to affiliates
of United States customers. SONICblue expects that export sales will continue to
represent a significant portion of net sales, although there can be no
assurances that export sales as a percentage of net sales will remain at current
levels. All sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.

     Sales to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, were significant to net
sales in 2000. One OEM customer accounted for 21% of net sales in 2000. Two
customers accounted for 19% and 10% of net sales in 1999. Three customers
accounted for 39%, 14% and 13% of net sales in 1998. SONICblue expects a
significant portion of its future sales to remain concentrated within a limited
number of strategic customers. Sales to any particular customer may fluctuate
significantly from quarter to quarter.

  Gross Margin

     SONICblue had a negative gross margin of 2% in 2000, a positive gross
margin of 13% in 1999 and a negative gross margin of 1% in 1998. The negative
gross margin in 2000 was primarily the result of lower margin products sold by
the Rio and Access divisions and a $3.4 million charge for the write-down of
inventory relating to the shutdown of the Diamond Multimedia branded graphics
add-in board business. Another factor resulting in decreased gross margin was
the highly competitive pricing pressures in the market for mainstream and
entertainment graphics accelerators. This was partially offset by improving
margins on SONICblue's desktop chips and communications products.

     Gross margin in 1999 as compared to gross margin in 1998 was favorably
impacted by an increase in average selling prices and an increase in sales of
products with higher margins (primarily graphics chips), partially offset by
charges for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market reserves
made in 1999.

     The negative gross margin in 1998 was a result of decreases in overall
average selling prices of the ViRGE and Trio family of graphics chips. Also
affecting the negative gross margin were charges for excess and obsolete
inventory, lower of cost or market reserves established for SONICblue's 2-D and
3-D products, a $4.0 million charge for underutilized prepaid production
capacity and yield losses.

     In the future, SONICblue's gross margins may be adversely affected by
increased competition and related decreases in average selling prices,
particularly with respect to older generation products, timing of volume
shipments of new products, the availability and cost of products from
SONICblue's suppliers, changes in the mix of products sold and the extent to
which SONICblue incurs additional licensing fees. Negative gross margins could
continue in the future.

  Research and Development Expenses

     SONICblue has made and intends to continue to make significant investments
in research and development to remain competitive by developing new and enhanced
products. Research and development expenses were $83.4 million in 2000, $73.9
million in 1999 and $78.6 million in 1998.

     Research and development expenses increased by 13% from 1999 to 2000 as a
result of inclusion of headcount and related expenses associated with the
Diamond acquisition, which were included in SONICblue's results of operations
for the entire year. Research and development expenses decreased by 6% from 1998
to 1999 as a result of an increased focus on core technology and products.
Concentration of research and development efforts resulted in lower headcount
and related costs. Write-offs of idle and excess capital equipment in 1998
resulted in lower depreciation and maintenance charges in 1999. Also, research
and development expenses for 1998 reflect approximately $3.0 million in charges
for SONICblue's discontinued audio and communications product lines and the
write-offs of idle, excess and obsolete capital equipment associated with
research and development projects terminated during the year.

  Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses

     Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were $126.9 million in 2000,
$52.8 million in 1999 and $41.9 million in 1998. The 140% increase in selling,
marketing and administrative expenses from 1999 to 2000 was due primarily to the
integration and combination of selling, marketing and administrative headcount
and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Diamond and Empeg
Limited. Other factors that affected marketing expenses were costs associated
with the refocusing of SONICblue's business, including its name change and image
in November 2000.

     The 26% increase in selling, marketing and administrative expenses from
1998 to 1999 was primarily due to the acquisition of Diamond in October 1999 and
additional sales, marketing and administrative expenses required to support the
increase in revenue from 1998 to 1999. As a percentage of revenue, selling,
marketing and administrative expenses decreased from 19% in 1998 to 15% in 1999.

  Restructuring Expense

     In August 2000, SONICblue adopted a restructuring plan relating to the
shutdown of its Diamond Multimedia-branded add-in board business to reflect its
long term strategy and focus. Restructuring expenses of $6.7 million in 2000
related to the shutdown included write-off of intangibles, facilities closure
expenses and personnel severance compensation and related expenses. As part of
the restructuring, SONICblue also wrote off $3.4 million of inventory, through
cost of sales. At December 31, 2000, the reserve remaining for these items was
$2.1 million. Aside from the original write-off of intangibles, reductions in
the reserve were the result of cash payments. SONICblue expects the plan to be
completed by the end of 2001.

     In July 1998, SONICblue implemented a restructuring plan, resulting in a
charge of $6.1 million, in order to align resources with a new business model
and to lower SONICblue's overall cost structure. In connection with the
restructuring, SONICblue reduced its headcount and consolidated facilities.
Severance and related benefits related to the reduction of approximately 70
employees were paid by the end of the second quarter of 1999. The number of
temporary employees and contractors used by SONICblue was also reduced. The
restructuring expense included the write-off and write-down in carrying value of
equipment, which consists primarily of workstations, personal computers and
furniture that are no longer utilized in SONICblue's operations. These assets
were written down to their estimated fair value less cost to sell. Facility
closure expenses were incurred as a result of the vacating of one of two leased
buildings at SONICblue's headquarters and include leasehold improvements,
furniture, fixtures and network costs. SONICblue completed its move in 1999.

  Other Operating Expense

     Other operating expense in 1999 included a write-off of acquired
technologies of $6.7 million related to the purchase of Diamond on September 24,
1999. This was determined through valuation techniques generally used by
appraisers in the high-technology industry and was immediately expensed in the
period of acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established
and no alternative use had been identified.

     Other operating expense in 1998 included a write-off of acquired
technologies of $8.0 million and a charge for impairment of long-lived assets of
$27.2 million.

  Amortization of Goodwill and Intangibles

     Amortization of goodwill and intangibles increased from $12.2 million in
1999 to $44.4 million in 2000 primarily due to the full year of amortization of
goodwill and intangibles recorded as a result of the Diamond acquisition. The
Diamond acquisition was effective in September 1999, at which time the
amortization began.

  Gain on Sale of Manufacturing Joint Venture

     On December 31, 1997, SONICblue entered into an agreement with United
Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC, to sell to UMC 80 million shares of stock
of United Semiconductor Corporation, or USC, for a price of 2.4 billion New
Taiwan Dollars. SONICblue received the sales price, which was, approximately
$68.0 million in January 1998 upon closing. The gain on the sale of stock in USC
recorded in 1998 was $26.6 million.

     In June 1999, SONICblue amended its agreement with UMC. Under the terms of
the amended agreement, UMC has agreed to pay SONICblue, subject to certain
conditions, 1.4 billion New Taiwan

Dollars (totaling approximately $37.2 million in cash over the period that the
cash was received) and SONICblue has agreed to release UMC from contingencies
associated with the sale of 80 million shares of stock of USC in January 1998
(described in the preceding paragraph) and to grant a license to UMC for 29
patents covering multimedia products and integrated circuit manufacturing
technology for use in products manufactured by UMC. SONICblue recognized the
gain on this transaction over five fiscal quarters beginning in the quarter
ended June 30, 1999, as payments were received. In 1999, the gain recognized on
the sale of the stock in USC was $22.4 million. In 2000, the gain recognized on
the sale of stock in USC was $14.7 million.

  Gain on UMC Investment, net

     In June 1999, UMC announced a foundry consolidation plan whereby USC,
United Integrated Circuits Corporation, United Silicon Incorporated and UTEK
Semiconductor Corporation would be merged into UMC. Under the terms of the
consolidation plan, each of SONICblue's shares in the USC joint venture would be
exchanged for one share of UMC. On January 4, 2000, SONICblue's 252 million
shares of USC were exchanged for 252 million shares of UMC stock. SONICblue
recorded a gain on the transfer of the shares of $884.2 million to recognize the
difference in the carrying value of its investment in USC, a privately held
company, and the fair market value of the UMC, a publicly traded company, shares
on the date of the transfer. Approximately half of the shares received are
subject to sale restrictions and are carried at market value as of January 4,
2000 as long-term assets in the accompanying balance sheet at December 31, 2000.
As the remaining shares are freely tradable, the investment is adjusted to fair
market value in accordance with SFAS 115 and classified as short-term
investments.

     SONICblue received a 20% stock dividend, or approximately 50.4 million
shares of UMC stock, in April 2000, increasing SONICblue's holdings to
approximately 302 million shares of UMC stock. SONICblue sold 10 million shares
of UMC stock in August 2000 on the Taiwan Stock Exchange receiving net proceeds
of $25.1 million. SONICblue sold 5 million shares of UMC stock in December 2000
on the Taiwan Stock Exchange receiving net proceeds of $6.4 million. These
transactions resulted in an aggregate net loss of $10.8 million. At December 31,
2000, approximately 161 million shares are classified as a current asset with
approximately 126 million shares classified as a long-term asset.

     At December 31, 2000, the market value of both SONICblue's short-term and
long-term investment in UMC had declined $519.8 million below its original cost
basis. It was determined that this decline was related to the downturn in the
semiconductor industry as a whole and was temporary in nature due to the
historically cyclical nature of the industry. The available-for-sale portion of
SONICblue's investment was marked-to-market through other comprehensive income
as required by SFAS 115.

     Subsequent to the year-end, the market value of SONICblue's investment in
UMC remained significantly below its cost. In the first quarter of 2001,
SONICblue sold 35 million shares of UMC on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. As of
March 31, 2001, SONICblue's 252 million UMC shares held as of that date were
worth approximately $408 million, based on the closing price of UMC shares on
the Taiwan Stock Exchange on that date and the U.S. dollar to New Taiwan Dollar
exchange rate prevailing on that date. The downturn in the semiconductor
industry and the economy in general appears to be more severe than previously
anticipated. There is a great deal of uncertainty regarding when the
semiconductor industry will recover from this down cycle. SONICblue is
continuing to evaluate its need to reduce the value of its investment. Should
SONICblue conclude that the decline in value is other than temporary, it will
report a loss in other income and expense at that time.

  Gain on Sale of Other Investments

     In fiscal year 2000, SONICblue recognized a gain in the amount of $5.9
million from the sale of certain non-strategic investments in corporate equity
securities. There were no comparable transactions in either fiscal 1999 or 1998.

  Equity Income/(Loss) of Investees

     Investments in entities in which SONICblue does not have control, but has
the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial
policies, are accounted for by the equity method. In 2000, SONICblue's share of
losses in these entities was $11.4 million. In 1999, the loss was $0.05 million.
In 2000, the loss was principally due to SONICblue's share of losses from
RioPort, Inc. In 1998, SONICblue recognized income of $17.5 million,
attributable to its investment in USC.

  Interest Expense

     Interest expense increased from $6.2 million in 1998 to $7.2 million in
1999 to $9.2 million in 2000, primarily due to SONICblue's increased borrowings
on its bank facility.

  Other Income (Expense), Net

     Other income (expense), net changed from a net other income of $6.3 million
in 1999 to a net expense of $1.9 million in 2000. This was the result of higher
foreign currency translation losses in 2000 and lower interest income due to the
decreasing balance of short-term investments. Other income (expense), net
changed from net other expenses in 1998 of $0.9 million to net other income in
1999 primarily due to non-recurring write-offs of certain equity investments and
royalty expenses that occurred in 1998 and an increase in sublease income in
1999 as well as a decrease in interest income due to decreasing balances of
short-term investments.

INCOME TAXES

     SONICblue's effective tax rate for 2000 was 47.4%, compared to the benefit
tax rates of 60.9% and 9.6% for 1999 and 1998, respectively. The effective tax
rate for 2000 reflects the effects of the gain on the UMC shares and the
inability to use the goodwill amortization and foreign losses to reduce taxable
income. The effective tax rate for 1999 reflects the expected benefits of
current year and prior year net operating loss and tax credit carryovers. The
effective tax rate for 1998 reflects the expected benefits of current year loss
carrybacks net of the establishment of a valuation allowance in 1998 against the
beginning of the year balance of net deferred tax assets.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Cash used for operating activities was $221.2 million in 2000 and consisted
primarily of SONICblue's operating income of $312.8 million, which included a
non-cash gain on its UMC investment of $869.4 million, and other investments of
$20.2 million. This was partially offset by non-cash charges including deferred
income taxes of $278.2 million, amortization and depreciation of $64.8 million
and equity in losses of investee of $11.4 million.

     Cash used for operating activities was $67.5 million in 1999 and consisted
primarily of SONICblue's operating loss of $30.8 million, an increase in
deferred income taxes of $61.7 million and an increase in inventories of $34.7
million. These were partially offset by non-cash charges including depreciation,
amortization and write-off of acquired technologies and by decreases in accounts
receivable and prepaid expenses and other and increases in accounts payable,
accrued liabilities and income taxes payable.

     Cash used for operating activities was $9.3 million in 1998. SONICblue's
operating loss of $113.2 million was offset by non-cash charges including
deferred income taxes, depreciation, amortization, loss on the disposal of
equipment, write-off of prepaid production capacity, the utilization of
production capacity rights, write-off of impaired assets and the write-off of
acquired technologies. SONICblue sold a portion of its interest in USC during
1998 and recognized a gain of $26.6 million. In addition, SONICblue recognized
$17.5 million in income from its 15.75% equity investment in USC. The non-cash
charges were offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventories of $36.8
million and $60.5 million, respectively. Accounts receivable decreased as a
result of lower net sales by SONICblue, while inventories decreased as the
result of lower production volumes and charges taken during 1998 for excess and
obsolete inventory,

lower of cost or market reserves and yield losses. Accounts payable decreased as
a direct result of lower inventory purchases.

     Investing activities provided cash of $29.5 million in 2000 and consisted
primarily of sales and maturities of short-term investments, including a portion
of SONICblue's UMC investment, of $170.2 million, cash received related to the
sale of USC shares of $14.7 million, offset by the additional purchase cost of
merging with Diamond of $6.3 million, purchases of short-term investments, and
equity investments in technology companies and other acquisitions of $140.2
million and purchases of property and equipment of $8.9 million. Investing
activities provided cash of $38.7 million in 1999 and consisted primarily of
maturities of short-term investments of $148.9 million, cash received from UMC
related to the sale of USC shares of $22.4 million and cash received from the
sale of investment in real estate partnership of $7.8 million, offset by
purchases of short-term investments of $107.7 million, the merger with Diamond,
net of cash acquired of $22.5 million and net purchases of property and
equipment of $6.6 million. Investing activities used cash of $38.9 million in
1998 and consisted primarily of $40.0 million used in a patent purchase and
cross-licensing agreement with Cirrus Logic, Inc., $5.9 million of property and
equipment purchase, and $125.4 million of short-term investment purchases,
offset by $66.7 million of maturities of short-term investments and $68.0
million from the sale of a portion of SONICblue's joint venture in USC.
SONICblue expects capital requirements for 2001 to be consistent with those for
2000.

     Financing activities provided cash of $182.5 million in 2000 and consisted
of sales of common stock of $162.0 million, including proceeds from the private
sale of stock to VIA and borrowings of notes payable in the amount of $20.5
million. Financing activities provided cash of $38.0 million in 1999 and
consisted of sales of common stock, net, including $34.4 million received from
the sale of stock to three foreign investors, and the sale of a warrant to
Intel, offset partially by repayments of notes payable. Financing activities
used cash of $11.3 million in 1998 and consisted primarily of repayments of
notes payable and equipment financing, offset partially by sales of common
stock, net.

     In 1995, SONICblue entered into two long-term manufacturing capacity
arrangements. SONICblue entered into an agreement with UMC and Alliance
Semiconductor Corporation to form USC, a separate Taiwanese company, for the
purpose of building and managing a semiconductor manufacturing facility in the
Science Based Industrial Park in Hsin Chu City, Taiwan, R.O.C. SONICblue
invested $53.0 million in 1996 and $36.4 million in 1995 for its 23.75% equity
interest. The facility commenced production utilizing advanced submicron
semiconductor manufacturing processes in late 1996. In January 1998, SONICblue
reduced its equity interest to 15.75% through the sale of a portion of its USC
shares, and received approximately $68 million in cash. In January 2000,
SONICblue's USC shares were exchanged for 252 million UMC shares. SONICblue has
the right to purchase up to 31.25% of the output from the foundry. In addition,
SONICblue expanded and formalized its relationship with TSMC to provide
additional capacity over the 1996 to 2000 timeframe. During the second quarter
of 1999, SONICblue and TSMC agreed to extend the capacity term of the agreement
two years to 2002. The agreement with TSMC requires SONICblue to make certain
annual advance payments to be applied against the following year's capacity.
SONICblue signed promissory notes to secure these payments, which totalled $9.6
million as of December 31, 1999. In July 2000, SONICblue terminated its take or
pay contract with TSMC and its foundry relationship with UMC. SONICblue received
a refund of approximately $4.8 million and the notes payable were cancelled.

     Working capital at December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999 was $161.5
million and $100.1 million, respectively. At December 31, 2000, SONICblue's
principal sources of liquidity included cash and equivalents of $36.6 million
and $9.0 million in short term investments. In addition, SONICblue held shares
of UMC, which it classifies as a current asset, valued at $228.7 million at
December 31, 2000 based upon then existing New Taiwan Dollar to U.S. Dollar
exchange rates and UMC's market prices on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Using the
market value and exchange rate at March 31, 2001, these shares were valued at
$205.1 million. At December 31, 2000, SONICblue had short-term lines of credit
and bank credit facilities totaling $79.3 million, of which approximately $6.6
million was unused and available.

SONICblue believes that its current capital resources will satisfy SONICblue's
projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the
next 12 months.

     SONICblue is currently a party to certain legal proceedings. Litigation
could result in substantial expense to SONICblue. These legal proceedings are
described in the section entitled "Information about SONICblue
Incorporated -- SONICblue's Business -- Legal Proceedings."

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     As of January 1, 2001, SONICblue adopted Financial Accounting Standards
Board Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, or Statement 133, which was issued in June 1998, and its amendments
Statement 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities-Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB No. 133 and 138, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities issued in June 1999
and June 2000, respectively, which collectively are referred to as Statement
133.

     As a result of the adoption of Statement 133, SONICblue will recognize all
derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange contracts, in the
consolidated financial instruments at fair value regardless of the purpose or
the intent for holding the instrument. Changes in the fair value of derivative
financial instruments are either recognized periodically in income or in
stockholders' equity as a component of comprehensive income depending on whether
the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedging accounting, and if so,
whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge. Generally,
changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are
recorded in income along with the portions of the changes in the fair values of
the hedged items that relate to the hedged risks. Changes in fair values of
derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective
as hedges, are recorded in other comprehensive income net of deferred taxes.
Changes in fair value of derivatives used as hedges of the net investment in
foreign operations are reported in other comprehensive income as part of the
cumulative translation adjustment. Changes in fair value of derivatives not
qualifying as hedges are reported in income.

     In the fourth quarter of 2000, SONICblue implemented Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," or SAB 101,
retroactively to January 1, 2000. SAB 101 requires that the following criteria
must be met before revenues can be recorded: (a) persuasive evidence that an
arrangement exists, (b) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered,
(c) the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and (d)
collectibility is reasonably assured. There was no cumulative effect associated
with implementing SAB 101.

     In March 2000, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, an interpretation of APB
Opinion No. 25. FIN 44 clarifies the application of Opinion No. 25 for (a) the
definition of an employee for purposes of applying Opinion No. 25, (b) the

July 2, 2000, but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after

have a material impact on SONICblue's financial position, results of operation,
or cash flows.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

     SONICblue does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment
portfolio. SONICblue invests in instruments that meet high credit quality
standards, as specified in its investment policy. SONICblue also limits the
amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer or type of investment.

     The table below summarizes SONICblue's investment cash and equivalents and
its short-term investments (all short-term investments are classified as
available for sale).

                                                          FAIR VALUE
                                                     ---------------------

                                                        INTEREST RATES)

Cash and equivalents...............................        $ 36,582
Weighted average interest rate.....................            5.33%
Short-term investments.............................        $  9,017

Short-term investments.............................        $ 58,918

Total portfolio....................................        $104,743
Weighted average interest rate.....................            5.81%

     A hypothetical 10% change in market interest rates would not have a
material effect on SONICblue's operations, cash flows, or the value of its
short-term investments.

     SONICblue also holds an investment in UMC, a publicly traded company, which
was carried at $635.0 million on SONICblue's consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2000. This investment is subject to market risk. At December 31,
2000, the market value of both SONICblue's short-term and long-term investment
in UMC had declined to $407.2 million. A 10% decline in the market value of the
UMC stock would reduce the market value of the number of shares SONICblue held
at December 31, 2000 by approximately $40.7 million. It was determined that the
decline from the carrying value at December 31, 2000 and the original cost basis
was related to the downturn in the semiconductor industry as a whole and was
temporary in nature due to the historically cyclical nature of the industry.
Subsequent to the year end, the market value of the investment in UMC remained
significantly below cost. As of March 31, 2001, SONICblue's 252 million UMC
shares held as of that date were worth approximately $408 million, based on the
closing price of UMC shares on the Taiwan Stock Exchange on that date and the
U.S. dollar to New Taiwan Dollar exchange rate prevailing on that date. The
downturn in the semiconductor industry and the economy in general appears to be
more severe than previously anticipated. There is a great deal of uncertainty
regarding when the semiconductor industry will recover from this down cycle.
Should SONICblue conclude that the decline in value is other than temporary,
they will report a loss in other income and expense at that time.

CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES

     In September 1996, SONICblue completed a private placement of $103.5
million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes. The notes
mature in 2003. Interest is payable semi-annually at 5 3/4% per annum. The notes
are convertible at the option of the note holders into SONICblue's common stock
at an initial conversion price of $19.22 per share, subject to adjustment.
During 2000, $0.2 million in notes were converted into common stock. Beginning
in October 1999, the notes became redeemable at the option of SONICblue at an
initial redemption price of 102% of the principal amount. The fair value of the
convertible subordinated notes at December 31, 2000 and 1999 was approximately
$70.92 million and $96.13 million, respectively. A hypothetical 10% change in
market interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on SONICblue's
operations, cash flows or the fair value of the convertible subordinated notes.

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE CHANGES

     SONICblue invoices its customers in U.S. dollars for all products.
SONICblue is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial
results of its foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars in
consolidation. The foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounts in the local
currency of the foreign location in order to centralize the foreign exchange
risk with SONICblue.

     The effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on SONICblue's financial
statements for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 was not material. From
time to time SONICblue uses foreign exchange contracts as a means for hedging
assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As of December 31,
2000, SONICblue held no exchange contracts. As of December 31, 1999, SONICblue
had the following foreign exchange contracts:

DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION

     Employee directors (presently Mr. Potashner and Mr. Holdt) receive no
additional compensation for service on the Board of Directors. Non-employee
directors of SONICblue (presently consisting of

Messrs. Lee, Santoro, and Schraith) receive an annual retainer fee of $24,000,
plus $1,000 for each Board meeting attended. Non-employee directors are
reimbursed for their expenses for each meeting attended.

     Under the terms of SONICblue's 1989 Stock Plan, upon appointment to the
Board, each non-employee director receives an option to purchase 40,000 shares
of common stock at an exercise price of 100% of the fair market value of the
stock on the date of grant, which option vests ratably over the next four
anniversary dates of the date of grant. In addition, following each annual
meeting of SONICblue's stockholders, each non-employee director who will
continue to serve as a member of the Board automatically receives an option to
purchase 20,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 100% of the fair
market value of the stock on the date of grant, which option vests ratably over
the next four anniversary dates of the date of grant. For a description of the
compensation arrangements with Mr. Potashner, who is an officer and a director,
see "SONICblue's Business -- Executive Compensation -- Employment Agreements."

     In February 2000, each director, other than Mr. Potashner, was granted an
additional option to purchase 20,000 shares of SONICblue's common stock, at an
exercise price of $15.00, the fair market value of the stock on the date of
grant, which option vests ratably over the next four anniversary dates of the
date of grant. In April 2000, Mr. Holdt was granted an additional option to
purchase 150,000 shares of SONICblue's common stock, at an exercise price of
$14.00, the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant, which option
vests ratably over the next four anniversary dates of the date of grant. All
options granted to a non-employee director as described in this paragraph or the
immediately preceding paragraph become exercisable in full in the event the
director's service is terminated because of death or total and permanent
disability or upon a change in control of SONICblue.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

     In October 1998, SONICblue entered into an agreement with Kenneth F.
Potashner, pursuant to which Mr. Potashner is employed as the President, Chief
Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board at a base salary of $500,000 per
year. The agreement has a three-year term. Mr. Potashner is eligible to receive
an annual cash bonus of up to 200% of his base salary, with the cash bonus
payable after the first year of the employment agreement guaranteed to be at
least $250,000. Mr. Potashner also received two options to purchase an aggregate
of 4,500,000 shares of common stock of SONICblue at an exercise price of
$3.1562, which was the closing price of the common stock on the effective date
of his employment agreement. One option for 1,500,000 shares vested in April
1999, six months after SONICblue hired Mr. Potashner. The second option for
3,000,000 shares vests over a four-year period in accordance with the following
schedule: 750,000 shares vested on the first anniversary of Mr. Potashner's
employment with SONICblue; thereafter, the remaining options vest in equal
monthly installments of 62,500 shares. If Mr. Potashner's employment is
terminated without cause, SONICblue will continue to pay Mr. Potashner his
salary and maximum bonus for twelve months following his termination. During
such twelve-month period, Mr. Potashner's employee benefits and the vesting on
the 3,000,000 share option will continue. If termination without cause occurs
following a change in control of SONICblue, the twelve-month period for
compensation and benefit continuation will be extended to eighteen months, and
Mr. Potashner will receive an additional cash payment to the extent that the sum
of his continued compensation and option value as calculated under the agreement
do not exceed $10,000,000. In addition, if the post-change in control
termination occurs after October 31, 2000, the 3,000,000 share option will be
vested as to any shares that cannot vest during the eighteen-month period.

     When Mr. Potashner became Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
in 1998, Mr. Holdt, who formerly held those positions, became Vice Chairman of
SONICblue. Mr. Holdt currently receives a salary of $2,000 per month or, in the
event the time he spends on SONICblue business exceeds 20 hours a month, $3,000
per single day, $5,000 for a consecutive two-day period and $10,000 per week of
continuous service pursuant to a consulting agreement. Pursuant to the
agreement, in January 1998 Mr. Holdt received a non-qualified stock option of
500,000 shares with a vesting period of one year and participation in the
Executive Bonus Plan. In addition, in his capacity as Vice Chairman, Mr. Holdt
is entitled under the agreement to receive a non-qualified stock option of
20,000 shares at each regular annual meeting of

SONICblue's stockholders at which he is re-elected as a director, which option
vests and becomes exercisable at the rate of 25% on each one year anniversary of
the date of grant. The agreement may be terminated by either Mr. Holdt or
SONICblue at any time with or without cause.

     In September 1998, SONICblue entered into an involuntary termination
agreement with each of Messrs. Franklin and Wolfe which provides for a severance
payment by SONICblue to each of them if they are involuntarily terminated other
than for cause. Each severance payment would be paid in a lump sum amount equal
to six months of the individual's base salary plus one month of base salary for
every full year of that individual's service to SONICblue. In addition, each
involuntary termination agreement provides that the term for exercise of any
outstanding options will be extended until six months after the date of
termination, although vesting shall cease as of that date.

     In December 1998, SONICblue adopted an Executive Retention Incentive
Program pursuant to which Messrs. Franklin and Wolfe were each entitled to
receive $250,000 on the latest to occur of several events, (i) November 11,
2000, (ii) the date that SONICblue's United Semiconductor Corporation shares are
free tradable and are traded on either the Taiwan national stock exchange or
another national stock exchange or (iii) the sale of substantially all of USC,
provided that he continues to be employed by the Corporation on such date. As a
result of the merger between USC and UMC, in January 2000, SONICblue's USC
shares were exchanged for UMC shares that are traded on the Taiwan national
stock exchange. Therefore, under the terms of the Executive Retention Incentive
Program, Messrs. Franklin and Wolfe each received $250,000 on November 11, 2000.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     In June 2000, in connection with the purchase of 24,380 shares of RioPort,
Inc., formerly RioPort.com, Inc., common stock, for the aggregate purchase price
of $9,727.62, by each of Messrs. Lee, Holdt, Santoro and Schraith, SONICblue
loaned to each of these individuals substantially all of the purchase price.
Each loan is evidenced by a promissory note and is secured by the RioPort, Inc.
common stock purchased. These loans accrue interest at the rate of 6.53% per
year and are due on June 14, 2003.

     In June 2000, in connection with the purchase of 46,431 shares of RioPort,
Inc. Series D Preferred Stock, for the aggregate purchase price of $167,230.53,
by each of Messrs. Lee, Holdt, Santoro and Schraith, SONICblue loaned to each of
these individuals substantially all of the purchase price. Each loan is
evidenced by a promissory note and is secured by the RioPort, Inc. Series D
Preferred Stock purchased. These loans accrue interest at the rate of 6.53% per
year and are due on June 14, 2003.

     In July 2000, SONICblue invested $3.0 million in Entridia Corporation. In
addition, pursuant to an engineering and manufacturing services agreement,
SONICblue provided semiconductor manufacturing services to Entridia during
fiscal 2000 in exchange for $1,479,103. Mr. Holdt, the Vice Chairman of the
Board of Directors of SONICblue, is currently a member of the board of directors
of Entridia, and from June 1999 until April 2001 was Entridia's President and
Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Holdt did not directly benefit from SONICblue's
investment in Entridia.

                  THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND RELATED AGREEMENTS

     The following summary of the merger agreement is qualified by reference to
the complete text of the merger agreement, which is incorporated by reference
into this document and attached as Annex A.

STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER

     Under the merger agreement, a SONICblue subsidiary will merge with and into
Sensory Science with Sensory Science subsequently becoming a wholly owned
subsidiary of SONICblue.

TIMING OF CLOSING

     We expect that the closing will occur as soon as practicable, but in any
event within two business days after the day on which the last of the conditions
set forth in the merger agreement has been satisfied or waived. Immediately upon
the closing of the merger, Sensory Science and Phoenix I Acquisition Corp., the
merger subsidiary, will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, which will become effective at the time it is filed or
at the time specified in the merger certificate, which is the effective time.

MERGER CONSIDERATION

     The merger agreement provides that each share of Sensory Science common
stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will, at the effective
time, be converted into the right to receive 0.0710 of a share of SONICblue
common stock. Provided, however, that if the average share price of SONICblue
common stock in the applicable measurement period before the closing of the
merger is between $5.5213 and $7.0988, the exchange ratio will be based on a
formula that takes into account the average share price of SONICblue common
stock. Provided, further, that if the average share price of SONICblue common
stock in the applicable measurement period is less than $5.5213, the exchange
ratio will be 0.0913. Any shares of Sensory Science common stock held by Sensory
Science as treasury stock will be cancelled without any payment for those
shares. Any shares of Sensory Science common stock that are outstanding prior to
the effective time and are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk
of forfeiture or other condition under an agreement with Sensory Science will be
exchanged for shares of SONICblue common stock having the same restrictions or
right of repurchase by SONICblue.

TREATMENT OF SENSORY SCIENCE STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

     At the effective time, each outstanding option granted by Sensory Science
to purchase shares of Sensory Science common stock will be converted into an
option to acquire SONICblue common stock having the same terms and conditions as
the Sensory Science stock option had before the effective time. The number of
shares that the new SONICblue option will be exercisable for and the exercise
price of the new SONICblue option will be adjusted in accordance with the
exchange ratio in the merger.

     No later than 20 days following the effective time, SONICblue will file a
registration statement on Form S-8 with the SEC with respect to the shares of
SONICblue common stock subject to all assumed Sensory Science options.

     At the effective time, each warrant granted by Sensory Science will be
exercisable, as of the effective time, for that number of whole shares of
SONICblue common stock equal to the number of shares of Sensory Science for
which the warrant was exercisable, multiplied by the exchange ratio, rounded to
the nearest whole number of shares. The new exercise price for the warrant will
be equal to dividing the premerger exercise proceeds of the warrant by the
number of shares of SONICblue common stock for which the warrant is exercisable
as of the effective time.

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

     SONICblue will appoint an exchange agent to handle the exchange of Sensory
Science stock certificates in the merger for SONICblue stock and the payment of
cash for fractional shares of

SONICblue stock. Soon after the closing, the exchange agent will send each
holder of Sensory Science stock a letter of transmittal for use in the exchange
as well as instructions explaining how to surrender their Sensory Science stock
certificates to the exchange agent. YOU SHOULD NOT RETURN CERTIFICATES WITH THE
ENCLOSED PROXY CARD.

     Holders of Sensory Science stock who surrender their certificates to the
exchange agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, will
receive the appropriate merger consideration. Holders of unexchanged shares of
Sensory Science stock will not be entitled to receive any dividends or other
distributions payable by SONICblue after the closing until their certificates
are surrendered.

     SONICblue will not issue any fractional shares in the merger. Holders of
Sensory Science common stock will receive a cash payment in the amount of the
proceeds from the sale of their fractional shares on the Nasdaq National Market.

COVENANTS

     Each of SONICblue and Sensory Science has undertaken certain covenants in
the merger agreement. The following summarizes the more significant of these
covenants.

     No Solicitation. Sensory Science has agreed that it and its subsidiaries
and their officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, financial advisors, agents or other representatives will not
directly or indirectly take action to initiate, solicit or encourage an offer
for an alternative acquisition transaction of a nature defined in the merger
agreement.

     Restricted actions include directly or indirectly engaging in discussions
or negotiations with any potential bidder and disclosing confidential
information or data to a potential bidder. These actions are permitted by
Sensory Science or the Sensory Science board:

     - disclosures to its stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
       Sensory Science board, failure to do so will be inconsistent with its
       obligations under applicable law;

     - negotiate with or furnish information in response to an unsolicited bona
       fide offer; and

     - recommend a superior offer to Sensory Science stockholders in accordance
       with the provisions of the merger agreement.

     Sensory Science Board's Covenant to Recommend. The Sensory Science board
has agreed to recommend the approval and adoption of the merger agreement to
Sensory Science's stockholders. The Sensory Science board, however, is permitted
not to make this recommendation or to withdraw or modify it in a manner adverse
to SONICblue if the Sensory Science board determines in its good faith judgment,
after receiving the advice of outside legal counsel, that in light of the
superior proposal failure to withdraw or modify its recommendation would be
inconsistent with fulfilling its fiduciary duty to stockholders under applicable
law.

     Even if the Sensory Science board of directors changes its recommendation
in favor of the merger, Sensory Science must still call a stockholders' meeting
as otherwise required by the merger agreement to vote on the approval and
adoption of the merger agreement and the merger.

     Interim Operations of Sensory Science. Sensory Science has undertaken a
separate covenant that places restrictions on it and its subsidiaries until
either the merger becomes effective or the merger agreement is terminated. In
general, Sensory Science and its subsidiaries are required to conduct their
business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and in a manner
not representing a new strategic direction and to use their reasonable best
efforts to preserve intact their business organizations and relationships with
third parties. Sensory Science has also agreed to some specific restrictions
which are

subject to exceptions described in the merger agreement. The following table
summarizes the more significant of these restrictions undertaken by Sensory
Science:

     - enter into any material commitment or transaction not in the ordinary
       course of business;

     - transfer any material property rights, other than pursuant to licenses in
       the ordinary course of business;

     - enter into any material agreements granting an unrelated third party
       marketing, distribution or similar rights other than in the ordinary
       course of business;

     - commence any material litigation;

     - declare dividends or any other distributions or redeem, repurchase any
       shares of capital stock except pursuant to purchase rights under certain
       agreements;

     - split, combine or reclassify capital stock;

     - cause changes to be made to charter documents;

     - acquire or agree to acquire material assets;

     - sell, lease, license or dispose of material assets other than in the
       ordinary course of business;

     - incur or guarantee any indebtedness for borrowed money;

     - issue or sell debt security or guarantee debt security of others;

     - grant severance or termination pay to any director or employee other than
       pursuant to the existing agreements of SONICblue;

     - revalue assets other than in the ordinary course of business;

     - make or change any material tax election or change in an existing tax
       election relating to a material tax liability;

     - make capital expenditures, except within the budget for a given year,
       subject to certain ordinary course exceptions; or

     - any other action that would prevent performance of a covenant.

     Reasonable Efforts. SONICblue and Sensory Science have agreed to cooperate
with each other and use all commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions
and do all things necessary or advisable under the merger agreement and
applicable laws to complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement.

     Employee Benefits Matters. SONICblue has agreed that all employees of
Sensory Science and its subsidiaries who continue to be employed by SONICblue,
Sensory Science or any other SONICblue subsidiary after the merger will be
eligible to participate in SONICblue's health and welfare benefit plans.

     Sensory Science has agreed to terminate, freeze, and/or modify its 401(k)
plan or merge its 401(k) plan into the SONICblue 401(k) plan. After the merger
SONICblue will provide comparable benefits to Sensory Science employees as are
provided to similarly situated employees of SONICblue.

     Indemnification. SONICblue has agreed that:

     - for six years after the merger becomes effective SONICblue will indemnify
       present and former Sensory Science directors, officers, employees, agents
       and representatives against costs or expenses incurred in connection with
       any claim arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
       effective time of the merger to the extent provided under Delaware law,
       Sensory Science's certificate of incorporation and its bylaws;

     - for three years after the merger becomes effective, SONICblue will
       maintain current policies of officers' and directors' liability insurance
       with respect to claims arising from facts or events

       occurring prior to the effective time of the merger, however, SONICblue
       will be obligated to pay only up to 200% of the premiums paid by Sensory
       Science for such insurance as of January 31, 2001.

     Other Covenants. The merger agreement contains additional mutual covenants
of the parties, including SONICblue's covenant to prepare and file with the
Nasdaq National Market prior to the effective time of the merger any documents
that may be required.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     Right to Terminate. The merger agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the closing in any of the following ways:

          (a) by mutual consent of SONICblue and Sensory Science;

          (b) by either SONICblue or Sensory Science if the merger has not been
     completed by September 30, 2001;

          (c) by either SONICblue or Sensory Science if Sensory Science
     stockholders fail to approve the merger;

          (d) by SONICblue if the Sensory Science board fails to recommend the
     merger or withdraws or modifies in a manner adverse to SONICblue its
     approval or recommendation of the merger, recommends a superior offer or if
     a tender or exchange offer relating to securities of Sensory Science have
     been commenced and the Sensory Science board has not recommended the
     rejection of such tender or exchange offer in accordance with the terms of
     the merger agreement;

          (e) by Sensory Science if its board of directors authorizes Sensory
     Science to enter into an agreement for a superior proposal; or

          (f) by SONICblue or Sensory Science if the other party has breached
     its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations under the merger
     agreement, which breach would result in the failure to satisfy certain
     specified closing conditions and such breach shall be incapable of being
     cured, or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within 30
     days after written notice thereof was received.

     A "superior proposal" is an unsolicited proposal for the acquisition of the
majority of Sensory Science's outstanding common stock that is not subject to a
financing condition and which the Sensory Science board believes to be more
favorable to Sensory Science stockholders.

     Neither SONICblue nor Sensory Science can terminate the merger agreement
for the reasons described in paragraph (b) above if its failure to fulfill in
any material respect its obligations under the merger agreement has resulted in
the failure to complete the merger. Sensory Science cannot terminate the merger
agreement due to the failure of Sensory Science stockholders to approve the
merger above if the failure to obtain stockholder approval was caused by an
action or failure to act by Sensory Science.

     If the merger agreement is validly terminated, the agreement will become
void without any liability on the part of any party unless such party is in
willful breach. The provisions of the merger agreement relating to expenses and
termination fees, as well as the confidentiality agreement entered into between
SONICblue and Sensory Science, will, however, continue in effect notwithstanding
termination of the merger agreement.

     Termination Fees Payable by Sensory Science. Sensory Science has agreed to
pay SONICblue a cash amount equal to $404,000 in any of the following
circumstances:

     - SONICblue terminates the merger agreement as described in paragraph (c)
       under "Right to Terminate" above;

     - Sensory Science terminates the merger agreement as described in paragraph
       (d) under "Right to Terminate" above; or

     - either SONICblue or Sensory Science terminates the merger agreement upon
       the failure of Sensory Science stockholders to approve the merger at a
       duly held meeting and prior to such meeting an alternative offer was made
       to Sensory Science or its stockholders.

EXPENSES

     Except as described above, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the merger agreement and related transactions will be paid by the party
incurring such costs or expenses.

AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS

     Any provision of the merger agreement may be amended or waived prior to
closing if the amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by Sensory Science, SONICblue and the merger subsidiary or, in the
case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. After
the approval of the merger agreement by the stockholders of Sensory Science, no
amendment or waiver shall change the amount or kind of merger consideration or
any term of Sensory Science's certificate of incorporation or otherwise
adversely affect the Sensory Science stockholders without the further approval
of such stockholders.

CREDIT AGREEMENT

     The following summary of the credit agreement, as amended, is qualified by
reference to the complete text of the credit agreement, which is incorporated by
reference into this document and attached as Annex B.

     In connection with SONICblue's acquisition of Sensory Science, and to fund
the working capital needs of Sensory Science, SONICblue agreed to make available
to Sensory Science a line of credit not to exceed $3.0 million, of which
$500,000 of the proceeds must be used in connection with Sensory Science's
iCache business. The balance of the proceeds of the line of credit must be used
for either iCache or for general working capital purposes. The line of credit is
governed by a credit agreement that details, among other things, the means by
which Sensory Science may request loans pursuant to the $3.0 million line of
credit. Loans made pursuant to the line of credit are subordinated to Sensory
Science's existing indebtedness with Congress Financial Corporation (Western)
and SoftTech Financial/Midstates EAB Leasing Corporation.

     Should the merger agreement between SONICblue and Sensory Science not be in
full force and effect or should an event occur giving rise to termination of the
merger agreement, SONICblue was under no obligation to make any loans beyond
$500,000. In February 2000, SONICblue loaned Sensory Science $3.0 million
pursuant to the credit agreement.

     The loans accrue interest at the "prime rate" as published in the "Money
Rates" section of the Wall Street Journal and interest will be payable in
arrears on the last day of each month. The principal balances of the loans are
scheduled to be repaid by February 1, 2002. Sensory Science must promptly repay
the balances outstanding under the credit agreement upon the occurrence of
certain events including the sale of substantially all of its assets to a party
other than SONICblue, a business combination with a party other than SONICblue,
or the acquisition of a controlling interest in Sensory Science by a third party
other than SONICblue. The principal balances may be prepaid at any time without
penalty or premium.

COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT

     The following summary of the common stock purchase warrant is qualified by
reference to the complete text of the common stock purchase warrant, which is
incorporated by reference into this document and attached as Annex C.

     The common stock purchase warrant issued in connection with the loan of
$3.0 million entitles SONICblue to purchase 5,357,143 shares of Sensory Science
common stock at $0.56 by cash or equivalent or by net issue exercise, which is
the number of shares exercised multiplied by the difference between fair market
value of a share and exercise price, or $0.56, divided by the fair market value
of a share.

     The common stock purchase warrant terminates on the later of (i) the first
anniversary of the advance under the credit agreement, attached hereto as Annex
B; (ii) the date on which the indebtedness of Sensory Science is paid to
SONICblue.

     Should Sensory Science propose to register any of its securities, it must
give notice to SONICblue and, upon timely written request by SONICblue, include
the warrant shares in that registration. At any time within five years from the
date of the common stock purchase warrant, SONICblue may request that Sensory
Science register the warrant shares. Sensory Science will comply, pay the fees
involved in such registration, and take any other reasonable action necessary to
permit the sale or other disposition of the warrant shares.

     The number of shares purchasable upon exercise of the warrant will reflect
any stock dividends, combination of stock, or reorganization as if the warrant
been exercised prior to such an event.

                    INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING AND VOTING

     Sensory Science's board of directors is using this proxy
statement/prospectus to solicit proxies from the holders of Sensory Science
common stock for use at the special meeting. Sensory Science is first mailing
this proxy statement/prospectus and accompanying form of proxy to Sensory
Science stockholders on or about             , 2001.

MATTERS RELATING TO THE MEETING

     Time and Place. The meeting will be held at   :   .m., local time, on
day,             , 2001, at                          .

     Purpose of Meeting. The purpose of the meeting is to have Sensory Science
stockholders vote on a proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and
the merger.

2001. As of             , 2001, there were        shares of Sensory Science
common stock outstanding.

     Shares Entitled to Vote. Shares of Sensory Science common stock held at the
close of business on the record date,             , 2001, are entitled to vote
at the special meeting. Each share of Sensory Science common stock that you own

voted.

     Quorum Requirement. A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid
meeting. The presence in person or by proxy at the meeting of holders of shares
representing a majority of the votes of the Sensory Science common stock
entitled to vote at the meeting is a quorum. Abstentions and broker "non-votes"
count as present for establishing a quorum. Shares held by Sensory Science in
its treasury do not count toward a quorum. A broker "non-vote" occurs on an item
when a broker is not permitted to vote on that item without instruction from the
beneficial owner of the shares and no instruction is given.

VOTE NECESSARY TO APPROVE THE MERGER

     The presence, in person or by proxy, at the meeting of the holders of a
majority of the shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the
meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum at the meeting. The affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the shares of Sensory Science common stock
outstanding, or                shares, is required to approve the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement. Withheld votes and abstentions have the same effect
as a vote against.

Sensory Science beneficially owned approximately 222,100 shares of Sensory
Science common stock, representing approximately 1.5% of the outstanding shares

with the merger agreement, Carmine F. Adimando, Roger B. Hackett, Thomas F.
Hartley and William T. Walker, Jr. have granted SONICblue irrevocable proxy to
vote their shares of Sensory Science common stock, representing in the aggregate
approximately      % of the outstanding shares of Sensory Science common stock

agreement and the merger.

       you have revoked your proxy, or

     - voting in person at the meeting.

     Voting in person. If you plan to attend a meeting and wish to vote in
person, Sensory Science will give you a ballot at the meeting. However, if your
shares are held in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee, you must
bring an account statement or letter from the nominee indicating that you are
the beneficial owner of the shares on             , 2001, the record date for
voting.

     Confidential voting. Ballots, proxy forms and voting instructions returned
to brokerage firms, banks and other holders of record are treated as
confidential. Only the proxy solicitor, the proxy tabulator and the inspectors
of election have access to the ballots, proxy forms and voting instructions.
Anyone who processes or inspects the ballots, proxy forms and voting
instructions signs a pledge to treat them as confidential. None of these persons
is a director, officer or employee of Sensory Science.

     The proxy solicitor and the proxy tabulator will disclose information taken
from the ballots, proxy forms and voting instructions only in the event of a
proxy contest or as otherwise required by law.

management but will not disclose your identity unless you request it in writing.

     Proxy solicitation. Sensory Science will pay its own costs of soliciting
proxies.

personally, electronically or by telephone. Sensory Science is paying Corporate
Investor Communications, Inc. a fee of $7,500 plus their reasonable
out-of-pocket and related expenses to help with the solicitation.

     The extent to which these proxy soliciting efforts will be necessary
depends entirely upon how promptly proxies are submitted. YOU SHOULD SEND IN
YOUR PROXY BY MAIL WITHOUT DELAY. Sensory Science also reimburses brokers and
other nominees for their expenses in sending these materials to you and getting
your voting instructions.

     DO NOT SEND IN ANY STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH YOUR PROXY CARD. THE EXCHANGE

SCIENCE COMMON STOCK CERTIFICATES TO FORMER SENSORY SCIENCE STOCKHOLDERS AS SOON
AS PRACTICABLE AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

OTHER BUSINESS; ADJOURNMENTS

     Under the laws of Delaware, where Sensory Science is incorporated, no
business other than procedural matters may be raised at the stockholder
meetings, unless proper notice to the stockholders has been given.

     Adjournments may be made for the purpose of, among other things, soliciting
additional proxies. Any adjournment may be made from time to time without
further notice other than by an announcement made at the meeting.

                        COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS

     Both SONICblue and Sensory Science are Delaware corporations and are
governed by Delaware law. In addition, the rights of Sensory Science
stockholders are currently governed by the Sensory Science certificate of
incorporation and the Sensory Science bylaws. The rights of the SONICblue
stockholders are governed by the SONICblue amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and the SONICblue restated bylaws. After the effective time of the
merger, the rights of holders of Sensory Science capital stock who become
holders of SONICblue common stock will be governed by the SONICblue amended and
restated certificate of incorporation, the SONICblue bylaws and Delaware law. In
most respect, the rights of holders of Sensory Science capital stock are similar
to the rights of holders of SONICblue common stock. The following is a summary
of the material differences between the current rights of Sensory Science
stockholders and the rights those stockholders will have as SONICblue
stockholders following the merger.

     The summary contained in the following chart is not intended to be complete
and is qualified by reference to Delaware law, the Sensory Science certificate
of incorporation, the Sensory Science bylaws, the SONICblue restated certificate
of incorporation and the SONICblue bylaws.

                     DESCRIPTION OF SONICBLUE CAPITAL STOCK

     The following description of certain terms of the capital stock of
SONICblue is not meant to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws of SONICblue
which are incorporated herein by reference. See "Where You Can Find More
Information" on page 98.

AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK

     The authorized capital stock of SONICblue currently consists of 175 million
shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and five million shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share.

SONICBLUE COMMON STOCK

     SONICblue common stock outstanding. As of March 29, 2001, there were
93,532,533 shares of SONICblue common stock issued, of which 80,532,533 shares
were outstanding and 13 million were treasury shares. The outstanding shares of
SONICblue common stock are, and the shares of SONICblue common stock issued
pursuant to the merger will be, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable.

     Voting rights. Each holder of SONICblue common stock is entitled to one
vote for each share of SONICblue common stock held of record on the applicable
record date on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. There are no
cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of a majority of the
shares voted can elect all of the directors then standing for election.

     Dividend rights; rights upon liquidation. The holders of SONICblue common
stock are entitled to receive dividends out of assets legally available for
dividends at times and in amounts as the SONICblue board of directors may
determine. These dividend rights are subject to any preferential dividend rights
granted to the holders of any outstanding SONICblue preferred stock. SONICblue
has never paid cash dividends on shares of its capital stock. The SONICblue
board presently intends to retain all earnings for use in its business and has
no present intention to pay cash dividends before or after the merger.

     In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of SONICblue, each
share of SONICblue common stock is entitled to share pro rata in any
distribution of SONICblue's assets after payment or providing for the payment of
liabilities and the liquidation preference of any outstanding SONICblue
preferred stock.

     Preemptive and other rights. Holders of SONICblue common stock have no
preemptive rights to purchase, subscribe for or otherwise acquire any unissued
or treasury shares or other securities. There are no redemption or sinking fund
provisions applicable to the SONICblue common stock.

SONICBLUE PREFERRED STOCK

     As of             , 2001, no shares of SONICblue preferred stock were
issued or outstanding.

     SONICblue's board of directors has the authority, without stockholder
approval, to create and issue one or more series of preferred stock and to fix
the number of shares, designations, preferences, powers and relative,
participating, optional or other special rights of the shares of that series,
and the qualifications or restrictions on those preferences or rights. The
specific matters that may be determined by the board with respect to a series of
preferred stock include:

     - the designation of the series;

     - the number of shares of the series;

     - the rate of dividends, if any;

     - whether dividends, if any, are cumulative or non-cumulative;

     - the terms of redemption, if any;

     - the amount payable in the event of any voluntary or involuntary
       liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of SONICblue;

     - rights and terms of conversion or exchange, if any;

     - restrictions on the issuance of shares of the same series or any other
       series, if any; and

     - voting rights, if any.

     The series A participating preferred stock described below under
"-- Stockholder Rights Plan" is a series of preferred stock that has been
authorized by the SONICblue board.

     The issuance of preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in
connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could
decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders
of SONICblue common stock or affect adversely the rights and powers, including
voting rights, of the holder of SONICblue common stock. Also, the issuance of
preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a
change in control of SONICblue and may adversely affect the market price of
SONICblue common stock. SONICblue has no current plans to issue any shares of
preferred stock.

WARRANT AND REGISTRATION RIGHTS

     As of April 18, 2001, SONICblue had outstanding a warrant to purchase 2
million shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $10.00 per snare. The
warrant has a net exercise provision under which the holder may, in lieu of
payment of the exercise price in cash, surrender the warrant and receive a net
amount of shares, based on the fair market value of SONICblue's common stock at
the time of the exercise of the warrant, after deducting the aggregate exercise
price. The warrant will expire in January 2005.

     If SONICblue proposes to register any of its securities under the
Securities Act in connection with a firmly underwritten public offering solely
of its common stock and solely for cash, holders of SONICblue's common stock
issued on exercise of the warrant are entitled to notice of the registration and
are entitled to include their shares in the registration, provided, among other
conditions, that the underwriters of any such offering have the right to limit
the number of shares included in the registration. In addition, holders of at
least 40% of the shares issued on exercise of the warrant may require SONICblue
to prepare and file a registration statement under the Securities Act at its
expense covering at least 400,000 shares entitled to registration rights.
SONICblue is obligated to effect up to two of these stockholder-initiated
registrations.

TRANSFER AGENT AND REGISTRAR

     Fleet National Bank c/o Equiserve, LP, is the transfer agent and registrar
for SONICblue's common stock.

SONICBLUE STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

     SONICblue's board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan.

     The rights issued under the plan are not now exercisable, and SONICblue
does not know at this time whether they ever will be exercisable. Except as
described below, each right, when exercisable, entitles the registered holder to
purchase from SONICblue one one-thousandth of a share of series A participating
preferred stock at a price of $85.00, subject to adjustment.

     In general, until the rights are exercisable or are redeemed or exchanged
or expire unexercised, each right is associated with and cannot be separated
from the underlying share of SONICblue common stock on which the right was
declared as a dividend. Accordingly, until the rights are separate from the
SONICblue common stock, (i) each holder of outstanding shares of SONICblue
common stock is also the holder of an equal number of rights, (ii) any sale or
other transfer of shares of SONICblue common stock by a holder thereof also will
cause a transfer of the associated rights, and (iii) no certificates will be

issued to evidence ownership of the rights, but certificates for shares of
SONICblue common stock will refer to the associated rights. Until a right is
exercised, it confers no rights as a stockholder, including the right to vote or
to receive dividends.

     The rights will separate from the SONICblue common stock if there is a
"Distribution Date." A Distribution Date will occur on the earliest to happen of

     - a public announcement that someone has become an "Acquiring Person,"
       meaning that the person, which can be an entity or group and including
       affiliated or associated persons or entities, has acquired, or obtained
       the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the
       outstanding shares of SONICblue common stock, other than as a result of
       repurchases of stock by SONICblue or certain inadvertent actions by
       institutional or certain other stockholders, or

     - ten days, or later if determined by the SONICblue board, following the
       commencement of or a public announcement of an intention to make a tender
       offer or exchange offer that would result in someone becoming an
       Acquiring Person.

If a Distribution Date occurs, the rights will become exercisable and separately
tradable, and SONICblue will issue certificates for the rights as soon as
possible.

     The rights will expire on the earliest of (i) May 14, 2007, (ii)
consummation of a merger transaction with a person or group who acquired
SONICblue common stock pursuant to a Permitted Offer, as defined below, and is
offering in the merger the same price per share and form of consideration paid
in the Permitted Offer, or (iii) redemption or exchange of the rights by
SONICblue as described below.

     The number of rights associated with each share of SONICblue common stock
will be proportionately adjusted to prevent dilution in the event of a stock
dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the SONICblue
common stock. The purchase price payable, and the number of shares of preferred
stock or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the rights are
subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of
a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of the
preferred stock, (ii) if holders of the preferred stock are granted certain
rights or warrants to subscribe for preferred stock, certain convertible
securities or securities having the same or more favorable rights, privileges
and preferences as the preferred stock at less than the current market price of
the preferred stock, or (iii) if holders of the preferred stock are issued
evidences of indebtedness or assets, excluding regular quarterly cash dividends
out of earnings or retained earnings, or subscription rights or warrants other
than those referred to above. With certain exceptions, no adjustments in the
purchase price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an
adjustment of at least 1% in the purchase price.

     The amount of preferred stock that the holder of a right is entitled to
receive upon exercise of a right and the purchase price payable upon exercise of
a right are both subject to adjustment. Initially, the purchase price is $85.00
per right. If no one has yet become an Acquiring Person, payment of the purchase
price entitles the holder of a right to receive only one one-thousandth of a
share of preferred stock. If someone has become an Acquiring Person, however,
and that fact has been publicly announced by SONICblue or the Acquiring Person,
the rights will be adjusted as follows:

     - If SONICblue is involved in a merger or other business combination
       transaction or 50% or more of SONICblue's assets or earning power are
       sold, each holder of a right other than an Acquiring Person will have the
       right to receive, upon the exercise of the right at the then current
       purchase price, a number of shares of common stock of the acquiring
       company which at the time of the transaction would have a market value of
       two times the purchase price.

     - If someone becomes an Acquiring Person, except pursuant to a tender offer
       or exchange offer approved by SONICblue's board before the person becomes
       an Acquiring Person or a Permitted Offer, then each holder of a right
       will for a 60-day period, subject to extension under certain
       circumstances, have the right to receive upon exercise that number of
       shares of SONICblue common stock or, in certain circumstances, a
       combination of SONICblue common stock, property,

other securities and/or a reduction in the exercise price of the right, having a
market value of two times the purchase price.

If any of the events described in the prior two paragraphs occurs, any rights
that are or were at any time after the Distribution Date owned by an Acquiring
Person will immediately become null and void.

     At any time before there is an Acquiring Person, the SONICblue board of
directors may act to redeem all of the rights at a price of $0.01 per right.
After there is an Acquiring Person, the rights may be redeemed only in very
limited circumstances. Upon redemption, the right to exercise the rights will
terminate and the only right of the holders of rights will be to receive the
redemption price.

     At any time after there is an Acquiring Person, but not after that person
acquires 50% or more of the outstanding SONICblue common stock, the SONICblue
board may exchange all or part of the then outstanding and exercisable rights,
except for rights that have become void, for shares of SONICblue common stock at
a rate of one share of SONICblue common stock, or substitute consideration, per
right.

     The preferred stock purchasable upon exercise of the rights will be
nonredeemable and junior to any other series of preferred stock SONICblue may
issue, unless otherwise provided in the terms of that stock. Each share of
preferred stock will have a preferential quarterly dividend in an amount equal
to 1,000 times the dividend declared on each share of SONICblue common stock,
but in no event less than $25.00. In the event of liquidation, the holders of
shares of preferred stock will receive a preferred liquidation payment equal to
the greater of $1,000 or 1,000 times the payment made per each share of
SONICblue common stock. Each share of preferred stock will have 1,000 votes,
voting together with the shares of SONICblue common stock. In the event of any
merger, consolidation or other transaction in which shares of SONICblue common
stock are exchanged, each share of preferred stock will be entitled to receive
1,000 times the amount and type of consideration received per share of SONICblue
common stock. The rights of the preferred stock as to dividends, liquidation and
voting, and in the event of mergers and consolidations, are protected by
customary antidilution provisions. Fractional shares of preferred stock will be
issuable; however, (i) SONICblue may elect to distribute depositary receipts in
lieu of fractional shares and (ii) in lieu of fractional shares other than
fractions that are multiples of one one-thousandth of a share, an adjustment in
cash will be made based on the market price of the preferred stock on the last
trading date prior to the date of exercise.

     The description and terms of the rights are set forth in a rights agreement
between SONICblue and Fleet National Bank, the rights agent. SONICblue and the
rights agent retain broad authority to amend the rights agreement; however,
following any Distribution Date any amendment may not adversely affect the
interests of holders of rights. This description of the rights is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the rights agreement, which has been filed with the
SEC. See "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 98.

     The stockholder rights plan is intended to enhance the likelihood of
continuity and stability in the composition of SONICblue's board of directors
and in the policies formulated by the board of directors and to discourage
certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change of
control of SONICblue. The rights plan is designed to reduce the vulnerability of
SONICblue to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and, accordingly, could
discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change
in control of SONICblue. The rights plan is also intended to discourage certain
tactics that may be used in proxy fights but could, however, have the effect of
discouraging others from making tender offers for SONICblue's shares and,
consequently, may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of SONICblue's
shares that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts. The rights
plan may also have the effect of preventing changes in the management of
SONICblue. In general, the rights plan is likely to make an acquisition of
SONICblue more difficult and expensive and could discourage potential acquirers.

                                 LEGAL MATTERS

     The validity of the SONICblue common stock to be issued to Sensory Science
stockholders pursuant to the merger will be passed upon by Pillsbury Winthrop
LLP, Palo Alto, California.

               REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Stockholders and Board of Directors
SONICblue Incorporated

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SONICblue
Incorporated and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at
item 14(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of SONICblue
Incorporated and subsidiaries at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects
the information set forth therein.

                  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000, 1999 AND 1998

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  Organization

     SONICblue Incorporated ("SONICblue" or the "Company"), which was
incorporated on January 9, 1989, designs, develops and markets products for the
digital media, consumer electronics, Internet appliance and home networking
markets. The Company, formerly S3 Incorporated, changed its named to SONICblue
Incorporated on November 15, 2000. The Company's products are used in, and its
business is dependent on, the personal computer industry and the development of
the Internet. Its sales are primarily in the United States, Asia and Europe (see
Note 11). Its products are manufactured, assembled and tested by contract
manufacturers.

  Basis of Presentation

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SONICblue and
its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and
transactions have been eliminated. Investments in entities in which the Company
does not have control, but has the ability to exercise significant influence
over operating and financial policies, are accounted for by the equity method.
In January 2001, SONICblue completed the transfer of its graphics chips assets
to S3 Graphics Co., Ltd. a joint venture between VIA Technologies Inc. and a
wholly owned subsidiary of SONICblue.

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Significant estimates include allowances for doubtful accounts
and customer returns, deferred tax assets, the useful lives of fixed assets and
intangible assets, inventory and other reserves. Actual results could differ
from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial
statements.

  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

     The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a remaining
maturity of 90 days or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash
equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company's
short-term investments primarily comprise readily marketable debt and equity
securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of
purchase.

     The Company has classified its entire investment portfolio as
available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are classified as cash
equivalents or short-term investments and are stated at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss). The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion
are included in interest income. Realized gains and losses are included in other
income (expense). The cost of securities sold is based on the specific
identification method.

  Derivative Financial Instruments

     As of January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
Board Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, which was issued in June 1998, and its amendments Statement 137,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-Deferral of the
Effective Date of FASB No. 133 and Statement 138, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, issued in June 1999 and June 2000,
respectively (collectively referred to as Statement 133).

                                       F-7

                             SONICBLUE INCORPORATED

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
                  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000, 1999 AND 1998

     As a result of the adoption of Statement 133, the Company will recognize
all derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange contracts, in the
consolidated financial instruments at fair value regardless of the purpose or
the intent for holding the instrument. Changes in the fair value of derivative
financial instruments are either recognized periodically in income or in
stockholders' equity as a component of comprehensive income depending on whether
the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedging accounting, and if so,
whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge. Generally,
changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are
recorded in income along with the portions of the changes in the fair values of
the hedged items that relate to the hedged risk(s). Changes in fair values of
derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective
as hedges, are recorded in other comprehensive income net of deferred taxes.
Changes in fair value of derivatives used as hedges of the net investment in
foreign operations are reported in other comprehensive income as part of the
cumulative translation adjustment. Changes in fair value of derivatives not
qualifying as hedges are reported in income.

     As the Company had no derivative financial instruments outstanding as of
December 31, 2000, the adoption of Statement 133 had no impact on the financial
statements of the Company at January 1, 2001.

     Prior to January 1, 2001, the Company used forward foreign exchange
contracts primarily to hedge the value of accounts receivable denominated in
foreign currencies against fluctuations in exchange rates until such receivables
are collected. The Company did not enter into forward foreign exchange contracts
for speculative or trading purposes. The Company's accounting policies for these
contracts were based on the Company's designation of the contracts as hedges of
recorded transactions. Gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts
were recognized in income in the same period as losses and gains on the
underlying transactions were recognized and generally offset. As of December 31,
2000, the Company had no foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding. As of
December 31, 1999, the Company had two foreign exchange forward contracts
outstanding. Each contract allowed the Company to sell 275,905,000 New Taiwan
Dollars.

  Inventories

     Inventories consist of raw materials, work in process and finished goods
and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. The
Company's products typically experience short life cycles and the Company
estimates the market value of its inventory based on anticipated selling prices
adjusted for completion and selling costs. Should the Company experience a
substantial unanticipated decline in the selling price of its products and/or
demand therefor, a material valuation adjustment and corresponding charge to
operations could result.

     Required payments under the terminated "take or pay" contract with TSMC
(See Note 6) were capitalized and amortized to inventory costs as the related
product was received.

     Inventories consist of:

  Property and Equipment

     Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of three to seven years for
machinery and equipment and five to seven years for furniture and fixtures.
Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the
shorter of the lease term or the assets' useful lives.
