                               SUMMARY TERM SHEET

     Tiger Deals, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of 3D Systems
Corporation, is offering to purchase all the outstanding shares of common stock
of DTM Corporation for $5.80 per share in cash. The following are some questions
you, as a shareholder of DTM, may have, and answers to those questions. This
summary sheet is not meant as a substitute for the information contained in the
remainder of this document and the related letter of transmittal, and the
information contained in the summary term sheet is qualified in its entirety by
the more detailed descriptions and explanations contained in this document and
the related letter of transmittal. We urge you to carefully read this entire
document and the related letter of transmittal prior to making any decision
regarding whether to tender your shares.

WHO IS OFFERING TO BUY MY SHARES OF DTM?

     Our name is Tiger Deals, Inc. We are a Delaware corporation and we were
formed for the purpose of making this offer. We are wholly owned by 3D Systems,
Inc., which is a California corporation, and our ultimate parent is 3D Systems
Corporation, a Delaware corporation. 3D Systems, Inc., together with its other
direct and indirect subsidiaries, develops and manufactures solid imaging
systems that it markets to a worldwide customer base. Solid imaging systems are
designed to rapidly produce three-dimensional physical objects from digital data
using computer aided design and manufacturing software utilities and related
computer applications. 3D Systems, Inc. is also sometimes referred to in this
document as "3D California."

     Unless the context indicates otherwise, we will use the terms "3D Systems",
"we", "us" and "our" to refer to 3D Systems Corporation and all of its direct
and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. See Section 9 -- "Information Concerning
Us" and Schedule I for more detailed information.

HOW MANY SHARES ARE YOU SEEKING TO PURCHASE, AT WHAT PRICE, AND DO I HAVE TO PAY
ANY FEES OR COMMISSIONS?

     We are offering to purchase all the outstanding shares of common stock of
DTM at a purchase price of $5.80 per share, net to you, in cash, without
interest, less any required withholding taxes. If you tender your shares
directly to the depositary that we have hired to complete this transaction, you
will not have to pay any brokerage fees or any similar expenses. If you own your
shares through a broker or other nominee, and your broker or other nominee
tenders your shares for you, your broker or other nominee may charge you a fee.
You should check whether your broker or other nominee will charge you any fee to
tender your shares for you. See "Introduction" and Section 1 -- "Terms of the
Offer; Expiration Date; Extension of Tender Period; Termination; Amendment" for
more detailed information.

DO YOU HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MAKE PAYMENT?

     3D Systems Corporation and 3D Systems, Inc., will provide us with
approximately $48 million. We will use those funds to purchase all shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn in the offer and to provide funding for the
merger which is expected to follow the consummation of the offer. We will obtain
the necessary funds from available cash on hand and from a loan, pursuant to a
financing commitment from U.S. Bank, N.A. However, the loan has not yet been
finalized and the bank is permitted to withdraw its commitment under certain
circumstances. See Section 10 -- "Source and Amount of Funds" for more detailed
information.

IS YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION RELEVANT TO MY DECISION WHETHER TO TENDER MY SHARES
IN THE OFFER?

     Yes. While the payment for your shares consists solely of cash, we have
arranged for all of our funding to come from cash on hand and the bank loan
described in the preceding answer. Therefore, our financial condition is
relevant in determining whether we will be able to pay for your shares if the
bank were to withdraw its loan commitment or fail to fully fund the loan. As of
December 31, 2000, our fiscal year-end, we had total current assets of
$75,065,000 and, for the year ended December 31, 2000, net

income of $8,144,000. See Section 9 -- "Information Concerning Us" and Section
10 -- "Source and Amount of Funds" for more detailed information.

HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO TENDER MY SHARES AND CAN THE OFFER BE
EXTENDED?

     You will have until 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on May 29, 2001, to
tender your shares. This date, or the extended expiration date in the event of
an extension of the offer, is the expiration date of the offer. We have the
right to extend the offer from time to time, without the consent of DTM if, at
the expiration date, any condition to the offer is not satisfied or waived. We
also have agreed to extend the offer from time to time until June 29, 2001 if,
at the then scheduled expiration date, all of the offer conditions have not been
satisfied or waived. We will not be required to extend the offer under this
provision unless, in our reasonable judgment:

     - each condition that is not then satisfied or waived is reasonably capable
       of being satisfied;

     - DTM is in material compliance with all of its covenants in the merger
       agreement; and

     - the failure of the condition to be satisfied is not the result of a
       breach by DTM of any of its covenants or agreements contained in the
       merger agreement.

     If we extend the time period of the offer, this will extend the time that
you will have to tender your shares. See Section 1 -- "Terms of the Offer;
Expiration Date; Extension of Tender Period; Termination; Amendment" for more
detailed information.

WILL THERE BE A SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD?

     Maybe. We may elect to provide a "subsequent offering period" for the
offer. A subsequent offering period, if one is included, will be an additional
period of time, between three and 20 business days in length following the
expiration date of the offer and the purchase of common shares by us in the
offer, during which shareholders may tender shares not tendered in the offer,
and receive $5.80, or any higher price paid in the offer. During any subsequent
offering period, tendering shareholders will not have withdrawal rights and we
will promptly purchase and pay for any shares of common stock of DTM tendered,
at the same price paid in the offer. We do not currently intend to include a
subsequent offering period, although we reserve the right to do so. See Section
1 -- "Terms of the Offer; Expiration Date; Extension of Tender Period;
Termination; Amendment" for more detailed information.

HOW WILL I BE NOTIFIED IF THE OFFER IS EXTENDED?

     If the offer is extended, we will issue a press release announcing the
extension on or before 9:00 a.m. New York City time on the first business day
following the date the offer was previously scheduled to expire. See Section
1 -- "Terms of the Offer; Expiration Date; Extension of Tender Period;
Termination; Amendment" and Section 2 -- "Procedure for Tendering Shares" for
more detailed information.

HOW DO I TENDER MY SHARES?

     To tender your shares, you must complete and sign the letter of
transmittal, which we have enclosed with this document, indicating that you want
to sell your shares to us. Then send the letter of transmittal along with the
certificates representing your shares to the depositary prior to the expiration
of the offer. If your common shares are held in street name by your broker,
dealer, bank, trust company or other nominee, only your nominee can tender your
shares for you. If you cannot deliver all necessary documents to the depositary
in time, you may be able to complete and deliver to the depositary the enclosed
Notice of Guaranteed Delivery in place of the missing documents, provided you
are able to comply fully with its terms. See Section 2 -- "Procedure for
Tendering Shares" and the letter of transmittal for more detailed information.

IF I TENDER MY SHARES, WHEN WILL I GET PAID?

     If the conditions to the offer are satisfied and we consummate the offer
and accept your shares for payment, you will receive payment for the shares you
tendered as promptly as practicable following the expiration of the offer.

IF I TENDER MY SHARES, CAN I CHANGE MY MIND?

     Yes. You can withdraw your shares at any time prior to the expiration of
the offer and, if we have not agreed to accept your shares for payment by
Tuesday, June 29, 2001, you can withdraw your shares at any time thereafter
until we accept your shares for payment. The right to withdraw tendered shares
will not apply to any subsequent offering period, if one is included. In order
to withdraw your shares, you must send written notice of the withdrawal with the
required information to the depositary before the expiration of the offer. If
you tendered your shares by giving instructions to a broker or nominee, you must
instruct your broker or nominee to arrange for the withdrawal of your shares.
See Section 3 -- "Withdrawal Rights" for more detailed information.

WHAT DOES DTM'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS THINK OF THE OFFER?

     DTM's board of directors has approved the offer and has determined that the
offer is fair to you and in your best interests. DTM's board of directors
unanimously recommends that shareholders accept the offer and tender their
shares. DTM has prepared a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement containing
additional information regarding the determination and recommendation of DTM's
board of directors, including a discussion of an opinion dated April 2, 2001, of
Hoak Breedlove Wesneski & Co. to DTM's board of directors that, as of that date,
the $5.80 per share of common stock cash consideration to be received in the
offer and the merger by the holders of DTM common stock was fair from a
financial point of view to those holders. The Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement is being sent to shareholders concurrently with this document. See
Section 11 -- "Background of Offer; Past Contacts, Transactions or Negotiations
with DTM" for more detailed information.

WILL THE OFFER BE FOLLOWED BY A MERGER IF ALL THE SHARES ARE NOT TENDERED IN THE
OFFER?

     The merger agreement provides that if we acquire at least 67% of the total
number of outstanding common shares on a fully diluted basis pursuant to the
offer, we will be merged into DTM as soon as practicable after the acquisition
and the satisfaction of the other conditions contained in the merger agreement.
If we acquire at least 67% of the common shares, we will have sufficient voting
power to approve the merger without the approval of any other DTM shareholders.
If the merger takes place, 3D Systems Corporation indirectly will own all of the
shares of DTM and all shareholders of DTM who have not tendered their shares
will have the right to receive the same price paid in the offer, subject to
their right to pursue appraisal under Texas law. See Section 12 -- "Purpose of
the Offer and the Merger; Plans for DTM" for more detailed information.

IF I OBJECT TO THE PRICE BEING OFFERED, WILL I HAVE APPRAISAL RIGHTS?

     No. Appraisal rights are not available in the offer. However, if the merger
takes place, shareholders who have not tendered their shares in the offer and
have complied with the applicable provisions of Texas law will have appraisal
rights. See Section 12 -- "Purpose of the Offer and the Merger; Plans for DTM"
and Section 15 -- "Legal Matters" for more detailed information.

IF I DECIDE NOT TO TENDER, HOW WILL THE OFFER AFFECT MY SHARES?

     If the merger takes place, shareholders who have not tendered their shares
will have the right to receive the same price paid in the offer to tendering
shareholders, that is, $5.80 per share of common stock in cash (or any other
higher price per share which is paid in the offer), subject to their right to
pursue appraisal under Texas law. Therefore, if the merger takes place and you
do not perfect your appraisal rights, the only difference to you between
tendering your shares and not tendering your shares is that you

will be paid earlier if you tender your shares. However, until the merger is
consummated or if the merger does not take place for some reason, the number of
shareholders of DTM and the number of shares of DTM that are still in the hands
of the public may be so small that there no longer will be an active public
trading market (or, possibly, any public trading market) for the shares. Also,
the shares may no longer be eligible to be traded on the Nasdaq stock market or
any other securities exchange, and DTM may cease making filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to in this document as the
SEC, or otherwise cease being required to comply with the SEC's rules relating
to publicly held companies. See Section 7 -- "Effects of the Transaction" and
Section 12 -- "Purpose of the Offer and the Merger; Plans for DTM" for more
detailed information.

WHAT IS THE MARKET VALUE OF MY SHARES AS OF A RECENT DATE?

     On April 27, 2001, the last trading day before the commencement of this
offer, the common shares closed on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market at $5.61 per
share. On April 2, 2001, the last trading day before the public announcement of
our intention to purchase the shares, the shares closed on the Nasdaq SmallCap
Market at $3.69 per share. On April 3, 2001, the date of our announcement, the
shares closed at $5.06 per share. Please obtain a recent quotation for your
common shares prior to deciding whether or not to tender. See Section
6 -- "Price Range of Common Shares; Dividends on Common Shares" for more
detailed information.

WHAT ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER?

     The offer is conditioned upon, among other things:

     - shareholders validly tendering, and not withdrawing by the expiration
       date, at least 67% of the total number of outstanding common shares, on a
       fully diluted basis, which we call the minimum condition; and

     - our receipt of all financing necessary to fund all financial obligations
       arising in connection with the consummation of the offer, the merger and
       all other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

     In addition, we are not obligated to purchase shares that are validly
tendered if there is a material adverse change affecting the business of DTM.
Other than the minimum condition, we have reserved the right to waive any and
all conditions to the offer at our discretion. See Section 1 -- "Terms of the
Offer; Expiration Date; Extension of Tender Period; Termination; Amendment" and
Section 14 -- "Conditions to Our Obligations" for more detailed information.

HAVE ANY SHAREHOLDERS AGREED TO TENDER OR VOTE THEIR SHARES?

     Yes. We have entered into agreements with DTM's largest shareholder and
DTM's chief executive officer, who own in the aggregate approximately 44.9% of
the common shares outstanding, as of April 26, 2001, on a fully diluted basis.
These shareholders have agreed to tender in the offer all shares that they
currently own, as well as any shares they may subsequently acquire, and to vote
their shares in accordance with the terms of those agreements. See the
"Introduction" and Section 13 -- "The Merger Agreement, the Tender and Voting
Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Exclusivity Agreement" for
more detailed information.

IF SUFFICIENT SHARES TO SATISFY THE MINIMUM CONDITION ARE TENDERED AND ACCEPTED
FOR PAYMENT, WILL DTM CONTINUE AS A PUBLIC COMPANY?

     Yes. However, if and when the merger takes place, DTM will no longer be
publicly owned. It is likely that, following the purchase of shares pursuant to
the offer and prior to the merger, there may be so few remaining shareholders
and publicly held common shares that the common shares will no longer be
eligible to be traded on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market (or any other securities
exchange), there may not

be an active public trading market (or, possibly, any public trading market) for
the common shares, and DTM may cease making filings with the SEC and complying
with the SEC's rules relating to publicly held companies.

WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF
TENDERING MY SHARES?

     Your sale of shares pursuant to this offer is a taxable event for United
States federal income tax purposes and in all likelihood for state and local
income tax purposes. To the extent that the proceeds that you receive from the
sale of your shares pursuant to this offer exceed your basis in the shares sold,
you will realize a gain. If your basis in the shares sold exceeds the proceeds
you received pursuant to the sale, you will realize a loss. Because tax matters
are complicated, we encourage you to contact your tax advisor to determine the
particular tax consequences of our offer to you. See Section 5 -- "Material
United States Federal Income Tax Considerations" for more detailed information.

TO WHOM MAY I SPEAK IF I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OFFER?

     If you have any questions about the offer, you can call Georgeson
Shareholder Communications Inc., the information agent for the offer, at (800)
223-2064 (toll free) or A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., the dealer manager for the
offer, at (866) 235-5185 (toll free).

To the Holders of DTM Common Stock:

                                  INTRODUCTION

     We, Tiger Deals, Inc., a Delaware corporation, hereby offer to purchase all
the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.0002 per share, of DTM
Corporation, a Texas corporation, at a purchase price of $5.80 per share, net to
you, in cash, without interest, less any required withholding taxes, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this document and in the letter
of transmittal included with this document. We were formed for the purpose of
making this offer. We are wholly owned by 3D Systems, Inc., a California
corporation, and our ultimate parent is 3D Systems Corporation, a Delaware
corporation. If you hold your shares directly, you will not be obligated to pay
brokerage fees or commissions or, except as set forth in the letter of
transmittal, transfer taxes on the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer. If
you hold your shares through a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or other
nominee, you should check with that broker, dealer, bank, trust company or other
nominee as to whether they charge any service fees. We will pay all charges and
expenses of U.S. Stock Transfer Corporation (which is acting as the depositary
for the offer), Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. (which is acting as
the information agent for the offer) and A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc. (which is
acting as the dealer manager for the offer). See Section 16 -- "Fees and
Expenses" for more detailed information.

     3D Systems, Inc., together with its other direct and indirect subsidiaries,
develops and manufactures solid imaging systems that it markets to a worldwide
customer base. Solid imaging systems are designed to rapidly produce
three-dimensional physical objects from digital data using computer aided design
and manufacturing software utilities and related computer applications. 3D
Systems, Inc. is also sometimes referred to in this document as "3D California."
Unless the context indicates otherwise, we will use the terms "3D Systems,"
"we," "us" and "our" to refer to 3D Systems Corporation and all of its direct
and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries.

     The offer is being made pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of April 2, 2001, by and among 3D Systems Corporation, Tiger Deals and DTM.
The merger agreement provides, among other things, for the making of the offer
and that, following the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer and as soon as
practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions set forth
in the merger agreement, Tiger Deals will be merged with and into DTM.

     Consummation of the merger also is subject to a number of conditions,
including approval by DTM's shareholders and the purchase of shares pursuant to
this offer. If we acquire at least 90% of the outstanding shares of common
stock, we will be able to, and we intend to, effect the merger pursuant to the
"short-form" merger provisions of Texas law, without prior notice to, or any
action by, any other shareholder of DTM. If we acquire at least 67% of the
outstanding shares of common stock, we will have sufficient voting power to
effect the merger without the affirmative vote of any other shareholder of DTM.
See Section 12 -- "Purpose of the Offer and the Merger; Plans for DTM" for more
detailed information.

     The board of directors of DTM has unanimously approved the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the offer,
the merger, and the tender and voting agreements (described below) and
unanimously determined that the terms of the offer, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and fair to you
and in your best interests and are fair and in the best interests of DTM. DTM's
board of directors unanimously recommends that you accept the offer and tender
your shares of DTM common stock pursuant to the offer. The factors considered by
DTM's board of directors in arriving at its decision to approve the merger
agreement, the offer, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement and to recommend that you accept the offer and tender your
shares of DTM common stock pursuant to the offer are described in DTM's
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which has been filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is being mailed to you with this
document. See Section 11 -- "Background of the Offer; Past Contacts,
Transactions or Negotiations with DTM" and Section 12 -- "Purpose of the Offer
and the Merger; Plans for DTM" for more detailed information. Following
consummation of the merger, DTM will continue as the surviving corporation and
will be a

wholly-owned subsidiary of 3D Systems, Inc. At the effective time of the merger,
each share of DTM common stock that is issued and outstanding (other than shares
of DTM common stock held by DTM in treasury, or shares held by us, which shall
be cancelled, and shares held by shareholders who have properly exercised
appraisal rights under Texas law) will be converted into the right to receive
$5.80 in cash, or any higher price that may be paid per share for the DTM common
stock pursuant to the offer (less any required withholding taxes), upon
surrender of the DTM common stock certificate. See Section 13 -- "The Merger
Agreement, the Tender and Voting Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement and
the Exclusivity Agreement" for more detailed information.

     The offer is conditioned upon, among other things:

     - there being validly tendered by the expiration date and not withdrawn at
       least that number of common shares which would constitute 67% of the
       total number of outstanding common shares on a fully diluted basis on the
       date of purchase, which we call the "minimum condition;" and

     - receipt by 3D Systems of all financing necessary to fund all financial
       obligations arising in connection with the offer, the merger and all
       other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

     Hoak Breedlove Wesneski & Co. has acted as DTM's financial advisor in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. DTM has
represented to us in the merger agreement that its board of directors has
received the opinion of Hoak Breedlove Wesneski & Co. to the effect that, as of
the date of the merger agreement, the consideration to be received by the
holders of DTM common stock was fair from a financial point of view to those
holders. A copy of that opinion is filed as an exhibit to the
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement, and we urge you to read the
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement and that opinion carefully in their
entirety.

     The merger agreement provides that effective upon our purchase of at least
67% of the total number of outstanding common shares on a fully diluted basis,
we will be entitled to designate up to that number of DTM directors, rounded up
to the next whole number, as will make the percentage of the DTM directors
designated by us equal to the percentage of outstanding shares of DTM common
stock held by us. Nevertheless, prior to the effective time of the merger, DTM
will have on its board of directors at least two directors who were directors of
DTM on April 2, 2001 (the date of the merger agreement) and who are not officers
of DTM or affiliates of us. See Section 13 -- "The Merger Agreement, the Tender
and Voting Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Exclusivity
Agreement" for more detailed information.

     DTM has advised us that as of April 26, 2001, its authorized capital stock
consists of:

     - 60,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0002 per share, of which
       7,127,397 shares were issued and outstanding;

     - 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which
       no shares were issued and outstanding; and

     - 977,493 shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of
       outstanding options.

     As an inducement to us to enter into the merger agreement, John S.
Murchison, III, DTM's Chief Executive Officer and President, and DTM Acquisition
Company, L.P., each entered into a tender and voting agreement, dated as of
April 2, 2001. DTM Acquisition Company and Mr. Murchison collectively
beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 3,513,357 outstanding common
shares (representing approximately 44.9% of the common shares outstanding as of
April 26, 2001, on a fully diluted basis). Mr. Murchison owns stock options
exercisable into 235,028 shares of DTM common stock. If and when Mr. Murchison
exercises his stock options, these shares of DTM common stock will be subject to
the

tender and voting agreement. Under these agreements, these shareholders have
agreed, among other matters, to:

     - validly tender in the offer (and not withdraw) all of their shares of DTM
       common stock now owned at the date of the tender and voting agreements or
       which may thereafter be acquired by them;

     - appoint 3D Systems as their proxy to vote their shares in connection with
       the merger agreement; and

     - with respect to certain matters presented to the shareholders of DTM for
       a vote (including approval of the merger agreement), vote their shares in
       each case, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender and
       voting agreement.

     At the date of this document, we did not beneficially own any securities of
DTM (other than as provided in the tender and voting agreements). Assuming that
no shares of DTM common stock are issued after April 26, 2001, there would be
7,819,915 shares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis and the
minimum condition would be satisfied if at least 5,239,343 shares of common
stock are validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration date. The
actual number of shares of common stock required to be tendered to satisfy the
minimum condition will depend on the actual number of shares of common stock
outstanding on a fully diluted basis on the date we accept shares of common
stock for payment pursuant to the offer. If the minimum condition is satisfied
and we accept for payment shares of common stock tendered pursuant to the offer,
we will be able to elect at least 67% of the members of the board of directors
of DTM and to effect the merger without the affirmative vote of any other
shareholder of DTM. See Section 12 -- "Purpose of the Offer and the Merger;
Plans for DTM" for more detailed information.

     The information concerning DTM contained in this document has been provided
by DTM or has been taken from publicly available documents and records on file
with the SEC and other public sources. We do not assume any responsibility for
the accuracy or completeness of the information concerning DTM contained in this
document, or in any other document or record, or for any failure by DTM to
disclose events which may have occurred or may affect the significance or
accuracy of any of that information but which are unknown to us.

     THE OFFER DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION OF PROXIES FOR ANY MEETING OF
SHAREHOLDERS OF DTM. ANY SUCH SOLICITATION WILL BE MADE ONLY PURSUANT TO
SEPARATE PROXY MATERIALS PURSUANT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE
ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, WHICH WE CALL THE "EXCHANGE ACT."

     THIS DOCUMENT AND THE RELATED LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL CONTAIN IMPORTANT
INFORMATION. YOU SHOULD READ BOTH DOCUMENTS CAREFULLY IN THEIR ENTIRETY BEFORE
YOU MAKE A DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE OFFER.

                                   THE OFFER

1. TERMS OF THE OFFER; EXPIRATION DATE; EXTENSION OF TENDER PERIOD; TERMINATION;
AMENDMENT.

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer (including, if
the offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any extension or
amendment), we will accept for payment and pay for all shares validly tendered
prior to the expiration date and not properly withdrawn in accordance with
Section 3 -- "Withdrawal Rights." The term "expiration date" means 12:00
midnight, New York City time, on Tuesday, May 29, 2001, unless we extend the
period of time for which the offer is open, in which event the term "expiration
date" will mean the latest time and date at which the offer, as so extended by
us, expires.

     In the merger agreement, we agreed that we will not, without the prior
written consent of DTM:

     - decrease the offer price;

     - change the form of consideration to be paid pursuant to the offer;

     - reduce the maximum number of shares to be purchased in the offer;

     - impose conditions to the offer in addition to those set forth in Section
       14 -- "Conditions to Our Obligations;"

     - extend the offer, except as provided below;

     - amend any other term of the offer in any manner adverse to you; or

     - amend or waive the minimum condition.

     However, the merger agreement also provides that, without the consent of
DTM, we may:

     - extend the offer if at the scheduled expiration date of the offer any of
       the offer conditions are not satisfied, until that time when those
       conditions are satisfied or waived;

     - extend the offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
       interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff applicable to the
       offer or for any period required by applicable law; and

     - make available a subsequent offering period as provided for under the
       Exchange Act.

     In addition, we have agreed to extend the offer from time to time until
June 29, 2001 if the offer conditions are not satisfied or waived at the
scheduled expiration date or any extension thereof. However, we are not required
to extend the offer under this agreement unless, in our reasonable judgement:

     - each condition that is not then satisfied or waived is reasonably capable
       of being satisfied;

     - DTM is in material compliance with all of its covenants in the merger
       agreement; and

     - the failure of a condition to be satisfied does not result from a breach
       by DTM of any of its covenants and agreements contained in the merger
       agreement.

     Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, including the restrictions
described above, and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, we reserve
the right (but are not obligated, except as described in this Section 1), at any
time and from time to time, and regardless of whether or not any of the events
or facts set forth in Section 14 shall have occurred:

     - to elect to provide a subsequent offering period for the offer in
       accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act; and

     - to amend the offer in any other respect, although in certain
       circumstances an amendment may require the prior written consent of DTM.

     Under no circumstances will interest be paid on the purchase price for
tendered shares of common stock, regardless of any extension of or amendment to
the offer.

     If by 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Tuesday, May 29, 2001 (or any
date or time then set as the expiration date), any or all of the conditions to
the offer have not been satisfied or waived, we reserve the right (but are not
obligated except as described in this Section 1), subject to the terms and
conditions contained in the merger agreement and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC:

     - to terminate the offer and not accept for payment or pay for any shares
       of DTM common stock and return all tendered shares to tendering
       shareholders;

     - except as set forth above with respect to the minimum condition, to waive
       all the unsatisfied conditions and accept for payment and pay for all
       shares of DTM common stock validly tendered prior to the expiration date
       and not withdrawn;

     - to extend the offer and, subject to the right of the shareholders to
       withdraw shares until the expiration date, retain the shares that have
       been tendered during the period or periods for which the offer is
       extended; or

     - except as set forth above, to amend the offer.

     Any extension, waiver, amendment or termination will be followed as
promptly as practicable by a public announcement. In the case of an extension,
Rule 14e-1(d) under the Exchange Act requires that the announcement be issued no
later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the
previously scheduled expiration date in accordance with the public announcement
requirements of Rule 14d-4(d) under the Exchange Act. Subject to applicable law,
including Rules 14d-4(d) and 14d-6(c) under the Exchange Act (which require that
any material change in the information published, sent or given to you in
connection with the offer be promptly disseminated to you in a manner reasonably
designed to inform you of those changes), and without limiting the manner in
which we may choose to make any public announcement, we currently intend to make
announcements by issuing a press release to the Dow Jones News Service and
making any appropriate filing with the SEC. As used in this document, "business
day" means any day, other than Saturday, Sunday or a federal holiday, and shall
consist of the time period from 12:01 a.m. through 12:00 midnight, New York City
time.

     If we make a material change in the terms of the offer or the information
concerning the offer or waive a material condition to the offer, we will
disseminate additional tender offer materials, including by public announcement
as set forth above, and extend the offer to the extent required by Rules
14d-4(d), 14d-6(c) and 14e-1 under the Exchange Act. These rules generally
provide that the minimum period during which a tender offer must remain open
following a material change in the terms of the offer or information concerning
the offer, other than a change in price or a change in percentage of securities
sought, will depend upon the facts and circumstances, including the relative
materiality of the changes in the terms or information. In the SEC's view, an
offer should remain open for a minimum of five business days from the date a
material change is first published, sent or given to security holders, and, if
material changes are made with respect to information that approaches the
significance of price and the percentage of securities sought, a minimum of ten
business days may be required to allow for adequate dissemination and investor
response. With respect to a change in price or a change in the percentage of
securities sought, a minimum of ten business days generally is required to allow
for adequate dissemination to shareholders and for investor response.

     Pursuant to the merger agreement and Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act we
may elect to make available a "subsequent offering period" by extending the
offer from three to 20 business days in length following the expiration date. A
subsequent offering period would be an additional period of time following the
expiration of the offer and the purchase of shares of common stock in the offer,
during which you may tender shares not tendered in the offer. A subsequent
offering period, if one is provided, is not an extension of the offer, which
already will have been completed. A subsequent offering period may be provided
regardless of whether the events or the facts set forth in Section
14 -- "Conditions to Our Obligations" have occurred. We currently do not intend
to provide for a subsequent offering period.

     During a subsequent offering period, you will not have withdrawal rights,
and we will promptly purchase and pay for any shares of common stock tendered at
the same price paid in the offer. Rule 14d-11 provides that we may provide a
subsequent offering period so long as, among other things:

     - the initial 20 business day period of the offer has expired;

     - we offer the same form and amount of consideration for shares of common
       stock in the subsequent offering period as in the initial offer;

     - we accept and promptly pay for all securities tendered during the offer;

     - we announce the results of the offer, including the approximate number
       and percentage of shares deposited in the offer, no later than 9:00 a.m.
       New York City time on the next business day after the expiration date and
       immediately begin the subsequent offering period; and

     - we immediately accept and promptly pay for shares as they are tendered
       during the subsequent offering period.

     DTM has provided us with a list of its shareholders and security position
listings for the purpose of disseminating the offer to holders of DTM common
stock. This document and the related letter of transmittal will be mailed to
record holders of shares whose names appear on DTM's shareholder list and will
be furnished to brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies and similar
persons whose names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on the shareholder
list or, if applicable, who are listed as participants in a clearing agency's
security position listing for subsequent transmittal to beneficial owners of
shares. The Solicitation/Recommendation Statement also will be included with
those materials.

2. PROCEDURE FOR TENDERING SHARES.

     Valid Tenders.  For shares to be validly tendered pursuant to the offer,
(i) the depositary must receive at the address set forth on the back cover of
this document prior to the expiration date a properly completed and duly
executed letter of transmittal (or a manually signed facsimile copy of it), with
any required signature guarantees and certificates representing tendered shares
or in the case of a book-entry transfer, an agent's message, and any other
documents required by the letter of transmittal and the tendered shares must be
delivered pursuant to the procedures for book-entry transfer set forth below
(and a book-entry confirmation, as defined below, received by the depositary) or
(ii) the tendering shareholder must comply with the guaranteed delivery
procedures set forth below. No alternative, conditional or contingent tenders
will be accepted.

     The depositary will establish an account with respect to the common shares
at The Depositary Trust Company, which we refer to as "DTC," for purposes of the
offer within two business days after the date of this document. DTC is an
electronic clearinghouse used by banks and broker-dealers to settle trades among
members of DTC. Any financial institution that is a participant in DTC's system
may make book-entry delivery of common shares by causing DTC to transfer those
common shares into the depositary's account at DTC in accordance with DTC's
procedures for transfer. Although delivery of common shares may be effected
through book-entry transfer into the depositary's account at DTC prior to the
expiration date, the letter of transmittal (or a manually signed facsimile
thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with any required signature
guarantees, or an agent's message in connection with a book-entry transfer, and
any other documents required by the letter of transmittal, must, in any case, be
transmitted to and received by the depositary at the address set forth on the
back cover of this document or the tendering shareholder must comply with the
guaranteed delivery procedures described below. The confirmation of a book-entry
transfer of shares of common stock into the depositary's account at DTC as
described above is referred to herein as a "book-entry confirmation." Delivery
of documents to DTC in accordance with DTC's procedures does not constitute
delivery to the depositary.

     The term "agent's message" means a message transmitted by DTC to, and
received by, the depositary and forming a part of a book-entry confirmation,
which states that DTC has received an express acknowledgement from the
participant in DTC tendering the shares that are subject to the book-entry

confirmation, that the participant has received and agrees to be bound by the
terms of the letter of transmittal and that we may enforce that agreement
against the participant.

     THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF SHARE CERTIFICATES, THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND
ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH DTC, IS AT YOUR OPTION
AND RISK. DELIVERY WILL BE DEEMED MADE ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE
DEPOSITARY (INCLUDING, IN THE CASE OF A BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER, A BOOK-ENTRY
CONFIRMATION). IF DELIVERY IS BY MAIL, CERTIFIED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT
REQUESTED AND PROPERLY INSURED, IS RECOMMENDED. IN ALL CASES, SUFFICIENT TIME
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY.

     Signature Guarantee. No signature guarantee is required on the letter of
transmittal if:

     - the letter of transmittal is signed by the registered holder (this term,
       for purposes of this Section 2, includes any participant in DTC's systems
       whose name appears on a security position listing as the owner of the
       shares) of the shares tendered and that registered holder has not
       completed either the box entitled "Special Payment Instructions" or the
       box entitled "Special Delivery Instructions" on the letter of
       transmittal; or

     - the shares are tendered for the account of a financial institution
       (including most commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
       brokerage houses) that is a participant in the Security Transfer Agent's
       Medallion Program, the New York Stock Exchange Medallion Signature
       Guarantee Program or the Stock Exchange Medallion Program (we refer to
       each of these financial institutions as an "eligible institution" and
       together as "eligible institutions").

     In all other cases, all signatures on letters of transmittal must be
guaranteed by an eligible institution. See Instructions 1 and 5 to the letter of
transmittal. If the certificates evidencing shares to be tendered are registered
in the name of a person or persons other than the signer of the letter of
transmittal, or if payment is to be made, or delivered to, or certificates for
unpurchased shares are to be issued or returned to, a person other than the
registered owner or owners of the tendered shares, then the tendered
certificates must be endorsed or accompanied by duly executed stock powers, in
either case signed exactly as the name or names of the registered owner or
owners appear on the certificates, with the signatures on the certificates or
stock powers guaranteed by an eligible institution as provided in the letter of
transmittal. See Instructions 1 and 5 to the letter of transmittal.

     Guaranteed Delivery. If you wish to tender shares pursuant to the offer and
your certificates for shares are not immediately available or time will not
permit all required documents to reach the depositary prior to the expiration
date or the procedure for book-entry transfer cannot be completed on a timely
basis, you may nevertheless effectively tender shares if you comply with all of
the following guaranteed delivery procedures:

     - the tender is made by or through an eligible institution;

     - a properly completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery,
       substantially in the form provided to you, is received by the depositary,
       as provided below, prior to the expiration date; and

     - the certificates for (or a book-entry confirmation with respect to) all
       tendered shares, together with a properly completed and duly executed
       letter of transmittal (or a manually signed facsimile of it), and any
       required signature guarantees, or, in the case of a book-entry transfer
       of common shares, an agent's message, and any other documents required by
       the letter of transmittal, are received by the depositary within three
       trading days after the date of execution of the Notice of Guaranteed
       Delivery. As used in this document, "trading day" means any day on which
       the Nasdaq SmallCap Market is open for business.

     The Notice of Guaranteed Delivery may be delivered by hand or transmitted
by facsimile transmission or mail to the depositary and must include a guarantee
by an eligible institution in the form set forth in the Notice of Guaranteed
Delivery.

     A tender of shares pursuant to any one of the procedures described above
will constitute your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the offer, as
well as your representation and warranty that:

     - you have the full power and authority to tender, sell, assign and
       transfer the tendered shares (and any and all other shares or other
       securities issued or issuable in respect of those shares); and

     - when we accept the shares for payment we will acquire good and
       unencumbered title, free and clear of all liens, restrictions, charges
       and encumbrances and not subject to any adverse claims.

Our acceptance for payment of your shares tendered pursuant to the offer will
constitute a binding agreement between us upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the offer.

     Appointment. By executing the letter of transmittal as set forth above
(including through delivery of an agent's message), you will irrevocably appoint
our designees as your attorneys-in-fact and proxies in the manner set forth in
the letter of transmittal, each with full power of substitution, to the full
extent of your rights with respect to the shares you tendered and we accepted
for payment (including all rights, other shares or other securities issued or
issuable in respect of those shares). These powers of attorney and proxies will
be considered irrevocable and coupled with an interest in the tendered shares.
This appointment is effective when, and only to the extent that, we accept for
payment the shares you tendered as provided in the offer. Upon this appointment,
all prior powers of attorney and proxies granted by you with respect to the
shares or other securities or rights will, without further action, be revoked
and no subsequent powers of attorney or proxies may be given or written consent
executed (and, if given or executed, will not be deemed effective). Our
designees will, with respect to the shares and other securities or rights for
which the appointment is effective, be empowered to exercise all your voting and
other rights as they in their sole judgment deem proper in respect of any
annual, special, adjourned or postponed meeting of DTM's shareholders or actions
by written consent in lieu of a meeting or otherwise. We reserve the right to
require that, in order for shares to be deemed validly tendered, immediately
upon our payment for those shares, we must be able to exercise full voting,
consent and other rights with respect to those shares and the other securities
or rights issued or issuable in respect of those shares, including voting those
shares at any meeting of shareholders.

     Determination of Validity. We will determine, in our sole discretion, all
questions as to the form of documents and the validity, form, eligibility
(including time of receipt) and acceptance for payment of any tender of shares
and our determination will be final and binding on all parties. We reserve the
absolute right to reject any or all tenders of any shares that we determine not
to be in proper form or the acceptance for payment of which may, in our opinion,
be unlawful. We also reserve the absolute right, subject to the limitations set
forth in the merger agreement and applicable law, to waive any of the conditions
of the offer, or any defect or irregularity in the tender of any shares of any
particular shareholder, whether or not similar defects or irregularities are
waived in the case of other shareholders. No tender of shares will be deemed to
have been validly made until all defects and irregularities have been cured or
waived. Neither we, the depositary, the dealer manager, the information agent
nor any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects
or irregularities in tenders or incur any liability for failure to give any
notification. Our interpretation of the terms and conditions of the offer
(including the Letter of Transmittal and the Instructions to the Letter of
Transmittal) will be final and binding on all parties.

     Backup Federal Income Tax Withholding.  Under the "backup withholding"
provisions of U.S. federal income tax law, unless you or your assignee, which we
refer to in either case as the "payee," satisfy the conditions described in
Instruction 9 of the Letter of Transmittal or are otherwise exempt, any cash
payable to you as a result of the purchase of your shares may be subject to
backup withholding tax of 31% of the gross proceeds. To prevent backup
withholding, each payee should complete and sign the Substitute Form W-9
provided in the letter of transmittal. Foreign holders must submit a completed
Form W-8 to avoid backup withholding. This form may be obtained from the
depositary. See Instructions 8 and 9 set forth in the letter of transmittal and
Section 5 -- "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations."

3. WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS.

     Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3, tenders of shares made
pursuant to the offer are irrevocable. You may withdraw shares previously
tendered pursuant to the offer by procedures set forth below at any time prior
to the expiration date and, unless already accepted for payment and paid by us
pursuant to the offer, a shareholder also may withdraw previously tendered
shares at any time after June 29, 2001.

     To withdraw shares tendered pursuant to the offer, a written telegraphic,
telex or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal must be timely received by
the depositary at the address set forth on the back cover of this document and
must specify:

     - the name of the person who tendered the shares to be withdrawn;

     - the number of shares to be withdrawn; and

     - the name of the registered holder(s), if different from the name of the
       person who tendered the shares.

If certificates for shares to be withdrawn have been delivered or otherwise
identified to the depositary, then, prior to the physical release of those
certificates, you must submit the serial numbers shown on the particular
certificates to be withdrawn to the depositary and, unless the shares have been
tendered by an eligible institution, the signatures on the notice of withdrawal
must be guaranteed by an eligible institution. If shares have been tendered
pursuant to the procedures for book-entry transfer set forth in Section 2 --
"Procedure for Tendering Shares," any notice of withdrawal must also specify the
name and number of the account at DTC to be credited with the withdrawn shares
and must otherwise comply with DTC's procedures. You may not rescind a
withdrawal of tendered shares, and any shares that you properly withdraw will
thereafter be deemed not validly tendered for purposes of the offer. You may
re-tender withdrawn shares by again following one of the procedures described in
Section 2 -- "Procedure for Tendering Shares" at any time prior to the
expiration date.

     We will resolve, in our sole discretion, all questions as to the form and
validity (including time of receipt) of notices of withdrawal, and our
resolution will be final and binding on all parties. We reserve the absolute
right to waive any defect or irregularity in the withdrawal of shares by any
shareholder, whether or not similar defects or irregularities are waived in the
case of any other shareholder. No person, including us, the depositary, the
dealer manager, the information agent or any other person will be under any duty
to give notification of any defects or irregularities in any notice of
withdrawal or incur any liability for failure to give any notification.

     If we provide a subsequent offering period following the offer under Rule
14d-11 under the Exchange Act, no withdrawal rights will apply to shares
tendered during the subsequent offering period or to shares previously tendered
in the offer and accepted for payment.

4. ACCEPTANCE FOR PAYMENT AND PAYMENT FOR SHARES.

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer, including any
amended or extended offer, we will accept for payment and will pay for all
shares validly tendered prior to the expiration date and not withdrawn in
accordance with Section 3 -- "Withdrawal Rights" promptly after the expiration
date. We expressly reserve the right to delay payment for shares in order to
comply in whole or in part with any applicable law. See Section 1 -- "Terms of
the Offer; Expiration Date; Extension of Tender Period; Termination; Amendment"
and Section 15 -- "Legal Matters" for more detailed information. Any delay will
be effected in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (which
relates to our obligation to pay for or return tendered securities promptly
after the termination or withdrawal of our offer).

     In all cases, we will pay for shares tendered and accepted for payment
pursuant to the offer only after timely receipt by the depositary of:

     - certificates for (or a timely book-entry confirmation with respect to)
       the shares;

     - a properly completed and duly executed or a manually signed facsimile
       letter of transmittal with all required signature guarantees or, in the
       case of a book-entry transfer of common shares, an agent's message; and

     - any other documents required by the letter of transmittal.

Accordingly, tendering shareholders may be paid at different times depending on
when the depositary actually receives certificates for shares of DTM common
stock or book-entry confirmations with respect to shares of DTM common stock.

     For purposes of the offer, we will be deemed to have accepted for payment,
and thereby to have purchased, shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as, if
and when we give oral or written notice to the depositary of our acceptance of
those shares for payment. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the
offer, we will pay for shares accepted pursuant to the offer by depositing the
purchase price for all accepted shares of DTM stock with the depositary. The
depositary will act as your agent for the purpose of receiving payment from us
and transmitting payments to you when your shares have been accepted for
payment. If, for any reason whatsoever, acceptance for payment of any shares
tendered pursuant to the offer is delayed, or we are unable to accept for
payment shares tendered pursuant to the offer, then, without prejudice to our
rights under Section 1 -- "Terms of the Offer; Expiration Date; Extension of
Tender Period; Termination; Amendment," the depositary may, on our behalf,
retain tendered shares, and those shares may not be withdrawn, except to the
extent that the tendering shareholders are entitled to withdrawal rights as
described in Section 3 -- "Withdrawal Rights" and as otherwise required by Rule
14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act. Under no circumstances will we pay interest on
the purchase price for tendered shares because of any delay in making any
payment.

     If any tendered shares are not accepted for payment pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the offer for any reason, or if certificates are submitted for
more shares than are tendered, certificates for those unpurchased or untendered
shares will be returned, without expense, to the tendering shareholder (or, in
the case of tenders through DTC, those shares of DTM common stock will be
credited to the participant account with DTC from which those shares were
tendered), as promptly as practicable after the expiration, termination or
withdrawal of the offer.

     If, prior to the expiration date, we increase the price being paid for
shares accepted for payment pursuant to the offer, we will pay the increased
consideration for all shares purchased pursuant to the offer, whether or not
those shares were tendered prior to the increase in consideration.

     We reserve the right to transfer or assign, in whole or from time to time
in part, to one or more of our affiliates, the right to purchase all or any
portion of the shares tendered pursuant to the offer, but any transfer or
assignment will not relieve us of our obligations under the offer and will in no
way prejudice your rights to receive payment for shares validly tendered and
accepted for payment pursuant to the offer.

5. MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS.

     The following is a summary of material United States federal income tax
considerations of the offer and merger to holders whose shares are purchased
pursuant to the offer or whose shares are converted into the right to receive
cash in the merger (including pursuant to the exercise of appraisal rights).
This discussion is included for general information purposes only and does not
purport to consider all aspects of United States federal income taxation that
may be relevant to you. The discussion is based on current provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, existing, proposed and temporary regulations
promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof,
all of which are subject to change. The discussion applies only to holders of
shares of DTM common stock in whose hands shares are capital assets within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code, and may not apply to

shares received pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise
as compensation, or to certain types of holders of shares (such as insurance
companies, tax-exempt organizations and broker-dealers) who may be subject to
special rules under the United States federal income tax laws. This discussion
does not discuss the United States federal income tax consequences to a holder
of shares who, for United States federal income tax purposes, is a non-resident
alien individual, a foreign corporation, a foreign partnership or a foreign
estate or trust, nor does it consider the effect of any foreign, state or local
tax laws.

     Because individual circumstances may differ, you should consult your own
tax advisor to determine whether the rules discussed below are applicable to you
and the particular tax effects to you of the offer and the merger, including the
application and effect of state, local and other income tax laws.

     The receipt of cash for tendered shares pursuant to the offer or the merger
will be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes. In
general, for United States federal income tax purposes, you will recognize gain
or loss equal to the difference between (i) your adjusted tax basis in the
shares sold pursuant to the offer or converted to cash in the merger and (ii)
the amount of cash received. Gain or loss must be determined separately for each
block of shares (that is, shares acquired at the same cost in a single
transaction) sold pursuant to the offer or converted to cash in the merger. That
gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss. If you are not a corporation, any
capital gain will be a long-term capital gain taxable at a maximum rate of 20%
if your shares have been held for more than one year on the date of sale (in the
case of the offer) or the effective time of the merger (in the case of the
merger); and a short-term capital gain taxable at ordinary income rates if the
shares have been held for one year or less on the date of sale (or the effective
time of the merger).

     If you tender shares, you may be subject to 31% backup withholding unless
you provide your taxpayer identification number, or TIN, and certify that the
TIN is correct or properly certify that you are awaiting a TIN, or unless an
exemption applies. Exemptions are available for shareholders that are
corporations and for certain foreign individuals and entities. If you do not
furnish a required TIN, you may be subject to a penalty imposed by the Internal
Revenue Code. See Section 2 -- "Procedure for Tendering Shares."

     If backup withholding applies to you, the depositary is required to
withhold 31% from amounts otherwise payable to you. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. Rather, the amount of the backup withholding can be credited
against the United States federal income tax liability of the person subject to
the backup withholding, provided that the required information is given to the
Internal Revenue Service. If backup withholding results in an overpayment of
tax, you can obtain a refund by filing a United States federal income tax
return.

as reported on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market was $3.69. On April 27, 2001, the last
full trading day prior to the date of this document, the last reported closing
sales price per share of DTM common stock as reported on the Nasdaq SmallCap
Market was $5.61. WE URGE YOU TO OBTAIN A CURRENT MARKET QUOTATION FOR YOUR
COMMON STOCK.

7. EFFECTS OF THE TRANSACTION.

     Market for Common Shares.  Our purchase of the common shares pursuant to
the offer will reduce the number of shares of DTM common stock that might
otherwise trade publicly and will reduce the number of holders of DTM common
stock. This could adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the
remaining common shares held by shareholders other than us.

     Nasdaq Listing.  The shares of DTM common stock are listed on the Nasdaq
SmallCap Market. Depending upon the aggregate market value and the per share
price of any shares not purchased pursuant to the offer, the DTM common stock
may no longer meet the requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq SmallCap
Market. According to Nasdaq's published guidelines, Nasdaq would consider
delisting the shares of DTM common stock if, among other things, the number of
round lot holders of shares of DTM common stock falls below 300, the number of
publicly held shares of DTM common stock (exclusive of holdings of officers and
directors of DTM and their immediate families and other concentrated holdings of
10% or more) fall below 500,000, the amount of DTM's net tangible assets falls
below $2.0 million or the aggregate market value of the publicly held shares of
DTM common stock falls below $1.0 million.

     If Nasdaq delists the shares of DTM common stock, the market for the DTM
common stock could be adversely affected. It is possible that the shares of DTM
common stock would continue to trade in the over-the-counter market, and that
price quotations would be reported by other sources. The extent of the public
market for the DTM common stock and the availability of those quotations would,
however, depend upon the number of shareholders and/or the aggregate market
value of the shares remaining at that time, the interest in maintaining a market
in those shares on the part of securities firms, the possible termination of
registration of those shares under the Exchange Act and other factors. If, as a
result of the purchase of the shares pursuant to the offer, the shares no longer
meet Nasdaq's requirements for continued inclusion

in Nasdaq and the shares are no longer included in Nasdaq, the market for, and
value of the shares could be adversely affected.

     Exchange Act Registration. DTM common stock is currently registered under
the Exchange Act. Registration under the Exchange Act may be terminated upon
application by DTM to the SEC if the shares of DTM common stock are neither
listed on a national securities exchange nor held by 300 or more holders of
record. We intend to cause DTM to apply for termination of registration as soon
as practicable after consummation of the offer and the requirements for
termination of registration of the common shares are met. If registration were
terminated:

     - DTM would no longer legally be required to disclose publicly in proxy
       materials distributed to shareholders the information which it now must
       provide under the Exchange Act;

     - DTM would no longer legally be required to make public disclosure of
       financial and other information in annual, quarterly and other reports
       required to be filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act;

     - the requirements of Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act with respect to
       going private transactions would no longer apply to DTM; and

     - the officers, directors and 10% shareholders of DTM would no longer be
       subject to the "short-swing" insider trading reporting and profit
       recovery provisions of the Exchange Act.

Furthermore, if DTM's registration were terminated, persons holding "restricted
securities" of DTM may be deprived of their ability to dispose of those
securities under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended.

     If registration of DTM common stock is not terminated prior to the merger,
then it will be delisted from the Nasdaq SmallCap Market and its registration
under the Exchange Act will be terminated following the consummation of the
merger.

     The name, citizenship, business address, present principal occupation or
employment and five-year employment history of each of our directors and
executive officers are set forth in Schedule I hereto.

     Our audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31,
1999 and December 31, 2000 are incorporated herein by reference and may be found
on pages F-1 to F-30 on our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000,
filed with the SEC on March 16, 2001. This information may be inspected or
copies obtained from the SEC in the same manner as is described in Section 8 --
"Information Concerning DTM." 3D Systems Corporation's book value per share on
December 31, 2000 was $6.06 and ratio of earnings to fixed charges on December
31, 2000 was 20:1, based upon fixed charges for the year equal to interest
expense of $180,000 and an estimated interest within rental expense of 25% of
$1,900,000. 3D Systems Corporation had a loss for the year ended December 31,
1999 and therefore the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not meaningful.

     During the last five years, neither we, nor, to the best of our knowledge,
any of the persons listed in Schedule I to this document:

       ownership over all shares of DTM common stock beneficially owned by each
       of DTM Acquisition Company, L.P. and Mr. John S. Murchison, III. See
       Section 13 -- "The Merger Agreement and the Tender and Voting Agreements"
       for more detailed information. Neither we, nor, to the best of our
       knowledge, any of the persons listed on Schedule I to this document, has
       any other contract, agreement or understanding with any other person with
       respect to any securities of DTM, including, but not limited to, any
       contract, agreement or understanding concerning the transfer or the
       voting of any securities of DTM, joint ventures, loan or option
       arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of loans, guarantees against loss
       or the giving or withholding of proxies, consents or authorizations;

       have met with officers and representatives of and exchanged information
       regarding DTM, and we have executed certain agreements with DTM. See
       Section 11 -- "Background of the Offer; Past Contacts, Transactions or
       Negotiations with DTM" for more detailed information.

           - Neither we, nor, to the best of our knowledge, any of the persons
             listed on Schedule I to this document, has had, within the past two
             years, any other business relationships or transactions with DTM or
             any of its executive officers, directors or affiliates that would
             require reporting under the rules and regulations of the SEC
             applicable to this document;

           - Within the past two years, there have been no other contacts,
             negotiations or transactions between us or, to the best of our
             knowledge, any of the persons listed on Schedule I to this
             document, and DTM or its affiliates, concerning a merger,
             consolidation or acquisition, tender offer or other acquisition of
             securities, election of directors or a sale or other transfer of a
             material amount of assets; and

     - As a result of the tender and voting agreements, we have beneficial
       ownership over all of the shares of DTM common stock beneficially owned
       by each of DTM Acquisition Company, L.P. and Mr. John S. Murchison, III.
       See Section 13 -- "The Merger Agreement and the Tender and Voting
       Agreements" for more detailed information. Neither we nor, to the best of
       our knowledge, any of the persons listed on Schedule I to this document,
       beneficially owns or has any right to acquire any other shares or has
       effected any other transactions in the shares of DTM common stock during
       the past 60 days.

matters. These reports, proxy statements and other information are available for
inspection at the SEC, and copies can be obtained from the SEC in the same

Concerning DTM."

10. SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS.

     The offer is conditioned upon the receipt of all financing necessary to
fund our financial obligations arising from the offer, the merger and all the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. We estimate that the total
amount of funds required to consummate the offer and the merger, to pay for the
cancellation of employee stock options and to pay our related fees and expenses
will be approximately $48,000,000. We will obtain the necessary funds through
available cash on hand and through the two credit facilities described below.

     It is anticipated that the indebtedness incurred under the credit
facilities will be repaid from funds generated from our general business
operations and from other sources that may include proceeds from a private or
public sale of debt or equity securities. No final decision has been made
concerning the methods which we may employ to repay the indebtedness. We
currently have no other financing arrangements or alternative financing plans in
place in the event the credit facilities described below fall through. In such a
situation, we will seek alternative sources of financing.

     Credit Facilities.  Pursuant to a letter agreement dated April 24, 2001,
U.S. Bank N.A. has committed to make us loans consisting of a $26,500,000
revolving line of credit and a $15,000,000 commercial term loan, upon the terms
and conditions described in the letter agreement. The purpose of the credit
facilities is to assist us in our acquisition of DTM and thereafter to finance
our working capital and general corporate needs.

     The interest rate applicable to both credit facilities will be at our
option either: (1) the prime rate plus a margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.0%, or
(2) the 90 day reserve adjusted LIBOR, or London Inter-Bank Offer Rate, plus a
margin ranging from 2.0% to 2.75%. The margin for each rate will vary depending
upon our interest-bearing-debt-to-our earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization. The terms prime rate, LIBOR and
interest-bearing-debt will have the meanings customary for financings of this
type.

     The revolving credit facility will mature three years after the closing
date of the offer. The term loan will mature 66 months from the closing date of
the offer. For the revolving line of credit, interest will be payable monthly
and the principal will be due in full at maturity. For the term loan, only the
interest is

due during the first six months; thereafter, the balance of the loan will be
amortized over five years requiring quarterly principal payments equal to the
lesser of the outstanding principal balance or $750,000, plus interest. The term
loan is also subject to a debt recapture provision that requires 40% of our
"excess cash flow" to be applied toward principal reduction on an annual basis.

     The letter agreement provides that U.S. Bank will receive a first priority
security interest in our and DTM's accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and
general intangibles (including certain intellectual property assets). We will
also pledge the stock of DTM as collateral for the credit facilities. In
addition, we will provide U.S. Bank with customary and appropriate
representations and warranties and covenants (which will require us to meet
various financial ratios on a periodic basis).

     Funding of the above mentioned credit facilities will be subject to the
satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including but not limited to, the
closing of the offer, the bank's perfection of title in certain of our assets,
the receipt of third party permits and consents and such other matters as
customary or appropriate for a financing of this type.

     This summary of the letter agreement does not purport to be complete and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the letter agreement, which is
attached and which is incorporated herein by reference.

11. BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER; PAST CONTACTS, TRANSACTIONS OR NEGOTIATIONS WITH
DTM.

     In November 1999, Mr. G. Walter Loewenbaum II, our Chairman, and Mr.
Anthony Mariotti, a director of DTM, had a lunch meeting and discussed on a
preliminary basis, the possibility of 3D Systems and DTM entering into a
transaction. Following this meeting, Mr. Brian Service, our Chief Executive
Officer and President, had preliminary telephonic conversations with Mr.
Mariotti to further discuss the possibility of entering into a transaction. To
facilitate these discussions, on January 25, 2000, the parties entered into a
confidentiality agreement. On February 9, 2000, Mr. Service, Mr. Loewenbaum, Mr.
Charles Hull, our Chief Technology Officer and Mr. A. Sidney Alpert, our then
general counsel, held a preliminary meeting in Austin, Texas with John S.
Murchison, III, DTM's Chief Executive Officer and President, Geoffrey W.
Kreiger, DTM's Chief Financial Officer, Kevin McAlea, DTM's Vice President of
Marketing and Business Development and Mr. Mariotti, to discuss their mutual
interest in a potential business combination.

     On February 16, 2000, we held a regular board meeting at our principal
corporate offices in Valencia, California. During this meeting, Mr. Service, as
part of his regular strategic overview, provided the Board with information
concerning these preliminary discussions. No formal action relating to any
business combination was taken by the Board at this time.

     Throughout February and March 2000, informal discussions continued between
our representatives and those of DTM. During this period, we met with A.G.
Edwards & Sons, Inc. and discussed a possible combination with DTM. In addition,
3D Systems and DTM exchanged certain limited valuation analyses following which
we orally communicated a preliminary proposal to Mr. Mariotti to acquire all of
the outstanding securities of DTM. Mr. Mariotti informed us that DTM did not
accept our proposal. On May 2, 2000, we held a regular board meeting at which
Mr. Service updated the board of directors with respect to discussions with DTM
and informed the board of directors that in light of the differences in
valuation analyses and due to other business developments, discussions with DTM
had ceased.

     On May 10, 2000, we engaged A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc. to provide certain
financial advisory services in the event that we determined to pursue a business
combination. Thereafter, from time to time, A.G. Edwards advised us with respect
to possible acquisition candidates, including DTM.

     On February 22, 2001, Mr. Loewenbaum met with Mr. Mariotti in Austin, Texas
to again discuss potential strategic opportunities of a business combination of
the companies in light of certain changes in the business climate and DTM's
recent strong earnings performance and litigation proceedings between DTM and
EOS GmbH. At that time, EOS was threatening to cause us to become a party to
this litigation because EOS's lawsuit against DTM alleges that DTM has infringed
and continues to infringe certain U.S. patents licensed to EOS by us. On
February 23, 2001, Messrs. Loewenbaum, Service and

Mariotti met in Austin, Texas and continued discussions regarding a possible
combination. During these meetings, the parties discussed the current operations
of DTM, the structure of a proposed transaction and the potential synergies of a
combination.

     On February 28, 2001, we held a regular board meeting during which Mr.
Service summarized the discussions conducted with DTM and the structure of a
proposed acquisition. The Board authorized management to present a non-binding
offer letter to DTM to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of
DTM for $5.25 per share by means of a cash tender offer followed by a merger of
DTM and a newly-formed subsidiary. That same day, we submitted to DTM a
non-binding offer letter to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common
stock of DTM for $5.25 per share, subject to, among other conditions,
satisfactory conclusion of due diligence, a 30-day exclusivity period and an
agreement from certain key shareholders to tender their shares and support the
proposed transaction.

     On March 12, 2001, Hoak Breedlove Wesneski & Co., DTM's financial advisor,
contacted A.G. Edwards and indicated that the special committee had reviewed our
non-binding offer letter dated February 28, 2001 and also had received and was
considering a proposal from another potential acquiror. Hoak Breedlove indicated
the special committee would not grant us a period of exclusivity based on our
proposed offer letter.

     On March 13, 2001, we submitted a letter to the special committee
indicating that we were unwilling to commit the substantial time and resources
necessary to launch our due diligence investigation in the presence of the
competing offer. We reiterated our earlier proposal as set forth in the February
28, 2001 offer letter including the period of exclusivity.

     On March 13 and 14, 2001, discussions continued between the parties
regarding the valuation of DTM, the exclusivity period and the proposed
transaction. On March 14, 2001, Hoak Breedlove contacted A.G. Edwards and
indicated that the special committee had received our March 13, 2001 letter but
believed the proposed price was not sufficient to grant us a period of
exclusivity in which to conduct our due diligence. In a separate conversation on
March 14, 2001, Hoak Breedlove indicated to A.G. Edwards that the special
committee believed that the price per share should be increased and that the
exclusivity period should be reduced from 30 days to not more than two weeks.
Separately, on March 14, 2001, Mr. Mariotti contacted Mr. Service directly and
discussed the special committee's response to our proposal, specifically that
the offer price should be increased and that the special committee would agree
to a maximum two-week period of exclusivity. Mr. Service inquired as to whether
a price range of $5.50-6.00 would be sufficient and Mr. Mariotti expressed his
belief that such a price range would be adequate to justify granting us a
two-week exclusivity period, but that any decision would be made by the special
committee.

     On March 15, 2001, we submitted another non-binding offer letter to acquire
DTM for a price in the range of $5.50-$6.00 per share, subject to, among other
things, satisfactory completion of due diligence and a two-week period of
exclusivity. Later that day, Hoak Breedlove contacted A.G. Edwards and indicated
that the special committee had agreed to grant us a two-week period of
exclusivity based on our March 15, 2001 non-binding offer letter.

     During the next several days, our representatives negotiated the terms of
the exclusivity agreement and a confidentiality agreement with DTM, and on March
17, 2001, the parties executed and delivered the exclusivity agreement and the
confidentiality agreement.

     Beginning on March 16, 2001, representatives of A.G. Edwards held
discussions with certain potential lending sources relating to the financing
necessary to fund the contemplated transactions.

     On March 18 and 19, 2001, our principals together with representatives of
A.G. Edwards and Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld, L.L.P., our outside
counsel, commenced preliminary business and legal due diligence. Additional due
diligence was conducted in meetings with DTM management on March 20-22, 2001 in
Austin, Texas by certain of our officers, together with representatives of A.G.
Edwards, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld, L.L.P., and Deloitte and Touche, our
independent

public accountants, concerning the business, financial, accounting, legal
intellectual property rights and other affairs of DTM. The parties continued
these due diligence activities during the following week.

     On March 26 and 27, 2001, certain members of our management together with
representatives of A.G. Edwards made presentations to potential lenders.
Beginning the week of March 26, we received several written proposals from
potential lending sources.

     On March 27, 2001, our board of directors held a telephonic meeting to
discuss the proposed business combination, which included a presentation from
our management regarding the status of due diligence and negotiations. During
that meeting, A.G. Edwards presented its financial analysis with regard to the
proposed transaction. On that same day, we submitted to the special committee a
non-binding offer letter to acquire DTM for $5.75 per share. On March 28, 2001,
our outside counsel provided to the parties a preliminary draft of the merger
agreement.

     On March 28, 2001, Hoak Breedlove contacted A.G. Edwards on behalf of the
special committee to propose a purchase price of $6.00 per share. Hoak Breedlove
also discussed certain of the other terms in the draft merger agreement.

     Between March 28, 2001 and April 2, 2001 there were various meetings and
telephonic conferences between our principals and representatives of A.G.
Edwards and our outside counsel, on the one hand, and principles of DTM, Hoak
Breedlove and DTM's outside counsel, on the other, to negotiate provisions of
the merger agreement and the tender and voting agreements, and additional due
diligence was conducted by our outside counsel. On April 1, 2001, Messrs.
Loewenbaum and Mariotti together with their respective representatives met to
negotiate certain remaining terms in the merger agreement including, among other
things, the purchase price and receipt by us of financing adequate to fund the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Following these discussions,
the parties agreed to recommend to their respective boards of directors a
purchase price of $5.80 per share.

     In the morning of April 2, 2001, our board of directors held a special
meeting by telephonic conference to discuss the merger agreement and the
proposed transaction. The board of directors received and participated in a
presentation by A.G. Edwards with respect to the financial terms of the proposed
transaction. At the conclusion of its presentation, a representative of A.G.
Edwards delivered the oral opinion of A.G. Edwards to the board of directors
that, as of such date, an offer price of $5.80 per share of DTM common stock was
fair from a financial point of view to our stockholders. A.G. Edwards
subsequently confirmed its oral opinion by letter dated April 2, 2001. Our
outside counsel summarized the material terms of the merger agreement and
discussed the results of the due diligence investigation. Mr. Service presented
to the Board details regarding DTM and recent discussions with the principals of
DTM. At the conclusion of the meeting, the board of directors approved and
authorized the execution of the merger agreement, the tender and voting
agreements and the commencement of the offer consistent with the terms of the
merger agreement.

     Later on April 2, 2001, DTM informed us that its board of directors had
approved the execution of the merger agreement, the tender and voting agreements
and the completion of the transactions contemplated by those agreements and
declared the advisability of the merger agreement and resolved to recommend
acceptance of the offer and adoption of the merger agreement by the holders of
shares of DTM common stock.

     On April 2, 2001, the respective parties to the merger agreement and the
tender and voting agreements executed and delivered those agreements and on
April 3, 2001, we and DTM issued a joint press release announcing the signing of
the merger agreement.

     Commencing April 2, 2001 and continuing through April 23, 2001, the
potential lending sources conducted their due diligence investigation. On April
24, 2001, we received a commitment letter from U.S. Bank and during the next two
days together with our outside counsel and financial advisor negotiated certain
of its terms. On April 26, 2001, we held a special telephonic board meeting
during which Mr. Service presented the material terms of the commitment letter.
At the conclusion of the meeting, the

board of directors approved and authorized the execution of the commitment
letter. On April 27, 2001, we issued a press release announcing the execution of
the commitment letter.

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, the parties agreed to commence the tender
offer on April 30, 2001.

12. PURPOSE OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER; PLANS FOR DTM.

     The purpose of the offer is for us to acquire the entire equity interest in
DTM. The purpose of the merger is for us to acquire all of the equity interest
in DTM not acquired pursuant to the offer. Upon consummation of the merger, DTM
will become our wholly owned subsidiary. The acquisition of the entire equity
interest in DTM has been structured as a cash tender offer followed by a cash
merger in order to provide a prompt transfer of ownership of the equity interest
in DTM from you to us and to provide you with cash for all of your shares.

     Under Texas law, the approval of DTM's board of directors and, under
certain circumstances, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares present at a duly constituted meeting are required to approve
and adopt the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
agreement. Alternatively, Texas law and the articles of incorporation of DTM
permit the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the related
transactions by written consent of the holders of at least 67% of the
outstanding shares of DTM common stock. DTM has agreed to take all action
necessary to convene a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable
after the consummation of the offer for the purpose of obtaining shareholder
approval of the merger (if required by applicable law to consummate the merger)
or in place of that meeting, we have agreed to cause the merger agreement to be
adopted by written consent of the shareholders of DTM. The shareholders' meeting
will be held as soon as practicable (subject to any statutory or other
restrictions) following the purchase of the shares of DTM common stock pursuant
to the offer. If a meeting of DTM shareholders is required, a proxy statement
containing detailed information concerning the merger will be furnished to
shareholders of DTM in connection with that meeting.

     If we own at least 90% of the outstanding shares of DTM common stock, we
will not need to hold the shareholders' meeting described in the previous
paragraph. Texas law provides for a "short-form" merger under which the merger
will become effective as soon as practicable after the expiration date without a
meeting of the DTM shareholders and without the written consent of the DTM
shareholders.

     At a meeting duly called and held on April 2, 2001, the DTM board of
directors:

     - after evaluating the merger, determined that each of the merger agreement
       and the tender and voting agreements is advisable and fair to, and in the
       best interests of DTM's shareholders;

     - approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement
       and each of the tender and voting agreements and completion of the
       transactions contemplated by those agreements, including the offer and
       the merger; and

     - declared the advisability of the merger agreement and resolved to
       recommend the acceptance of the offer and the adoption of the merger
       agreement by DTM's shareholders.

     The only remaining corporate action of DTM that may be required is the
approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
by the agreement by the holders of a majority of the shares of DTM common stock
(or by 67% if approved by written consent of the shareholders in lieu of a
meeting). If the minimum condition is satisfied, we will have sufficient voting
power to cause the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby without the affirmative vote of any other
shareholder of DTM. We have agreed to vote all shares of DTM common stock owned
by us in favor of the merger. If we acquire at least 90% of the shares of DTM
common stock in the offer we will complete a short-form merger without the vote
or written consent of the DTM shareholders.

     Rule 13e-3. The SEC has adopted Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act, which is
applicable to certain "going private" transactions and which may, under certain
circumstances, be applicable to the merger. We believe, however, that Rule 13e-3
will not be applicable to the merger if the merger is consummated within one
year after the termination of the offer at the same per share price as paid in
the offer. If applicable, Rule 13e-3 requires, among other things, that certain
financial information concerning DTM and certain information relating to the
fairness of the merger and the consideration offered to minority shareholders in
the merger be filed with the SEC and disclosed to shareholders prior to
consummation of the merger.

     Plans for DTM. If we purchase DTM common stock pursuant to the offer, the
merger agreement provides that we will be entitled to designate representatives
to serve on DTM's board of directors in proportion to our ownership of DTM
common stock following that purchase; provided, however, that until the
effective time of the merger, there must be at least two directors who are
directors of DTM on April 2, 2001 and not officers of DTM or our affiliates.
Promptly upon the consummation of the offer, we currently intend to seek maximum
representation on DTM's board of directors as permitted by the merger agreement.
We expect that our representation on DTM's board of directors would permit us to
exert substantial influence over DTM's conduct of its business and operations.
As a result of the merger, our directors and officers immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will become the directors and officers,
respectively, of DTM, as the surviving corporation. See Section 13 -- "The
Merger Agreement, the Tender and Voting Agreements, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Exclusivity Agreement" for more detailed information.

     Following the consummation of the offer, we intend to cause the DTM common
stock to cease to be authorized or to be quoted in an automated quotation system
operated by a national securities association and to terminate the registration
of the DTM common stock pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Exchange Act. We
expect that initially following the merger, the business and operations of DTM
will be continued substantially as they are currently being conducted. We will
continue to evaluate the business and operations of DTM during the pendency of
the offer and, after the consummation of the offer and the merger, we will take
those actions as we deem appropriate under the circumstances then existing. We
intend to seek additional information about DTM during this period. Thereafter,
we intend to review this information as part of a comprehensive review of DTM's
business, assets, operations, capitalization, dividend policy, management and
personnel, with a view to optimizing development of DTM's potential in
conjunction with our current and future business.

     Except as described above or elsewhere in this document, we have no present
plans or proposals that would relate to or result in the following:

     - an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization
       or liquidation, involving DTM or any of its subsidiaries (other than
       possible intercompany transactions among DTM, its subsidiaries and us);

     - a purchase, sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of DTM or any
       of its subsidiaries;

     - any change in the present board of directors or management of DTM;

     - any material change in the present dividend rate or policy, or
       indebtedness or capitalization of DTM;

     - any other material change in DTM's business or corporate structure;

     - any action similar to any of those enumerated above.

13. THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE TENDER AND VOTING AGREEMENTS, THE CONFIDENTIALITY
    AGREEMENT AND THE EXCLUSIVITY AGREEMENT.

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger
agreement, the tender and voting agreements, the confidentiality agreement and
the exclusivity agreement, copies of which are attached as exhibits to the
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO we filed with the SEC in connection with
the

offer. These summaries do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the merger agreement the tender and voting agreements,
the confidentiality agreement and the exclusivity agreement, each of which we
incorporate by reference. You should read these agreements carefully in their
entirety.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The Offer

     Structure, Timing and Conditions. Pursuant to the merger agreement, within
five business days of our receipt of commitments from financial institutions or
other equity or debt sources sufficient in amount to allow us to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, we will commence the offer to
acquire all the outstanding shares of DTM common stock from the shareholders at
$5.80 per share, net to the shareholder in cash, without interest, less any
required withholding taxes. The offer will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York
City time on the 20th business day following the commencement of the offer,
unless otherwise extended. We will accept for payment and pay for all shares of
DTM common stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the offer as
promptly as practicable after the expiration date of the offer. Our obligation
to accept for payment, purchase and pay for any shares of DTM common stock
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the offer is subject to certain
conditions described in Section 14 -- "Conditions to Our Obligations."

     Changes to the Offer Terms. We may, in our sole discretion, modify the
terms and conditions of the offer and waive any condition described under
Section 14 -- "Conditions to Our Obligations," except that, without the prior
written consent of DTM, we may not:

     - decrease the offer price;

     - change the form of consideration to be paid pursuant to the offer;

     - reduce the maximum number of shares to be purchased in the offer;

     - impose conditions to the offer in addition to those set forth in Section
       14 -- "Conditions to Our Obligations;"

     - extend the offer, except as provided below;

     - amend any other term of the offer in any manner materially adverse to
       holders of shares of DTM common stock; or

     - amend or waive the minimum condition.

     Extension of the Offer. We may from time to time, in our sole discretion,
extend the initial expiration date of the offer if, on the initial expiration
date, not all the conditions of the offer are satisfied or waived. We may,
without the consent of DTM, extend any expiration date of the offer for any
period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC
or for any period required by applicable law. In addition, we have agreed to
extend the offer from time to time until June 29, 2001, if on the initial
expiration date of the offer, or any extension thereof, the conditions of the
offer have not been waived or satisfied. However, we are not required to extend
the offer under this provision unless, in our reasonable judgment:

     - each condition that is not then satisfied or waived is reasonably capable
       of being satisfied;

     - DTM is in material compliance with all of its covenants in the merger
       agreement; and

     - the failure of a condition to be satisfied did not result from a breach
       by DTM of any of its covenants and agreements contained in the merger
       agreement.

     In addition, we may, without the consent of DTM, provide a "subsequent
offering period" by extending the offer from three to 20 business days following
the expiration date of the offer.

     Board Representation. The merger agreement provides that effective upon our
purchase pursuant to the offer of that number of shares of DTM common stock
which represents at least 67% of the total number of outstanding common shares
on a fully diluted basis, and from time to time thereafter, we will be entitled
to designate up to that number of DTM directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, as will make the percentage of the DTM directors designated by us equal
to the percentage of outstanding shares of DTM common stock held by us. DTM has
agreed to take all action necessary to cause our designees to be elected to or
appointed by DTM's board of directors. The merger agreement also provides that
upon our written request, DTM will use its best efforts to cause our designees
to be elected or appointed to each committee of DTM's board of directors and to
the board of directors of each of its subsidiaries (in the same percentage of
representation as on DTM's board of directors).

     Prior to the effective time of the merger, DTM will have on its board of
directors at least two directors who were directors of DTM on April 2, 2001 (the
date of the merger agreement) and who are not officers of DTM or our affiliates.
We refer to these two directors as the "independent directors." If the number of
independent directors is reduced below two, the remaining independent director
will be entitled to designate a person to fill the vacancy and if no independent
director remains, the other directors will designate two persons to fill the
vacancies who shall not be officers of DTM or our affiliates and those designees
will be deemed to be independent directors for purposes of the merger agreement.

     SEC Filings and Dissemination of Documents to Shareholders. As soon as
practicable on the date of commencement of the offer, we will file the Tender
Offer Statement on Schedule TO with the SEC. The Schedule TO will contain or
incorporate by reference this document and other related offering documents with
respect to the offer. We also have agreed to cause this document and related
offering documents to be disseminated to you to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws. DTM will file with the SEC and mail to you,
concurrently with the commencement of the offer or as promptly thereafter as
practicable, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
containing the recommendation of DTM's board of directors in favor of the offer
and the merger and the opinion of DTM's financial advisor that the consideration
to be received for the shares of DTM common stock pursuant to the offer and the
merger is fair to you from a financial point of view.

     The Merger

     Structure, Timing. Pursuant to the merger agreement, as soon as practicable
after satisfaction of all conditions to the merger, Tiger Deals will merge with
and into DTM. DTM will be the surviving corporation after the merger. The merger
will become effective at the time the certificate of merger is filed with the
Secretary of State of Delaware and a certificate of merger is issued by the
Secretary of State of Texas, or at a later time as specified in the respective
certificates of merger. The merger is expected to occur as soon as practicable
after all conditions of the merger have been satisfied or waived.

     At the effective time of the merger, the articles of incorporation and
bylaws of the surviving corporation will be amended and restated to be identical
to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger, except that the name of the surviving
corporation will be "DTM Corporation." Further, at the effective time of the
merger, our directors and officers will become the initial directors and
officers of the surviving corporation until those directors' or officers'
successors are duly elected or appointed.

     Consideration. Pursuant to the merger agreement and by virtue of the
merger, at the effective time of the merger:

     - each share of DTM common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
       to the effective time of the merger (other than shares of DTM common
       stock held by DTM in treasury, or shares held by us, which shall be
       cancelled, and shares held by shareholders who have properly exercised
       appraisal rights under Texas law), will be converted automatically into
       the right to receive $5.80 in cash, or any higher price that may be paid
       per share for the DTM common stock pursuant to the offer (less any
       required withholding taxes), upon surrender of the DTM common stock
       certificate;

     - each share of DTM common stock held in the treasury of DTM or by us, if
       any, immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, will be
       cancelled without any conversion and no payment or distribution will be
       made with respect to those shares; and

     - each outstanding share of Tiger Deal common stock will be converted into
       one share of common stock of the surviving corporation.

     If, between April 2, 2001 and the effective time of the merger, the number
of outstanding shares of DTM capital stock changes by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or the like other than pursuant to the merger,
the $5.80 cash consideration to be paid to each DTM shareholder will be
correspondingly adjusted.

     Treatment of Options. At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding
and unexercised option to purchase DTM common stock pursuant to the 1996, 1998
and 1999 DTM stock option plans, whether vested or unvested, will accelerate and
convert into an obligation of DTM to pay to the holders of those options a cash
amount for each option that is equal to (i) the excess, if any, of the $5.80 per
share consideration or any higher price that may be paid per share in the offer,
over the exercise price per share of the subject option multiplied by (ii) the
number of shares underlying the option. In addition, except as may be otherwise
agreed upon by the parties, as of the effective time of the merger:

     - all of DTM's stock option plans will terminate;

     - the provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement providing for
       the issuance of capital stock of DTM or any of its subsidiaries will be
       deleted; and

     - no holder of DTM options or any participant in DTM's stock option plans
       will have any rights to acquire any equity interest in the surviving
       corporation.

     Treatment of Warrants. All warrants and other convertible securities to
purchase shares of DTM common stock, if any, will be cancelled as of the closing
of the merger.

     Exchange of Stock Certificates. At the effective time of the merger, the
surviving corporation will deposit with a paying agent the cash necessary to
consummate the merger. Promptly after the effective time of the merger, the
paying agent will mail to each person who was a record holder of DTM common
stock at the effective time of the merger, a letter of transmittal and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the holder's stock
certificates. Upon surrender to the paying agent of the holder's stock
certificate, the holder will be entitled to receive the $5.80 per share cash
consideration, without interest, less any required withholding taxes and the
certificates so surrendered will be promptly cancelled.

     No Further Ownership Rights in DTM.  At and after the effective time of the
merger your rights as a shareholder of DTM will terminate, except for the right
to surrender your certificates in exchange for the $5.80 per share cash
consideration (or any higher consideration paid in the offer) or to perfect your
right to receive payment for your shares under Texas law and the merger
agreement. There shall be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of
DTM of the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger. If, after the effective time of the merger, certificates that
formerly represented shares of DTM common stock are presented to the surviving
corporation, these certificates will be cancelled and exchanged for cash less
required withholding taxes in the manner described above, subject to applicable
law with respect to dissenting shareholders.

     Representations and Warranties. In the merger agreement, DTM and/or its
subsidiaries have made various customary representations and warranties to us,
subject to certain exceptions, with respect to among other things:

       the merger agreement; and

     Covenants

     Conduct Prior to Closing. The parties to the merger agreement each agreed
that, during the period from April 2, 2001 (the date of the merger agreement) to
the earlier of the closing date of the merger or termination date of the merger
agreement, the following, among other things, will occur:

     - the parties will give any required notices to third parties and use their
       best efforts in obtaining the consent of any third party or governmental
       authority;

     - DTM and its subsidiaries will conduct their operations in the ordinary
       course of business and consistent with past practices;

     - DTM will provide reasonable access during normal business hours to all of
       its properties, books, contracts and records to our representatives;

     - we will use reasonable best efforts to obtain the necessary financing
       commitments;

     - the parties will use reasonable best efforts to satisfy the closing
       conditions set forth in the merger agreement;

     - if, prior to the closing of the merger, either party becomes aware of a
       matter that, if existing on the date of the merger agreement, would have
       been required to have been disclosed, such party will promptly provide
       written notice of the undisclosed matter to the other party; and

     - the parties will use reasonable best efforts to agree upon the text of
       any press release before issuing any press release or making any public
       statements with respect to the merger.

     No Solicitation. The merger agreement provides that DTM will not, nor will
DTM permit its officers, directors, employees and representatives, directly or
indirectly, to initiate, solicit, have discussions with, enter into an agreement
with or provide any information, to any party, concerning the following events:

     - the acquisition of DTM by merger, acquisition consolidation or similar
       transaction involving any equity security of DTM; and

     - the acquisition of DTM by the acquisition of all or substantially all of
       DTM's assets (other than an acquisition by us).

     We refer to any offer or proposal (other than by us) for either of the
foregoing actions as an "acquisition proposal."

     However, nothing contained in the merger agreement prevents DTM or DTM's
board of directors from:

     - complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with
       regard to any tender offer, provided that, among other things, DTM's
       board of directors will not recommend that DTM shareholders tender their
       shares in connection with that tender offer unless DTM's board of
       directors in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel,
       determines that it is reasonably likely that its failure to do so would
       constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to its shareholders; and

     - furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations
       with, any person or entity in response to an acquisition proposal,
       unless, among other things, DTM's board of directors in good faith, after
       consulting with legal counsel, determines that it is reasonably likely
       that its failure to do so would constitute a breach of its fiduciary
       duties to its shareholders.

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, DTM's board of directors may withdraw its
recommendation of the merger agreement or approve or recommend any acquisition
proposal, if after consulting with legal counsel, DTM's board of directors
determines in good faith that it is reasonably likely that its failure to do so
would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to its shareholders. DTM's
board of directors may only enter into an agreement with respect to an
acquisition proposal that is a superior proposal. A superior proposal is an
unsolicited acquisition proposal by a third party who the DTM board of directors
determines in good faith has a good faith intent to proceed with negotiations
and has the financial and other capabilities to complete the acquisition
proposal (i) on terms that a majority of the members of DTM's board of directors
determines, acting upon the written opinion of financial advisors, to represent
superior value for the DTM shareholders as compared to the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and (ii) is reasonably capable of being
completed.

     DTM must promptly advise us of any acquisition proposal or any inquiry with
respect to or that could lead to an acquisition proposal. In addition, DTM must
provide prompt notice to us of the identity of the person making the acquisition
proposal and the material terms of the acquisition proposal. Further, DTM must
keep us fully informed of the status of the acquisition proposal and provide
copies of all correspondence sent by the third party to DTM in connection with
the acquisition proposal.

     Shareholders' Meetings and Proxy Statement. DTM has agreed to take all
action necessary to convene a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as
practicable after the consummation of the offer for the purpose of obtaining
shareholder approval of the merger (if required by applicable law to consummate
the merger) or in lieu of that meeting, we have agreed to cause the merger
agreement to be adopted by written consent of the shareholders of DTM. The
shareholders' meeting (if required by applicable law to consummate the merger)
shall be held as soon as practicable (subject to any statutory or other
restrictions) following the purchase of DTM common stock pursuant to the offer.
In the event a meeting of DTM shareholders is required, DTM and 3D Systems will
prepare and file a proxy statement with the SEC.

     Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance. The merger
agreement provides that DTM will indemnify each person who is now, or has been
at any time prior to the execution date of the merger agreement, an officer or
director of DTM or any of its subsidiaries, for any claim, liability, loss,
damage, amount paid in settlement, cost or expense, including reasonable
attorney fees and expenses, occurring at or prior to the effective time of the
merger, arising (i) out of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and (ii) out of the fact that the person is
or was an officer or director of DTM or any of its subsidiaries. From and after
the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will fulfill and
honor the indemnification obligations of DTM under any indemnification
agreements between DTM and its directors and officers as well as any
indemnification provisions under DTM's organizational documents. In addition,
the surviving company will maintain in effect, if available, for not less than
six years after the effective time of the merger the current directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by DTM with respect to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger. Neither we nor DTM
will be required to pay annual premiums for this insurance in excess of 200% of
the annual premium currently paid by DTM. In addition, we at our election, may
cause

coverage to be provided under any policy maintained for our benefit, so long as
the terms are not materially less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries
than the existing insurance coverage.

     Financing. We will use our reasonable best efforts to obtain, on terms
reasonably satisfactory to us, commitments in customary form from financial
institutions or other equity or debt sources sufficient to allow us to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

     Employee Benefits. As of the effective time of the merger, we have agreed
that all DTM employees retained after the merger will become entitled to all
benefits generally available to our employees under our employee benefit plans.
Further, the merger agreement requires the surviving corporation to honor
certain severance plans and severance agreements adopted and entered into by DTM
prior to the effective time of the merger.

     Closing Conditions. The obligation of each party to effect the merger is
subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions, unless waived
in writing by the parties:

     - no governmental entity will have initiated proceedings to restrain or
       prohibit the merger or force rescission of the merger agreement;

     - any applicable waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust
       Improvements Act of 1976 must have been terminated with respect to the
       merger and the transactions contemplated by the agreement;

     - DTM shareholder approval of the merger (if required) must have been
       obtained;

     - all governmental consents, orders and approvals required to complete the
       merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement must
       have been obtained;

     - no law or order will have been promulgated by any governmental entity
       (and be in effect) which declares the merger agreement invalid or
       unenforceable in any material respect or prohibits consummation of the
       merger or transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and

     - we will have purchased all shares of DTM common stock tendered and not
       withdrawn.

     Termination; Termination Fees and Expenses. Subject to certain limitations,
the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by it may, at any time
prior to the effective time of the merger, be terminated, whether before or
after shareholder approval of the merger:

     - by mutual written consent of the parties to the merger agreement;

     - by DTM or us, if (i) we do not receive the necessary financing commitment
       to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on or
       prior to May 3, 2001 or (ii) we do not accept for payment the shares of
       DTM common stock tendered pursuant to the offer within 65 days following
       the commencement of the offer;

     - by DTM or us, if any governmental entity issues a non-appealable final
       order, decree or ruling or has taken any other action having the effect
       of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
       acceptance for payment of, or payment for, shares of DTM common stock
       pursuant to the offer or the merger;

     - by us, if DTM's board of directors (i) withdraws, modifies or changes
       (including by amendment of the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement) its
       recommendation of the offer, the merger agreement or the merger in a
       manner adverse to us; (ii) recommends to DTM shareholders any other
       acquisition proposal; or (iii) fails to reaffirm publicly and
       unconditionally its recommendation to you that you tender your shares of
       DTM common stock in the offer within five days of our written request to
       do so;

     - by us, if the minimum condition is not satisfied by the expiration date
       of the offer and a third party has made an acquisition proposal or a
       group or person (other than us or parties to the tender and voting
       agreements) becomes the beneficial owner of more than 50% of DTM's common
       stock;

     - by us, if DTM breaches any of its representations and warranties or fails
       to perform its covenants or other agreements contained in the merger
       agreement which give rise to the failure of the conditions in the merger
       agreement relating to the withdrawal of DTM's board of directors'
       recommendation of the offer, the entering into an agreement with respect
       to an acquisition proposal, the acquisition by a third party of a 50% or
       greater interest in DTM, and that breach or failure is incapable of being
       cured within five business days following receipt of notice of that
       breach or failure;

     - by DTM, if there has been a material breach by us of any representation,
       warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in the merger agreement which
       (if susceptible of cure) has not been cured in all material respects
       within five business days following receipt of notice of the breach; and

     - by DTM, if prior to the acceptance of and payment for the shares of DTM
       common stock pursuant to the offer, (i) DTM enters into an agreement with
       respect to a superior proposal or DTM's board of directors recommends any
       superior proposal and (ii) DTM pays the termination fee required by the
       merger agreement.

     The merger agreement provides for payment of a termination fee and
reimbursement for actual out of pocket expenses (including, but not limited to,
fees of legal counsel, accountants and financial and other advisors), in the
following situations:

     - if DTM terminates the merger agreement and enters into an agreement with
       respect to a superior proposal or we terminate the merger agreement
       because DTM's board of directors withdraws its recommendation of the
       offer, DTM will pay us a termination fee equal to $1,025,000 plus all
       actual out of pocket expenses but not to exceed $2,000,000 in the
       aggregate;

     - if we are not entitled to the termination fee described above, and we
       terminate the merger agreement because DTM shareholders fail to approve
       the merger or DTM breaches any of its representations or warranties or
       fails to perform its covenants under the merger agreement and the breach
       or failure gives rise to the failure of certain conditions to the offer,
       DTM must pay us all actual out of pocket expenses up to $500,000; and

     - if DTM terminates the merger agreement because we breach a representation
       or warranty and we fail to cure that breach in the prescribed time, we
       must pay DTM all actual out of pocket expenses up to $500,000.

TENDER AND VOTING AGREEMENTS

     General. We required as a condition of our entering into the merger
agreement, that DTM Acquisition Company, L.P. and John S. Murchison, III enter
into tender and voting agreements. DTM Acquisition Company and Mr. Murchison
beneficially own an aggregate of 3,513,357 outstanding shares of DTM common
stock (representing approximately 44.9% of the outstanding shares of DTM common
stock on April 26, 2001, on a fully diluted basis).

     Agreement to Tender. Pursuant to the tender and voting agreements, DTM
Acquisition Company and Mr. Murchison have agreed to do the following:

     - validly tender, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the
       offer, as soon as practicable after commencement of the offer but in no
       event later than ten business days after the date of commencement of the
       offer, all DTM common stock legally or beneficially owned by them on the
       date of the tender and voting agreements, together with any DTM common
       stock acquired after that date; and

     - not withdraw the DTM common stock so tendered, except following the
       termination of the offer pursuant to its terms.

     Agreement to Vote. During the time the tender and voting agreements are in
effect, DTM Acquisition Company and Mr. Murchison have agreed that at any
meeting of the shareholders of DTM or in any other circumstance in which the
vote, consent or approval of DTM shareholders is sought, DTM

Acquisition Company and Mr. Murchison will vote their shares of DTM common stock
in the following manner:

     - in favor of approval of the merger agreement and any actions required in
       furtherance of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
       including voting their shares in favor of the election to DTM's board of
       directors and the board of directors of each wholly-owned entity of DTM
       of each person designated by us for nomination;

     - against any action or agreement that would result in a breach of any
       covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement
       of DTM under the merger agreement; and

     - against certain other actions outlined in the tender and voting
       agreements, except with our written consent.

     DTM Acquisition Company and Mr. Murchison also have agreed not to enter
into any agreement or understanding with any person or entity which is
inconsistent with or violates any provisions of the tender and voting
agreements.

     Shareholder Capacity. We acknowledge that DTM Acquisition Company and Mr.
Murchison have executed the tender and voting agreements solely in its or his
capacity as a DTM shareholder. The tender and voting agreements in no way limit
or otherwise restrict Mr. Murchison with respect to any act or omission in his
capacity as an officer of DTM or a member of the board of directors of DTM.

     Grant of Irrevocable Proxy. DTM Acquisition Company and Mr. Murchison have
irrevocably granted to, and appointed us as their proxy and attorney-in-fact
(with full power of substitution), to vote their DTM common stock to approve and
vote in favor of the offer, the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, against an acquisition proposal and as
otherwise contemplated by the tender and voting agreements.

     Waiver of Appraisal Rights. DTM Acquisition Company and Mr. Murchison have
waived any rights of appraisal, any rights to dissent and any similar rights
relating to the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

     Representations and Warranties. The tender and voting agreements contain
customary representations and warranties by DTM Acquisition Company and Mr.
Murchison to us, including among others:

     - ownership and title to the DTM common stock, and the absence of liens or
       encumbrances on the DTM common stock;

     - authority to enter into and perform obligations under the tender and
       voting agreements;

     - noncontravention and enforceability;

     - the absence of conflicts; and

     - the absence of finder's fees.

     Termination. The tender and voting agreements terminate upon the earlier to
occur of (i) the termination of the merger agreement or (ii) the date we accept
for payment the shares of DTM common stock of DTM Acquisition Company and Mr.
Murchison.

     CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

     On March 17, 2001, we executed a confidentiality agreement with DTM. The
confidentiality agreement, which supersedes a prior mutual nondisclosure
agreement between DTM and us dated January 25, 2000, contains customary
provisions pursuant to which, among other things, each party agreed on behalf of
itself and its representatives, subject to certain exceptions, to maintain the
confidentiality to keep confidential all of the other party's nonpublic,
confidential or proprietary information furnished to it, and to use the
confidential information solely in connection with evaluating a business
combination between the parties. In addition, both parties agreed not to
disclose to any third parties the fact that

negotiations were taking place. The confidentiality agreement also provides that
for a period of two years after the termination of discussions between the
parties, neither party shall, without the prior written consent of the other
party, directly or indirectly solicit for hire any person currently employed by
the other party, except under the conditions provided in the confidentiality
agreement.

     In addition, the confidentiality agreement contains a standstill provision
pursuant to which, among other things, for a period of 15 months from the date
of the confidentiality agreement, neither party nor its respective
representatives will, in any manner:

     - acquire, offer to acquire, or agree to acquire (directly or indirectly,
       by purchase or otherwise) any voting securities of the other party or any
       subsidiaries of the other party, or of any successor to or person in
       control of the other party, or the material assets of the other party or
       any subsidiary or division of the other party or of any such successor or
       controlling person;

     - make or participate, directly or indirectly, in any solicitation of
       proxies to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person or entity with
       respect to, the voting of any voting securities of the other party, or

     - make any public announcement with respect to, or submit a proposal or
       offer in connection with either of the foregoing.

     These provisions will terminate in the event that:

     - any third party not affiliated with either us or DTM initiates or
       announces its intentions to initiate a tender offer or exchange offer
       for, or otherwise proposes or agrees to acquire, our or DTM's common
       stock or other equity interests;

     - it is publicly disclosed that voting securities representing more than or
       equal to 15% of either our or DTM's total voting power then outstanding
       have been acquired or are proposed to be acquired by any person or group
       not affiliated with the other party in a single transaction or a series
       of related transactions; or

     - either we or DTM enter into any agreement to merge with, or sell or
       dispose of 50% or more of our or their, respectively, assets or earning
       power to, any person not affiliated with that party.

     EXCLUSIVITY AGREEMENT

     Concurrently with the execution of the confidentiality agreement on March
17, 2001, we entered into an exclusivity letter agreement with DTM pursuant to
which DTM agreed, from such date until April 2, 2001 and subject to specified
conditions:

     - that neither DTM nor its representatives would initiate, solicit,
       negotiate, encourage or provide confidential information to facilitate
       any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that may reasonably
       lead to an alternative transaction;

     - immediately to terminate discussions and negotiations in which DTM or its
       representatives may have been involved with respect to an alternative
       transaction proposal; and

     - to notify us promptly if DTM received any inquiries or proposals,
       requests for information or if negotiations or discussions are sought to
       be initiated or continued with DTM.

     However, the agreement did not prohibit DTM from furnishing confidential
information to, and participating in negotiations with, a person making an
unsolicited proposal for an alternative transaction if DTM's board of directors
reasonably determined in good faith after consultation with its legal counsel
that the failure to furnish this information would constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties. Prior to furnishing this information to, or entering
discussions or negotiations with, any person concerning an alternative
transaction proposal, DTM would have been required to receive from that person
an executed confidentiality agreement on terms not less favorable to us than the
confidentiality agreement between us and DTM and provide written notice to us
that DTM is furnishing this information or entering discussions

with that person. DTM would have been required to provide us with a summary of
the terms of the alternative transaction proposal including the identity of the
person making the proposal.

     If, prior to May 30, 2001, DTM's board of directors, in the exercise of its
fiduciary duties, recommends an alternative transaction, then DTM would have
been reimburse us for all actual, reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses,
not to exceed $125,000, incurred by us in connection with the possible
transaction between DTM and us. Under the agreement, DTM also agreed to provide
us such information as is reasonable and mutually agreed to by the parties in
connection with our due diligence review of DTM.

     All obligations under the exclusivity agreement terminated when DTM and we
signed the merger agreement.

14. CERTAIN CONDITIONS TO OUR OBLIGATIONS.

     We are not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange
Act, pay for, and we may postpone the acceptance for payment of and payment for

                subsidiaries, or to compel DTM or its subsidiaries or us to
                dispose of or hold separate all or any portion of the business
                or assets of DTM, 3D Systems or any of their respective
                subsidiaries, as a result of the offer, the merger or any of the

         reasonably likely to result in any of the consequences referred to
         above;

            (5) a change in general financial, bank or capital market conditions

                loans; or

            (6) in the case of any of the conditions described in clauses (1)

         Rule 13d-3(e) of the Exchange Act) of 50% or more of the outstanding
         DTM common stock has been acquired by any person or entity other than
         us, except for any person or entity having that beneficial ownership as
         of April 2, 2001 (the date of the merger agreement);

       - DTM's board of directors:

               (1) withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation of the
                   offer, the merger agreement or the merger in a manner adverse
                   to 3D Systems;

               (2) recommends to DTM shareholders any acquisition proposal; or

               (3) fails to reaffirm publicly and unconditionally its
                   recommendation to DTM shareholders that they tender their
                   shares of DTM common stock in the offer, which public
                   reaffirmation must be made within five days after 3D Systems'
                   written request of such reaffirmation.

         not true and correct;

       - any of the other representations and warranties of DTM set forth in the
         merger agreement are not true and correct except where the failure to

         material adverse effect on DTM;

       - DTM fails to perform or comply in any material respect with any
         material obligation, agreement or covenant to be performed or complied

         financial obligations arising in connection with the consummation of
         the offer, the merger and other transactions contemplated by the merger
         agreement.

     The above conditions are for our benefit and may be asserted by us
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any of the conditions and, other
than the conditions relating to the minimum condition and the receipt of all
necessary permits and consents, which require the written consent of DTM to be
waived, may be waived by us, in whole or in part, at any time. The failure by us
to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be deemed a waiver of any right
and each right will be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at anytime.

15. LEGAL MATTERS.

     General. Except as set forth in this Section 15, we are not aware of any
approval or other action by any governmental or administrative agency which
would be required for the acquisition or ownership of DTM common stock as
contemplated by the merger agreement. Should any approval or other action be
required, it will be sought, but we have no current intention to delay the
purchase of DTM common stock tendered pursuant to the offer pending the outcome
of any such matter, subject, however, to our right to decline to purchase DTM
common stock if any of the conditions specified in Section 14  -- "Conditions to
Our Obligations" have occurred. We cannot assure you that any approval or other
action, if needed, would be obtained or would be obtained without substantial
conditions, or that adverse consequences might not result to DTM's business or
that parts of DTM's business might not have to be disposed of if any of these
approvals were not obtained or other action taken.

     Appraisal Rights. Appraisal rights are not available in connection with the
offer. Shares of DTM common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger and which are (1) held by holders of DTM common
stock who have not voted in favor of the merger or consented to the merger in
writing and (2) who have demanded properly in writing payment of the fair market
value of their DTM common stock in accordance with Texas law, will be cancelled
and terminated and will represent solely the right to receive payment from the
surviving corporation of the fair market value of the DTM common stock held by
them in accordance with the provisions of Texas law. Those rights to dissent, if
the statutory procedures are complied with, could lead to a judicial
determination of the fair value of the DTM common stock immediately before the
effective time of the merger (excluding any appreciation or depreciation in
anticipation of the merger unless exclusion would be inequitable), required to
be paid in cash to those dissenting shareholders for their DTM common stock. In
addition, the dissenting shareholders would be entitled to receive payment of
interest, beginning 91 days after the date of consummation of the merger to the
date of such judgment, on the amount determined to be the fair value of their
DTM common stock.

     However, if you have failed to exercise or effectively have withdrawn or
lost your rights for an appraisal of your shares under Texas law you will then
have your shares deemed to be cancelled and terminated, as of the effective time
of the merger, and the shares will represent solely the right to receive the
offer price as provided in the merger agreement, upon surrender of your
certificate or certificates in the manner provided in the merger agreement.

     DTM will provide us the following concerning any demand for appraisal:

     - any written objection to the merger and notice of exercise filed with DTM
       prior to the taking of any vote or written consent of the shareholders;

     - prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by DTM, withdrawals
       of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Texas law
       and received by DTM; and

     - the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
       to demands for payment of fair market value under Texas law.

     DTM will not, except with our prior written consent, make any payment with
respect to any demands, or offer to settle, or settle, any demands.

     Texas State Takeover Laws. Article 13 of Texas law contains an
"anti-takeover" provision which we will refer to as the Texas Business
Combination Law. The Texas Business Combination Law generally

prohibits an issuing public corporation from, directly or indirectly, entering
into or engaging in a "business combination" (i.e. any merger, share exchange or
conversion of an issuing public corporation or a subsidiary) with an "affiliated
shareholder" during the three-year period immediately following the affiliated
shareholder's share acquisition date unless the board of directors of the
issuing public corporation approved of the affiliated shareholder's share
acquisition in advance. One becomes an "affiliated shareholder" of a corporation
by beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the outstanding
voting shares of the issuing public corporation. Pursuant to Article 13.02.A.(3)
of the TBCA, a person or entity (and its affiliates and associates) will be
considered a "beneficial owner" of shares owned by another person or entity if
there is any written or other agreement, arrangement or understanding for the
purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of the shares. However, on
April 2, 2001, DTM's board of directors approved of us becoming affiliated
shareholders and approved the offer and the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by those agreements, and, by doing so, made the Business
Combination Law inapplicable to the offer, the merger and the transactions
contemplated by those agreements.

     Other State Takeover Laws. A number of other states have adopted laws and
regulations applicable to attempts to acquire securities of corporations which
are incorporated, or have substantial assets, shareholders, principal executive
offices or principal places of business, or whose business operations otherwise
have substantial economic effects, in such states. In 1982, in Edgar v. MITE
Corp., the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated on constitutional grounds the Illinois
Business Takeover Statute, which made takeovers of corporations meeting certain
requirements more difficult. However, in 1987, in CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of
America, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the State of Indiana may
constitutionally disqualify a potential acquiror from voting on the affairs of a
target corporation without the prior approval of the remaining shareholders. The
state law before the U.S. Supreme Court was by its terms applicable only to
corporations that had a substantial number of shareholders in the state and were
incorporated there. Subsequently, a number of federal courts have ruled that
various state takeover statutes were unconstitutional insofar as they apply to
corporations incorporated outside the state of enactment.

     DTM conducts business in a number of states throughout the United States,
some of which have enacted takeover laws. We do not know whether any of these
laws will, by their terms, apply to the offer or the merger, and we have not
attempted to comply with any of those laws. Should any person seek to apply any
state takeover law, we will take such action as then appears desirable, which
may include challenging the validity or applicability of any such statute in
appropriate court proceedings. In the event it is asserted that one or more
state takeover laws is applicable to the offer or the merger, and an appropriate
court does not determine that those laws are inapplicable or invalid as applied
to the offer, we might be required to file certain information with, or receive
approvals from, the relevant state authorities. In addition, if enjoined, we
might be unable to accept for payment any DTM common stock tendered pursuant to
the offer, or be delayed in continuing or consummating the offer and the merger.
In such case, we may not be obligated to accept for payment any DTM common stock
tendered. See Section 14 -- "Conditions to Our Obligations" for more detailed
information.

     Antitrust. Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,
as amended, or "HSR," and the related rules promulgated by the Federal Trade
Commission, or the "FTC," some acquisition transactions may not be consummated
unless information has been furnished to the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice and the FTC and waiting period requirements have been
satisfied. The purchase of DTM common stock pursuant to the offer and the
subsequent merger are not subject to these requirements.

  Foreign Filings. We and DTM each conduct operations in a number of foreign
jurisdictions where regulatory filings or approvals may be required or desirable
in connection with the offer. We and DTM are currently in the process of
analyzing whether filings or approvals are in fact required or desirable in
certain of these jurisdictions and, where necessary, the parties intend to make
those filings. It is possible that one or more of those filings may not be made,
or one or more of those approvals, which are not as a matter of law or practice
required to be obtained prior to consummation of the merger, may not be obtained
prior to consummation of the merger.

     Class Action Lawsuit. On April 6, 2001 a purported class action lawsuit was
filed in the 200th Judicial District Court of Travis County, Austin, Texas,
naming as defendants DTM, some of DTM's directors and 3D Systems. The complaint
asserts that the $5.80 cash consideration to be paid in the merger is inadequate
and does not represent the value of the assets and the future prospects of DTM.
The complaint also alleges that the individual defendants breached their
fiduciary obligations to the public shareholders of DTM in approving the merger
agreement.

     The complaint seeks, among other things, preliminary and permanent
injunctive relief prohibiting DTM from consummating the merger, and if the
merger is consummated, an order rescinding the merger and awarding damages to
the purported class. The complaint also seeks unspecified damages, attorney fees
and other relief. We have not been served with the complaint. None of the
defendants has filed an answer to the complaint.

16. FEES AND EXPENSES.

     Neither we, nor any of our officers, directors, shareholders, agents or
other representatives, will pay any fees or commissions to any broker, dealer or
other person (other than the Information Agent) for soliciting tenders of DTM
common stock pursuant to the offer. We will reimburse brokers, dealers,
commercial banks and trust companies and other nominees, upon request, for
customary mailing and handling expenses incurred by them in forwarding materials
to their customers.

     We have retained A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., as dealer manager, Georgeson
Shareholder Communications Inc., as information agent, and U.S. Stock Transfer
Corporation, as depositary, in connection with the offer. A.G. Edwards has
provided certain financial advisory services to us in connection with the
proposed acquisition of DTM. We have agreed to pay A.G. Edwards a fee of (a)
$150,000, which became payable upon the delivery of the fairness opinion by A.G.
Edwards to us and (b) approximately $720,000, which will become payable once the
acquisition is completed, against which the fee paid pursuant to (a) above will
be credited. In addition, we have agreed to reimburse A.G. Edwards for all of
its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including attorney and other professional
fees, travel, document procurement and computer services, and to indemnify A.G.
Edwards and certain related persons against certain liabilities and expenses,
including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws. The dealer
manager and information agent may contact holders of shares of DTM common stock
by personal interview, mail, telephone, and other methods of electronic
communication and may request brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust
companies and other nominees to forward the offer materials to beneficial
holders. The information agent and the depositary will receive reasonable and
customary compensation for their services and, together with the dealer manager,
reimbursement for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. The dealer manager,
the information agent and the depositary will also be indemnified by us against
specified liabilities in connection with the offer.

17. MISCELLANEOUS.

     We are not aware of any jurisdiction where the making of the offer is
prohibited by any administrative or judicial action pursuant to any valid state
statute. If we become aware of any valid state statute prohibiting the making of
the offer or the acceptance of the DTM common stock, we will make a good faith
effort to comply with that state statute. If, after a good faith effort, we
cannot comply with the state statute, the offer will not be made to, nor will
tenders be accepted from or on behalf of, the holders of the DTM common stock in
that state.

     NO PERSON HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO GIVE ANY INFORMATION OR MAKE ANY
REPRESENTATION ON OUR BEHALF OTHER THAN AS CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT OR IN THE
LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND, IF ANY INFORMATION OR REPRESENTATION IS GIVEN OR
MADE, IT SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS HAVING BEEN AUTHORIZED.

     We have filed with the SEC (1) a Schedule TO, together with all exhibits,
pursuant to Section 14(d)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14d-3, furnishing
certain information with respect to the

offer and (2) a Schedule 13D, pursuant to Section 13(d)(1) of the Exchange Act.
In addition, DTM has filed with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement,
together with exhibits, pursuant to Rule 14d-9 of the Exchange Act, setting
forth the recommendations of DTM's board of directors with respect to the offer
and the reasons for such recommendations and furnishing certain additional
related information. The schedule TO, Schedule 13D and
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement, and any amendments thereto, including
exhibits, may be examined and copies may be obtained from the SEC in the same
manner as set forth in Section 8 -- "Information Concerning DTM" (except that
they will not be available at the regional offices of the SEC).

Offer to Purchase dated April 30, 2001 (the "Offer to Purchase") and in this
Letter of Transmittal (which, together with any supplements and amendments,
collectively, constitute the "Offer"). Receipt of the Offer is hereby
acknowledged. The undersigned will not be obligated to pay brokerage fees or
commissions or, except as set forth in Instruction 6 of this Letter of
Transmittal, stock transfer taxes on the transfer and sale of Shares pursuant to
the Offer. The Purchaser will pay all fees and expenses of U.S. Stock Transfer
Corporation, as Depositary (the "Depositary"), A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., as
Dealer Manager ("Dealer Manager") and Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc.,
as Information Agent (the "Information Agent"), incurred in connection with the
Offer. The undersigned understands that the Purchaser reserves the right to
transfer or assign, in whole or from time to time in part, to one or more of its
affiliates, the right to purchase all or any portion of the Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer.

     Upon the terms and conditions of the Offer and subject to, and effective
upon, acceptance for payment for the Shares tendered herewith in accordance with
the terms of the Offer, the undersigned hereby sells, assigns and transfers to,
or upon the order of, the Purchaser all right, title and interest in and to all

distributions (including any and all other Shares or other securities) or rights
declared, paid or issued with respect to the tendered Shares on or after April
30, 2001 and payable or distributable to the undersigned on a date prior to the
transfer to the name of the Purchaser or nominee or transferee of the Purchaser
on the Company's stock transfer records of the Shares (and all such other Shares
or securities) tendered herewith, and appoints the Depositary the true and
lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of the undersigned with respect to such Shares
(and all such other Shares or securities) with full power of substitution (such
power of attorney being deemed to be an irrevocable power coupled with an
interest) to (a) deliver such Share certificates or transfer ownership of such
Shares (and all such other Shares or securities) on the account books maintained

accompanying evidences of transfer and authenticity, to the Depositary for the
account of the Purchaser upon receipt by the Depositary of the purchase price,

     By executing this Letter of Transmittal, the undersigned irrevocably
appoints the Purchaser, its officers and its designees, and each of them, as the
attorneys-in-fact and proxies of the undersigned, with full power of
substitution, in the manner set forth in this Letter of Transmittal, to the full
extent of such shareholder's rights with respect to the Shares tendered by the
undersigned and accepted for payment by the Purchaser (and with respect to any
and all other Shares or other securities issued or issuable in respect of the
Shares on or after April 30, 2001). All such powers of attorney and proxies
shall be considered irrevocable and coupled with an interest in the tendered
Shares. Such appointment will be effective if, when and only to the extent that,
the Purchaser accepts such Shares for payment. Upon such acceptance for payment,
all prior powers of attorney and proxies given by the undersigned with respect
to the Shares (and such other Shares and securities) will, without further
action, be revoked, and no subsequent powers of attorney, proxies or written
consents may be given or executed (and if given or executed will not be deemed
effective with respect thereto by the undersigned). The Purchaser, its officers
and its designees will, with respect to the Shares (and such other Shares and
securities) for which such appointment is effective, be empowered to exercise
all voting and other rights of the undersigned as they in their sole discretion
may deem proper at any annual or special meeting of the Company's shareholders
or any adjournment or postponement thereof, by written consent in lieu of any
such meeting or otherwise. The Purchaser reserves the right to require that, in
order for Shares to be deemed validly tendered, immediately upon the Purchaser's
payment for such Shares, the Purchaser must be able to exercise full voting
rights with respect to such Shares and other securities, including voting at any
meeting of shareholders or acting by written consent without a meeting.

     The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that (a) the undersigned has
full power and authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer the Shares (and
all such other Shares or securities) tendered hereby, (b) the undersigned

owns the tendered Shares within the meaning of Rule 14e-4 promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), (c) the tender
of the tendered Shares complies with Rule 14e-4 under the Exchange Act, and (d)
when the Shares (and all such other Shares or securities) are accepted for
payment by the Purchaser, the Purchaser will acquire good, marketable and
unencumbered title to the Shares (and all such other Shares or securities), free
and clear of all liens, restrictions, charges and encumbrances, and the same
will not be subject to any adverse claim. The undersigned, upon request, will
execute and deliver any additional documents deemed by the Depositary or the
Purchaser to be necessary or desirable to complete the sale, assignment and
transfer of the Shares (and all such other Shares or securities) tendered
hereby.

     All authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred shall not be
affected by and shall survive the death or incapacity of the undersigned and any
obligation of the undersigned hereunder shall be binding upon the heirs,
personal representatives, successors and assigns of the undersigned. Except as
stated in the Offer, this tender is irrevocable.

     The undersigned understands that valid tenders of Shares pursuant to any of
the procedures described in Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase and in the
instructions hereto and acceptance for payment of such Shares will constitute a
binding agreement between the undersigned and the Purchaser upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer, including without limitation
the undersigned's representation that the undersigned owns the Shares (and all
such other Shares or securities) being tendered. Without limiting the foregoing,
if the price to be paid in the Offer is amended as described in the Offer to
Purchase, the price to be paid to the undersigned will be the amended price
regardless of the price stated in this Letter of Transmittal. The undersigned
recognizes that under certain circumstances set forth in the Offer to Purchase,
the Purchaser may not be required to accept for payment any of the Shares
tendered hereby.

     Unless otherwise indicated herein under "Special Payment Instructions,"
please issue the check for the purchase price and/or issue or return any
certificate(s) for Shares not tendered or not accepted for payment in the
name(s) of the undersigned (and, in the case of Shares tendered by book-entry
transfer, by credit to the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility
designated above). Similarly, unless otherwise indicated herein under "Special
Delivery Instructions," please mail the check for the purchase price and/or any
certificate(s) for Shares not tendered or not accepted for payment (and
accompanying documents, as appropriate) to the undersigned at the address shown

Delivery Instructions and the Special Payment Instructions are completed, please
issue the check for the purchase price and/or any certificate(s) for Shares not
tendered or accepted for payment in the name of, and deliver such check and/or
such certificates to, the person(s) so indicated. The undersigned recognizes
that the Purchaser has no obligation, pursuant to the Special Payment
Instructions, to transfer any Shares from the name(s) of the registered
holder(s) thereof if the Purchaser does not accept for payment any of the Shares
so tendered.

                                  INSTRUCTIONS

              FORMING PART OF THE TERM AND CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

     1. GUARANTEE OF SIGNATURES. No signature guarantee is required on this
Letter of Transmittal (a) if this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the
registered holder(s) (which term, for purposes of this document, shall include
any participant in the Book-Entry Transfer Facility whose name appears on a
security position listing as the owner of Shares) of Shares tendered herewith,
unless such holder(s) has completed either the box entitled "Special Payment
Instructions" or the box entitled "Special Delivery Instructions" above, or (b)
if such Shares are tendered for the account of a firm which is a bank, broker,
dealer, credit union, savings association or other entity which is a member in
good standing of a recognized Medallion Signature Guarantee Program (each of the
foregoing being referred to as an "Eligible Institution"). In all other cases,
all signatures on this Letter of Transmittal must be guaranteed by an Eligible
Institution. See Instruction 5 of this Letter of Transmittal.

     2. REQUIREMENTS OF TENDER; DELIVERY OF LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND
SHARES. This Letter of Transmittal is to be completed by shareholders either if
certificates are to be forwarded herewith or, unless an Agent's Message is
utilized, if tenders are to be made pursuant to the procedure for tender by
book-entry transfer set forth in Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase. Share
certificates for all physically delivered Shares, or timely confirmation (a
"Book-Entry Confirmation") of a book-entry transfer of such Shares into the
Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility, as well as this Letter
of Transmittal (or a facsimile hereof), properly completed and duly executed
with any required signature guarantees, or an Agent's Message in connection with
a book-entry transfer, and any other documents required by this Letter of
Transmittal, must be received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set
forth on the front page of this Letter of Transmittal on or prior to the
Expiration Date (as defined in Section 1 of the Offer to Purchase). Shareholders
whose Share certificates are not immediately available or who cannot deliver
their Share certificates and all other required documents to the Depositary on
or prior to the Expiration Date or who cannot complete the procedure for
delivery by book-entry transfer on a timely basis may tender their Shares by
properly completing and duly executing a Notice of Guaranteed Delivery pursuant
to the guaranteed delivery procedure (as set forth in Section 2 of the Offer to
Purchase). Pursuant to such procedure: (a) such tender must be made by or
through an Eligible Institution; (b) a properly completed and duly executed
Notice of Guaranteed Delivery, substantially in the form made available by the
Purchaser, must be received by the Depositary on or prior to the Expiration
Date; and (c) the Share certificates for all physically delivered Shares (or a
Book-Entry Confirmation) representing all tendered Shares, in proper form for
transfer, in each case together with the Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile
thereof), properly completed and duly executed with any required signature
guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry delivery, an Agent's Message) and
any other documents required by this Letter of Transmittal, must be received by
the Depositary within three Nasdaq National Market trading days after the date
of execution of such Notice of Guaranteed Delivery. If Share certificates are
forwarded separately to the Depositary, a properly completed and duly executed
Letter of Transmittal must accompany each such delivery.

     THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, SHARE CERTIFICATES
AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH THE BOOK-ENTRY
TRANSFER FACILITY, IS AT THE OPTION AND RISK OF THE TENDERING SHAREHOLDER
(INCLUDING, IN THE CASE OF BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER, BY BOOK-ENTRY CONFIRMATION).
DELIVERY WILL BE DEEMED MADE ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY. IF
DELIVERY IS BY MAIL, REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, PROPERLY
INSURED, IS RECOMMENDED. IN ALL CASES, SUFFICIENT TIME SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO
ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY.

     No alternative, conditional or contingent tenders will be accepted, and no
fractional Shares will be purchased (unless you are tendering all of the Shares
you own). All tendering shareholders, by execution of this Letter of Transmittal
(or a facsimile hereof), waive any right to receive any notice of the acceptance
of their Shares for payment.

     3. INADEQUATE SPACE. If the space provided herein is inadequate, the
certificate numbers and/or the number of Shares and any other required
information should be listed on a separate signed schedule attached hereto.

     4. PARTIAL TENDERS (NOT APPLICABLE TO SHAREHOLDERS WHO TENDER BY BOOK-ENTRY
TRANSFER). If fewer than all of the Shares evidenced by any Share certificate
delivered to the Depositary are to be tendered, fill in the number of Shares
which are to be tendered in the box entitled "Number of Shares Tendered." In
such a case, new Share certificates for the Shares that were evidenced by your
old Share certificates, but were not tendered by you, will be sent to you
(unless otherwise provided in the appropriate box on this Letter of Transmittal)
as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date. All Shares represented by
Share certificates delivered to the Depositary will be deemed to have been
tendered unless otherwise indicated.

     5. SIGNATURES ON LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL; STOCK POWERS AND ENDORSEMENTS. If
this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the Shares
tendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond with the name(s) as written on
the face of the certificate(s) without alteration, enlargement or any change
whatsoever.

     If any of the Shares tendered hereby are owned of record by two or more
joint owners, all such owners must sign this Letter of Transmittal.

     If any of the tendered Shares are registered in different names on several
certificates, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many separate
Letters of Transmittal as there are different registrations of certificates.

     If this Letter of Transmittal or any certificates or stock powers are
signed by trustees, executors, administrators, guardians, attorneys-in-fact,
officers of corporations or others acting in a fiduciary or representative
capacity, such persons should so indicate when signing, and proper evidence
satisfactory to the Purchaser of their authority so to act must be submitted.

     If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the
Shares listed and transmitted hereby, no endorsements of certificates or
separate stock powers are required unless payment is to be made to or
certificates for Shares not tendered or not purchased are to be issued in the
name of a person other than the registered holder(s). Signatures on such
certificates or stock powers must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.

     If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by a person other than the
registered holder(s) of the certificate(s) listed, the certificate(s) must be
endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case signed
exactly as the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appear(s) on the
certificate(s) for such Shares. Signatures on such certificates or stock powers
must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.

     6. STOCK TRANSFER TAXES. Except as otherwise provided in this Instruction
6, the Purchaser will pay or cause to be paid any stock transfer taxes with
respect to the transfer and sale of Shares to it or its order pursuant to the
Offer. If, however, payment of the purchase price is to be made to, or if
certificate(s) for Shares not tendered or accepted for payment are to be
registered in the name of, any person other than the registered holder(s), if a
transfer tax is imposed for any reason other than the sale or transfer of Shares
to the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer, or if tendered certificate(s) are
registered in the name of any person other than the person(s) signing this
Letter of Transmittal, the amount of any stock transfer taxes (whether imposed
on the registered holder(s) or such person) payable on account of the transfer
to such person will be deducted from the purchase price unless satisfactory
evidence of the payment of such taxes or an exemption therefrom is submitted.

     7. SPECIAL PAYMENT AND DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS. If the check for the purchase
price of any Shares purchased is to be issued in the name of, or any Shares not
tendered or not purchased are to be returned to, a person other than the
person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal or if the check or any certificates
for Shares not tendered or not purchased are to be mailed to someone other than
the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal or to the person(s) signing
this Letter of Transmittal at an address other than that shown above, the
appropriate boxes on this Letter of Transmittal should be completed.

     8. WAIVER OF CONDITIONS. The conditions of the Offer may be waived by the
Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in its sole
discretion.

     9. SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9. Each tendering shareholder is required to provide
the Depositary with a correct Taxpayer Identification Number ("TIN"), generally
the shareholder's Social Security Number or federal Employer Identification
Number, on Substitute Form W-9 above. Failure to provide the information on the
form may subject the tendering shareholder to 31% federal income tax withholding
on the payment of the purchase price. The box in Part 3 of the form may be
checked if the tendering shareholder has not been issued a TIN and has applied
for a number or intends to apply for a number in the near future. If the box in
Part 3 is checked and the Depositary is not provided with a TIN by the time of
payment, the Depositary will withhold 31% of all payments of the purchase price
thereafter until a TIN is provided to the Depositary.

     Under the federal income tax law, a shareholder whose tendered Shares are
accepted for purchase is required by law to provide the Depositary (as payer)
with such shareholder's correct TIN on Substitute Form W-9 above. If such
shareholder is an individual, the TIN is his or her Social Security Number. If a
shareholder fails to provide the correct TIN to the Depositary, such shareholder
may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. In
addition, payments that are made to such shareholder with respect to Shares
purchased pursuant to the Offer may be subject to backup withholding of 31%.

     Certain shareholders (including, among others, all corporations and certain
foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and reporting
requirements. In order for a foreign individual to qualify as an exempt
recipient, the shareholder must submit a Form W-8, signed under penalties of
perjury, attesting to that individual's

exempt status. A Form W-8 can be obtained from the Depositary. See the enclosed
Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute
Form W-9 for additional instructions.

     If backup withholding applies, the Depositary is required to withhold 31%
of any such payments made to the shareholder or other payee. Backup withholding
is not an additional tax. Rather, the tax liability of persons subject to backup
withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding
results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained from the Internal
Revenue Service.

     The box in Part III the Substitute Form W-9 may be checked if the tendering
shareholder has not been issued a TIN and has applied for a TIN or intends to
apply for a TIN in the near future. If the box in Part III is checked, the
shareholder or other payee must also complete the Certificate of Awaiting
Taxpayer Identification Number on the Substitute Form W-9 in order to avoid
backup withholding. Notwithstanding that the box in Part III is checked and the
Certificate of Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number is completed, the
Depositary will withhold 31% of all payments made prior to the time a properly
certified TIN is provided to the Depositary.

     The shareholder is required to give the Depositary the Social Security
Number or Employer Identification Number of the record owner of the Shares or of
the last transferee appearing on the transfers attached to, or endorsed on, the
Shares. If the Shares are in more than one name or are not in the name of the
actual owner, consult the enclosed Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer
Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9 for additional guidance on which
number to report.

     10. REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE OR ADDITIONAL COPIES. Questions or requests for
assistance may be directed to the Information Agent or Dealer Manager at their
respective addresses and telephone numbers set forth below. Additional copies of
the Offer to Purchase, this Letter of Transmittal and the Notice of Guaranteed
Delivery may also be obtained from the Information Agent at its address and
telephone number set forth below, or from brokers, dealers, commercial banks or
trust companies.

     11. LOST, DESTROYED OR STOLEN CERTIFICATES. If any certificate evidencing
Shares has been lost, destroyed or stolen, the shareholder should promptly
notify the Depositary. The shareholder will then be instructed as to the steps
that must be taken in order to replace the certificate. This Letter of
Transmittal and related documents cannot be processed until the procedures for
replacing lost or destroyed certificates have been followed.

     IMPORTANT: THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL (OR A FACSIMILE HEREOF), TOGETHER
WITH SHARE CERTIFICATES OR CONFIRMATION OF BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER OR THE NOTICE OF
GUARANTEED DELIVERY, AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE
DEPOSITARY ON OR PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE.

approval is required by applicable law). Accordingly, the Board of Directors of
the Company unanimously recommends that the Company's shareholders accept the
Offer and tender their Shares of common stock pursuant to the Offer.

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (including, if
the Offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any such extension
or amendment), the Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted for payment, and
will pay for, all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to
the Expiration Date when, as and if the Purchaser gives oral or written notice
to the Depositary of the Purchaser's acceptance of such Shares for payment
pursuant to the Offer. Payment for shares purchased pursuant to the Offer will
be made only after timely receipt by the Depositary of certificates for such
Shares (or confirmation of a book-entry transfer of such Shares into the
Depositary's account at DTC (as described in the Offer to purchase)), a properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof)
(unless, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message (as defined in
the Offer to Purchase) is utilized) and any other documents required by the
Letter of Transmittal.

     In order to take advantage of the Offer, (i) a duly executed and properly
completed Letter of Transmittal with any required signature guarantees, or an
Agent's Message (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) in connection with a
book-entry delivery of Shares, and any other required documents should be sent

     If holders of Shares wish to tender, but it is impracticable for them to

Expiration Date or to comply with the book-entry transfer procedure on a timely
basis, a tender may be effected by following the guaranteed delivery procedures
specified in Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase.

     The Purchaser will not pay any commissions or fees to any broker, dealer or
other person (other than the Depositary and the Information Agent as described
in the Offer to Purchase) in connection with the

companies for reasonable and necessary clerical and mailing expenses incurred by

To Our Clients:

     Enclosed for your consideration is an Offer to Purchase dated April 30,
2001 (the "Offer to Purchase") and the related Letter of Transmittal relating to
an offer by Tiger Deals, Inc. (the "Purchaser"), a Delaware corporation and an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of 3D Systems Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common
stock, par value $0.0002 per share, of DTM Corporation, a Texas corporation (the
"Company"), (the "Shares") at a purchase price of $5.80 per Share (such price,
or such higher price per Share as may be paid in the Offer, being referred to
herein as the Offer Price), net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon
and less any required withholding taxes, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase and in the related Letter of
Transmittal (which, together with any supplements or amendments, collectively
constitute the "Offer"). WE ARE THE HOLDER OF RECORD OF SHARES HELD BY US FOR
YOUR ACCOUNT. A TENDER OF SUCH SHARES CAN BE MADE ONLY BY US PURSUANT TO YOUR
INSTRUCTIONS. THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL IS FURNISHED TO YOU FOR YOUR INFORMATION
ONLY AND CANNOT BE USED BY YOU TO TENDER SHARES HELD BY US FOR YOUR ACCOUNT.

     We request instructions as to whether you wish to have us tender on your
behalf any or all of such Shares held by us for your account, pursuant to the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer.

     Your attention is directed to the following:

     1. The Offer Price is $5.80 per Share, net to you in cash, without interest
thereon.

     2. The Offer is being made for all outstanding Shares.

     3. The Offer and withdrawal rights will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York
City time, on May 29, 2001 unless the Offer is extended.

     4. The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, there being validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn on or prior to the Expiration Date (as
defined in the Offer to Purchase) a number of Shares which constitutes at least
sixty-seven percent (67%) of the outstanding Shares of the Company on a fully-

diluted basis (the "Minimum Condition"). The Offer is also subject to other
terms and conditions. See the "Introduction" and Section 14 of the Offer to
Purchase.

     5. The Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously approved the
Offer, the Merger, the Merger Agreement, the Tender and Voting Agreement (each
as defined in the Offer to Purchase), and the purchase of Shares contemplated by
the Offer and the Tender and Voting Agreement, and determined that the terms of
the Offer and the Merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, the
Company's shareholders, and has recommended acceptance of the Offer and approval
and adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company's shareholders (if such
approval is required by applicable law). Accordingly, the Board of Directors of
the Company unanimously recommends that the Company's shareholders accept the
Offer and tender their Shares of common stock pursuant to the Offer.

     6. Tendering shareholders will not be obligated to pay brokerage fees or
commissions or, except as set forth in Instruction 6 of the Letter of
Transmittal, stock transfer taxes on the transfer and sale of Shares pursuant to
the Offer. However, federal income tax backup withholding at a rate of 31% may
be required, unless an exemption is provided or unless the required taxpayer
identification information is provided. See Instruction 9 of the Letter of
Transmittal.

     The Offer is being made solely by the Offer to Purchase and the related
Letter of Transmittal and is being made to all holders of Shares. The Purchaser
is not aware of any state where the making of the Offer is prohibited by
administrative or judicial action pursuant to any valid state statute. If the
Purchaser becomes aware of any valid state statute prohibiting the making of the
Offer or the acceptance of Shares pursuant thereto, the Purchaser will make a
good faith effort to comply with any such state statute or seek to have such
statute declared inapplicable to the Offer. If after such good faith effort, the
Purchaser cannot comply with such state statute, the Offer will not be made to
(nor will tenders be accepted from or on behalf of) the holders of Shares in
such state. In any jurisdiction where the securities, blue sky or other laws
require the Offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the Offer shall be
deemed to be made on behalf of the Purchaser by one or more registered brokers
or dealers that are licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction.

     If you wish to have us tender any or all of the Shares held by us for your
account, please instruct us by completing, executing and returning to us the
instruction form contained in this letter. An envelope to return your
instructions to us is enclosed. If you authorize a tender of your Shares, all
such Shares will be tendered unless otherwise specified in such instruction
form. Your instructions should be forwarded to us in ample time to permit us to
submit a tender on your behalf on or prior to the Expiration Date. Holders of
Shares whose Share certificates are not immediately available or who cannot
deliver their certificates and all other required documents to U.S. Stock
Transfer Corporation, as depositary (the "Depositary"), or complete the
procedures for book-entry transfer on or prior to the Expiration Date must
tender their Shares according to the guaranteed delivery procedures set forth in
Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase.

     Payment for Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer will in all cases be
made only after timely receipt by the Depositary of (a) Share certificates or
timely confirmation of the book-entry transfer of such Shares into the account
maintained by the Depositary at The Depository Trust Company (the "Book-Entry
Transfer Facility"), pursuant to the procedure set forth in Section 2 of the
Offer to Purchase, (b) the Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof),
properly completed and duly executed with any required signature guarantees, or
an Agent's Message (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) in connection with a
book-entry delivery, and (c) any other documents required by the Letter of
Transmittal. Accordingly, payment may not be made to all tendering shareholders
at the same time depending upon when Share certificates for or confirmation of
book-entry transfer of such Shares into the Depositary's account at the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility are actually received by the Depositary.

This announcement is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer
to sell Shares (as defined below). The Offer (as defined below) is made solely
by the Offer to Purchase, dated April 30, 2001 (the "Offer to Purchase"), and
the related Letter of Transmittal, and any amendments or supplements thereto,
and is being made to all holders of Shares. Purchaser (as defined below) is not
aware of any state or jurisdiction where the making of the Offer or the
acceptance of the Shares is prohibited by any applicable law. If Purchaser
becomes aware of any valid state statute prohibiting the making of the Offer or
the acceptance of Shares pursuant thereto, Purchaser will make a good faith
effort to comply with such statute or seek to have such statute declared
inapplicable to the Offer. If, after such good faith effort, Purchaser cannot
comply with such state statute, the Offer will not be made to (nor will tenders
be accepted from or on behalf of) holders of Shares in any such state. In any
jurisdiction where securities, blue sky or other laws require the Offer to be
made by a licensed broker or dealer, the Offer shall be deemed to be made on
behalf of Purchaser by one or more registered brokers or dealers licensed under
the laws of such jurisdiction.

         NOTICE OF OFFER TO PURCHASE FOR CASH ALL OUTSTANDING SHARES OF
                                  COMMON STOCK
                                       of
                                 DTM CORPORATION

                               $5.80 NET PER SHARE

                                TIGER DEALS, INC.
                     AN INDIRECT WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF
                             3D SYSTEMS CORPORATION

         Tiger Deals, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Purchaser") and an indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of 3D Systems Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), is offering to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of
Common Stock, par value $0.0002 per share (the "Shares"), of DTM Corporation, a
Texas corporation (the "Company"), for $5.80 per Share (the "Offer Price"), net
to the seller in cash, without interest and less any required withholding taxes,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase
and in the related Letter of Transmittal (which together, along with any
amendments or supplements thereto, constitute the "Offer"). Shareholders who
tender directly to the Depositary (as defined below) will not be obligated to
pay brokerage fees or commissions or, subject to Instruction 6 of the Letter of
Transmittal, stock transfer taxes, if any, on the purchase of Shares by
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. Shareholders who hold their Shares through a
broker or bank should consult that institution as to whether it charges any
service fees or commissions. Purchaser is offering to acquire all Shares as the
first step in acquiring all of the outstanding capital stock of, and other
securities and equity interest in, the Company. Following consummation of the
Offer, Parent and Purchaser intend to effect the merger described below.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT 12:00 MIDNIGHT, NEW YORK CITY
         TIME, ON TUESDAY, MAY 29, 2001, UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
"Merger Agreement"), dated as of April 2, 2001, by and among the Company, Parent
and Purchaser, pursuant to which, as soon as practicable after the completion of
the Offer and satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the Merger (as defined
below), Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company and the Company will
continue as the surviving corporation and will become an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger"). At the effective time of the Merger (the
"Effective Time"), each Share then outstanding (other than Shares held in
treasury, by Parent, the Purchaser or any other subsidiary of Parent or by
dissenting shareholders who have properly exercised their appraisal rights) will
be canceled and converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash,
payable to the holder thereof, without interest, less any required withholding
taxes. If Purchaser, together with Parent, acquires, pursuant to the Offer, at
least 67% of the then issued and outstanding Shares, which is a condition to
closing the Offer, Purchaser will have sufficient voting power to approve the
Merger without the approval of any other shareholders and intends to effect the
Merger by a written consent of the shareholders. If Purchaser, together with
Parent, acquires, pursuant to the Offer, at least 90% of the then issued and
outstanding Shares, Purchaser intends to effect the Merger without a vote of the
Company's shareholders pursuant to Article 5.03.G. of the Texas Business
Corporation Act (a "Short-Form Merger").

     THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS (1) UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING THE OFFER AND THE
MERGER, (2) UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER IS ADVISABLE AND THAT THE
TERMS OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER ARE FAIR TO AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE
COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS, AND (3) UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDED THAT THE COMPANY'S
SHAREHOLDERS ACCEPT THE OFFER AND TENDER THEIR SHARES PURSUANT TO THE OFFER.

     Simultaneously with entering into the Merger Agreement, Parent and
Purchaser also entered into a Tender and Voting Agreement (the "Tender and
Voting Agreement") with certain shareholders of the Company (each, a "Signatory
Holder"), pursuant to which each Signatory Holder agreed to (a) tender all
Shares owned by it or him in the Offer, and (b) vote all of its or his Shares in
favor of the Merger Agreement and the Merger and against any alternative
acquisition proposal. Together, the Signatory Holders, as of April 26, 2001, own
approximately 52.6% of the outstanding Shares. According to the Company, as of
April 26, 2001, there were 7,127,397 Shares issued and outstanding.

     The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt by Parent of
financing necessary to fund all of its financial obligations in connection with
the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and there being validly tendered and not
withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (as defined below) that number of Shares
which constitutes 67% of the outstanding Shares, on a fully diluted basis, on
the date Shares are accepted for payment. As used herein, "fully diluted basis"
means the number of Shares outstanding, together with

The number of Shares which the Company may be required to issue pursuant to
outstanding options or other obligations then currently exercisable into Shares.
The Offer is also subject to other terms and conditions described in Section 1
of the Offer to Purchase.

     Hoak Breedlove Wesneski & Co. ("Hoak Breedlove"), the Company's financial
advisor, has delivered to the Company its written opinion, dated April 2, 2001,
that, as of that date and based on and subject to the assumptions and
limitations described in the opinion, the cash consideration to be received by
the Company's shareholders in the Offer and the Merger is fair, from a financial
point of view, to those shareholders. A copy of the written opinion of Hoak
Breedlove is contained in the Company's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection
with the Offer, a copy of which is being furnished to the Company's shareholders
concurrently with the Offer to Purchase.

     For purpose of the Offer, Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted for
payment, and thereby purchased, Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn if, as
and when Purchaser gives oral or written notice to U.S. Stock Transfer
Corporation (the "Depositary") of Purchaser's acceptance for payment of such
Shares pursuant to the Offer. Payment for Shares accepted for payment pursuant
to the Offer will be made by deposit of the purchase price therefor with the
Depositary, which will act as agent for the tendering shareholders for the
purpose of receiving payments from Purchaser and transmitting those payments to
the tendering shareholders whose Shares have been accepted for payment. In all
cases, payment for Shares tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer will be made only after timely receipt by the Depositary of (a)
certificates for (or a timely Book-Entry Confirmation (as defined in the Offer
to Purchase) with respect to) those Shares, (b) a Letter of Transmittal,
properly completed and duly executed, with any required signature guarantees
(or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message (as defined in the
Offer to Purchase)), and (c) any other documents required by the Letter of
Transmittal. Accordingly, tendering shareholders may be paid at different times
depending upon when certificates for, or Book-Entry Confirmations with respect
to, the Shares are actually received by the Depositary. Under no circumstances
will interest be paid on the purchase price to be paid by Purchaser for the
tendered Shares, regardless of any extension of the Offer or any delay in making
such payment.Tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable,
except that Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer may be withdrawn pursuant to
the procedures set forth below at any time prior to the Expiration Date, unless
such Shares were previously accepted for payment by Purchaser pursuant to the
Offer.

     For a withdrawal to be effective, a written telegraphic, telex or facsimile
transmission notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the Depositary at
its address set forth on the back cover of the Offer to Purchase. Any notice of
withdrawal must specify the name of the person who tendered the Shares to be
withdrawn, the number of Shares to be withdrawn and the name of the registered
holder of those Shares, if different from the name of the person who tendered
those Shares. If certificates evidencing Shares to be withdrawn have been
delivered or otherwise identified to the Depositary and unless those Shares have
been tendered by an Eligible Institution (as defined in the Offer to Purchase),
then, prior to the physical release of those certificates, the serial numbers
shown on the particular certificates to be withdrawn must be submitted to the
Depositary, and the signature(s) on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed
by an Eligible Institution, unless those Shares have been tendered for the
account of an Eligible Institution. If Shares have been tendered pursuant to the
procedures for book-entry tender as set forth in Section 2 of the Offer to
Purchase, any notice of withdrawal must also specify the name and number of the
account at DTC(as defined in the Offer to Purchase) to be credited with the
withdrawn Shares and must otherwise comply with the DTC's procedures. Any Shares
properly withdrawn will thereafter be deemed not to have been validly tendered
for purposes of the Offer. However, withdrawn Shares may be re-tendered at any
time prior to the Expiration Date by following one of the procedures described
in Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase.

     The term "Expiration Date" means 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on May
29, 2001, unless and until Purchaser, in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement, extends the period for which the Offer is open, in which event the
term "Expiration Date" will mean the latest time and date on which the Offer, as
so extended, expires.

     All questions as to the form and validity (including, without limitation,
time of receipt) of notices of withdrawal will be determined by Purchaser, in
its sole discretion, whose determination shall be final and binding. None of
Parent, Purchaser, the Depositary, Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc.
(the "Information Agent"), A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc. (the "Dealer Manager") or
any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or
irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or incur any liability for failure to
give such notification.

     Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Purchaser may
extend the Expiration Date to allow for the satisfaction or waiver of
unsatisfied and unwaived conditions, and under certain circumstances Purchaser
has agreed to extend the Offer until June 29, 2001, if, at the then scheduled
expiration date, all of the conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied or
waived. In lieu of extension, Purchaser may elect to provide a "subsequent
offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Oral or written notice of
any extension of the Expiration Date or the provision of a subsequent offering
period would be given to the Depositary and a public announcement would be made
by no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after
the previously scheduled expiration date. During an extension, all Shares
previously tendered and not withdrawn would remain subject to the Offer. During
a subsequent offering period, shareholders would not be able to withdraw Shares
previously tendered in the Offer and shareholders would not be able to withdraw
Shares tendered during the subsequent offering period.

     The receipt by a shareholder of cash for Shares pursuant to the Offer and
the Merger will be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax
purposes, and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local or
foreign tax laws. All shareholders are urged to consult with their own tax
advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Offer and the
Merger.

     The information required to be disclosed by paragraph (d)(1) of Rule 14d-6
under the Exchange Act is contained in the Offer to Purchase and is incorporated
herein by reference.

     The Company has provided Purchaser with mailing labels containing the names
and addresses of all record holders of Shares and with security position
listings of Shares held in stock depositories, together with all other available
listings and computer files containing names, addresses and security position
listings of record holders and beneficial owners of Shares. The Offer to
Purchase, the related Letter of Transmittal and other relevant documents will be
mailed to record holders of Shares, will be provided (for subsequent transmittal
to beneficial owners of Shares) to the brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust
companies and others whose names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on
these lists and may be mailed directly to beneficial owners.

     THE OFFER TO PURCHASE AND THE RELATED LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL CONTAIN
IMPORTANT INFORMATION WHICH SHOULD BE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE ANY DECISION IS MADE
WITH RESPECT TO THE OFFER.

     Questions and requests for assistance or additional copies of the Offer to
Purchase, Letter of Transmittal and any other tender offer documents may be
directed to the Information Agent or the Dealer Manager at their respective
telephone numbers and locations listed below, and copies will be furnished at
Purchaser's expense. Purchaser will not pay fees to any broker or dealer or
other person (other than the Information Agent and the Depositary) for
soliciting tenders of Shares pursuant to the Offer.

Dear Mr. Selzer and Mr. Strobel:

We are pleased to advise you that U.S. Bank has approved the credit
accommodations ("Facilities") described below.

The commitment letter is neither meant to be, nor shall it be construed as, an
attempt to define all of the terms and conditions involved in the financing.
Rather, it is intended only to outline certain of the basic points of our
understanding around which the final terms and documentation are to be
structured. U.S. Bank has not determined the entire range of provisions that may
be required in the final loan documentation, and therefore, further negotiations
adding to or modifying the general scope of these basic terms shall not be
precluded by the issuance of this commitment letter and its acceptance by
Borrower. U.S. Bank's commitment to make the Facilities available is subject to
the execution of definitive loan documentation acceptable to U.S. Bank and its
counsel. The facilities will be made available upon the closing of the tender
offer made by Tiger Deals, Inc. to purchase the outstanding shares of DTM
Corporation.

                                 consultation with the Borrower (which would
                                 not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to
                                 change the terms, structure, pricing, and/or

                            Confidentiality Agreement

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     In connection with the possible transaction (the "Proposed Transaction")
between DTM Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, "DTM") and 3D Systems
Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, "3D"), and in order to allow DTM
and 3D to evaluate the Proposed Transaction, each of DTM and 3D have and will
deliver to the other party hereto, upon the execution and delivery of this
letter agreement by such other party, certain information about its properties,
employees, finances, businesses and operations (such party when disclosing such
information being the "Disclosing Party" and when receiving such information
being the "Receiving Party"). All information (i) about the Disclosing Party or
(ii) about a third party (which information was provided to the Disclosing Party
subject to a confidentiality agreement with such third party) furnished by the
Disclosing Party or its Representatives (as defined below) to the Receiving
Party or its Representatives, whether furnished before or after the date hereof
in connection with the Proposed Transaction, and regardless of the manner in
which it is furnished, is referred to in this letter agreement as "Evaluation
Material." Evaluation Material shall not include, however, information which (i)
is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Representatives in violation of this
letter agreement; (ii) was available to the Receiving Party on a nonconfidential
basis prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party or its Representatives;
(iii) becomes available to the Receiving Party on a nonconfidential basis from a
person other than the Disclosing Party or its Representatives who is not
otherwise bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Disclosing Party or any
of its Representatives, or is otherwise not known to the Receiving Party to be
under an obligation to the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives not to
transmit the information to the Receiving Party; or (iv) was independently
developed by the Receiving Party without reference to or use of the Evaluation
Material. For purposes of this letter agreement, (i) "Representative" shall
mean, as to any person, its directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors
(including, without limitation, financial advisors, attorneys and accountants)
and debt and equity financing sources and their advisors and Representatives
(but shall not include any debt and equity financing sources that enter into a
confidentiality agreement reasonably

acceptable to the Disclosing Party, which either names Disclosing Party as a
third party beneficiary or to which Disclosing Party is made a party, and an
executed copy of which is provided to Disclosing Party); and (ii) "person" shall
be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, company,
partnership, other entity or individual.

     Subject to the immediately succeeding paragraph, unless otherwise agreed to
in writing by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party (i) except as required
by law, rule or regulation, shall keep all Evaluation Material confidential,
shall not disclose or reveal any Evaluation Material to any person other than
its Representatives who are actively and directly participating in its
evaluation of the Proposed Transaction or who otherwise need to know the
Evaluation Material for the purpose of evaluating the Proposed Transaction and
shall cause those persons to observe the terms of this letter agreement; (ii)
shall not use Evaluation Material for any purpose other than in connection with
its evaluation of the Proposed Transaction or the consummation of the Proposed
Transaction in a manner that the Disclosing Party has approved; and (iii) except
as required by law, rule or regulation, shall not disclose to any person (other
than those of its Representatives who are actively and directly participating in
its evaluation of the Proposed Transaction or who otherwise need to know for the
purpose of evaluating the Proposed Transaction, which Representatives it shall
cause to observe the terms of this agreement,) any information about the
Proposed Transaction, or the terms or conditions or any other facts relating
thereto, including, without limitation, the fact that discussions are taking
place with respect thereto or the status thereof, or the fact that Evaluation
Material has been made available to the Receiving Party or its Representatives.
The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of the terms of this
letter agreement by it and secondarily responsible for any breach of the terms
of this letter agreement by its Representatives. The parties agree that
notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, the existence of any
discussions shall not be disclosed in any court, governmental or other similar
proceeding except as expressly permitted herein.

     Notwithstanding the definition of Evaluation Material, nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to prohibit the Disclosing Party or the Receiving Party
from utilizing any information obtained pursuant to discovery or other
mediation, arbitration, court, or administrative proceedings even though such
information also was provided hereunder as Evaluation Material; provided that
neither the Disclosing Party or the Receiving Party shall utilize any Evaluation
Material in connection with such proceeding unless acquired in such proceeding.

     In the event that the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are
requested pursuant to, or required by, applicable law or regulation (including,
without limitation, any rule, regulation or policy statement of any national
securities exchange, market or automated quotation system on which any of the
Receiving Party's securities are listed or quoted) or by legal process to
disclose any Evaluation Material or any other information concerning the
Disclosing Party or the Proposed Transaction, the Receiving Party shall provide
the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such request or requirement in order
to enable the Disclosing Party (i) to seek an appropriate protective order or
other remedy, (ii) to consult with the Receiving Party with respect to the
Receiving Party's taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such request or
legal process, or (iii) to waive compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms
of this letter agreement. In the event that such protective order or other
remedy is not obtained, or the Disclosing Party waives compliance, in whole or
in part, with the terms of this letter agreement,

the Receiving Party or its Representative shall use good faith efforts to
disclose only that portion of the Evaluation Material which is legally required
to be disclosed and to cooperate with the Disclosing Party in its efforts to
obtain reliable assurance that all Evaluation Material that is so disclosed will
be accorded confidential treatment to the fullest extent available. In the event
that the Receiving Party or its Representatives, as the case may be, shall have
complied with the provisions of this paragraph, such disclosure may be made by
the Receiving Party or its Representatives, as applicable, without any liability
hereunder.

     For a period (the "Restricted Period") commencing with the date of this
letter agreement and ending on the earlier of (i) 15 months after the
termination of discussions between the parties with respect to a Proposed
Transaction and (ii) the occurrence of a "Significant Event" (as defined below),

written consent of the other party or its board of directors or any committee

          party or any subsidiary or division of the other party or of any such
          successor or controlling person;

     (b)  make, or in any way participate, directly or indirectly, in any
          "solicitation" of "proxies" to vote (as such terms are used in the
          rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")), or seek
          to advise or influence any person or entity with respect to the voting
          of any voting securities of the other party;

     (c)  make any public announcement with respect to, or submit a proposal or
          offer (with or without conditions) in connection with any of the
          foregoing;

     (d)  form, join or in any way participate in a "group" as defined in
          Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
          (the "Exchange Act"), in connection with any of the foregoing;

     (e)  otherwise act or seek to control or influence the management, Board of
          Directors or policies of the other party;

     (f)  take any action that could reasonably be expected to require the other
          party to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of any
          of the events described in clauses (a) through (e) above; or

     (g)  request the other party or any of its Representatives, directly or
          indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph.

During the Restricted Period, each party hereto shall promptly advise the other
party of any inquiry or proposal made to it with respect to any of the
foregoing. For purposes of this letter agreement, (i) "Significant Event" shall
mean, with respect to each of the parties hereto, any of (A) the acquisition by
any person or "13D Group" (as defined below) of beneficial ownership of "Voting
Securities" (as defined below) of such party representing 15% or more of the
then outstanding Voting Securities of such party; (B) the announcement or
commencement by any person or 13D Group of a tender or exchange offer to acquire
Voting Securities of such party which, if successful, would result in such
person or 13D Group owning, when combined with any other Voting Securities of
such party owned by such person or 13D Group, 15% or more of the then
outstanding Voting Securities of such party; or (C) the entry into by such
party, or determination by such party to seek to enter into, any merger, sale or
other business combination transaction pursuant to which the outstanding shares
of common stock of such party would be converted into cash or securities of
another person or 13D Group or 50% or more of the then outstanding shares of
common stock of such party would be owned by persons other than the then current
holders of shares of common stock of such party, or which would result in all or
a substantial portion of such party's assets being sold to any person or 13D
Group; (ii) "Voting Securities" shall mean, with respect to each party hereto,
at any time shares of any class of capital stock of such party which are then
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; provided, that for
purposes of this definition any securities which at such time are convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of common stock of such party shall
be deemed to have been so converted, exchanged or exercised; and (iii) "13D
Group" shall mean, with respect to the Voting Securities of each party hereto,
any group of persons formed for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or
disposing of such Voting Securities which would required under Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder to file a statement on
Schedule 13D with the SEC as a "person" within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3)
of the Exchange Act if such group beneficially owned Voting Securities
representing more than 5% of the total combined voting power of all such Voting
Securities then outstanding.

     For a period of two (2) years subsequent to the termination of discussions
between the parties with respect to the Proposed Transaction, neither party
shall, without prior written consent of the other party, directly or indirectly
solicit for hire, any person currently employed by the other party (or any of
its subsidiaries); provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not
prevent either party, without such consent, from employing any employee who (i)
contacts the hiring party directly at his or her own initiative without any
direct or indirect solicitation by or encouragement from the hiring party or
(ii) responds to a mass media solicitation or advertisement consistent with the
hiring party's past practices that is not directed at employees of the other
party.

     To the extent that any Evaluation Material may include material subject to
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable
privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental
investigations, the parties understand and agree that they have a commonality of
interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and
mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and
shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or
its continued

protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege. All Evaluation Material provided by a party that is
entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection
under these privileges to the fullest extent available under applicable law.
Nothing in this letter agreement obligates any party to reveal material subject
to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable
privilege.

     If either party hereto shall determine that it does not wish to proceed
with the Proposed Transaction, such party shall promptly advise the other party
of that decision. In that case, or in the event that the Disclosing Party, in
its sole discretion, so requests or the Proposed Transaction is not consummated
by the Receiving Party, the Receiving party shall, upon the Disclosing Party's
written request, promptly deliver to the Disclosing Party all Evaluation
Material, and, at the Receiving Party's election, return or destroy (provided
that any such destruction shall be certified by a duly authorized Representative
of the Receiving Party) all copies, reproductions, summaries, analyses or
extracts thereof, including any electronic or computer file copies, or based
thereon in the Receiving Party's possession or in the possession of any
Representative of the Receiving Party.

     Subject to the terms and conditions of a definitive agreement regarding the
Proposed Transaction and without prejudice thereto, each party hereto
acknowledges that neither it nor its Representatives nor any of the officers,
directors, employees, agents or controlling persons of such Representatives
makes any express or implied representation or warranty as to the completeness
of the Evaluation Material. The Receiving Party shall not be entitled to rely on
the completeness of any Evaluation Material, but shall be entitled to rely
solely on such representations and warranties regarding the completeness of the
Evaluation Material as may be made to it in any definitive agreement relating to
the Proposed Transaction, subject to the terms and conditions of such agreement.

     Until a definitive agreement regarding the Proposed Transaction has been
executed by the parties hereto and subject to the terms and conditions of that
certain letter agreement dated as of March 17, 2001 between the company and the
Interested Party (the "Exclusivity Agreement"), neither party hereto shall be
under any legal obligation or have any liability to the other party of any
nature whatsoever with respect to the Proposed Transaction by virtue of this
letter agreement or otherwise (other than with respect to the confidentiality
and other matters set forth herein). Subject to the terms and conditions of the
Exclusivity Agreement, each party hereto and its Representatives (i) may conduct
the process that may or may not result in the Proposed Transaction in such
manner as such party, in its sole discretion, may determine (including, without
limitation, negotiating and entering into a definitive agreement with any third
party without notice to the other party) and (ii) reserves the right to change
(in its sole discretion, at any time and without notice to such other party) the
procedures relating to the consideration of the Proposed Transaction (including,
without limitation, terminating all further discussions with the other party and
requesting that such other party return or destroy the Evaluation Material as
described above).

     Without prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available to either
party hereto, each party shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of
injunction or otherwise if the other party or any of its Representatives breach
or threaten to breach any of the provisions of this

letter agreement. In the event of litigation relating to this letter agreement,
if a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final order from which
there is no appeal that this letter agreement has been breached by a party or by
its Representatives, the breaching party or the party whose Representatives have
breached this letter agreement, as the case may be, will reimburse the other
party for its costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the enforcement of this
letter agreement and such litigation.

     It is further understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either
party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or
privilege hereunder.

     This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Texas, without giving effect to its principles or rules
regarding conflicts of laws, other than such principles directing application of
Texas law.

     This letter agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties
hereto concerning confidentiality of the Evaluation Material, and no
modification of this letter agreement or waiver of the terms and conditions
hereof shall be binding upon either party hereto, unless approved in writing by
each such party. This letter agreement supersedes and replaces the Mutual
Non-Disclosure Agreement dated January 25, 2000 entered into previously between
the parties; provided that the restrictions imposed by such previous letter
agreement shall remain in effect for periods prior to the date hereof.

     Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing and returning
to the undersigned the duplicate copy of this letter enclosed herewith.

Special Committee of the Board of Directors
DTM Corporation
c/o Anthony Mariotti, Director
Proactive Finance Group, LLC
221 West 6th Street, Suite 1520
Austin, TX  78701

Gentlemen:

     In consideration of, and reliance on, the following agreement by DTM
Corporation (the "Company"), 3D Systems Corporation (the "Interested Party") is
prepared to continue its discussions with the Company regarding a possible
transaction and to devote substantial resources to a due diligence investigation
of the Company and its assets.

     (1) From the date hereof until 5:00 p.m. Austin Texas time on April 2,
2001, the Company agrees (a) that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries shall,
nor shall it or any of its subsidiaries authorize or permit their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives (including, without
limitation, any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant,
consultant or other advisor, agent, representative or expert retained by or
acting on behalf of it or any of its subsidiaries) (collectively,
"Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, negotiate,
encourage, or provide confidential information to facilitate any inquiries or
the making of any proposal or offer (including, without limitation, any proposal
or offer to any of its stockholders) concerning, or that may reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Alternative Transaction (any such proposal or offer
being hereinafter referred to as an "Alternative Transaction Proposal"), (b)
immediately to terminate any and all discussions or negotiations in which it,
its subsidiaries or their respective Representatives may be involved with
respect to an Alternative Transaction, and (c) that it will notify the
Interested Party promptly if any such inquiries or proposals are received by,
any information or documents is requested from, or any negotiations or
discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of
its subsidiaries; provided, however, that (i) nothing contained in this letter
shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company (or any committee thereof)
from, to the extent applicable, complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act with regard to an Alternative Transaction Proposal and
(ii) nothing in this letter shall prohibit the Company and its subsidiaries and
Representatives from furnishing confidential information to and participating in
negotiations with a person making an unsolicited proposal for an Alternative
Transaction Proposal if (x) the furnishing of such confidential information or
the entering into negotiations is not the result of a breach of the Company's or
any of its subsidiaries' or its Representatives' breach of clause (a) above and
the Company meets all of its obligations hereunder, including giving notice and
information about the Alternative Transaction Proposal to the Interested Party,
and (y) the Company's Board of Directors reasonably determines in good faith
after consultation with its legal counsel that that the failure to furnish such
information would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties. The Company
agrees that prior to furnishing any such information to, or entering into any
discussions or negotiations with, any person or entity concerning an Alternative

Transaction Proposal, the Company shall (i) receive from such person or entity
an executed confidentiality agreement in customary form on terms not less
favorable to the Company than the confidentiality provisions contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement dated March 15, 2001between the Interested Party and
the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), providing for confidentiality of
information furnished by the Company, and (ii) provide written notice to the
Interested Party to the effect that it is furnishing information to, or entering
into discussions or negotiations with, such person or entity. The Company shall
provide the Interested Party with a summary of the terms of any Alternative
Transaction Proposal received by the Company, or its subsidiaries or
Representatives, which summary shall include all material terms of such
Alternative Transaction Proposal and the identity of the person or entity
proposing the same. For purposes of this letter, "Alternative Transaction" shall
mean any of the following involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries: (i)
any merger, consolidation, business combination or other similar transaction;
(ii) any agreement of sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or any
granting of any option or right or any other agreement or transaction which may
result in the disposition of 20% or more of the assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles; (iii) any tender offer, exchange offer or other
offer for 20% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company
or the filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, in connection therewith; (iv) the acquisition by any person or entity
of beneficial ownership or any right or option of any kind to acquire beneficial
ownership of, or the formation or existence of any "group" (as such term is
defined under Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) which beneficially owns,
or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of the then
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company; or (v) any public
announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of the foregoing or any
agreement or commitment to engage in any of the foregoing.

     (2) If, during any time prior to 5:00 p.m. Austin Texas time on May 30,
2001, the Board of Directors of the Company, in the exercise of their fiduciary
duties, shall have recommended an Alternative Transaction or taken any
Alternative Transaction, then the Company shall reimburse the Interested Party
for all actual, reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (not to exceed
$125,000) incurred by the Interested Party after the date of this letter
agreement in connection with the possible transaction between the Company and
the Interested Party.

     (3) The Company understands that the Interested Party will need to conduct
a due diligence review and the Company agrees to provide the Interested Party
and its Representatives with such information as is considered reasonable and is
mutually agreed to by both parties. Interested Party agrees to communicate
exclusively with the following persons regarding the possible transaction and
any due diligence requests: Anthony Mariotti, Director and member of the Special
Committee; the Company's outside representatives (e.g., financial advisers,
attorneys and accountants); and such other persons as the foregoing persons may
from time to time identify. In the event that disclosure about the possible
transaction between the parties is required

by applicable law, rule or regulation, the language of any statement shall, to
the extent practicable, be agreed to by the parties, which agreement will not be
unreasonably withheld.

     (4) The Company and the Interested Party hereby agree that the failure to
comply with the terms of this Agreement would cause irreparable harm that could
not be redressed by the payment of any monetary damages and that specific
performance and other equitable relief, including injunctive relief, would be
appropriate.

     (5) The Company hereby agrees to notify its Representatives of the terms of
this agreement and will direct them to comply with the terms of this Agreement.

     (6) This letter agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement of
even date herewith, contains the entire agreement between the parties hereto
concerning the subject matter herein, and no modification of this letter
agreement or waiver of the terms and conditions hereof shall be binding upon
either party hereto, unless approved in writing by each such party.

     Kindly sign in the space provided below to confirm your acceptance of the
foregoing.

Sincerely,
