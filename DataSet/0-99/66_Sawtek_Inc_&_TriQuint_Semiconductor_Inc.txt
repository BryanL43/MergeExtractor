    Sawtek designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of electronic signal processing components based on surface acoustic wave technology primarily for use in the wireless communications industry. Sawtek's primary
products are custom-designed, high performance bandpass filters, resonators, oscillators and surface acoustic wave-based subsystems. These products are used in a variety of microwave and radio frequency systems, such as CDMA and GSM digital wireless
communications systems, digital microwave radios, wireless local area networks, cable television equipment, internet infrastructure, various defense and satellite systems and sensors.

We are proposing a merger of TriQuint and Sawtek    

Q:
What is the proposed merger? (see page 51)

A.
In
the proposed merger, Sawtek will merge with a wholly owned subsidiary of TriQuint. Sawtek will survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of TriQuint. The merger agreement
is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as 
Annex A
. You are encouraged to read it carefully.

Q:
What will I receive in the merger? (see pages 51 and 83)

A.
Following
the merger: 

Sawtek
shareholders will receive, in exchange for each of their shares of Sawtek common stock, 1.1507 shares of TriQuint common stock. 

Each
option to purchase Sawtek common stock outstanding immediately before the completion of the merger will automatically become an option to purchase shares of TriQuint common stock. The number of
shares of TriQuint common stock which may be purchased under each assumed option will be equal to the product of the number of Sawtek shares that were purchasable before the merger multiplied by
1.1507. The exercise price per share will be the pre-merger exercise price divided by 1.1507 and rounded up to the nearest whole cent. 

Instead
of fractional shares in the merger, Sawtek shareholders will receive cash in an amount equal to the fraction multiplied by the average closing prices reported on the Nasdaq National Market for
TriQuint common stock for the two trading days immediately preceding the effective date of the merger. 

Q:
When do you expect the merger to be completed? (see page 83)

A.
TriQuint
and Sawtek are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. We hope to complete the merger no later than the end of the third calendar quarter of 2001.

Q:
Are there risks involved in undertaking the merger? (see page 23)

A.
Yes.
In evaluating the merger, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled "
Risk
Factors
" beginning on page [23].

Q:
Are there conditions to completion of the merger? (see page 90)

A.
Yes,
TriQuint's and Sawtek's respective obligations to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain specified closing conditions. If either TriQuint or
Sawtek waives any conditions, each company will consider the facts and circumstances at that time and make a determination whether a resolicitation of proxies from its respective stockholders is
appropriate.

Q:
Is the merger subject to governmental approvals? (see page 81)

A.
Yes.
This merger is subject to review by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to determine whether it is in compliance with applicable antitrust laws. Under
the provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the merger may not be consummated until the specified waiting period requirements of that act have
been satisfied.

Q:
What stockholder approvals are required for the merger? (see page 89)

A.
The
holders of a majority of the shares of TriQuint common stock present or represented by proxy at the stockholders' meeting must approve the issuance of TriQuint common stock in
the merger. 

The
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Sawtek common stock present or represented by proxy at the shareholders' meeting must adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. 

Q:
Are there any stockholders already committed to voting in favor of the merger and the share issuance? (see page 95)

A.
Yes.


TriQuint
stockholders who collectively hold approximately 0.6% of the outstanding TriQuint common stock as of April 30, 2001 entered into voting
agreements requiring them to vote all of their beneficially owned shares in favor of the issuance of TriQuint common stock in the merger.


Sawtek
shareholders who collectively hold approximately 5.2% of the Sawtek common stock outstanding as of April 30, 2001 entered into voting
agreements requiring them to vote all of their beneficially owned shares in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and in favor of the approval of the merger. 

Q:
Who will be the directors of TriQuint following the merger? (see page 79)

A.
Following
the merger, the board of directors of TriQuint is expected to consist of the seven current members of TriQuint's board of directors and two members of Sawtek's current
board, Steven P. Miller and Willis C. Young.

Q:
Who will be the executive officers of TriQuint following the merger? (see page 78)

A.
Following
the merger, the executive management team of TriQuint is expected to include:


Steven
J. Sharp, as chairman, president and chief executive officer;


Kimon
Anemogiannis, as president of the Sawtek subsidiary of TriQuint; and


Raymond
A. Link, as vice president of finance and administration, chief financial officer and secretary. 

Edson
H. Whitehurst Jr., TriQuint's current vice president, finance and administration, chief financial officer and secretary, is retiring. The other current officers of TriQuint and Sawtek will
retain their existing positions at the respective companies after the merger occurs. 

Our reasons for proposing the merger of TriQuint and Sawtek    

Q:
Why are TriQuint and Sawtek proposing the merger? (see page 54)

A.
TriQuint
and Sawtek are proposing the merger to create the opportunity for TriQuint and Sawtek to:


have
a combined complementary technology portfolio and engineering talent to design products for the entire radio front end of mobile phones;


offer
cost effective integrated radio frequency module solutions to the combined company's mobile phone customer base that reduce the number of components
and the failure rates of completed phones; and


develop
more complete solutions and better penetrate their combined customer base to take advantage of cross sales opportunities. 

Q:
Does the board of directors of TriQuint recommend voting in favor of issuing TriQuint shares in the merger? (see page 56)

A.
Yes.
After careful consideration, the members of TriQuint's board of directors who were present unanimously recommend that TriQuint stockholders vote in favor of the issuance of
TriQuint common stock to the Sawtek shareholders in the merger and the other proposals set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus for consideration 

at
the TriQuint special meeting of stockholders. 

Q:
Does the board of directors of Sawtek recommend voting in favor of the merger agreement and the merger? (see page 54)

A.
Yes.
After careful consideration, Sawtek's board of directors unanimously recommends that its shareholders vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the
proposed merger.

Q:
Do persons involved in the merger have interests which may conflict with mine? (see page 78)

A.
Yes.
When considering the recommendations of TriQuint's and Sawtek's respective boards of directors, you should be aware that certain Sawtek directors and officers have interests in
the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, yours. These interests include the employment of the Sawtek executive officers by TriQuint or the Sawtek subsidiary after the merger, the
appointment of
Steven P. Miller and Willis C. Young to the TriQuint board of directors and the indemnification of directors and officers of Sawtek against certain liabilities both before and after the merger.

Q:
Did TriQuint's and Sawtek's investment bankers render favorable opinions concerning the fairness of the exchange ratio from a financial point of view? (see
pages 59-78)

A.
Yes.

In
connection with the merger, TriQuint's board of directors considered the opinions it received from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and SG Cowen Securities
Corporation, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, on the date of such opinions to TriQuint, of the exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement. 

Sawtek's
board of directors considered the opinion it received from JPMorgan H&Q, a division of J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, on the date of
such opinion to the holders of Sawtek common stock, of the exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement. 

The
full text of the written opinions of JPMorgan H&Q, Merrill Lynch and SG Cowen are attached to the back of this document as 
Annex B,
Annex C
 and 
Annex D
, and should be read carefully in their entirety to understand the procedures
followed, the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in providing the opinions. The opinions of Merrill Lynch and SG Cowen are directed to the TriQuint board and
the opinion of JPMorgan H&Q is directed to the Sawtek board. These opinions do not address the prices at which TriQuint or Sawtek common stock will trade prior to or after the proposed merger and do
not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Sawtek common stock or TriQuint common stock as to how to vote with respect to any matter relating to the proposed merger. 

Steps for you to take now    

Q:
What do I need to do now? (see pages 45-50)

A.
After
carefully reading and considering the information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, please mail your signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope. 

If you do not include instructions on how to vote your properly signed proxy card, your common stock will be voted "FOR" approval of matters related to the
merger.

Your vote is important regardless of the number of shares that you own.

Q:
When and where will the votes take place? (see pages 45-50)

A.
Special meeting of TriQuint stockholders
.  The TriQuint special meeting will be held at TriQuint's headquarters at
2300 N.E. Brookwood Parkway, Hillsboro, Oregon 97124 on July 19, 2001, starting at 10:00 a.m., local time. 

Special meeting of Sawtek shareholders.
  The Sawtek special meeting will be held at Sawtek's headquarters at 1818 South Highway 441,
Apopka, Florida 32703 on July 19, 2001, starting at 10:00 a.m., local time. 

Q:
Should I send in my Sawtek stock certificates now? (see page 79)

A.
No.
After the merger is completed, TriQuint will send you written instructions for exchanging your Sawtek stock certificates for TriQuint stock certificates.

Q:
If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote my shares for me? (see pages 46 and 49)

A.
No,
your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by following the information provided to you by your broker.

Q:
What do I do if I want to change my vote? (see pages 46 and 49)

A.
You
can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at your special meeting. There are several ways for you to do this:


Send
written notice to the secretary of TriQuint or Sawtek (as appropriate) that you wish to revoke your proxy;


Send
a completed proxy bearing a date later than your original proxy prior to the vote at the special meeting; or


Attend
the meeting and vote in person. 

Q:
What happens if a Sawtek shareholder does not vote? (see page 46)

A.
If
a Sawtek shareholder fails to submit a proxy or vote at the special meeting, it will have the same effect as a vote against adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of
the merger. 

If
you return your proxy and do not indicate how you want to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. 

If
you submit a proxy and affirmatively elect to abstain from voting, your proxy will be counted as present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum but will not be voted at the special
meeting. Consequently, your abstention will have the same effect as a vote against adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. 

Q:
What happens if a TriQuint stockholder does not vote? (see page 49)

A.
If
you are a TriQuint stockholder and do not submit a proxy or vote at the special meeting, your shares will not be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence or
absence of a quorum and will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal to approve the issuance of TriQuint common stock in the merger or the remaining proposals considered at the special meeting. 

If
you submit a proxy and do not indicate how you want to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote to approve the issuance of shares of TriQuint common stock in connection with the merger. 

If
you submit a proxy and affirmatively elect to abstain from voting, your proxy will be counted as present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum but will not be voted at the special
meeting. Consequently, your abstention will have the same effect as a vote against the issuance of TriQuint's common stock in connection with the merger. 

Q:
Am I entitled to dissenters' or appraisal rights in connection with the merger? (see page 82)

A.
No.
Under Florida law, shareholders of Sawtek are not entitled to dissenters' or appraisal rights in connection with the merger. Similarly, under Delaware law, stockholders of
TriQuint are not entitled to dissenters' or appraisal rights in connection with the issuance of TriQuint common stock to Sawtek shareholders. 

Other matters to consider    

Q:
How do the market prices of TriQuint and Sawtek common stock compare? (see page 22)

A.
Shares
of TriQuint common stock and Sawtek common stock are listed on the Nasdaq National Market. TriQuint's trading symbol is "TQNT" and Sawtek's trading symbol is "SAWS." On
May 15, 2001, the last full trading day prior to the public announcement of the proposed merger, the last reported sale prices were:


$26.00
per share of TriQuint common stock, and


$26.01
per share of Sawtek common stock. 

On May 29, 2001 the last reported sale prices were:


$19.01
per share of TriQuint common stock, and


$21.49
per share of Sawtek common stock. 

TriQuint
and Sawtek urge you to obtain current market quotations. 

Q:
What are the expected United States federal income tax consequences of the merger? (see page 80)

A.
We
expect that, in general, TriQuint, TriQuint stockholders, Sawtek and Sawtek shareholders will not recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result
of the merger, except for gain or loss attributable to cash received by Sawtek shareholders instead of fractional shares. It is a condition to the merger that both TriQuint and Sawtek receive legal
opinions to the effect that the merger will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code. 

A description of the material United States federal tax consequences of the merger is set forth in "The MergerMaterial United States federal income tax
consequences." The tax consequences to each Sawtek shareholder will depend on the facts of that shareholder's own situation. Therefore, Sawtek shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors
to determine their particular tax consequences.

Q:
How will the merger be accounted for? (see page 81)

A.
TriQuint
intends to account for the merger as a "pooling of interests" for financial accounting purposes, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. As a result, the assets and liabilities of each of TriQuint and Sawtek will be carried forward to TriQuint at their recorded amount. The results of operations and cash flows of Sawtek will be
included in TriQuint's financial statements for 2001, if the merger occurs this year, and Sawtek's and TriQuint's historical reported operating results for prior periods will be combined and restated
as the operating results of the combined company.

Q.
What are the conditions that must be satisfied for the merger to occur? (see page 90)

A.
Completion
of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including:


holders
of a majority of the outstanding shares of Sawtek common stock must vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement and approving the merger; 


the
registration statement, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part, must be declared and remain effective by the Securities and Exchange
Commission;


no
law, regulation or order preventing the completion of the merger shall be in effect;


the
applicable waiting periods under antitrust laws must expire or be terminated;


each
company must receive an opinion from its tax counsel that the merger will qualify as a reorganization;


each
company must receive a letter from its independent auditors regarding the appropriateness of pooling of interests accounting treatment for the merger;


the
shares of TriQuint common stock to be issued in the merger must be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market; and


the
board of directors of TriQuint must have been increased from seven members to nine members, and two members of Sawtek's board of directors designated
by Sawtek shall have been appointed to fill the newly created vacancies. 

Q:
Does the merger agreement permit termination of the merger? (see page 92)

A.
Yes.
Sawtek and TriQuint may mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement without completing the merger. Additionally, either Sawtek or TriQuint may terminate the merger
agreement under any of the following circumstances:


if
the merger is not completed by November 30, 2001;


if
a final court order prohibiting the merger is issued and is not appealable;


if
the Sawtek shareholders do not adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger;


if
the TriQuint stockholders do not approve the share issuance in connection with the Merger; or


if
the conditions to completion of the merger would not be satisfied because of a breach of a representation or warranty in the merger agreement resulting
in a material adverse effect or a failure to comply in all material respects with a covenant or agreement in the merger agreement. 

TriQuint
may terminate the merger agreement if: 


Sawtek
or its representatives breach their agreement not to solicit alternative proposals for a business combination with Sawtek;


Sawtek's
board of directors withdraws or changes, in a manner adverse to TriQuint, its recommendation in favor of the merger;


Sawtek's
board of directors does not reaffirm its recommendation in favor of the merger within five business days after TriQuint requests reaffirmation as
provided for in the merger agreement;


Sawtek's
board of directors approves or recommends any acquisition proposal from a party other than TriQuint;


Sawtek
enters into any letter of intent or other agreement accepting any acquisition proposal from a party other than TriQuint; or


a
tender or exchange offer relating to the securities of Sawtek is commenced by a person unaffiliated with TriQuint, and Sawtek does not recommend that its
shareholders reject such offer within 10 business days after such offer is first made. 

Q:
Could payment of a termination fee be required in connection with the merger? (see page 93)

A.
Yes.
If the merger agreement is terminated upon some specified occurrences, Sawtek may be required to pay to TriQuint a 

termination
fee of $39.2 million. In addition, either party may be required to pay the other a fee of $1.5 million if the matters in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are not
approved by that party's stockholders and the merger does not occur as a result. 

Q:
May Sawtek negotiate with other parties? (see page 87)

A.
No.
Sawtek agreed, subject to limited exceptions for responses to unsolicited bona fide offers, not to initiate or engage in discussions with another party concerning a business
combination with a party other than TriQuint while the merger is pending. 

Nothing
in the merger agreement prevents the Sawtek board of directors from withdrawing or changing its recommendation in favor of the merger if, pursuant to a Superior Offer (as defined on
page 89 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus) from a third party, the board reasonably concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to so withdraw
or change its recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations. 

Q:
Are there restrictions on the ability to sell TriQuint stock received as a result of the merger? (see page 82)

A.
All
TriQuint common stock received by Sawtek shareholders in connection with the merger will be freely transferable unless the holder is considered an affiliate of either TriQuint
or Sawtek under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Shares of TriQuint held by affiliates may only be sold pursuant to a registration statement or an exemption from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act. 

Generally,
an affiliate is considered to be someone who is an executive officer or director of a company or someone who owns more than 10% of the outstanding stock of a company.

stock to be issued to Sawtek shareholders in the merger. This joint proxy statement/prospectus constitutes the prospectus of TriQuint filed as part of the registration statement. This joint proxy

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS    

You should not rely on forward looking statements in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. This joint proxy statement/prospectus and
the documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus contain forward looking statements within the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995 with respect to TriQuint's and Sawtek's financial conditions, operating results and businesses and on the expected impact of the merger on TriQuint's financial performance. We use words
such as "anticipates," "believes," "plans," "expects," "future," "intends," "may," "will," "should," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "continue" and similar expressions to identify such forward
looking statements. These forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
contemplated by the forward looking statements:

    Some
of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following
possibilities: 


combining
the businesses of TriQuint and Sawtek may cost more than we expect;


the
completion of the proposed merger may be materially delayed or prohibited;


general
economic conditions or conditions in securities markets may be less favorable than we currently anticipate;


expected
cost savings and revenue enhancements from the merger may not be fully realized within the expected time frame;


integrating
the businesses and corporate cultures of TriQuint and Sawtek and retaining key personnel may be more difficult than we expect;


contingencies
may arise of which we were not aware or of which we underestimated the significance;


our
revenues after the merger may be lower than we expect;


we
may lose more business or customers after the merger than we expect, or our operating costs may be higher than we expect;


the
amount (both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales) of TriQuint expenditures for research and development, selling, general and
administrative and capital acquisitions and improvements may be materially greater or less than those expected;


development
costs, anticipated completion, introduction and projected revenues from TriQuint's new and developing products and technologies may be
materially different than anticipated; or


the
potential disruption of TriQuint's and Sawtek's ongoing business and distraction of their respective management. 

    Some
of these factors and additional risks and uncertainties are further discussed under the other factors identified in this "Risk Factors" section beginning on page 23.
Because such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. TriQuint and Sawtek stockholders are cautioned
not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or the date of any document incorporated by reference. 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS    

    On May 23, 2001, TriQuint announced that it was revising its guidance regarding its expected revenues and operating results for the three months ending
June 30, 2001. TriQuint provided revised estimates of revenues of approximately $60 million to $65 million, gross margins of approximately 35%, net income to total revenues of
approximately 4% and net income per share of approximately $0.03. TriQuint also advised investors that its expectations for each of the three months ending September 30, 2001 and
December 31, 2001 may be consistent with TriQuint's revised forecast for the three months ended June 30, 2001. TriQuint cited the general economic slowdown, soft bookings and delays and
rescheduling of orders as primary factors affecting its outlook and anticipated operating results. 

    On
May 23, 2001 Sawtek also announced that it was revising its guidance regarding its expected revenues, gross profit margin and earnings per share for the three months ending
June 30, 2001. Sawtek projected its revenues to be between $17 million to $19 million, gross profit margin of 33% to 39% and earnings per share of $0.06 to $0.08 for the three
months ending June 30, 2001. Sawtek attributed the
downward revision in its guidance to a slowdown in the economy, significant reduction in demand for components for wireless phones, lower unit prices for its products in the current quarter, a
reduction in network spending by wireless phone operators, a delay in roll-out of next generation equipment and excess inventories held by its broadband customers.

SUMMARY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL DATA    

    We are providing the following summary unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial data to give you a better picture of what the results of operations and
financial position of the combined businesses of TriQuint and Sawtek might have looked like had the merger occurred at an earlier date. These statements give effect to the merger accounted for using
the pooling of interests method of accounting. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not show what the results of operations or financial position of TriQuint would have
been if the merger actually occurred on the dates assumed. In addition, this information is not an indicator of what TriQuint's future consolidated operating results or consolidated financial position
will be. 

How the pro forma financial data were prepared  

    The selected unaudited pro forma combined financial data give effect to the proposed merger on a pooling of interest basis. The unaudited pro forma combined
financial data are based on the respective historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which are incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The
unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet assumes that the merger took place on March 31, 2001 and combines TriQuint's March 31, 2001 unaudited consolidated balance sheet with Sawtek's
March 31, 2001 unaudited consolidated balance sheet. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations assume that the merger took place as of the beginning of the periods presented.
TriQuint's unaudited consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2001 has been combined with Sawtek's unaudited consolidated statement of income for the three
months ended March 31, 2001, which represents Sawtek's second quarter results. TriQuint's audited consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998 have been combined with Sawtek's audited consolidated statement of income for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The unaudited pro forma combined
statement of operations for the annual periods do not present like periods. The use of different closing dates is necessary as each entity has different year ends. The pro forma reporting with respect
to combining TriQuint and Sawtek's results with different fiscal year ends that are within 93 days and is in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission guidance. The periods combined
for the purpose of presenting the unaudited pro forma combined financial data are not necessarily indicative of the periods expected to be combined after the date of the closing of the merger. 

    The
unaudited pro forma combined financial data are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the combined financial position or results of
operation of future periods or the results that actually would have been realized had the entities been a single entity during these periods. The unaudited pro forma combined financial data are
derived from the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and
should be read in conjunction with those statements and related notes. See "Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements." 

These pro forma financial statements have been based on assumptions  

    We prepared these statements on the basis of assumptions described in the notes. The pro forma adjustments made in connection with the development of the pro
forma information are preliminary and have been made solely for purposes of developing such pro forma information for illustrative purposes necessary to comply with the disclosure requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations for future periods or the combined financial
position or the results that actually would have been realized had the entities been a single entity during these periods. 

Charges resulting from the acquisition  

    TriQuint and Sawtek estimate that they will incur direct transaction costs of approximately $7 million associated with the merger. The unaudited pro
forma combined balance sheet gives effect to such charges as if they had been incurred as of March 31, 2001, but the effects of these costs have not been reflected in the unaudited pro forma
combined statements of operations as they are non-recurring in nature. These charges will be reflected in TriQuint's consolidated financial statements in the period in which the merger is consummated. 

You should read these summary pro forma financial statements with the historical financial statements  

    The TriQuint summary unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial data should be read in conjunction with the TriQuint unaudited pro forma combined
condensed financial statements and the related notes, which begin on page  . They should also be read in conjunction with the audited and unaudited financial statements of TriQuint and
Sawtek which are incorporated by reference in this document. The TriQuint summary unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial data are not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of
operations and financial position would have been had the merger taken place on January 1, 2001, 2000, 1999 and 1998 or March 31, 2001, and do not indicate future results of operations
or financial position.

The
pro forma combined basic and diluted net income per share are computed by dividing pro forma combined net income by the pro forma combined weighted-average number of common and
common equivalent shares outstanding of TriQuint and Sawtek for each period at an assumed exchange ratio of 1.1507 shares of TriQuint common stock for each share of Sawtek common stock.

(2)
The
pro forma combined book value per share is computed by dividing pro forma combined stockholders' equity by the pro forma number of shares of common stock outstanding at the
balance sheet date at an assumed exchange ratio of 1.1507 shares of TriQuint common stock for each share of Sawtek common stock.

(3)
Shares
used in the diluted calculation of unaudited pro forma combined net income per share are adjusted for the effect of the combined net income position. TriQuint's net loss for
the year ended December 31, 1998 resulted in anti-dilutive shares not included in the dilutive less per common share amounts. TriQuint and Sawtek had pro forma combined net income for fiscal
year 1998, resulting in the 2,702 anti-dilutive shares of TriQuint becoming dilutive. 

Comparative Per Share Information    

    The following table summarizes per share information for TriQuint and Sawtek on a historical, pro forma combined and equivalent pro forma combined basis. The
following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of TriQuint and Sawtek, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of TriQuint and
Sawtek, the selected historical combined financial data and the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements included elsewhere or incorporated by reference in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if
the merger had been consummated as of the beginning of the periods presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial position of the combined companies. All per

The
unaudited pro forma combined basic and diluted net income per TriQuint common share data is based upon the unaudited pro forma combined net income divided by the unaudited pro
forma combined, weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding of TriQuint and Sawtek of each respective period at an assumed exchange ratio of 1.1507 shares of
TriQuint common stock for each share of Sawtek common stock. The unaudited pro forma combined and equivalent pro forma combined basic and diluted net income per TriQuint common share data are based
upon the unaudited pro forma combined net income divided by the unaudited pro forma combined weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding, respectively, of TriQuint and
Sawtek of each respective period, at an assumed exchange ratio of 1.1507 shares of TriQuint common stock for each share of Sawtek common stock. The unaudited pro forma combined net income for
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 combines TriQuint's fiscal year end of December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 with Sawtek's fiscal year end of September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. The unaudited pro forma combined and equivalent pro forma combined data for annual periods do not present like periods. The use of different closing dates is necessary as each entity has
different year ends. The pro forma reporting with respect to combining TriQuint and Sawtek's results with different fiscal year ends that are within 93 days is in accordance with Securities and
Exchange Commission guidance.

(2)
The
unaudited pro forma combined basic and diluted net income per TriQuint share is computed by dividing the unaudited pro forma combined net income for each respective period by
the unaudited pro forma combined weighted-average common and common equivalent shares outstanding for each respective period.

(3)
The
unaudited pro forma combined book value per TriQuint share is computed by dividing the unaudited pro forma combined stockholders' equity at the end of each respective period by
the number of combined common shares outstanding at the end of the period, at an assumed exchange ratio of 1.1507 shares of TriQuint common stock for each share of Sawtek common stock.

(4)
The
unaudited equivalent pro forma combined basic and diluted net income per Sawtek share amounts and the unaudited equivalent pro forma book value per Sawtek share amount are
calculated by multiplying the respective unaudited pro forma combined TriQuint per share amounts by an assumed exchange ratio of 1.1507 shares of TriQuint common stock for each share of Sawtek common
stock.

(5)
Shares
used in the diluted calculation of unaudited pro forma combined net income per share are adjusted for the effect of the combined net income position. TriQuint's net loss for
the year ended December 31, 1998 resulted in anti-dilutive shares not included in the dilutive loss per common share amounts. TriQuint and Sawtek had a pro forma combined net income position
for fiscal year 1998, resulting in the TriQuint 2,702 anti-dilutive shares becoming dilutive.

Because the market price of TriQuint common stock that a Sawtek shareholder will receive in the merger may increase or decrease before completion of the
merger, Sawtek shareholders are urged to obtain current market quotations.  

    DIVIDEND POLICY    

    Neither TriQuint nor Sawtek has paid cash dividends on their common stock. After the merger is completed, TriQuint does not anticipate paying any cash
dividends and is prohibited from doing so under its indenture with the trustee for its outstanding 4% subordinated convertible notes due 2007 and certain of its other agreements with lenders. 

RISK FACTORS    

In evaluating the merger, you should carefully consider the discussion of risks and uncertainties below and you should refer to the
matters discussed under the caption "Forward Looking Statements" in this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus on page 12.

By voting in favor of the merger, you will be choosing to invest in TriQuint common stock. An investment in TriQuint common stock involves a high degree of
risk. By voting in favor of the share issuance, current TriQuint stockholders will face dilution of their ownership interest in TriQuint. In addition to the other information contained in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, you should carefully consider all of the following risk factors relating to the proposed merger, the combined company, TriQuint and Sawtek in deciding whether to vote for
the merger.

Risks Related to the Merger  

The value of TriQuint common stock issued in the merger will depend on its market price at the time of the merger, and no adjustment will be made as a result of changes in the
market price of TriQuint or Sawtek common stock.  

    At the closing of the merger, each share of Sawtek common stock will be exchanged for 1.1507 shares of TriQuint common stock. This exchange ratio will not be
adjusted for changes in the market price of TriQuint common stock or Sawtek common stock. In addition, neither TriQuint nor Sawtek may terminate or renegotiate the merger agreement, and Sawtek may not
resolicit the vote of its shareholders, solely because of changes in the market price of TriQuint common stock or Sawtek common stock. Any reduction in TriQuint's common stock price will result in
Sawtek shareholders receiving less than current market value in the merger at closing. Sawtek shareholders will not know the exact then current market value of TriQuint's common stock to be issued to
them in the merger at the time of the special meeting of Sawtek shareholders. 

    The
market price of TriQuint's common stock, like that of the shares of many other technology companies, has been and is expected to continue to be volatile. For example, during the
twelve months ended on March 31, 2001, TriQuint common stock traded as high as $66.63 per share and as low as
$14.25 per share. The market price of TriQuint common stock is expected to continue to fluctuate significantly in response to various factors, including: 


announcements
of developments relating to TriQuint's business;


fluctuations
in TriQuint's operating results;


general
conditions in the semiconductor industry or the domestic and worldwide economies;


a
shortfall in revenue or earnings from securities analysts' expectations or other changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;


announcements
of technological innovations or new products or enhancements by TriQuint or its competitors;


TriQuint's
ability to protect and exploit its intellectual property;


developments
in patent, copyright or other intellectual property rights; and


developments
in its relationships with customers, distributors and suppliers. 

    In
recent years the stock market in general, and the market for shares of high technology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been
unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. There can be no assurance that the market price of TriQuint's common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future,
including fluctuations that are unrelated to TriQuint's performance. 

Sawtek executive officers and directors have interests that may influence them to support and approve the merger.  

    Some of the directors and executive officers of Sawtek will receive continuing indemnification against liabilities and have Sawtek stock, stock options and
employment offers that provide them with interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, your interests in the merger. In addition, upon the completion of the merger, if
terminated or constructively terminated, Messrs. Anemogiannis and Link will also be entitled to continue to participate in the Sawtek employee stock ownership plan and will be entitled to
receive severance payments. As a result, these directors and officers may be more likely to vote to adopt and approve the merger agreement and approve the merger than if they did not have these
interests. See the section entitled "The MergerInterests of Sawtek Directors and Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 79 of this document. 

TriQuint will face significant challenges in integrating TriQuint and Sawtek and, as a result, may not realize the expected benefits of the merger.  

    Integrating the operations, systems and personnel of TriQuint and Sawtek will be a complex process; and TriQuint is uncertain that the integration will be
completed in a timely manner or will achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. The challenges involved in this integration include: 


retaining
existing customers and business partners of each company;


retaining
and integrating management and other key employees of both TriQuint and Sawtek;


coordinating
research and development activities to enhance introduction of new products, services and technologies;


combining
product and service offerings effectively and quickly;


transitioning
all systems to a common information technology system;


persuading
employees that the business cultures of TriQuint and Sawtek are compatible;


offering
integrated products and services of TriQuint and Sawtek to each other's customers and partners;


bringing
together the companies' marketing efforts so that the industry receives useful information about the merger; and


developing,
maintaining and combining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies. 

    It
is not certain that TriQuint and Sawtek can be successfully integrated in a timely manner or at all or that any of the anticipated benefits will be realized. Risks associated with
the integration of the companies include: 


the
impairment of relationships with employees, customers and business partners as a result of the integration of management and other key personnel;


the
potential disruption of TriQuint's ongoing business and distraction of its management;


the
difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into the product and service offerings of TriQuint; and


unanticipated
expenses related to integration of the two companies. 

    The
combined company may not succeed in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the merger. The diversion of the attention of TriQuint's management
and any difficulties encountered in the process of combining the companies could cause the disruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of TriQuint's business. Further, neither TriQuint nor
Sawtek 

can assure you that the growth rate of the combined company will equal the historical growth rates experienced by TriQuint or Sawtek. 

If TriQuint does not successfully integrate Sawtek or the merger's benefits do not meet the expectations of investors or financial or industry analysts, the market price of
TriQuint common stock may decline.  

    The market price of TriQuint common stock may decline as a result of the merger if: 


the
integration of TriQuint and Sawtek is not completed in a timely and efficient manner;


perceived
benefits of the merger are not achieved as rapidly as, or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts;


TriQuint's
assumptions about Sawtek's business model and operations, considered on a stand-alone basis, such as the ability of Sawtek to introduce radio
frequency front end modules at cost-effective prices and to continue to execute its strategic plan, may prove incorrect;


the
effect of the merger on the combined company's financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts; or


significant
stockholders of TriQuint following the merger decide to dispose of their shares because the results of the merger are not consistent with their
expectations. 

Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the market price of Sawtek common stock and TriQuint common stock.  

    If the merger is not completed for any reason, Sawtek and TriQuint will be subject to a number of material risks, including: 


the
provision in the merger agreement which provides that Sawtek could be required to pay TriQuint a termination fee in the amount of $39.2 million;


the
market price of Sawtek common stock and TriQuint common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of such shares reflects a market
assumption that the merger will be completed;


costs
related to the merger, such as legal and accounting fees and a portion of the investment banking fees, must be paid even if the merger is not
completed;


benefits
that TriQuint expects to realize from the merger, such as the potentially enhanced competitive position of the combined company, would not be
realized; and


the
diversion of management attention from the day-to-day business of Sawtek, the scaling back of marketing and capital spending
and the unavoidable disruption to its employees and its relationships with customers and suppliers, during the period before consummation of the merger, may make it difficult for Sawtek to regain its
financial and market position if the merger does not occur. 

    If
the merger is terminated and the Sawtek board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, Sawtek shareholders cannot be certain that Sawtek will be able to find a
partner willing to pay an equivalent or more attractive price than the price to be paid by TriQuint in the merger. 

During the pendency of the merger, Sawtek may not be able to enter into a merger or business combination with another party at a favorable price because of restrictions in the
merger agreement.  

    Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, subject to specified exceptions, Sawtek is prohibited from entering into or soliciting,
initiating or encouraging any inquiries 

or proposals that may lead to a proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of substantial assets, tender offer, sale of shares of capital stock or other similar
transactions with any person or entity other than TriQuint. As a result of these prohibitions, Sawtek may not be able to enter into an alternative transaction at a favorable price. 

Uncertainties associated with the merger may cause Sawtek to lose key personnel.  

    Current and prospective Sawtek employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with TriQuint. This uncertainty may adversely affect Sawtek's
ability to attract and retain key management, sales, marketing and technical personnel. 

Failure to qualify for pooling of interests accounting treatment may harm the future operating results of the combined company.  

    If events occur that cause the merger to fail to qualify for pooling of interests accounting treatment, the purchase method of accounting would apply. Purchase
accounting treatment would have a negative impact on the reported operating results of the combined company. Under purchase accounting, TriQuint would record the estimated fair value of TriQuint
common stock issued in the merger in exchange for ordinary shares and vested options to acquire ordinary shares of Sawtek as the cost of acquiring Sawtek. A portion of the purchase price would be
charged to in process research and development expense. The remainder would be allocated to the net assets acquired, with the excess of the estimated fair value of TriQuint common stock issued in the
merger over the fair value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill or other intangible assets. This goodwill and other intangible assets would be amortized or written down in future periods as
charges reducing income. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued an Exposure Draft (Draft), 
Business Combinations and Intangible Assets-Accounting for
Goodwill
, that proposes significant changes to the current accounting for goodwill and intangible assets. Currently, the Draft would require companies to discontinue the
current practice of amortizing goodwill over its useful life and instead require companies to perform impairment tests when certain events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of goodwill may
be less than the carrying amount. The estimated fair value of TriQuint common stock to be issued in the merger is much greater than the historical net book value at which Sawtek carries its assets in
its accounts. 

The merger will result in substantial costs whether or not completed.  

    The merger will result in significant costs to TriQuint and Sawtek. Costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies are difficult to
estimate. Direct transaction costs are estimated at approximately $7.0 million. These costs are expected to consist primarily of fees for investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, filing fees
and financial printing. The aggregate amount of these costs may be greater than currently anticipated. A substantial amount of these costs will be incurred whether or not the merger is completed. 

TriQuint's certificate of incorporation and bylaws include anti-takeover provisions, which may deter or prevent a takeover attempt.  

    Some provisions of TriQuint's certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt, including a
takeover that might result in a premium over the market price for its common stock. These provisions include: 

    Stockholder proposals and nominations.
  TriQuint's stockholders must give advance notice, generally 120 days
prior to the relevant meeting, to nominate a candidate for director or present a proposal to its
stockholders at a meeting. These notice requirements could inhibit a takeover by delaying stockholder action. 

    Stockholder rights plan.
  The rights plan makes it more difficult and costly to acquire TriQuint without the consent of
the board of directors. 

    Preferred stock.
  TriQuint's certificate of incorporation authorizes its board of directors to issue up to five million
shares of preferred stock and to determine what rights, preferences and privileges such shares have. No action by TriQuint's stockholders is necessary before its board of directors can issue the
preferred stock. TriQuint's board of directors could use the preferred stock to make it more difficult and costly to acquire TriQuint. 

    Delaware anti-takeover statute.
  The Delaware anti-takeover law restricts business combinations
with some stockholders once the stockholder acquires 15% or more of TriQuint's common stock. The Delaware statute makes it harder for TriQuint to be acquired without the consent of its board of
directors and management. 

    In
addition, the Sawtek Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plan, or the KSOP, owned approximately 20% of Sawtek's outstanding common stock as of March 31, 2001 and would own
approximately 6% of the combined company's common stock if the merger had occurred on or before March 31, 2001. The KSOP trustee has the right to vote all of these shares. The KSOP trustee
votes the shares allocated to participants' accounts in accordance with the participants' voting directions and votes in its sole discretion with respect to the unallocated shares. If the KSOP trustee
were to vote against or oppose a proposed acquisition of the combined company, a potential acquirer might be discouraged from acquiring the combined company even though the holders of a majority of
the shares of its common stock were in favor of the acquisition. 

Risks Associated with Combined Company Operations  

Some executive officers and key personnel are critical to the business of the combined company and these officers and key personnel may not remain with the company in the
future.  

    The success of the combined company following the merger depends upon the continued service of some executive officers and other key personnel. Upon completion
of the merger, Raymond A. Link, Sawtek's chief financial officer and vice president of finance, will become TriQuint's vice president, finance and administration, chief financial officer and
secretary. Kimon Anemogiannis, chief executive officer and president of Sawtek, will remain the president of the Sawtek subsidiary of TriQuint. If the combined company loses the services of Steven J.
Sharp, president and chief executive officer of TriQuint, Mr. Anemogiannis or Mr. Link or one or more of its other executive officers or key employees, or if one or more of these
individuals decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with the combined company, the combined company's business, operating results and financial condition could be
seriously harmed. 

The combined company's operating results may fluctuate substantially, which may cause its stock price to fall.  

    TriQuint's and Sawtek's quarterly and annual results of operations have varied in the past, and the combined company's operating results may vary significantly
in the future due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, the following: 


cancellation
or delay of customer orders or shipments;


the
combined company's success in achieving design wins in which its products are designed into those of its customers;


market
acceptance of the combined company's products and those of its customers;


variability
of the life cycles of its customers' products; 


variations
in manufacturing yields;


timing
of announcements and introduction of new products by the combined company and its competitors;


changes
in the mix of products the combined company sells;


declining
average sales prices for the combined company's products;


ability
to integrate existing and newly developed technologies;


changes
in manufacturing capacity and variations in the utilization of that capacity;


variations
in operating expenses;


the
long sales cycles associated with customer-specific products;


the
timing and level of product and process development costs;


performance
of vendors and subcontractors;


realization
of research and development efforts;


variations
in raw material quality and costs;


delays
in new process qualification or delays in transferring processes;


the
cyclicality of the semiconductor and mobile phone component industries;


the
timing and level of nonrecurring engineering revenues and expenses relating to customer-specific products; and


significant
changes in the combined company's, its consignment warehouses and its customers' inventory levels. 

    TriQuint
and Sawtek expect that the combined company's operating results will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of these and other factors. Any unfavorable changes in
these or other factors could cause the combined company's results of operations to suffer as they have in the past, based upon some of these factors. Due to potential fluctuations, TriQuint and Sawtek
believe that period-to-period comparisons of their individual or the combined company's results of operations are not and will not be necessarily meaningful and should not be
relied upon as indicators of the combined company's future performance. 

    If
the combined company's operating results are not within the market's expectations, then its stock price may fall. The public stock markets have experienced, and are currently
experiencing, extreme price and trading volume volatility, particularly in high technology sectors of the market. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many
technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market
price of its common stock. 

The combined company will rely on a limited number of customers for a substantial part of its revenues.  

    Sales to a limited number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of each of TriQuint's and Sawtek's revenues in each fiscal period. TriQuint and
Sawtek expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of the combined company's total revenues in future periods. TriQuint and Sawtek each has
experienced periods in which sales to some of their respective major customers, as a percentage of total revenues, have fluctuated due to delays or failures to place expected orders. 

    Neither TriQuint nor Sawtek generally have long-term agreements with their respective customers. Customers generally purchase their respective products pursuant to
cancelable short-term purchase orders. TriQuint's and Sawtek's results of operations have been negatively affected in the past by the failure of anticipated orders to materialize and by
delays in or cancellations of orders. If the combined company were to lose a major customer or if orders by or shipments to a major customer were to otherwise decrease or be delayed, its results of
operations would be harmed. 

    A
few large customers have accounted for a significant portion of Sawtek's net sales. During the first six months of fiscal 2001, sales to Sawtek's top five and 10 customers accounted
for approximately 54% and 75% of its total net sales, respectively. Sales to Sawtek's top 10 customers accounted for approximately 72%, 70% and 76% of net sales in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. 

    Motorola,
Sawtek's largest customer, accounted for approximately 19% and 26% of its total net sales during the three and six months ended March 31, 2001, and Sawtek believes it
will continue to account for a high percentage of net sales during the remainder of fiscal 2001. Motorola accounted for 25% and 23% of net sales in fiscal years 2000 and 1999, respectively. 

The combined company's operating results may suffer due to fluctuations in demand for semiconductors and mobile phone components.  

    From time to time, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand, often in connection
with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions. This cyclicality has led to significant imbalances in demand, inventory levels and production
capacity. It has also accelerated the decrease of average selling prices per unit. TriQuint and Sawtek have experienced, and may experience again, periodic fluctuations in its financial results
because of these or other industry-wide conditions. TriQuint and Sawtek expect that the current decline in demand for semiconductor components and surface acoustic wave devices, including
theirs, could last throughout 2001, if not longer. For example, if demand for communications applications were to decrease substantially, demand for the semiconductor components and surface acoustic
wave devices in these applications would also decline, which would negatively affect the combined company's operating results. 

The combined company will depend on the continued growth of communications markets.  

    TriQuint and Sawtek derive all of their product revenues from sales of products for communication applications, specifically the mobile phone market, optical
market, broadband wireless market and other wireless markets. These markets are characterized by the following: 


intense
competition;


rapid
technological change; and


short
product life cycles, especially in the wireless market. 

    In
the last few years, the communications markets have grown rapidly; however, these markets may not continue to grow or may experience a significant slowdown. In general, the
communications markets are currently experiencing and may continue to experience softness, which will impact the combined company across all markets in which it operates. Additionally, if these
markets do not recover and demand for communications applications declines, the combined company's operating results could suffer. 

    Products
for communications applications are often based on industry standards, which are continually evolving. The combined company's future success will depend, in part, upon its
ability to successfully develop and introduce new products based on emerging industry standards, which could render its existing products unmarketable or obsolete. If communications markets evolve to
new 

standards, the combined company may be unable to successfully design and manufacture new products that address the needs of its customers or that will meet with substantial market acceptance. 

The combined company will face risks from failures in its manufacturing processes.  

    The fabrication of integrated circuits, particularly those made of gallium arsenide, is a highly complex and precise process. TriQuint's integrated circuits
are currently manufactured from four-inch round wafers made of gallium arsenide. Sawtek's products are manufactured primarily from four-inch quartz wafers. During
manufacturing, each wafer is processed to contain numerous die, the individual integrated circuits or surface acoustic wave die. The combined company may reject or be unable to sell a substantial
percentage of wafers or the die on a given wafer because of: 


minute
impurities;


difficulties
in the fabrication process, such as failure of special equipment, operator error or power outages;


defects
in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer;


electrical
performance;


wafer
breakage; or


other
factors. 

    We
refer to the proportion of final good integrated circuits that have been processed, assembled and tested relative to the gross number of integrated circuits that could be
constructed from the raw materials as our respective manufacturing yields. Compared to the manufacture of silicon integrated circuits, gallium arsenide technology is less mature and more difficult to
design and manufacture within specifications in large volume. In addition, the more brittle nature of gallium arsenide wafers can result in lower manufacturing yields than with silicon wafers.
TriQuint has in the past experienced lower than expected manufacturing yields, which have delayed product shipments and negatively impacted its results of operations. The combined company may
experience difficulty maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields in the future. 

    In
addition, the maintenance of the combined company's fabrication facilities in Florida, Oregon and Texas and its manufacturing facility in San Jose, Costa Rica are subject to risks,
including: 


the
demands of managing and coordinating workflow between geographically separate production facilities;


disruption
of production in one of its facilities as a result of a slowdown or shutdown in its other facility; and


higher
operating costs from managing geographically separate manufacturing facilities. 

The manufacturing facilities of the combined company are located in areas prone to natural disasters.  

    Sawtek has manufacturing and production facilities located in Orlando, Florida and in San Jose, Costa Rica. Hurricanes, tropical storms, flooding, tornadoes,
and other natural disasters are common events for the southeastern part of the United States and in Central America. Additionally, Sawtek's Costa Rican facility could also be affected by mud slides,
earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Any disruptions from these or other events would have a material adverse impact on the combined company's operations and financial results. 

    Though
Sawtek has manufacturing and assembly capabilities in both Orlando and San Jose, Sawtek is only capable of fabricating wafers in its Orlando facility. As a result, any
disruption to Sawtek's 

Orlando facility would have a material adverse impact on the combined company's operations and financial results. 

A disruption in Sawtek's Costa Rican operations would have an adverse impact on the combined company's operating results.  

    Operating a facility in Costa Rica presents additional risks of electrical disruption such as government intervention, currency fluctuations, labor disputes,
limited supplies of labor, power interruption and war. Any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the combined company's business, results of operations and financial condition. 

    During
the three and six months ended March 31, 2001, net sales from Sawtek's Costa Rican operation accounted for approximately 58% and 60% of total net sales, respectively,
and 44% and 48% of its operating income, respectively. During fiscal years 2000 and 1999, net sales from Sawtek's Costa Rican operation accounted for approximately 51% and 47% of its total net sales,
respectively, and approximately 37% and 40% of its operating income, respectively. TriQuint and Sawtek expect Sawtek's Costa Rican operations to continue to account for a significant proportion of the
combined company's overall operations in the future. 

A change in Sawtek's favorable tax status in Costa Rica would have an adverse impact on the combined company's operating results.  

    Sawtek's subsidiary in Costa Rica operates in a free trade zone and expects to receive a 100% exemption from Costa Rican income taxes through 2003 and a 50%
exemption through 2007. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2001, this tax exemption provided Sawtek a tax saving of approximately $1.6 million and $5.7 million,
respectively. During fiscal year 2000, this tax exemption provided tax savings of approximately $10.0 million, excluding the one-time gain of $16.7 million related to
adjusting the prior year's deferred income taxes, and increased Sawtek's diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.23. 

    The
Costa Rican government is reviewing its policy on granting tax exemptions to companies located in free trade zones. To date, no changes have been made and it is uncertain if any
changes will be made to the current tax structure. Any adverse change in the tax structure for Sawtek's Costa Rican
subsidiary made by the Costa Rican government would have a negative impact on the combined company's net income. 

If the combined company fails to sell a high volume of products, its operating results will be harmed.  

    Because a large portion of their manufacturing costs are relatively fixed, TriQuint's and Sawtek's manufacturing volumes are critical to their operating
results. If the combined company fails to achieve acceptable manufacturing volumes or experiences product shipment delays, its results of operations could be harmed. During periods of decreased
demand, the combined company's high fixed manufacturing costs could have a negative effect on its results of operations. TriQuint and Sawtek base their expense levels in part on their respective
expectations of future orders and these expense levels are predominantly fixed in the short-term. If the combined company receives fewer customer orders than expected, it may not be able
to reduce its manufacturing costs in the short-term and the combined company's operating results would be harmed. 

    All
of TriQuint's revenues stem from the production of products for the communications markets, specifically the mobile phone market, optical market, broadband wireless market and
other wireless markets. TriQuint expects that end-use customers will continue to replace their communication devices due to continued innovations, therefore continuing the demand for
communications applications. However, if this demand decreases from TriQuint's historic growth, TriQuint may not be able to sustain its historic growth. 

The combined company's operating results could be harmed if it loses access to sole or limited sources of materials, equipment or services.  

    TriQuint and Sawtek currently obtain some components, equipment and services for its products from limited or single sources, such as ceramic and plastic
packages from Kyocera Corporation and, with respect to TriQuint, chemicals and related supply chain management from Great Western Chemical Corporation. Both TriQuint and Sawtek purchase these
components, equipment and services on a purchase order basis, do not carry significant inventories of components and do not have any long-term supply contracts with these vendors. TriQuint
and Sawtek expect that the combined company's requirements will continue to be relatively small compared to silicon semiconductor manufacturers. Because it often does not account for a significant
part of its vendors' business, the combined company may not have access to sufficient capacity from these vendors in periods of high demand. If the combined company were to change any of its sole or
limited source vendors, it would be required to requalify each new vendor. Requalification could prevent or delay product shipments that could negatively affect its results of operations. In addition,
the combined company's reliance on these vendors may negatively affect its production if the components, equipment or services vary in reliability
or quality. If it is unable to obtain timely deliveries of sufficient quantities of acceptable quality or if the prices increase, the combined company's results of operations could be harmed. 

The combined company's operating results may suffer if it is unable to successfully transfer TriQuint's manufacturing operations from its existing Dallas facility to its new
Richardson, Texas facility.  

    In August 2000, TriQuint completed the synthetic lease of a 420,000 square foot fabrication facility in Richardson, Texas from Micron Technology Texas,
LLC. This facility is expected to provide the capacity needed to meet future demands and manufacturing. TriQuint plans to continue to operate its Dallas facility during the configuration, setup and
testing of the new Richardson facility. Given the long lead times associated with bringing a new facility to a fully qualified manufacturing production status, the combined company will incur
substantial expenses before achieving volume production in the Richardson facility. The transfer of TriQuint's four-inch wafer fabrication processes to the Richardson facility will involve
a number of significant risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, manufacturing transition, startup or process problems, construction, process qualification, or equipment delays, cost
overruns or shortages of equipment or materials, any of which may also adversely affect yields. Should there be delays in commencing production at the Richardson facility, the combined company may not
have adequate capacity to respond to all orders during the transition. There can be no assurance that the combined company will be able to successfully transition its manufacturing operations to the
Richardson facility prior to the expiration of its existing Dallas facility's lease or that the combined company will not experience difficulties in replicating critical manufacturing processes or a
reduction in manufacturing output as a result. Nor has TriQuint determined whether it will seek to extend the lease for the Dallas facility. Moreover, believing that commencement of production at the
Richardson facility could cause manufacturing delays, some customers may have purchased quantities of TriQuint's products in recent fiscal quarters in excess of such customers' respective immediate
needs and may continue to do so. As a result, the combined company's operating results in subsequent quarters may be materially reduced. Commencing manufacturing operations at its Richardson facility
could place significant strain on the combined company's management and engineering resources and result in diversion of management attention from the day-to-day operation of
its business. 

    The
combined company's lease and operation of its own manufacturing facilities entails a high level of fixed costs. Such fixed costs consist primarily of occupancy costs, investment
in manufacturing equipment, repair, maintenance and depreciation costs related to equipment and fixed labor costs related to manufacturing and process engineering. TriQuint's and Sawtek's
manufacturing yields vary significantly among their respective products, depending on a given product's complexity and TriQuint's or Sawtek's, as the case may be, experience in manufacturing such
product. TriQuint and Sawtek have 

experienced in the past and the combined company may experience in the future substantial delays in product shipments due to lower than expected production yields. However, before the combined company
realizes any revenues from commencement of its manufacturing operations at the higher capacity Richardson facility, the combined company will have a significant increase in fixed and operating
expenses. Once TriQuint commences volume production at the Richardson facility, the combined company's results of operations may still be adversely affected if revenue levels do not
increase sufficiently to offset these additional expense levels. Because TriQuint has capitalized and intends to continue to capitalize certain costs associated with bringing the Richardson facility
to commercial production, the combined company will recognize depreciation or amortization expenses thereafter. In addition, during periods of low demand, high fixed wafer fabrication costs could have
a material adverse effect on the combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The combined company may face fines or its facilities could be closed if it fails to comply with environmental regulations.  

    Federal, state and local regulations impose various environmental controls on the storage, handling, discharge and disposal of chemicals and gases used in
TriQuint's and Sawtek's manufacturing processes. For its manufacturing facility located in Hillsboro, Oregon, TriQuint provides its own manufacturing waste treatment and contract for disposal of some
materials. TriQuint is required by the State of Oregon Department of Environmental Quality to report usage of environmentally hazardous materials. 

    At
its Richardson facility, TriQuint provides its own wastewater treatment and contracts for disposal of some materials. 

    At
its Dallas facility, TriQuint utilizes Texas Instruments' industrial wastewater treatment facilities and services for the pre-treatment and discharge of wastewater
TriQuint generates. TriQuint's wastewater streams are commingled with those of Texas Instruments and are covered by Texas Instruments' wastewater permit. 

    At
its Apopka, Florida and Orlando, Florida facilities, Sawtek provides its own wastewater treatment and contracts to have all of its hazardous waste removed by a permitted
transporter and taken to a permitted treatment, storage and disposal facility. At its San Jose, Costa Rica facility, Sawtek captures all solvents for recycling and disposes of all other wastes
according to local regulations. 

    The
failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on the combined company and the combined company could be required to suspend production
or cease its operations. These regulations could require the combined company to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Any
failure by the combined company to control the use of, or to adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances could subject the combined company to future liabilities and harm its results of
operations. 

The combined company will have substantial indebtedness.  

    In February and March 2000, TriQuint sold $345.0 million of convertible subordinated notes in a private placement to qualified institutional
buyers. As a result of the sale of notes, TriQuint incurred $345.0 million of additional indebtedness, increasing its ratio of debt to equity (expressed as a percentage) to approximately 78.3%
as of March 31, 2001. TriQuint's other indebtedness is principally comprised of operating, synthetic and capital leases. TriQuint may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future.
For example, TriQuint entered into an $87.0 million synthetic lease obligation to finance the purchase of its new Richardson facility, which includes a provision to increase 

the lease by $18.5 million. Sawtek has no debt and has minimal operating lease expenses of less than $75,000. The level of its indebtedness, among other things, could: 


make
it difficult for the combined company to make payments on the notes and leases,


make
it difficult for the combined company to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or
other purposes;


require
the combined company to dedicate a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which would reduce
the amount of its expected cash flow available for other purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures;


limit
its flexibility in planning for or reacting to, changes in the combined company's business; and


make
the combined company more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business. 

    There
can be no assurance that the combined company will be able to meet its debt service obligations, including its obligation under the notes. 

The combined company may not be able to pay its debt and other obligations.  

    If its cash flow is inadequate to meet the combined company's obligations, the combined company could face substantial liquidity problems. If the combined
company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes, or the combined company's other obligations, the combined company would
be in default under the terms thereof. Default under the indenture TriQuint has entered into with the trustee for its 4% subordinated convertible notes due 2007 would permit the holders of the notes
to accelerate the maturity of the notes and could cause defaults under future indebtedness the combined company may incur. Any such default could have a material adverse effect on the combined
company's business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. In addition, TriQuint and Sawtek cannot assure you that the combined company would be able to repay amounts due in respect of
the notes if payment of the notes were to be accelerated following the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the indenture. 

Customers may delay or cancel orders due to regulatory delays.  

    The increasing demand for communications products has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards for these products, generally
following extensive investigation of and deliberation over competing technologies. The delays inherent in the regulatory approval process may in the future cause the cancellation, postponement or
rescheduling of the installation of communications systems by the combined company's customers. These delays have in the past had and may in the future have a negative effect on its sales and its
results of operations. 

The combined company's revenues are at risk if it does not introduce new products and/or decrease costs.  

    Historically, the average selling prices of some of TriQuint's and Sawtek's respective products have decreased over the products' lives and TriQuint and Sawtek
expect them to continue to do so. To offset these decreases, TriQuint and Sawtek expect the combined company to rely primarily on achieving yield improvements and other cost reductions for existing
products and on introducing new products that can often be sold at higher average selling prices. TriQuint and Sawtek believe that the combined company's future success depends, in part, on its timely
development and introduction of new products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and adequately address customer 

requirements. The success of new product and process introductions depends on several factors, including: 


proper
selection of products and processes;


successful
and timely completion of product and process development and commercialization;


market
acceptance of the combined company's or its customers' new products;


achievement
of acceptable manufacturing yields; and


the
combined company's ability to offer new products at competitive prices. 

    The
combined company's product and process development efforts may not be successful and its new products or processes may not achieve market acceptance. To the extent that the
combined company's cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner, its results of operations could suffer. 

The combined company must improve its products and processes to remain competitive.  

    If technologies or standards supported by the combined company or its customers' products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, the
combined company's results of operations may be materially impacted. Because of continual improvements in semiconductor technology, including those in high performance silicon where substantially more
resources are invested than in gallium arsenide, silicon germanium or surface acoustic wave-based products, TriQuint and Sawtek believe that the combined company's future success will depend, in part,
on its ability to continue to improve its product and process technologies. The combined company must also develop new technologies in a timely manner. In addition, the combined company must adapt its
products and processes to technological changes and to support emerging and established industry standards. TriQuint and Sawtek have and the combined company must continue to perform significant
research and development into advanced material development such as indium phosphide, gallium nitride, silicon carbide and silicon germanium to compete with future technologies of its competitors. For
example, TriQuint recently announced that it had entered into an agreement with Atmel Corporation to fabricate portions of its proposed silicon germanium products. These research and development
efforts may not be accepted by the combined company's customers, and therefore may not go into full production in the future. The combined company may not be able to improve its existing products and
process technologies, develop new technologies in a timely manner or effectively support industry standards. If the combined company fails to do so, its customers may select another gallium arsenide,
silicon germanium or surface acoustic wave product or move to an alternative technology. 

The combined company's results of operations may suffer if it does not compete successfully.  

    The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion.
Currently, TriQuint competes primarily with manufacturers of high-performance silicon integrated circuits such as Applied Micro Circuits Corporation, Maxim Integrated Products Inc.,
Motorola, Philips Electronics N.V., and STMicroelectronics N.V. and with manufacturers of gallium arsenide integrated circuits such as Alpha Industries Inc., Anadigics Inc., Conexant
Systems Inc., Fujitsu Microelectronics, Inc., Infineon Technologies AG, Raytheon, RF Micro Devices and Vitesse Semiconductor Corp. TriQuint also faces competition from the internal
semiconductor operations of some of its current and potential customers. Sawtek's business is dependent upon the application of surface acoustic wave-based technology. Competing
technologies, including digital filtering technology, direct conversion or any other technology that could be developed, could replace or reduce the use of surface acoustic wave filters for certain
applications. Direct conversion is a process that converts an RF signal to baseband without the need for a surface acoustic wave IF filter. Qualcomm Inc., Analog Devices, Inc., Agilent
Technologies, Inc. and RF Micro Devices of Greensboro, North Carolina, each produce integrated circuits for use in wireless phones and have announced products or plans to produce products that
utilize direct conversion or other technologies that could reduce or eliminate surface acoustic wave filters in certain applications. Other companies, as well, may from time to time, announce
products, patents or other claims relating to direct conversion or such other technologies that may reduce or eliminate certain surface acoustic wave filters. Competition from existing or potential
competitors may increase due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, the following: 


offering
of new or emerging technologies;


mergers
and acquisitions;


longer
operating histories and presence in key markets;


development
of strategic relationships;


access
to a wider customer base; and


access
to greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources. 

    Additionally,
manufacturers of high-performance silicon integrated circuits have achieved greater market acceptance of their existing products and technologies in some
applications. 

    The
combined company will compete with both gallium arsenide and silicon suppliers in the wireless, data communications and telecommunications markets. In the microwave and millimeter
wave markets, its competition is primarily from a limited number of gallium arsenide suppliers, which are in the process of expanding their product offerings to address commercial applications other
than aerospace. 

    TriQuint's
and Sawtek's prospective customers are typically systems designers and manufacturers that are considering the use of gallium arsenide or silicon germanium integrated
circuits or surface acoustic wave filters, as the case may be, for their high performance systems. Competition is primarily based on performance elements such as speed, complexity and power
dissipation, as well as price, product quality and ability to deliver products in a timely fashion. Due to the proprietary nature of TriQuint's and Sawtek's products, competition occurs almost
exclusively at the system design stage. As a result, a design win by its competitors or the combined company typically will limit further competition with respect to manufacturing a given design. 

If the combined company fails to integrate any future acquisitions, its business will be harmed.  

    The combined company faces risks from any future acquisitions, including the following: 


the
combined company may fail to merge and coordinate the operations and personnel of newly acquired companies with its existing business;


the
combined company may experience difficulties integrating its financial and operating systems;


the
combined company's ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention;


the
combined company may not cost-effectively and rapidly incorporate the technology it acquires;


the
combined company may not be able to recognize the cost savings or other financial benefits it anticipated;


the
combined company may not be able to retain the existing customers of newly acquired operations;


the
combined company's corporate culture may clash with that of the acquired businesses; and


the
combined company may incur unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses. 

    The
combined company may not successfully address these risks or any other problems that arise in connection with future acquisitions. 

    TriQuint
and Sawtek expect the combined company will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities available to it and may pursue product, technology or business acquisitions. In
addition, in connection with any future acquisitions, the combined company may issue equity securities that could dilute the percentage ownership of its existing stockholders, the combined company may
incur additional debt and be required to amortize expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets that may negatively affect its results of operations. 

If the combined company does not hire and retain key employees, its business will suffer.  

    The combined company's future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical, marketing and management personnel. The combined
company will also depend on its ability to continue to identify, attract and retain qualified technical employees, particularly highly skilled design, process and test engineers involved in the
manufacture and development of our products and processes. The combined company must also recruit and train employees to manufacture its products without a substantial reduction in manufacturing
yields. There are many other semiconductor companies located in the communities near its facilities and it may become increasingly difficult for the combined company to attract and retain those
employees. The competition for these employees is intense, and the loss of key employees could negatively affect the combined company. 

The combined company's business may be harmed if it fails to protect its proprietary technology.  

    The combined company will rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to
protect its intellectual property rights. TriQuint and Sawtek currently have patents granted and pending in the United States and in foreign countries and intend to seek further international and
United States patents on its technology. TriQuint and Sawtek cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of their respective pending applications or that patents will be issued in all
countries where their respective products can be sold or that any claims allowed from pending applications or will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial
advantage. The combined company's competitors may also be 

able to design around its patents. The laws of some countries in which its products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold, may not protect its products or intellectual property rights to the
same extent as do the laws of the United States, increasing the possibility of piracy of its technology and products. Although TriQuint and Sawtek intend to continue to vigorously defend the combined
company's intellectual property rights, the combined company may not be able to prevent misappropriation of its technology. The combined company's competitors may also independently develop
technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to its technology. 

The combined company's ability to produce its semiconductors and surface acoustic wave devices may suffer if someone claims TriQuint or Sawtek infringes on its intellectual
property.  

    The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions, which have resulted in significant
and often protracted and expensive litigation. If it is necessary or desirable, the combined company may seek licenses under such patents or other intellectual property rights. However, TriQuint and
Sawtek cannot be certain that licenses will be offered or that the combined company would find the terms of licenses that are offered acceptable or commercially reasonable. The combined company's
failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology it uses could cause the combined company to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of products. Furthermore, the
combined company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of its proprietary rights or to establish the validity of its proprietary rights. Litigation by or against the
combined company could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of its technical personnel and management, whether or not the litigation results in a favorable determination. In the event
of an adverse result in any litigation, the combined company could be required to: 


pay
substantial damages;


indemnify
its customers;


stop
the manufacture, use and sale of the infringing products;


expend
significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;


discontinue
the use of certain processes; or


obtain
licenses to the technology. 

    The
combined company may be unsuccessful in developing non-infringing products or negotiating licenses upon reasonable terms, or at all. These problems might not be
resolved in time to avoid harming the combined company's results of operations. If any third party makes a successful claim against the combined company or its customers and a license is not made
available to the combined company on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed. 

    On
February 26, 1999, a lawsuit was filed against 88 companies, several of which are still in litigation, including TriQuint, in the United States District Court for the
District of Arizona. The suit alleges that the defendants, including TriQuint, infringe upon certain patents held by The Lemelson Medical, Education and Research Foundation, Limited Partnership.
Although TriQuint believes the suit is without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the charges, TriQuint cannot be certain that it will be successful. Moreover, this litigation may
require the combined company to spend a substantial amount of time and money and could distract management from its day to day operations. 

    Sawtek
is not currently engaged in any patent infringement suits, nor has Sawtek been threatened with any such suits. In January 2000, Sawtek received a letter from a large
Canadian telephone equipment manufacturer claiming that it believes Sawtek is infringing on a patent it owns that issued in 1987 and offering a license on preferred terms. Sawtek believes that this
patent is unenforceable because Sawtek sold devices commercially utilizing the invention claimed in the patent at least two 

years before the application for this patent was filed and because the patent owner did not attempt to exercise its rights to enforce this patent for over 12 years. If Sawtek is incorrect in
this matter and this patent is found to be enforceable, the combined company could be required to pay a license fee or to pay damages related to sales of devices utilizing this invention sold over the
past seven years and the combined company could be enjoined from further infringement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on combined company operating results. 

    Sawtek
is currently engaged in negotiations with Fujitsu Media Devices Limited regarding a license to two United States patents owned by Fujitsu pertaining to materials which may be
used in radio frequency filters. Based on discussions with Fujitsu, Sawtek believes it will obtain a license for these patents on commercially reasonable terms. If Sawtek does not obtain a license for
these patents, Sawtek may be required to utilize a less desirable material for its radio frequency filters. 

The combined company's business may suffer due to risks associated with international sales.  

    TriQuint's sales outside of the United States were 34.4% of total revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2001. TriQuint's sales outside of the
United States were 44.6% of total revenues in 2000. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2001, net sales to Sawtek's international customers accounted for approximately 64% and 67%
of total net sales, respectively. Sawtek's net sales to international customers accounted for approximately 61% of total net sales for fiscal 2000. 

    Some
of Sawtek's major customers are relying on growth in international markets, including Asia and Latin America, for sales of their products. The demand for Sawtek's products will
be reduced if the economies in these regions decline or do not meet anticipated growth expectations. 

    Sawtek
has grown its net sales over the past several years partly from shipments to South Korean customers. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2001, net sales to
Sawtek's South Korean customers accounted for approximately 27% and 19% of total net sales, respectively. For fiscal 2000, Sawtek's net sales to South Korean customers was approximately
$32.9 million or 20.6% of total net sales. However, net sales to South Korean customers have fluctuated greatly. The South Korean economy and the economies of many other countries in Asia and
around the world have experienced economic turmoil and recession during the past 24 months and may continue to face economic problems which would adversely impact Sawtek's sales in these
regions. In addition, the South Korean government recently reduced subsidies for the purchase of wireless phones in the South Korean market, which could adversely impact future sales of its products
into this market. The combined company faces inherent risks from these sales, including: 


imposition
of government controls;


currency
exchange fluctuations;


longer
payment cycles and difficulties related to the collection of receivables from international customers;


reduced
protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;


the
impact of recessionary environments in economies outside the United States;


unfavorable
tax consequences;


difficulty
obtaining distribution and support;


political
instability; and


tariffs
and other trade barriers. 

    In
addition, due to the technological advantages provided by gallium arsenide integrated circuits in many military applications, all of TriQuint's sales outside of North America must
be licensed by the 

Office of Export Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Sawtek is required to obtain licenses from the Office of Export Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce for sales to
customers in certain countries. If the combined company fails to obtain these licenses or experience delays in obtaining these licenses in the future, its results of operations could be harmed. Also,
because all of its foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, increases in the value of the dollar would increase the price in local currencies of its products and make the combined company's
products less price competitive. 

The combined company may be subject to a securities class action suit if its stock price falls.  

    Following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's stock, some stockholders may file a securities class action litigation. For example,
in 1994, a stockholder class action lawsuit was filed against TriQuint, its underwriters and some of its officers, directors and investors, which alleged that TriQuint, its underwriters and certain of
its officers, directors and investors intentionally misled the investing public regarding its financial prospects. TriQuint settled the action and recorded a special charge of $1.4 million
associated with the settlement of this lawsuit and related legal expenses, net of
accruals, in 1998. Any future securities class action litigation could be expensive and divert management's attention and harm the combined company's business, regardless of its merits. 

The combined company's stock will likely be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond its control and may
prevent its stockholders from reselling TriQuint's common stock at a profit.  

    The securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of semiconductor companies have been
especially volatile. The market price of TriQuint's common stock may experience significant fluctuations in the future. For example, TriQuint's common stock price has fluctuated from a high of
approximately $66.63 to a low of approximately $14.25 during the 52 weeks ended March 31, 2001, and Sawtek's common stock price has fluctuated from a high of approximately $80.44 to a low of
approximately $15.13 during the 52 weeks ended March 31, 2001. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of the combined
company's common stock in spite of the combined company's operating performance. In addition, the combined company's operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and
investors, and in response, the market price of the combined company's common stock could decrease significantly. 

TriQuint Specific Risks which could Adversely Affect the Combined Company  

If TriQuint does not sell its customer-specific products in large volumes, its operating results may be harmed.  

    TriQuint manufactures a substantial portion of its products to address the needs of individual customers. Frequent product introductions by systems
manufacturers make its future success dependent on its ability to select development projects which will result in sufficient volumes to enable TriQuint to achieve manufacturing efficiencies. Because
customer-specific products are developed for unique applications, TriQuint expects that some of its current and future customer-specific products may never be produced in volume and may impair its
ability to cover its fixed manufacturing costs. In addition, if TriQuint experiences delays in completing designs, if TriQuint fails to obtain development contracts from customers whose products are
successful or if TriQuint fails to have its product designed into the next generation product of existing volume production customers, its revenues could be harmed. 

TriQuint's business will be adversely affected if systems manufacturers do not use TriQuint's gallium arsenide and silicon germanium components.  

    Silicon semiconductor technologies are the dominant process technologies for integrated circuits and the performance of silicon integrated circuits continues
to improve. While TriQuint has recently introduced silicon germanium components jointly developed and manufactured with Atmel, systems designers may be reluctant to adopt TriQuint's products because
of: 


their
unfamiliarity with designing systems with gallium arsenide or silicon germanium products;


their
concerns related to manufacturing costs and yields for gallium arsenide and silicon germanium products;


their
unfamiliarity with TriQuint's design and manufacturing processes; and


uncertainties
about the relative cost effectiveness of TriQuint's gallium arsenide and silicon germanium products compared to other manufacturers'
high-performance silicon components. 

    Systems
manufacturers may not use gallium arsenide components because the production of gallium arsenide integrated circuits has been, and continues to be, more costly than the
production of silicon devices. Systems manufacturers may not use TriQuint's silicon germanium components because this is a newly introduced process and TriQuint has developed and manufactured these
components jointly with Atmel. Systems manufacturers may be reluctant to rely on a technology new to TriQuint. Systems manufacturers may also be reluctant to rely on a jointly produced product because
future supplies may depend on the continued good relationship between TriQuint and Atmel. 

    In
addition, customers may be reluctant to rely on a smaller company like TriQuint for critical components. TriQuint cannot be certain that additional systems manufacturers will
design its products into their systems, or that the companies that have utilized its products will continue to do so in the future or that gallium arsenide and silicon germanium technology will
continue to achieve widespread market acceptance. If TriQuint's gallium arsenide or silicon germanium products fail to achieve market acceptance, its results of operations would suffer. 

TriQuint's operating results could be harmed if its subcontractors are unable to fulfill its requirements.  

    TriQuint currently utilizes subcontractors for the majority of its assemblies and some of its tests. There are certain risks associated with dependence on
third party providers, such as minimal control over delivery scheduling, adequate capacity during demand peaks, warranty issues and protection of intellectual property. Additionally, if these
subcontractors are unable to meet its demands, it could prevent or delay production shipments that could negatively affect TriQuint's results of operations. If TriQuint were to change any of its
subcontractors, TriQuint would be required to qualify each new subcontractor, which could also prevent or delay product shipments that could negatively affect its results of operations. In addition,
TriQuint's reliance on these subcontractors may negatively affect its production if the services vary in reliability or quality. If TriQuint is unable to obtain timely service of acceptable quality or
if the prices increase, TriQuint's results of operations could be harmed. 

If TriQuint's products fail to perform or meet customer requirements, TriQuint could incur significant additional costs.  

    The fabrication of gallium arsenide integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process. TriQuint's customers specify quality, performance and
reliability standards that TriQuint must meet. If TriQuint's products do not meet these standards, TriQuint may be required to rework or replace the products. Gallium arsenide integrated circuits may
contain undetected defects or failures that only become evident after TriQuint commences volume shipments. TriQuint has experienced product quality, 

performance or reliability problems from time to time. Defects or failures may occur in the future. If failures or defects occur, TriQuint could: 


lose
revenue;


incur
increased costs such as warranty expense and costs associated with customer support;


experience
delays, cancellations or rescheduling of orders for its products; or


experience
increased product returns or discounts. 

TriQuint's operating results may suffer as a result of the conversion of its manufacturing processes from four-inch wafer production to six-inch wafer
production.  

    TriQuint is in the process of converting its existing Hillsboro facility to accommodate equipment that uses six-inch (150-millimeter)
wafer production. In addition, a portion of the Richardson facility is being configured to accommodate a six-inch product line. TriQuint does not have any experience processing
six-inch wafers in its fabrication facilities. TriQuint's inexperience may result in lower yields and higher unit production costs. TriQuint may be required to redesign its processes and
procedures substantially to accommodate the larger wafers. As a result, converting to six-inch wafer production may take longer than planned, could interrupt production of integrated
circuits from four-inch wafers and could harm its results of operations. The process of building, testing and qualifying a gallium arsenide integrated circuit fabrication facility is time
consuming and difficult. If TriQuint fails to successfully transition to six-inch wafers or TriQuint's manufacturing yields decline, its relationships with its customers may be harmed. 

Increases in TriQuint's manufacturing capacity may adversely affect its operating results if the current economic downturn continues for an extended period of time.  

    TriQuint is currently in the process of converting its existing Hillsboro facility from four-inch wafer production to six-inch wafer
production, developing a new six-inch production line in its Richardson facility and expanding the capacity of four-inch wafer production at its Texas operations concurrent
with the transition of its Texas manufacturing operations from its current Dallas facility to the new Richardson facility. Due to the current economic downturn in the semiconductor industry and
related high-technology industries, however, TriQuint has slowed the pace of the development of the six-inch production line at the Richardson facility. 

    These
increases in capacity will directly relate to significant increases in fixed costs and operating expenses, even with the delay of the development of the six-inch
production line at the Richardson facility. These increased costs could have an adverse effect on TriQuint's results of operations during the current economic downturn. If this economic downturn were
to continue for an extended period of time, the decreased levels of demand and production in conjunction with these increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. 

Sawtek Specific Risks which could Adversely Affect the Combined Company  

A decline either in the growth of wireless communications or in the continued acceptance of CDMA technology would have an adverse impact on Sawtek.  

    During the three and six months ended March 31, 2001, the percentage of total revenues Sawtek generated from the sale of surface acoustic wave devices
was 68% and 69%, respectively, for applications in wireless communications systems, specifically wireless phones and base stations. Approximately 72%, 74% and 74% of Sawtek's net sales for fiscal
years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, were derived from sales of surface acoustic wave devices for applications in wireless communications systems, specifically wireless phones and base stations. 

    Sales of Sawtek's products for CDMA-based systems, including filters for base stations and wireless phones, accounted for approximately 46% and 41% of Sawtek's net sales
during the three and six months ended March 31, 2001. During fiscal years 2000 and 1999, approximately 45% and 56%, respectively, of Sawtek's net sales were generated from sales for
CDMA-based systems. CDMA technology is relatively new to the marketplace and there can be no assurance that emerging markets will adopt this technology. Sawtek's business and financial
results would be adversely impacted if CDMA technology does not continue to gain acceptance. 

Because Sawtek depends on a few large customers, its operating results would be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers.  

    A few large customers have accounted for a significant portion of Sawtek's net sales. During the first six months of fiscal year 2001, sales to Sawtek's top
five and 10 customers accounted for approximately 54% and 75% of its total net sales, respectively. Sales to Sawtek's top 10 customers accounted for approximately 72%, 70% and 76% of its net sales in
fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. 

    Motorola,
Sawtek's largest customer, accounted for approximately 19% and 26% of Sawtek's total net sales during the three and six months ended March 31, 2001, and Sawtek
believes it will continue to account for a high percentage of net sales during the remainder of fiscal year 2001. Motorola accounted for 25% and 23% of Sawtek's net sales in fiscal years 2000 and
1999, respectively. 

    Sawtek
expects that sales of its products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of its net sales in the foreseeable future. Sawtek's future
success depends largely upon the decisions of its current customers to continue to purchase its products, as well as the decisions of prospective customers to develop and market systems that
incorporate its products. 

New competitive products and technologies have been announced which could reduce demand for Sawtek's products.  

    The product introduced by Analog Devices, Inc. may have some application in certain GSM phones, which, if proven successful, could impact sales of
Sawtek's GSM IF filters for wireless phones. Sawtek's sales of surface acoustic wave filters for GSM wireless phones accounted for approximately 9% of revenues for the six months ended
March 31, 2001, and approximately 8% of revenues for the year ended September 30, 2000. Sawtek believes that revenues generated from handset filters for GSM phones could account for up
to 10% of its total revenues for all of fiscal 2001. 

    Qualcomm Inc.,
on December 18, 2000, announced a new product based on a direct conversion concept that could eliminate a surface acoustic wave IF filter in certain CDMA
phones. Qualcomm expects to sample this product in late calendar year 2001. Sawtek's sales of IF filters for CDMA phones accounted for approximately 23% of revenues for the six months ended
March 31, 2001 and approximately 22% of revenues for the year ended September 30, 2000. If Qualcomm's product is successful in the market, it could reduce or eliminate Sawtek's revenues
from IF filters for CDMA phones. 

    Agilent
Technologies, Inc. recently announced an alternative solution to surface acoustic wave-based technology for potential use as a duplexer in certain PCS
wireless phone applications. To date, Sawtek has not sold any surface acoustic wave-based duplexers for PCS applications, but it has targeted this application for future revenue growth. 

    Lastly,
RF Micro Devices, on January 22, 2001, announced a direct conversion modulator for multi-mode wireless phones that could reduce the need for certain
transmit filters for GSM and potentially other architectures. Production for this product by Sawtek is scheduled for the second half of calendar year 2001. Currently, most phone original equipment
manufacturers do not use surface 

acoustic wave filters in the transmit path for GSM phones and Sawtek does not derive any revenue from this application. At this time Sawtek is unable to assess the impact, if any, of this announcement
on Sawtek's future revenue and growth. 

    Any
development of a cost-effective technology that replaces surface acoustic wave filtering technology or reduces the need for surface acoustic wave filtering technology
could have a material adverse effect on Sawtek's business, financial condition and results of operations. 

If Sawtek is unable to successfully develop and bring new products to market, Sawtek's operating results will be adversely affected.  

    During fiscal year 2000, Sawtek announced its intent to offer an expanded line of surface acoustic wave filters for the wireless phone market, including radio
frequency and GSM IF filters. Expanding its product line and sales of these filters is an important part of Sawtek's growth strategy. There is no assurance that Sawtek will be successful in its
efforts to introduce these and other new filters for the wireless telecommunications market. If Sawtek is unable to successfully increase its production capacity, Sawtek will not be able to grow its
revenues as planned. 

A continued decline in selling prices for some of Sawtek's key products could have an adverse impact on its operating results.  

    Selling prices for Sawtek's products have declined due to competitive pricing pressures and to the use of newer surface mount package devices that are smaller
and less expensive than previous generation filters. Sawtek has experienced declines in prices for filters for GSM base stations due to the use of surface mount packages, and this has also begun to
occur in filters for CDMA base stations. In addition, Sawtek expects prices for wireless phone filters to continue to decline as they become smaller and as competitive pricing pressure increases. A
continued decline in prices could have a material adverse impact on both Sawtek's revenues and its net income.

Recommendation of the Sawtek board of directors  

    The board of directors of Sawtek has concluded that the merger agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of Sawtek's shareholders and
unanimously recommends that the shareholders vote FOR the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger. 

Shareholder record date for the special meeting  

    Sawtek's board of directors has fixed the close of business on June 8, 2001 as the record date for determination of Sawtek shareholders entitled to
notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. On the record date, there were            shares of Sawtek common stock outstanding, held by
approximately      holders of record. 

Majority vote of Sawtek shareholders required for adoption of the merger agreement  

    You are entitled to one vote for each share of Sawtek common stock held by you on the record date on each proposal to be presented to shareholders at the
special meeting. A majority of the outstanding shares of Sawtek common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting must be represented, either in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the
special meeting. Sawtek will count shares of its common stock represented in person or by proxy for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting. Sawtek will also
treat shares that abstain from voting as shares that are present and entitled to vote at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. 

    The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Sawtek common stock outstanding on the record date is required to adopt the merger agreement and approve
the merger. 

    Some
Sawtek executive officers and directors, including Kimon Anemogiannis, Brian P. Balut, John K. Bitzer, Raymond A. Link, Steven P. Miller and his affiliates, Robert C. Strandberg,
Neal Jay Tolar and
his affiliates, Azhar Waseem, Bruce S. White and Willis C. Young, in their capacity as shareholders, have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of a voting agreement with TriQuint, to vote their
shares of Sawtek common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. As of the record date these shareholders held approximately         shares of Sawtek common stock representing
approximately    % of the outstanding shares of Sawtek common stock as of the record date. 

Proxies  

    All shares of Sawtek common stock represented by properly executed proxies received before or at the special meeting will, unless the proxies are revoked, be
voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxies. If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy, the shares will be voted FOR adoption of the merger agreement and
approval of the merger. You are urged to mark a box on the proxy to indicate how to vote your shares. 

    If
a properly executed proxy is returned and the stockholder has instructed the proxies to abstain from voting on adoption of the merger agreement, the Sawtek common stock represented
by the proxy will be considered present at the special meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, but will not be voted for or against the merger, thereby having the effect of being a vote against
the merger. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must instruct such institution how to vote your shares. If an executed proxy card is returned by a broker holding
shares in the name of a brokerage firm or bank, which indicates that the broker or bank does not have instructions or discretionary authority to vote on adoption of the merger agreement, the shares
will be considered present at the meeting for the purpose of determining a quorum, but will not be considered to have been voted in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. Your broker or bank will
vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by following the information provided to you by your broker or bank. 

    Because
adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Sawtek common stock outstanding on the record date,
abstentions, failures to vote and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against adoption of the merger agreement. 

    Sawtek
does not expect that any matter other than adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger will be brought before the special meeting. If, however, other matters
are properly presented, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment with respect to those matters, unless authority to do so is withheld in the proxy. 

Revocability of proxies  

    Any proxy you give may be revoked at any time before it is voted at the special meeting. You may revoke a proxy in one of the following three ways: 


You
can send a signed written notice stating that you would like to revoke your proxy.


You
can complete and submit a new proxy.


You
can attend the special meeting and vote in person. Simply attending the special meeting, however, will not revoke your proxy; you must request a ballot
and vote at the special meeting. 

    To
be effective, any written notice of revocation or any new proxy card must be received by Sawtek Inc., 1818 South Highway 441, Apopka, Florida 32703, Attention: William A.
Grimm, Secretary, 

prior to the time of the special meeting. Attendance at the special meeting will not in and of itself constitute the revocation of a proxy. 

    You
should not send in any stock certificates with your proxies. A transmittal form with instructions for surrender of stock certificates for Sawtek common stock will be mailed to you
as soon as practicable after completion of the merger. 

Solicitation of proxies  

    TriQuint and Sawtek will equally share the expenses incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Sawtek will
also request banks, brokers and other intermediaries holding shares of Sawtek common stock beneficially owned by others to send this joint proxy statement/prospectus to, and obtain proxies from, the
beneficial owners and will reimburse the holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, telegram and other electronic means,
advertisements and personal solicitation by the directors, officers or employees of Sawtek. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or employees for such solicitation. 

You should not send in any stock certificates with your proxy card. A transmittal letter with instructions for the surrender of stock certificates will be
mailed to you as soon as possible after completion of the merger.

THE SPECIAL MEETING OF TRIQUINT STOCKHOLDERS    

Joint proxy statement/prospectus  

    This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to you in connection with the solicitation of proxies by TriQuint's board of directors in connection
with the proposed merger. This joint proxy statement/prospectus is first being furnished to stockholders of TriQuint on or about June  , 2001. 

Date, time and place of the special meeting  

The special meeting of stockholders of TriQuint is scheduled to be held as follows: 

July
19, 2001

10:00 a.m., local time

2300 N.E. Brookwood Parkway

Hillsboro, Oregon 97124 

Purpose of the special meeting  

    The special meeting is being held so that stockholders of TriQuint can consider and vote upon a proposal to issue shares of TriQuint common stock to Sawtek
shareholders in connection with the merger and transact any other business that properly comes before the special meeting or any adjournment thereof. 

    If
the stockholders of TriQuint approve the issuance of shares in the merger and the other conditions to completion of the merger are satisfied or waived, Timber Acquisition Corp.
will merge with and into
Sawtek, and Sawtek will survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of TriQuint. You will not receive any additional shares of TriQuint common stock or be required to exchange your TriQuint stock
certificates in connection with the merger. 

Recommendation of the TriQuint board of directors  

    The members of the board of directors of TriQuint present at the meetings where the merger was considered have concluded that the merger agreement and the
merger are fair to and in the best interests of TriQuint's stockholders and unanimously recommend that the stockholders vote FOR the proposal to approve the issuance of TriQuint common stock in the
merger, the increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock and the adoption of the 2001 stock incentive program. 

Stockholder record date for the special meeting  

    TriQuint's board of directors has fixed the close of business on June 8, 2001 as the record date for determination of TriQuint stockholders entitled to
notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. On the record date, there were        shares of TriQuint common stock outstanding, held by approximately      holders of record.

Majority vote of TriQuint stockholders required to approve the issuance of shares of TriQuint common stock in the merger  

    A majority of the outstanding shares of TriQuint common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting must be represented, either in person or by proxy, to
constitute a quorum at the special meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of TriQuint common stock represented at the special meeting is required to approve
the issuance of TriQuint common stock in the merger and the adoption of the 2001 Stock Option Plan. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of TriQuint common stock
outstanding on the record date is required to approve the increase in authorized shares of common stock. You are entitled to one vote for each 

share of TriQuint common stock held by you on the record date on each proposal to be presented to stockholders at the special meeting. 

    On
the record date for the special meeting, directors and executive officers of TriQuint and their affiliates held approximately            shares of TriQuint common stock
representing approximately      % of all outstanding shares of TriQuint common stock as of the record date. 

    Some
TriQuint executive officers and directors, in their capacity as stockholders, have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of a voting agreement with TriQuint, to vote their
shares of TriQuint common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. As of the record date these stockholders held approximately            shares of TriQuint common stock
representing approximately      % of the outstanding shares of TriQuint common stock as of the record date. 

Other Proposals  

At the TriQuint special meeting of stockholders you will also be requested to consider the following proposals which are described in more detail on page 117 under the caption "Other Proposals
for the TriQuint Special Meeting." 


To
amend TriQuint's certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance thereunder to 600,000,000 shares
from 200,000,000 shares.


To
approve and adopt the 2001 Stock Option Plan and to reserve 2,400,000 shares of common stock that may be optioned and sold under the plan, plus
an annual increase of the lesser of (i) 15,000,000 shares, (ii) 5% of the outstanding shares on the last day of TriQuint's prior fiscal year or (iii) an amount determined by the
board. 

Proxies  

All shares of TriQuint common stock represented by properly executed proxies received before or at the special meeting will, unless the proxies are revoked, be voted in accordance with the
instructions indicated on the proxies. If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy, the shares will be voted FOR approval of the share issuance, the increase of TriQuint's authorized
shares of common stock and the adoption of the 2001 Stock Option Plan. You are urged to mark a box on the proxy to indicate how to vote your shares. 

    If
a properly executed proxy is returned and the stockholder has instructed the proxies to abstain from voting on the share issuance in connection with the merger, the TriQuint common
stock represented by the proxy will be considered present at the special meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, but
will not be voted for or against the share issuance, thereby having the effect of being a vote against the share issuance. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must
instruct such institution how to vote your shares. If an executed proxy card is returned by a broker holding shares in the name of a brokerage firm or bank, which indicates that the broker or bank
does not have instructions or discretionary authority to vote on approval of the share issuance, the shares will be considered present at the meeting for the purpose of determining a quorum, but will
not be considered to have been voted in favor of approval of the share issuance. Your broker or bank will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by following the information
provided to you by your broker or bank. 

    Because
amendment of TriQuint's certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of TriQuint common stock outstanding on the record date,
abstentions, failures to vote and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against the issuance of the shares in connection with the merger, the increase in authorized shares
of common stock and the adoption of the 2001 Stock Option Plan. 

    TriQuint does not expect that any matters other than those set forth above will be brought before the special meeting. If, however, other matters are properly presented, the persons
named as proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment with respect to those matters, unless authority to do so is withheld in the proxy. 

    You
may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted by: 


notifying
in writing the Secretary of TriQuint at 2300 N.E. Brookwood Parkway, Hillsboro, Oregon 97124;


properly
submitting a subsequent proxy;


appearing
in person and voting at the special meeting; or


if
you voted electronically through the internet or by telephone, changing your vote by voting again at a later date, using the same procedures. 

    Attendance
at the special meeting will not in and of itself constitute the revocation of a proxy. 

    You
should not send in any stock certificates with your proxies. You do not need to exchange your TriQuint stock certificates. 

Voting electronically or by telephone  

For Shares Directly Registered in the Name of the Stockholder:
 If you are registered on TriQuint's stock
transfer books as the holder of record of your shares, you can vote your shares in one of three ways: 


By
calling 1-800-   -    on a touch-tone phone. This number is toll free in the United States and is available 24 hours
a day. Be sure to have your proxy card available to enter your control number.


By
visiting the internet site at http:/www.proxyvoting.com/tqnt/.


By
marking, signing, dating and promptly returning the proxy card. We have enclosed a postage-paid envelope (if mailed in the United States) for your
convenience. 

    For Shares Registered in the Name of Certain Brokerage Firms or Banks:
  A number of brokerage firms and banks currently
participate in a program provided through ADP Investor Communication Services that offers internet and telephone voting options. If your shares are held in an account at such a brokerage firm or bank,
you will already have been offered the opportunity to elect to vote via the internet and you may vote these shares telephonically by calling the telephone number referenced on your proxy card. Votes
submitted via the internet through the ADP program must be received by 12:00 a.m. midnight (EST) on July  , 2001. The giving of such proxy will not affect your right to vote in
person should you decide to attend the special meeting. The telephone and internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholder identities, to allow stockholders to give their voting
instructions and to confirm that stockholders' instructions have been recorded properly. TriQuint believes that the telephone and internet voting procedures that have been made available through ADP
Investor Communications Services are consistent with the requirements of applicable law. Stockholders voting via the internet through ADP Investor Communication Services should understand that there
might be certain costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from internet access providers and telephone companies, that must be borne by the stockholder. 

Solicitation of proxies  

    TriQuint and Sawtek will equally share the expenses incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. TriQuint
will also request banks, brokers and other intermediaries holding shares of TriQuint common stock beneficially owned by others to send this joint proxy statement/prospectus to, and obtain proxies
from, the beneficial owners and will reimburse the holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, telegram and other electronic
means, advertisements and personal solicitation by the directors, officers or employees of TriQuint. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or employees for such solicitation. 

You should not send in any stock certificates with your proxy card. You do not need to exchange your TriQuint stock certificates.

THE MERGER    

This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes material aspects of the proposed merger, including the merger agreement.
While we believe that the description covers the material terms of the merger, this summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you. You should read this entire joint proxy
statement/prospectus and the other documents we refer to carefully for a more complete understanding of the merger. In addition, we incorporate important business and financial information about
TriQuint and Sawtek into this joint proxy statement/prospectus by reference. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus without charge by
following the instructions in the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 9 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Effect of the merger and conversion of Sawtek common stock  

    Upon the closing of the merger, Timber Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of TriQuint, will merge with and into Sawtek, and Sawtek will survive the
merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of TriQuint. Following the merger, Sawtek will continue its operations as a wholly owned subsidiary of TriQuint. The Sawtek shareholders will become TriQuint
stockholders, and their rights as stockholders will be governed by the TriQuint certificate of incorporation, as amended, the TriQuint bylaws and the laws of the State of Delaware. See "Comparison of
Rights of Holders of TriQuint Common Stock and Sawtek Common Stock" on page 111 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

    At
the closing of the merger, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of TriQuint, Timber Acquisition Corp., Sawtek or any of their stockholders, each share of
Sawtek common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive 1.1507 shares of TriQuint
common stock upon surrender of the certificate representing such share of Sawtek common stock in the manner provided for in the merger agreement, or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit and bond, if required. The exchange ratio in the merger will be appropriately adjusted in the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
extraordinary cash dividends, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to TriQuint common stock or Sawtek common stock
occurring prior to the closing of the merger. However, no adjustment in the exchange ratio will be made for changes in the relative market prices of Sawtek's and TriQuint's shares. No fractional
shares of TriQuint common stock will be issued in connection with the merger. Instead you will receive cash, without interest, in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares of TriQuint common stock
which would have been otherwise issuable to you as a result of the merger. Each share of Sawtek common stock held by Sawtek or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Sawtek immediately
prior to the closing of the merger will be cancelled and extinguished. 

Background of the merger  

    On January 23, 2001, Steven J. Sharp, chairman, president and chief executive officer of TriQuint, spoke with Kimon Anemogiannis, president and chief
executive officer of Sawtek, regarding a possible joint effort to develop integrated modules for cellular telephones. On January 24, 2001, Mr. Sharp and Dr. Anemogiannis spoke
again and Mr. Sharp invited Dr. Anemogiannis and Raymond A. Link, chief financial officer of Sawtek, to visit TriQuint in order to discuss the design and manufacture of integrated
modules. On February 4, 2001, Mr. Sharp, Dr. Anemogiannis, Mr. Link and Peter Wright, TriQuint's manager of strategic marketing, met to discuss the use of Sawtek products
in integrated modules and to discuss each company's strategy and plans. Dr. Anemogiannis and Mr. Link were given tours of the TriQuint facilities in Hillsboro, Oregon. 

    On February 7, 2001, at a regular meeting of the TriQuint board of directors, Mr. Sharp discussed Sawtek products as they related to TriQuint's business strategy, as
well as the potential for working together in a number of ways. On February 8, 2001, Mr. Sharp discussed with his senior staff the content of his meeting on February 4, 2001 with
Dr. Anemogiannis and Mr. Link. 

    On
February 7, 2001, Steven P. Miller called Mr. Sharp and invited him to visit Sawtek's headquarters in Orlando. On February 23, 2001, Mr. Sharp
visited Sawtek's headquarters and met with Dr. Anemogiannis, Mr. Link, Azhar Waseem, Sawtek's vice president of operations, Mr. Miller, chairman of the board of Sawtek, and Gary
Monetti, former chief executive officer of Sawtek. At this meeting, Mr. Sharp and the Sawtek participants decided that a future meeting should be held to share information about each company
and to discuss a possible merger. On February 26, 2001, Mr. Sharp sent a message to his senior staff and TriQuint's directors regarding his positive observations of the corporate
culture, vision, structure and potential for strategic synergies. Mr. Sharp indicated that at this point TriQuint management should continue to explore the potential for a merger with Sawtek.
On March 1, 2001, a special meeting of the board of directors of Sawtek was held in order for Sawtek management to advise the Sawtek board of directors about the preliminary discussions with
the management of TriQuint concerning a possible merger. The board of directors authorized Sawtek management to continue with these discussions on a preliminary basis. 

    On
March 2, 2001, Dr. Anemogiannis called Mr. Sharp to advise Mr. Sharp that the Sawtek board of directors authorized Sawtek management to continue with
these discussions. Mr. Sharp and Dr. Anemogiannis decided to meet in Dallas, Texas, along with members of their management teams and legal counsel. On March 6 and 7, 2001, a group
from TriQuint and a group from Sawtek met in Dallas to exchange confidential information and to discuss a possible merger. Present for Sawtek were Dr. Anemogiannis, Mr. Link,
Mr. Miller and William A. Grimm of Gray, Harris & Robinson, P.A., legal counsel to Sawtek. Present for TriQuint were Mr. Sharp, Edson H. Whitehurst, Jr., chief financial
officer of TriQuint, Charles Scott Gibson, a member of the board of directors of TriQuint, and William C.
Campbell of Ater Wynne, LLP, legal counsel for TriQuint. A confidentiality agreement was signed at the beginning of this meeting. Both parties presented an overview of their business plans with an
emphasis on the opportunity for integrated modules for cellular telephones. At the conclusion of this meeting, both parties stated that they would each have separate internal discussions regarding the
possibility of a strategic relationship before having further discussions between the two companies. 

    On
or about March 8, 2001, Mr. Sharp and Mr. Whitehurst initiated discussions with two investment banking firms and indicated their desire to engage both firms to
provide fairness opinions in connection with a possible merger with Sawtek. 

    On
or about March 9, 2001, Dr. Anemogiannis called Mr. Sharp to set up a second meeting in Dallas to further discuss the business plans of each company and the potential
strategic fit between the two companies. Mr. Sharp and Dr. Anemogiannis decided to meet in Dallas on March 15 and 16, 2001 with management teams from each company. On
March 15 and 16, 2001, management teams from TriQuint and Sawtek met to discuss integrated module opportunities, customer opportunities and other synergies that might be achieved if the two
companies merged. Discussions were held concerning the possible terms of a merger involving a stock for stock exchange and whether a transaction could be accounted for using the pooling of interests
method of accounting. 

    Present
at this meeting for TriQuint were Mr. Sharp, Mr. Whitehurst, Ronald Ruebusch, vice president of wireless communications, David McQuiddy, vice
president of research and development, and Thomas Cordner, vice president and general manager of millimeter wave communications. Present at this meeting for Sawtek were Dr. Anemogiannis,
Mr. Link, Mr. Waseem and Mr. Miller. 

    A
special meeting of the board of directors of Sawtek was held on March 26, 2001, at the Sawtek headquarters for the purpose of discussing terms of a possible merger with
TriQuint and the need to engage an investment banker for purposes of a fairness opinion if agreement could be reached 

regarding a merger. The board of directors authorized management of Sawtek to continue with the discussions regarding a possible merger with TriQuint. Dr. Anemogiannis advised the board of
directors that Mr. Sharp would be traveling in Europe for approximately a week and that further discussions would take place following Mr. Sharp's return. 

    Pursuant
to an engagement letter dated March 9, 2001, on March 28, 2001, Mr. Link engaged JPMorgan H&Q as Sawtek's investment banking firm to render a fairness
opinion in connection with a possible merger with TriQuint. 

    On
April 4, 2001, at a regular meeting of the TriQuint board of directors, Mr. Sharp discussed Sawtek's products as they related to TriQuint's business strategy, as well
as the potential for working together in a number of ways. 

    On
April 9, 2001, Sawtek received a draft of a letter and outline of terms from TriQuint proposing a merger of Sawtek with a wholly owned subsidiary of TriQuint whereby Sawtek
shareholders would receive shares of TriQuint common stock in a tax-free exchange, with the transaction to be accounted for as a pooling of interests. Discussions took place internally in
Sawtek and among Sawtek, its investment banking firm and its legal counsel concerning the proposed letter and term sheet. 

    On
April 19, 2001, Dr. Anemogiannis called Mr. Sharp to discuss certain aspects of the term sheet proposed by TriQuint. On April 20, 2001, Sawtek sent to
TriQuint a revised letter and term sheet. On April 27, 2001, Dr. Anemogiannis and Mr. Sharp spoke by telephone several times regarding differences in the proposed term sheets. On
April 30, 2001, Sawtek received a revised letter and term sheet from TriQuint along with a letter explaining the differences between the terms proposed by Sawtek and the terms proposed by
TriQuint. Several calls were exchanged between Dr. Anemogiannis and Mr. Sharp regarding the term sheet. On May 1, 2001, Messrs. Campbell and Grimm spoke several times
concerning the proposed letter and term sheet. On May 2, 2001, Mr. Sharp, Mr. Miller and Willis C. Young, a member of the board of directors of Sawtek, met in New York City
to discuss the proposed terms of a merger and to discuss the appointment of two members of the Sawtek board of directors to the board of directors of TriQuint if the merger took place. 

    On
May 2, 2001, TriQuint and Sawtek signed a letter agreement confirming the terms of the confidentiality agreement previously executed by them, agreeing to a mutual standstill
agreement where neither party would purchase stock or participate in certain activities with respect to the stock of the other for a period of two years, and where Sawtek agreed not to continue with
or enter into negotiations regarding an acquisition or merger until after May 30, 2001. 

    Beginning
on May 3, 2001, TriQuint and Sawtek and each of their legal and accounting advisors conducted detailed business, legal and accounting due diligence with respect to
each other. Over the course of the next two weeks, TriQuint and Sawtek and their representatives and their respective legal advisors conducted negotiations relating to a definitive merger agreement
consistent with the terms contained in the non-binding term sheet. 

    On
May 14, 2001, the board of directors of Sawtek met at Sawtek's headquarters to review a draft of the merger agreement and unanimously voted to approve and adopt the merger
agreement and approve the merger, subject to resolution of several remaining issues and final approval by an ad hoc committee created by the board of directors consisting of Mr. Miller and
Mr. Young. The fairness opinion rendered by JPMorgan H&Q was delivered to the board of directors of Sawtek on May 15, 2001. 

    On
May 14, 2001, the board of directors of TriQuint had a conference call to discuss and review a draft of the merger agreement in detail. TriQuint director Francisco Alvarez
was not present at the meeting as he was travelling outside of the country. Members of TriQuint's management, including Mr. Ruebusch and Stephanie Welty, TriQuint's vice president of finance,
and Mr. Campbell of Ater Wynne LLP reviewed the business and legal due diligence conducted on Sawtek. Steve L. Camahort of 

Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, TriQuint's outside legal counsel, reviewed the draft merger agreement and related agreements and summarized the remaining open issues and deal points.
Mr. Camahort also reviewed with the TriQuint board of directors the legal principles applicable to the proposed merger, including the board's fiduciary duties and authority in considering the
proposed merger and the share issuance by TriQuint. The members of the TriQuint board of directors discussed the benefits of such a merger and decided to make several changes to the document and to
meet the following day. On May 15, 2001, the TriQuint board of directors held a meeting via conference call, and all directors, except Francisco Alvarez, who was absent and travelling out of
the country, participated and voted unanimously to approve the merger agreement. At the May 15, 2001 TriQuint board of directors meeting, representatives of Merrill Lynch and SG Cowen presented
their oral opinions, later confirmed in writing, that on the date of each opinion the exchange ratio was fair to TriQuint from a financial point of view. 

    After
the close of trading on May 15, 2001, Sawtek and TriQuint entered into the merger agreement and the officers and directors of Sawtek and TriQuint entered into voting and
affiliate agreements with TriQuint and Sawtek, respectively. Immediately following the signing of the merger agreement, TriQuint and Sawtek issued a joint press release announcing the merger. 

Joint reasons for the merger  

    The boards of directors of TriQuint and Sawtek have determined that a combined company would be positioned to compete more effectively in the communications
market, thereby increasing the potential for improved long-term operating and financial results. In particular, the boards believe that the merger will create the opportunity for TriQuint
and Sawtek to: 


have
a combined complementary technology portfolio and engineering talent to design products for the entire radio front end of mobile phones and other
wireless communications;


offer
cost effective integrated radio frequency module solutions to the combined company's mobile phone customer base that reduce the number of components
and the failure rates of completed phones; and


develop
more complete solutions and better penetrate their combined customer base to take advantage of cross sales opportunities. 

Recommendation of, and factors considered by, the Sawtek board of directors  

    In reaching its decision to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, the Sawtek board of directors consulted with Sawtek's management and its
legal counsel. Sawtek employed JPMorgan H&Q to provide a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed merger and did not seek any assistance from JPMorgan H&Q or any other investment banker or
financial advisor in negotiating the terms of the merger or to seek out alternative acquirers or merger partners. The Sawtek board considered numerous potential merger candidates and determined that
TriQuint offered the greatest potential for long-term value to the Sawtek shareholders. The Sawtek board of directors believed that the combined experience of the members of the board of directors and
the executive officers of Sawtek enabled the Sawtek board of directors to make an informed decision with respect to the terms of the proposed merger and a decision not to seek alternative acquirers or
merger partners. Among the factors considered by the Sawtek board of directors in its deliberations were the following: 

    Terms of the Transaction.
  In reaching its decision, the Sawtek board of directors reviewed Sawtek's business, results
of operations, and near- and long-term prospects as an independent entity, its business model, and the financial aspects and timing of the merger as compared to continuing as
an independent company. Sawtek's board of directors also considered Sawtek's strategic position in its industry, its management, its near-and long-term prospects and the
anticipated value of the combined 

company resulting from the merger. The Sawtek board of directors viewed TriQuint as having a track record that demonstrates a clear ability to compete effectively in the semiconductor industry and, in
particular, the communications industry. In analyzing the terms of the proposed transaction with TriQuint, the Sawtek board of directors took into account: 


the
current and historical market prices of TriQuint common stock;


the
risks and possible rewards associated with the ownership of TriQuint common stock;


the
substantial number of shares of TriQuint common stock to be delivered to Sawtek shareholders in the merger, which reflected, in the view of the Sawtek
board of directors, a fair valuation of Sawtek;


the
terms of the merger agreement, including representations and warranties, conditions to closing and rights of termination;


the
anticipated favorable impact of the merger on customers, suppliers and employees of Sawtek and TriQuint;


the
expected qualification of the merger as a tax free reorganization under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code;


the
likelihood that the merger would be treated as a pooling of interests for accounting purposes; and


the
likelihood that the merger would be completed. 

    Industry Trends.
  The Sawtek board of directors was aware of industry trends toward integrated modules for use in
handsets for wireless communications and the trend of manufacturers of mobile phones to outsource greater portions of the modules which make up mobile phones. In the opinion of the Sawtek board of
directors, the trend toward integrated modules would require Sawtek to work very closely with one or more semiconductor companies in order to achieve optimum design and cost effective manufacturing of
modules integrating surface acoustic wave devices, semiconductors and passive components in a single integrated module. 

    Strategic Alternatives.
  The Sawtek board of directors' deliberations included consideration of the likelihood of
effecting alternative transactions and the alternative of continuing as an independent company with a view to working with one or more semiconductor companies on a joint venture or other basis to
achieve optimum design and cost effective manufacturing of integrated modules. The Sawtek board of directors also considered the financial terms of the transaction in view of certain industry
valuation metrics (including revenue, gross margins, net after tax profits, historical growth rates) and comparable transactions. The Sawtek board of directors took into account the views expressed by
Sawtek management that TriQuint occupies a prominent position in the communications industry as a provider of semiconductor products for mobile phones and other communications products and that
TriQuint appears to be a good strategic fit for Sawtek. The Sawtek board of directors believes that TriQuint would be a good strategic fit based on: 


a
shared vision of the opportunity to design and cost-effectively produce integrated modules for cellular telephones;


technological
developments made or planned by TriQuint which are likely to contribute toward the success of Sawtek's evolving products;


the
sharing of a number of major customers and each having customers who could make large potential customers for the other;


the
diversified technology base of TriQuint where TriQuint sells integrated circuits which are incorporated into a variety of communications products,
including cellular phones and pagers, 

fiber
optic telecommunications equipment, satellite communications systems, high-performance data networking products and aerospace applications; 


the
proprietary gallium arsenide technology utilized by TriQuint that permits integrated circuits to operate at much higher speeds than silicon devices, or
operate at the same speeds with reduced power consumption; and


the
anticipated value of the merger to TriQuint. 

    The
Sawtek board of directors also identified and considered a number of potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger, including: 


the
risk that its operations might not be successfully integrated with the operations of TriQuint;


the
risk that, despite its efforts after the merger, key personnel might leave the combined company;


the
risk that the combined company may not be successful in developing integrated modules which offer cost savings to customers;


the
risk that gross margins may decline for integrated modules if the combined company cannot produce the modules cost effectively;


the
difficulty of managing operations in the different geographic locations in which Sawtek and TriQuint operate and will continue to operate; and


the
risk that the potential benefits of the merger might not be fully realized. 

    The
Sawtek board of directors believes that some of these risks are unlikely to occur, that the combined company can avoid or mitigate these risks, and that, overall, these risks are
outweighed by the potential benefits of the merger. 

    Tax and Accounting Treatment of the Transaction.
  The Sawtek board of directors considered that the merger is expected
to be generally tax-free for federal income tax purposes to Sawtek shareholders receiving TriQuint common stock and to be accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting
for business combinations. 

    After
considering the recommendation of the board of directors with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that some directors and officers of Sawtek have interests in
the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of Sawtek shareholders generally. Please see the section entitled "Interests of Sawtek Directors and Officers in the Merger"
beginning on page 79 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

Recommendation of TriQuint's board of directors and TriQuint's reasons for the merger  

    In reaching its decision to approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger and the share issuance, the TriQuint board of directors consulted
with TriQuint's management and legal counsel. TriQuint retained Merrill Lynch and SG Cowen to provide fairness opinions but did not seek assistance from Merrill Lynch, SG Cowen or any other investment
banker or financial advisor in negotiating the merger. The TriQuint board of directors believed that the combined experience of its members and TriQuint management enabled the TriQuint board of
directors to make an informed decision regarding the merger agreement, merger and share issuance. 

    At
a meeting held on May 15, 2001, the board of directors of TriQuint concluded that the merger is consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term business
strategy of TriQuint and is fair to, and in the best interests of, TriQuint and the TriQuint stockholders. Accordingly, the board of directors determined to recommend that the TriQuint stockholders
approve the issuance of the shares of TriQuint common stock in the merger. The summary set forth below briefly describes certain of the 

reasons, factors and information taken into account by the TriQuint board in reaching its conclusion. The TriQuint board did not assign any relative or specific weights to the factors considered in
reaching such determination, and individual directors may have given differing weights to different factors. 

    In
reaching its determination, the TriQuint board consulted with TriQuint's management and legal and financial advisors, and carefully considered a number of factors, including: 


Strategic Benefits.
 The potential strategic benefits of the merger, including without
limitation, the ability to produce products for the entire radio front end of mobile phones;


Historical Information.
 Historical information concerning TriQuint's and Sawtek's respective
businesses, prospects, financial performance and condition, operations, technology, management and competitive position, including public reports concerning results of operations for each company
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;


Prospects.
 TriQuint management's view of the financial condition, results of operations and
businesses of TriQuint and Sawtek before and after giving effect to the merger;


Market Conditions.
 Current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
volatility and trading information with respect to TriQuint common stock and Sawtek common stock;


Merger Consideration.
 The consideration to be received by Sawtek shareholders in the merger
and the relationship between the current and historical market values of TriQuint common stock and Sawtek common stock and a comparison of comparable merger transactions;


Terms of the Merger Agreement.
 The belief that the terms of the merger agreement, including
the parties' respective representations, warranties and covenants, and the conditions to their respective obligations, are reasonable;


TriQuint as a Stand-Alone Company.
 The prospects of TriQuint independent of Sawtek;


Available Alternatives.
 The potential for other parties to enter into strategic
relationships with or to acquire TriQuint or Sawtek;


Opinions of Merrill Lynch and SG Cowen.
 The TriQuint board also considered the opinions of
Merrill Lynch and SG Cowen that the exchange ratio was fair from a financial point of view on the date of such opinions to TriQuint. The opinions are subject to assumptions and limitations noted in
the opinions and described under "Opinion of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated" beginning on page 63 and "Opinion of SG Cowen Securities Corporation" beginning on
page 69 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You should carefully read both that section and the opinions that are attached to this document as 

Annex C
 and 
Annex D
;


Impact on TriQuint.
 The impact of the merger on TriQuint's customers and employees; and


Diligence on Sawtek.
 Reports from management, legal and financial advisors as to the results
of the due diligence investigation of Sawtek. 

    In
its decision to recommend and approve the merger and the share issuance, the most important benefits identified by the board of directors of TriQuint were the following: 


TriQuint
management's belief that, given the complementary nature of the technologies and business strategies of TriQuint and Sawtek, the merger will
enhance the opportunity for the potential realization of TriQuint's strategic objective to provide integrated front end modules for mobile phone customers;


the
potential for TriQuint's significant customers to benefit from the broader scope of TriQuint's offerings in radio frequency integrated circuit
marketplace; 


TriQuint's
stockholders would have the opportunity to participate in the potential for growth of the combined company after the merger;


the
potential ability of TriQuint and Sawtek to combine their product lines to create additional opportunities for designing products for the entire radio
front end; and


the
potential ability of the combined company to develop and market a low cost, high reliability radio frequency module. 

    Potential
risks for other negative factors identified by the TriQuint board of directors include the following: 


the
risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized;


the
challenges of integrating the management teams, strategies, cultures and organizations of the two companies, particularly given the geographic
separation of their facilities;


the
risk that Sawtek's financial results will not meet expectations given the current slowdown in demand for semiconductors and mobile phones and Sawtek's
customer base;


the
risk of disruption of sales momentum as a result of uncertainties created by the announcement of the merger or customers' expectations of the rapid
release of new, joint products;


the
risk that the merger might not occur despite the parties' efforts, even if approved by the holders of each company's common stock;


the
substantial charges to be incurred in connection with the merger, including costs of integrating the businesses and transaction expenses arising from
the merger;


the
effect of public announcement of the merger and the possibility of the merger might not be consummated on (a) TriQuint's sales and operating
results, (b) TriQuint's ability to attract and retain key management, marketing and technical personnel and (c) progress of certain development projects; and


other
applicable risks described in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 23. 

    The
foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the TriQuint board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but includes the material factors considered by
the TriQuint board of directors. In view of the complexity and wide variety of information and factors, both positive and negative, considered by the TriQuint board of directors, it did not find it
practical to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative or specific weights to the factors considered. In addition, the TriQuint board did not reach any specific conclusion with respect to each of
the factors considered, or any aspect of any particular factor. Instead, the TriQuint board of directors conducted an overall analysis of the
factors described above, including discussions with TriQuint's management and legal, financial and accounting advisors. In considering the factors described above, individual members of the TriQuint
board of directors may have given different weights to different factors. 

    The
TriQuint board considered all these factors as a whole and believed the factors supported its determination to approve the TriQuint merger. 

After taking into consideration all of the factors set forth above, the members of TriQuint's board of directors present at the meeting where these factors
were considered unanimously concluded that the TriQuint merger is consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term business strategy of TriQuint and is fair to, and in the best
interests of, TriQuint and TriQuint stockholders and that TriQuint should proceed with the merger.

Opinion of JPMorgan H&Q  

    Pursuant to an engagement letter dated March 9, 2001, Sawtek retained JPMorgan H&Q, a division of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as its financial
advisor in connection with the proposed merger of Sawtek and TriQuint. 

    At
the meeting of the board of directors of Sawtek on May 15, 2001, JPMorgan H&Q rendered its oral opinion to the board of directors of Sawtek that, as of such date, the
exchange ratio in the proposed merger was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of Sawtek common stock. JPMorgan H&Q has confirmed its May 15, 2001 oral opinion by delivering its
written opinion to the board of directors of Sawtek, dated May 15, 2001, that, as of such date, the exchange ratio in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of Sawtek common stock. No limitations were imposed by Sawtek's board of directors upon JPMorgan H&Q with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in rendering its
opinions. 

    The
full text of the written opinion of JPMorgan H&Q, dated May 15, 2001, which sets forth the assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is
attached as 
Annex B
 to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. Sawtek's shareholders are urged to read the
opinion in its entirety. JPMorgan H&Q's written opinion is addressed to the board of directors of Sawtek, is directed only to the exchange ratio in the merger and does not constitute a recommendation
to any shareholder of Sawtek as to how such shareholder should vote at Sawtek's special meeting. The summary of the opinion of JPMorgan H&Q set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. 

    In
arriving at its opinions, JPMorgan H&Q, among other things: 


reviewed
a draft of the merger agreement dated May 15, 2001;


reviewed
certain publicly available business and financial information concerning Sawtek and TriQuint and the industries in which they operate;


compared
the proposed financial terms of the merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies JPMorgan H&Q
deemed relevant and the consideration received for such companies;


compared
the financial and operating performance of Sawtek and TriQuint with publicly available information concerning certain other companies JPMorgan H&Q
deemed relevant;


reviewed
the current and historical market prices of Sawtek common stock and TriQuint common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other
companies;


reviewed
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the managements of Sawtek and TriQuint relating to their respective businesses; and


performed
such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as it deemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion. 

    JPMorgan
H&Q relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or that was furnished to it by
Sawtek and TriQuint or otherwise reviewed by JPMorgan H&Q, and JPMorgan H&Q has not assumed any responsibility or liability therefor. JPMorgan H&Q has not conducted any valuation or appraisal of any
assets or liabilities, nor have any valuations or appraisals been provided to JPMorgan H&Q. The projections furnished to JPMorgan H&Q for Sawtek and TriQuint were prepared by the respective management
of each company. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to JPMorgan H&Q, JPMorgan H&Q has assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of Sawtek and TriQuint to which such analyses or 

forecasts relate. JPMorgan H&Q has also assumed that the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United States income tax purposes and that the other transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement will be consummated as described in the merger agreement and this joint proxy statement/prospectus. JPMorgan H&Q relied as to all legal matters relevant to rendering its
opinion upon the advice of its counsel. JPMorgan H&Q also assumed that the definitive agreement would not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to it. JPMorgan H&Q further
assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on Sawtek or TriQuint or on
the contemplated benefits of the merger. 

    JPMorgan
H&Q's opinion is based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to JPMorgan H&Q as of the date of such opinions.
Subsequent developments may affect the opinion of JPMorgan H&Q, and JPMorgan H&Q does not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. JPMorgan H&Q expressed no opinion as to the
price at which Sawtek or TriQuint common stock will trade at any time after the date of such opinion. 

    In
accordance with customary investment banking practice, JPMorgan H&Q employed generally accepted valuation methods in reaching its opinion. The following is a summary of the
material financial analyses utilized by JPMorgan H&Q in connection with providing its opinion. 

 Premium and Implied Ownership Analysis  

    JPMorgan H&Q reviewed the ratios of the closing prices of Sawtek common stock divided by the corresponding prices of the TriQuint common stock for the period
from May 15, 2000 to May 14, 2001. The daily implied market exchange ratio over this period ranged from approximately 0.6358x to 1.6325x with an average exchange ratio of 1.1107x over
the same period. JPMorgan H&Q observed the following: 

    Premium

    JPMorgan
H&Q noted that these ownership percentages are lower than the implied ownership of 36% based on the exchange ratio. 

 Selected Public Trading Multiples  

    Using publicly available information, JPMorgan H&Q compared selected financial data of Sawtek with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged
in businesses which JPMorgan H&Q deemed to be comparative to Sawtek. The companies selected by JPMorgan H&Q were: 


Alpha
Industries, Inc.


Anadigics, Inc.


WJ
Communications, Inc. 

    These companies were selected, among other reasons, because they engage in businesses reasonably comparative to those of Sawtek. For each comparative company, JPMorgan H&Q measured
publicly available financial performance through the calendar year ended December 31, 2000, as well as financial projections for calendar years 2001 and 2002 by the equity analysts covering
each comparative company. JPMorgan H&Q selected the mean value for each multiple, specifically: the ratio of firm value to calendar year 2000 actual and 2001 and 2002 estimated revenue. These
multiples were then applied to Sawtek's calendar year 2000 actual and 2001 and 2002 estimated revenue, yielding implied trading values for Sawtek common stock of approximately $18.00 to $21.49 per
share. The following table represents a comparison of the mean revenue multiples of the comparative public companies and the implied offer multiples for Sawtek based on an actual calendar year 2000
and expected 2001 and 2002 revenue.

    JPMorgan
H&Q observed that the implied TriQuint offer per share of $30.26 fell above the range implied by comparative company mean multiples. 

 Selected Comparative Transaction Analysis  

    Using publicly available information, JPMorgan H&Q examined the following selected transactions: 


Marvell
Technology / Galileo Technology 

Applied
Micro Circuits / MMC Networks 

Texas
Instruments / Burr-Brown 

PMC
Sierra / Quantum Effect Devices 

Lucent
/ Ortel 

Conexant
Systems / Maker Communications 

Texas
Instruments / Unitrode 

Intel
/ Level One 

LSI
Logic / SEEQ Technology 

    JPMorgan
H&Q calculated transaction equity values for the above-mentioned transactions at the time of the announcement ("Announcement Value") and then JPMorgan H&Q adjusted
Announcement Value to current equity value ("Adjusted Value") by multiplying the number of shares issued in each of the transactions by respective acquirer's trading price on May 14, 2001.
JPMorgan H&Q then calculated adjusted firm value ("Adjusted Firm Value") by adding respective net debt at the time of the announcement to each of the respective Adjusted Values. 

    JPMorgan
H&Q considered a set of multiples from the analyzed transactions calculated by dividing the Adjusted Firm Value by the target's last twelve months sales ("Adjusted Firm Value
/ LTM Sales"). 

    JPMorgan H&Q then applied the range of Adjusted Firm Value / LTM Sales multiples derived from such analysis to Sawtek's last twelve months sales, and arrived at an estimated range of
equity values for Sawtek common stock of between $27.43 and $34.39 per share.

    JPMorgan

 Discounted Cash Flow Analysis  

    JPMorgan H&Q conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining the fully diluted equity value per share for Sawtek common stock.
JPMorgan H&Q calculated the unlevered free cash flows that Sawtek is expected to generate during calendar years 2001 through 2005 based upon financial projections prepared by the management of Sawtek
through the years ended 2002 and upon management estimates of growth and margins during the five-year period. JPMorgan H&Q also calculated a range of terminal asset values of Sawtek at the
end of the five-year period ending December 31, 2005 by applying a terminal P/E multiple ranging from 11x to 17x to the unlevered free cash flow of Sawtek during the final year of
the five-year period. The unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal asset values were then discounted to present values using a range of discount rates from 11% to 15%, which
were chosen by JPMorgan H&Q based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of Sawtek. The present value of the unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal asset values were
then adjusted for Sawtek's estimated March 31, 2001 excess cash, option exercise proceeds and total debt. Based on the adjusted management projections the discounted cash
flow analysis indicated a range of equity values of between $23 and $28 per share of Sawtek common stock on a stand-alone basis. 

    JPMorgan
H&Q observed that the implied TriQuint offer per share of $30.26 fell above the range implied by the discounted cash flow analysis. 

 Contribution Analysis  

    JPMorgan H&Q performed a contribution analysis based on historical results for Sawtek and TriQuint in 2000, Sawtek management projections for 2001 and 2002,
and estimates of TriQuint's financial performance for 2001 and 2002 provided through discussions with TriQuint management. The following table presents the contribution analysis of Sawtek and TriQuint
to the combined company:

for Sawtek. 

    The
summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by JPMorgan H&Q. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process
and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. JPMorgan H&Q believes that the summary set forth above and their analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions
thereof, without considering all of its analyses, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and opinion. JPMorgan H&Q based its analyses on assumptions that it deemed
reasonable, including assumptions concerning general business and economic conditions and industry-specific factors. The other principal assumptions upon which JPMorgan H&Q based its analyses are set
forth above under the description of each such analysis. JPMorgan H&Q's analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results that might be achieved, which values may be
higher or lower than those indicated. Moreover, JPMorgan H&Q's analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be bought
or sold. 

    As
a part of its investment banking business, JPMorgan H&Q and its affiliates are engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for estate,
corporate and other purposes. Sawtek selected JPMorgan H&Q with respect to the merger on the basis of its experience and familiarity with Sawtek. 

    Sawtek
has agreed to pay JPMorgan H&Q a fee for its services rendered in connection with the merger. In addition, Sawtek has agreed to indemnify JPMorgan H&Q against certain
liabilities, including liabilities arising under the federal securities laws and otherwise. 

    JPMorgan
H&Q and its affiliates maintain banking and other business relationships with Sawtek and its affiliates, for which it receives customary fees. In the ordinary course of their
businesses, JPMorgan H&Q and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities of Sawtek or TriQuint for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, they may
at any time hold long or short positions in such securities. 

Opinion of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated  

    TriQuint retained Merrill Lynch to render a fairness opinion with respect to TriQuint's proposed business combination with Sawtek. At the meeting of TriQuint's
Board on May 15, 2001, Merrill Lynch rendered its oral opinion, concurrently confirmed in writing by letter dated May 15, 2001 (the "Merrill Lynch Opinion"), to the effect that, as of
May 15, 2001, and based upon the assumptions made, matters considered and limits of review, as set forth in such opinion, the exchange ratio was fair to TriQuint from a financial point of view. 

A copy of the Merrill Lynch Opinion, which sets forth the assumptions made, matters considered and certain limitations on the scope of review undertaken by
Merrill Lynch, is attached hereto as 
Annex C
 and is incorporated herein by reference. The description of the Merrill Lynch Opinion set forth
herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. TriQuint stockholders are urged to read the Merrill Lynch Opinion in its entirety. The Merrill Lynch Opinion is
addressed to the TriQuint board of directors and addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view of the
exchange ratio. The Merrill Lynch Opinion does not address the underlying decision by TriQuint to engage in the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any TriQuint stockholder as to how
such stockholder should vote at the TriQuint special meeting.  

    In arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch, among other things: 


Reviewed
certain publicly available business and financial information relating to TriQuint and Sawtek that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant; 

Reviewed
certain information, including financial forecasts, relating to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of TriQuint
and Sawtek, furnished to or discussed with Merrill Lynch by TriQuint and Sawtek; 

Conducted
discussions with members of senior management and representatives of TriQuint and Sawtek concerning the matters described in the above clauses,
as well as their respective businesses and prospects before and after giving effect to the merger; 

Reviewed
the market prices and valuation multiples for the TriQuint common stock and the Sawtek common stock and compared them with those of certain
publicly traded companies that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant; 

Reviewed
the results of operations of TriQuint and Sawtek and compared them with those of certain publicly traded companies that Merrill Lynch deemed to be
relevant; 

Compared
the proposed financial terms of the merger with the financial terms of certain other transactions that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant; 

Participated
in certain discussions among representatives of TriQuint and Sawtek and their respective financial and legal advisors; 

Reviewed
the potential pro forma impact of the merger; 

Reviewed
a draft dated May 14, 2001 of the merger agreement; and 

Reviewed
such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other matters as Merrill Lynch deemed necessary, including its assessment of
general economic, market and monetary conditions. 

    In
preparing its opinion, Merrill Lynch relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made available to it, and did not assume any responsibility
for independently verifying such information or undertaking an independent evaluation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of TriQuint or Sawtek, and no such evaluation
or appraisal was provided to it. In addition, Merrill Lynch did not assume any obligation to conduct, nor did it conduct any physical inspection of the properties or facilities of TriQuint and Sawtek.
With respect to the financial forecasts information furnished to or discussed with Merrill Lynch by Sawtek, Merrill Lynch assumed that the information was reasonably prepared and reflected the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Sawtek. With respect to the financial forecasts for TriQuint, Merrill Lynch reviewed and discussed with the management of TriQuint
publicly available financial forecasts relating to TriQuint and projections therefrom and Merrill Lynch assumed that such forecasts were reasonably prepared and such forecasts and projections
therefrom represented the best currently available estimates and judgments as to the future financial performance of TriQuint. Merrill Lynch further assumed that the merger will be accounted for as a
pooling of interests under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and that it will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Merrill Lynch also
assumed that the final form of the merger agreement would be substantially similar to the last draft it reviewed. 

    Merrill
Lynch's opinion necessarily was based upon market, economic and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on, and on the information made available to it as of
May 15, 2001. 

    In
performing its analyses, Merrill Lynch made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond the control of Merrill Lynch, Sawtek or TriQuint. Any estimates contained in the analyses performed by Merrill Lynch are not necessarily indicative of actual values
or future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. Additionally, 

estimates of the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities might actually be sold. Accordingly, such analyses
and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, as described above, Merrill Lynch's opinion was among several factors taken into consideration by the TriQuint board of
directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and the merger. Consequently, Merrill Lynch's analyses should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of the TriQuint board
of
directors or TriQuint's management with respect to the fairness of the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement. 

    At
the meeting of the TriQuint board of directors held on May 15, 2001, Merrill Lynch presented certain financial analyses accompanied by written materials in connection with
the delivery of its oral opinion. The following is a summary of the material financial and comparative analyses performed by Merrill Lynch in arriving at its opinion. Some of the financial analyses
summarized below include information presented in a tabular format. In order to understand fully Merrill Lynch's financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of the summary. The
tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data set forth below in tables without considering the full narrative description of the financial
analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Merrill Lynch's financial analysis. 

 Historical Relative Trading Performance  

    Merrill Lynch reviewed the recent historical stock market performance of Sawtek common stock and TriQuint common stock in relation to each other and reviewed
the exchange ratios implied by those relative trading values. In addition, Merrill Lynch compared the merger agreement exchange ratio of 1.1507x to the average exchange ratios over certain specified
time periods and noted the amount by which the 1.1507x exchange ratio constituted a premium to such period averages, including the information set forth below:

April 20, 2001, for TriQuint for the calendar years 2001 and 2002 (the "TriQuint Projections"), Merrill Lynch compared certain financial and operating information for both TriQuint and Sawtek
with the corresponding financial and operating information for thirteen publicly traded companies (the 

"Merrill Comparable Companies") engaged primarily in businesses which Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant for the purpose of its analysis, including:

Merrill Comparable Companies as a multiple of, among other things, projected revenues for the calendar years 2001 and 2002, price/earnings ratios for calendar years 2001 and 2002 and price/earnings
for calendar year 2002 to forecasted earnings growth rates. 

    Applying
the ranges of multiples derived from the Merrill Comparable Companies information, Merrill Lynch calculated the following ranges of implied equity share values for TriQuint
and Sawtek:

    None
of the companies utilized in the above analysis for comparative purposes is, of course, identical to TriQuint or Sawtek. Accordingly, a complete analysis of the results of the
foregoing calculations cannot be limited to a quantitative review of such results and involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of
the Merrill Comparable Companies and other factors that could affect the public trading value of the comparable companies. 

 Comparable Acquisition Analysis  

    Merrill Lynch also reviewed the financial terms of six transactions in the communications integrated circuit industry and three transactions in the analog
industry (the "Comparable Acquisitions"). The Comparable Acquisitions considered in the communications integrated circuit industry, in reverse order of announcement date, were: 


the
acquisition of Galileo Technology by Marvell Technology Group; 

the
acquisition of MMC Networks by Applied Micro Circuits; 

the
acquisition of Quantum Effect Devices by PMC-Sierra; 

the
acquisition of Maker Communications by Conexant Systems; 

the
acquisition of DSP Communications by Intel Corp.; and 

the
acquisition of Level One Communications by Intel Corp. 

    The
Comparable Acquisitions considered in the analog industry, in reverse order of announcement, were: 


the
acquisition of Dallas Semiconductor by Maxim Integrated Products; 

the
acquisition of Burr-Brown Corp. by Texas Instruments; and 

the
acquisition of Unitode Corp. by Texas Instruments. 

    Merrill
Lynch analyzed the transaction values (defined as offer value plus net debt) for the Comparable Acquisitions as multiples of, among other things, current calendar year's
revenues and next calendar year's revenues and offer values for the Comparable Acquisitions, as multiples of current calendar year's net income and next calendar year's net income. 

    Applying
the ranges of multiples derived from the Comparable Acquisitions, Merrill Lynch calculated the following ranges of implied equity share values for TriQuint and Sawtek and the
following ranges of implied exchange ratios:

    No
transaction examined in the comparable acquisition analysis was identical to the merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing is not purely mathematical.
Rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies included in the comparable acquisition transaction analysis
and other factors that could affect the offer value and the transaction consideration. 

 Premium Analysis  

    Merrill Lynch reviewed the premiums paid to the market exchange ratio in the Comparable Acquisitions and analyzed the following ranges of premiums to the
market exchange ratio and ranges of exchange ratios implied therefrom: 

Market Exchange Ratio Prior to Transaction

Range of Premiums to Market Exchange Ratio

18.2% - 87.8%

Range of Implied Exchange Ratios Based on Premiums to Market Exchange Ratio 1 Month Prior to Transaction

 Discounted Cash Flow Valuation  

    Merrill Lynch also performed discounted cash flow valuations (i.e., derivation and analyses of the present value of the projected unlevered free cash flows and
terminal values for the periods and at the discount rates indicated) of both TriQuint and Sawtek for the years 2001 to 2005, inclusive, using the TriQuint Projections, the
SawtekManagement Case, and the SawtekStreet Case and using discount rates reflecting a weighted average cost of capital ranging from 19% - 23% and terminal
value multiples of calendar year 2005 EBITDA ranging from 19.0x - 23.0x and 18.0x - 22.0x for Sawtek and TriQuint, respectively. Projected financial results for the periods 2003 to 2005 for TriQuint
and Sawtek 

were based upon, but not limited to, historical results, projected industry growth rates, discussions with TriQuint management for TriQuint, and Sawtek management forecasts for Sawtek. 

    Applying
the results of such discounted cash flow valuation, Merrill Lynch calculated a range of implied equity values per share and exchange ratios as follows:

 Contribution Analysis  

    Merrill Lynch observed that, after giving effect to the issuance of TriQuint common stock in the merger, Sawtek shareholders would own 36% of the outstanding
shares of TriQuint common stock. Merrill Lynch analyzed the relative contributions of TriQuint and Sawtek to the operating results and net income of the pro forma combined entity. Using the TriQuint
Projections, the SawtekManagement Case and the SawtekStreet Case for the calendar years 2001 and 2002, the relative contributions of TriQuint and Sawtek to operating results
and net income implied the following ranges of exchange ratios:

 Pro Forma Combination Analysis  

    Merrill Lynch analyzed certain pro forma earnings effects resulting from the merger. In its analyses, Merrill Lynch used the TriQuint Projections, the
SawtekManagement Case, and the SawtekStreet Case, and assumed the merger was treated as a pooling of interests business combination for accounting purposes. These analyses
yielded the following projections of accretion/dilution to earnings per share accretion/dilution to current TriQuint stockholders:

 Other Factors  

    In the course of preparing its opinion, Merrill Lynch also reviewed and considered other information and data, including the following: 


the
performance of Sawtek common stock and TriQuint common stock against indices composed by Merrill Lynch; 

the
performance of Sawtek common stock and TriQuint common stock against the Nasdaq Composite Index; and 

the
research and commentary of Wall Street analysts who follow the relevant industries. 

    The
summary set forth above of Merrill Lynch's analyses underpinning its opinion is not a complete description of the analyses performed. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a
complex process and not necessarily subject to partial or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch did
not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but, rather, made qualitative judgments regarding the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Merrill
Lynch believes its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting only portions of its analyses or of the factors considered by it, could create a misleading view of the processes
underlying its analyses set forth in its opinion. 

    The
board of directors of TriQuint selected Merrill Lynch to render a fairness opinion because Merrill Lynch is an internationally recognized investment banking firm with substantial
experience in transactions similar to the merger. Merrill Lynch continually is engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions and for other
purposes and has substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger. 

    Pursuant
to a letter agreement, TriQuint agreed to pay Merrill Lynch fees as compensation for Merrill Lynch's services in rendering its opinion, a portion of which is payable only
upon consummation of the merger. The fees paid or payable to Merrill Lynch are not contingent upon the contents of the opinion delivered. In addition, TriQuint has agreed to reimburse Merrill Lynch
for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of its legal counsel) incurred in connection with its engagement, and to indemnify Merrill
Lynch and certain related persons against certain liabilities arising out of or in conjunction with the services rendered by Merrill Lynch under its engagement, including certain liabilities under
federal securities laws. 

    In
the ordinary course of business, Merrill Lynch may actively trade the securities and loans of TriQuint and Sawtek for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and,
accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities and loans. 

Opinion of SG Cowen Securities Corporation  

    Pursuant to an engagement letter dated May 1, 2001, TriQuint retained SG Cowen Securities Corporation to render an opinion to the board of directors of
TriQuint as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to TriQuint of the exchange ratio. 

    On
May 15, 2001, SG Cowen delivered written analyses and its oral opinion to the TriQuint board, subsequently confirmed in writing as of the same date, to the effect that and
subject to the various assumptions set forth therein, as of May 15, 2001, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to TriQuint. 

The full text of the written opinion of SG Cowen, dated May 15, 2001, is attached as 
Annex D
 and
is incorporated into this joint proxy statement/prospectus by reference. Holders of TriQuint common stock are urged to read the opinion in its entirety for the assumptions made, procedures followed,
other matters considered and limits of the review by SG Cowen. The summary of the written opinion
of SG Cowen is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the SG Cowen opinion. SG Cowen's analyses and opinion were prepared for and addressed to the TriQuint board and are directed  

 only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio, and do not constitute an opinion as to the merits of the transaction or a recommendation to any stockholder as to how to
vote on any matter with respect to the proposed transaction. The exchange ratio was determined through negotiations between TriQuint and Sawtek and not pursuant to recommendations of SG
Cowen.

    In
arriving at its opinion, SG Cowen reviewed and considered the financial and other matters as it deemed relevant, including, among other things: 


a
draft of the merger agreement dated May 14, 2001; 

publicly
available information for TriQuint, including its annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000,
its quarterly report filed on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2001, its proxy statement dated April 16, 2001, and other relevant financial and operating data
furnished to SG Cowen by TriQuint management; 

publicly
available information for Sawtek, including its annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2000,
its proxy statement dated December 8, 2000, its quarterly reports filed on Form 10-Q for each of the quarters ended December 31, 2000 and March 31, 2001 and
other relevant financial and operating data furnished to SG Cowen by Sawtek management; 

internal
financial analyses, reports and other information concerning TriQuint prepared by the management of TriQuint; 

internal
financial analyses, reports and other information concerning Sawtek prepared by the management of Sawtek; 

First
Call estimates and financial projections in Wall Street analyst reports for each of TriQuint and Sawtek; 

discussions
SG Cowen had with members of the management of each of TriQuint and Sawtek concerning the historical and current business operations, financial
conditions and prospects of TriQuint and Sawtek, and other matters SG Cowen deemed relevant; 

operating
results and the reported price and trading histories of the shares of the common stock of TriQuint and Sawtek as compared to operating results
and the reported price and trading histories of publicly traded companies SG Cowen deemed relevant; 

financial
terms of the merger as compared to the financial terms of selected business combinations SG Cowen deemed relevant; 

based
on forecasts provided by Sawtek and Wall Street projections, the cash flows generated by Sawtek on a stand-alone basis to determine the present value
of the discounted cash flows; 

pro
forma financial effects excluding goodwill of the merger on an accretion/dilution basis; and 

other
information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and other factors that SG Cowen deemed relevant for the purposes of its opinion. 

    In
conducting its review and arriving at its opinion, SG Cowen, with TriQuint's consent, assumed and relied, without independent investigation, upon the accuracy and completeness of
all financial and other information provided to it by TriQuint and Sawtek, respectively, or which was publicly available. SG Cowen did not undertake any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness
or reasonableness of, or independently to verify, this information. In addition, SG Cowen did not conduct or assume any obligation to conduct any physical inspection of the properties or facilities of
TriQuint or Sawtek. SG Cowen further relied upon the assurance of management of TriQuint that they were unaware of any facts that would have made the information provided to SG Cowen incomplete or
misleading in any respect. SG Cowen, with TriQuint management's consent, assumed that the financial forecasts which it examined were reasonably prepared by the management of Sawtek on bases reflecting
the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of Sawtek management as to the future 

performance of Sawtek, and that these forecasts, and Wall Street analyst projections utilized in SG Cowen's analysis, provide a reasonable basis for its opinion. 

    SG
Cowen did not make or obtain any independent evaluations, valuations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of TriQuint or Sawtek, nor was SG Cowen furnished with such
materials. Other than as specifically set forth in its opinion with respect to tax and accounting treatment, SG Cowen did not consider the effect, if any, of any legal matters on its opinion. SG
Cowen's services to TriQuint in connection with the merger were comprised solely of rendering an opinion from a financial point of view with respect to the exchange ratio. SG Cowen's opinion was
necessarily based upon economic and market conditions and other circumstances as they existed and could be evaluated by it on the date of its opinion. It should be understood that although subsequent
developments may affect its opinion, SG Cowen does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion and SG Cowen expressly disclaims any responsibility to do so. 

    For
purposes of rendering its opinion, SG Cowen did not consider the effect, if any, of any potential breach of the representations and warranties, covenants or agreements contained
in the merger agreement and SG Cowen assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that all conditions to the consummation of the merger would be satisfied without waiver thereof. SG Cowen
assumed that the final form of the merger agreement would be substantially similar to the last draft reviewed by SG Cowen. SG Cowen also assumed that all governmental, regulatory and other consents
and approvals contemplated by the merger agreement would be obtained and that in the course of obtaining any of those consents no restrictions would be imposed or waivers made that would have an
adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the merger. TriQuint informed SG Cowen, and SG Cowen assumed, that the merger (1) would be recorded as a pooling of interests under accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States and (2) would be treated as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended. 

    SG
Cowen's opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how the stockholder should vote on any matter with respect to the proposed merger. SG Cowen's opinion
does not imply any conclusion as to the likely trading range for TriQuint's common stock following consummation of the merger or otherwise, which may vary depending on numerous factors that generally
influence the price of securities. SG Cowen's opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to TriQuint of the exchange ratio. SG Cowen expressed no opinion as to the underlying
business reasons that may support the decision of the TriQuint board to approve, or TriQuint's decision to consummate, the merger. 

    The
following is a summary of the principal financial analyses performed by SG Cowen to arrive at its opinion. Some of the summaries of financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of the financial analyses. Considering the data set forth in the tables without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and
assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses. SG Cowen performed various procedures, including each of the financial analyses described
below, and reviewed with the management of TriQuint the assumptions on which those analyses were based and other factors, including the historical and projected financial results of TriQuint and
Sawtek. No limitations were imposed by the TriQuint board with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by SG Cowen in rendering its opinion. 

 Contribution Analysis  

    SG Cowen analyzed the respective contributions of TriQuint and Sawtek to the combined company of revenues, gross profit, earnings before interest expense and
income taxes (referred to as EBIT) and earnings for the following periods: (1) the latest reported twelve months (referred to as LTM), 

(2) estimated calendar year 2001, and (3) estimated calendar year 2002. This analysis was based upon the historical and projected financial results of TriQuint and Sawtek obtained from,
with TriQuint management's consent, SG Cowen Equity Research estimates for TriQuint's calendar year 2001, dated April 20, 2001, Merrill Lynch Equity Research estimates for TriQuint's calendar
year 2002, dated April 20, 2001, JPMorgan H&Q Equity Research estimates dated May 3, 2001 for Sawtek's calendar years 2001 and 2002, and Dain Rauscher Wessels Equity Research estimates
dated April 10, 2001, for Sawtek's calendar year 2001. The table below shows Sawtek's percentage contribution with respect to each of these items during each of these periods.

    Although
the communications semiconductor and similar technology transactions were used for comparison purposes, none of those transactions is directly comparable to the transaction
contemplated by TriQuint and Sawtek, and none of the companies in those transactions is directly comparable to TriQuint or Sawtek. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of such a comparison is not
purely mathematical, but instead involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in historical and projected financial and operating characteristics of the companies involved and
other factors that could affect the acquisition value of companies or TriQuint or Sawtek to which they are being compared. 

 Discounted Cash Flow Analysis  

    SG Cowen estimated a range of values for Sawtek common stock based upon the discounted present value of the projected after-tax cash flows of
Sawtek described in Wall Street analyst projections and the financial forecasts provided by management of Sawtek, for the period ended April 1, 2001 through December 31, 2005, and of the
terminal value of Sawtek at December 31, 2005, based upon multiples of EBITDA. 

    After-tax
cash flow was calculated by taking projected EBIT and subtracting from this amount projected taxes, capital expenditures, changes in working capital and changes
in other assets and liabilities and adding back projected depreciation and amortization. This analysis was based upon assumptions and projections supplied by and discussions held with the management
of Sawtek and, as a basis for calculating after-tax cash flow for calendar years 2001 and 2002, JPMorgan H&Q Equity Research dated May 3, 2001. In performing this analysis, SG Cowen
utilized discount rates ranging from 14% to 20%, which were selected based on the estimated industry weighted average cost of capital. SG Cowen utilized terminal multiples of EBITDA ranging from 10
times to 22 times, these multiples representing the general range of multiples of EBITDA for the selected companies. Utilizing this methodology, the per share equity value of Sawtek ranged from $19.49
to $42.07 per share. Because the discounted terminal value accounted for such a high percentage of the discounted present value of Sawtek, SG Cowen did not ascribe significance to this analysis in
reaching its opinion. 

 Pro Forma Earnings Analysis  

    SG Cowen analyzed the potential effect of the merger on the projected combined income statement of operations of TriQuint and Sawtek for the quarters ended
September 30, 2001 and December 31, 2001 and the calendar years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002. This analysis was based upon (1) the projected financial forecasts of
(a) TriQuint, which, with TriQuint management's consent, SG Cowen obtained from SG Cowen Equity Research estimates dated April 20, 2001, for the quarters ended September 30, 2001
and December 31, 2001 and calendar year 2001 and Merrill Lynch Equity Research estimates dated April 20, 2001, for calendar year 2002 and (b) Sawtek, which SG Cowen obtained from
JPMorgan H&Q Equity Research dated May 3, 2001 for the Wall Street research base 

case and Dain Rauscher Wessels Equity Research dated April 10, 2001, for the Wall Street research downside case and (2) 42,296,836 primary shares of Sawtek common stock outstanding and
2,480,171 options to purchase Sawtek common stock outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of $22.21, according to Sawtek management as of May 10, 2001. 

    SG
Cowen's pro forma earnings analysis did not take into account the possible effect of any cost savings or synergies in the proposed merger. The table below summarizes the results.

    The
summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of all the analyses performed by SG Cowen. The preparation of a fairness opinion involves various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analyses and the application of these methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not
readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. SG Cowen did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments as to
the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, notwithstanding the separate factors summarized above, SG Cowen believes, and has advised the TriQuint board, that its analyses
must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered by it, without considering all analyses and factors, could create an incomplete view of the process
underlying its opinion. In performing its analyses, SG Cowen made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of TriQuint and Sawtek. These analyses performed by SG Cowen are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than suggested by these analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities may actually be
sold. Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors. None
of TriQuint, Sawtek, SG Cowen or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those projected. The analyses supplied by SG Cowen and its opinion were among
several factors taken into consideration by the TriQuint board in making its decision to enter into the merger agreement and should not be considered as determinative of its decision. 

    SG
Cowen was selected by the TriQuint board to render an opinion to the TriQuint board because SG Cowen is a nationally recognized investment banking firm and because, as part of its
investment banking business, SG Cowen is continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. SG Cowen is solely providing a fairness opinion to TriQuint for which it will
receive customary fees. In addition, in the ordinary course of its business, SG Cowen and its affiliates trade the equity securities of TriQuint and Sawtek for their own account and for the accounts
of their customers, and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in those securities. SG Cowen and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business have from time to time provided,
and in the future may continue to provide, commercial and investment banking services to TriQuint, including serving as a financial advisor on potential acquisitions and as an underwriter on equity
offerings, and have received and may in the future receive fees for the rendering of its services. In particular, in 1993, SG Cowen acted as lead manager of 

TriQuint's initial public equity offering, co-manager of TriQuint's follow-on equity offering in 1995 and lead manager of TriQuint's follow-on equity offering in
1999. In February 2000, SG Cowen acted as joint-lead manager of TriQuint's $345 million convertible subordinated notes offering. 

    TriQuint
agreed to pay SG Cowen a fairness opinion fee; a portion of which fee was payable on delivery of the SG Cowen opinion and the remainder of such fee upon consummation of the
merger. Additionally, TriQuint agreed to reimburse SG Cowen for its out-of-pocket expenses, including attorneys' fees, and agreed to indemnify SG Cowen against liabilities,
including liabilities under the federal securities laws. The terms of the fee arrangement with SG Cowen, which are customary in transactions of this nature, were negotiated at arm's length between
TriQuint and SG Cowen, and the TriQuint board was aware of the arrangement, including the fact that a significant portion of the fee payable to SG Cowen would be contingent upon the completion of the
transaction. 

Interests of Sawtek directors and officers in the merger  

    When considering the recommendation of Sawtek's board of directors, you should be aware that the Sawtek directors and executive officers identified below have
interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, yours. The Sawtek board of directors was aware of these potential conflicts and considered them in making their recommendation. 

 Kimon Anemogiannis and Raymond A. Link  

    TriQuint has entered into employment agreements with Kimon Anemogiannis and Raymond A. Link, which will go into effect on the effective date of the
merger. Dr. Anemogiannis will be entitled to a
base salary of $225,000 per year and Mr. Link will be entitled to a base salary of $185,000. Dr. Anemogiannis and Mr. Link will each hold the Sawtek position assigned to him by
the chairman of the board of TriQuint. The employment agreements provide for at-will employment. However, if Dr. Anemogiannis or Mr. Link is terminated by TriQuint without
cause prior to June 30, 2002, Dr. Anemogiannis or Mr. Link, as the case may be, will be entitled to recover damages consisting of his base salary and benefits under any Sawtek
retirement plans for the period beginning with the date of the termination and ending on June 30, 2002, less withholding for applicable taxes. Dr. Anemogiannis or Mr. Link would
also be reimbursed for any COBRA premiums paid by him after he has elected COBRA coverage under any applicable welfare benefit plans for the period beginning with the date of termination and ending on
June 30, 2002. 

    Mr.
Link and TriQuint are in negotiations regarding the terms of Mr. Link's employment as chief financial officer of TriQuint following the closing of the merger which will be in
addition to those terms set forth above, but have not reached a definitive agreement with regard to the terms of such employment as chief financial officer. However, Mr. Link and TriQuint anticipate
that the additional terms of Mr. Link's employment as chief financial officer of TriQuint will include the following: salary adjustment to reflect the cost of living differential between Orlando and
Portland, payment of relocation and disruption allowance and the grant of a stock option in accordance with TriQuint's policy. 

 Director and Officer Indemnification  

    In addition, Sawtek's directors and officers will receive, for a period of six years after the completion of the merger, directors and officers insurance
coverage with terms substantially the same as those of Sawtek's existing directors and officers insurance policy for events occurring on or prior to the completion of the merger through one of the
following mechanisms: 


a
directors and officers insurance policy whose annual premium is not greater than 200% of the premium of Sawtek's policy in effect on the date of the
merger agreement; or 


obtaining
six-year "tail" coverage under Sawtek's existing directors and officers insurance policy. 

 Sawtek nominated directors  

    In addition, two Sawtek directors selected by Sawtek, initially Steven P. Miller and Willis C. Young, will become members of TriQuint's board of directors when
the merger is completed. TriQuint has also agreed to place Messrs. Miller's and Young's names on its slate of nominees for the TriQuint board of directors at the next two annual meetings of the
TriQuint stockholders, provided that such Sawtek director remains able and willing to serve on the TriQuint board. 

 Sawtek Employee Stock Ownership Plan and 401(k) Plan  

    Sawtek has provided its employees and officers benefits under the Sawtek Inc. Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plan and Trust, which we call the
Sawtek KSOP. The Sawtek KSOP allocates shares of Sawtek common stock to employees and officers of Sawtek over time. TriQuint has agreed to continue the Sawtek KSOP and the distribution of any
unallocated shares of TriQuint common stock held in the Sawtek KSOP after the merger in accordance with the Sawtek KSOP's prior distribution schedules. 

Assumption of Sawtek Stock Options  

    In connection with the merger, TriQuint will assume any outstanding options to purchase Sawtek common stock and those options will be converted to options to
purchase TriQuint common stock. As of June 8, 2001, the directors and officers of Sawtek held options to purchase      shares of Sawtek common stock. The remaining options held by
the officers and directors of TriQuint will continue to vest on their original schedules. 

 Sawtek Health and Welfare Plans  

    Each person who was an employee of Sawtek immediately prior to the closing of the merger will receive, for the purpose of any service requirements for
participation eligibility, or vesting, credit for his or her period of continuous service with Sawtek prior to the merger. No Sawtek employee, or any of his or her eligible dependents, who, at the
closing of the merger, is participating in a Sawtek group health plan shall be excluded from TriQuint's group plan, or limited in coverage thereunder, by reason of any waiting period restriction or
pre-existing condition limitation. Each Sawtek employee will also receive credit for any deductibles that such individual has paid or has been charged with under any Sawtek group health
plan during the calendar year in effect. 

Exchange of Sawtek stock certificates for TriQuint stock certificates  

    When the merger is completed, the exchange agent will mail to Sawtek shareholders a letter of transmittal and instructions for surrendering your Sawtek stock
certificates in exchange for TriQuint stock certificates. When you deliver your Sawtek stock certificates to the exchange agent along with an executed letter of transmittal and any other required
documents, your Sawtek stock certificates will be canceled and you will receive TriQuint stock certificates representing the number of full shares of TriQuint common stock to which you are entitled
under the merger agreement. You will not receive any fractional shares of TriQuint common stock in the merger, but will instead receive cash equal to your proportionate interest of the aggregate
fractional shares. In this case, the market value of the fractional shares will be based on the average closing price of TriQuint common stock for the two trading days ending on the trading day
immediately prior to the closing of the merger. 

You should not submit your Sawtek stock certificates for exchange until you receive your instructions and a form of letter of transmittal from the exchange agent.  

    You are not entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on TriQuint common stock until the merger is completed and you have surrendered your
Sawtek stock certificates in exchange for TriQuint stock certificates. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, you will receive payment for any dividend or other distribution on TriQuint common
stock with a record date after the merger and a payment date prior to the date you surrender your Sawtek stock certificates promptly after your TriQuint stock certificates are issued. You will receive
payment for any dividend or other distribution on TriQuint common stock with a record date after the merger and a payment date after the date you surrender your Sawtek stock certificates promptly
after the payment date. 

    TriQuint
will only issue you a TriQuint stock certificate or a check in lieu of a fractional share in a name other than the name in which a surrendered Sawtek stock certificate is
registered if you present the exchange agent with all documents required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership and show that you paid any applicable stock transfer taxes. If your
Sawtek stock certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, you may need to deliver an affidavit and bond prior to receiving your TriQuint stock certificate. 

Material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger  

    It is the opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, TriQuint's tax counsel, and Gray, Harris & Robinson, P.A.,
Sawtek's tax counsel, that the following generally will be the material federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders of Sawtek common stock: 

    (a) The
merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

    (b) No
gain or loss will be recognized by the holders of Sawtek common stock upon their receipt of TriQuint common stock in exchange for Sawtek common stock in the
merger. 

    (c) A
holder of Sawtek common stock who receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of TriQuint common stock will be treated as if he had received the fractional share
and then had that share redeemed for cash. The holder will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the cash received and that portion of his basis in the TriQuint common stock
attributable to the fractional share. 

    (d) The
aggregate tax basis of the TriQuint common stock received by each holder of Sawtek common stock in the merger (including any fractional share that the holder
will be treated as having received and then had immediately redeemed for cash) will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the Sawtek common stock surrendered in the exchange. 

    (e) The
holding period of the TriQuint common stock received by each holder of Sawtek common stock in the merger will include the period during which the holder held
his Sawtek common stock. 

    (f)  TriQuint,
Sawtek and Timber Acquisition Corp. will not recognize gain or loss as a result of the merger. 

    If
the merger does not qualify as a reorganization, each holder of Sawtek common stock would recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the
value of the TriQuint common stock received by the holder plus the amount of any cash received by the holder in lieu of a fractional share of TriQuint common stock, and (ii) the holder's tax
basis in his Sawtek common stock. In that case, the holder's tax basis in the TriQuint common stock received in the merger would equal the fair market value of that stock, and the holder's holding
period for income tax purposes for the stock would begin on the day following the merger. 

    The preceding discussion is based on existing authorities. These authorities may change, or the Internal Revenue Service might interpret the existing authorities differently. In
either case, the tax consequences of the merger to the holders of Sawtek common stock could differ from those described above. The preceding discussion is for general information only and does not
provide a complete analysis of all potential tax considerations that may be relevant to particular shareholders because of their specific circumstances, or because they are subject to special rules.
The discussion assumes that Sawtek shareholders hold their shares of common stock for investment. 

    This
discussion does not address any consequences arising under the laws of any state, locality or foreign jurisdiction. This discussion also does not address the tax consequences of
an exchange or conversion of options or warrants for Sawtek common stock into options or warrants for TriQuint common stock. 

Holders of Sawtek common stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to their particular
situations and the consequences of foreign, state, or local laws, and tax treaties.

Accounting treatment of the merger  

    TriQuint intends to account for the merger as a pooling of interests transaction. Completion of the merger is conditioned upon its being accounted for on a
pooling of interests accounting basis and the receipt by TriQuint and Sawtek of letters from KPMG LLP and Ernst & Young LLP regarding those firms' concurrence with the TriQuint management's and
the Sawtek management's conclusions, respectively, that, as of the date the merger is completed, no conditions exist that would preclude accounting for the merger as a pooling of interests transaction
under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16 and applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations, if the merger is completed in accordance with the merger agreement.
Under this accounting treatment, upon completion of the merger, the assets and liabilities of Sawtek would be added to those of TriQuint at their recorded book values and the shareholders' equity
accounts of TriQuint and Sawtek would be combined on TriQuint's consolidated balance sheet. On a pooling of interests accounting basis, TriQuint will retroactively restate its financial statements
issued after completion of the merger to reflect the consolidated combined financial position and results of operations of TriQuint and Sawtek as if the merger had taken place as of the earliest
period covered by such financial statements. 

Regulatory filings and approvals required to complete the merger  

    This merger is subject to review by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to determine whether it is in compliance with applicable
antitrust laws. Under the provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the merger may not be consummated until the specified waiting period
requirements of that Act have been satisfied. On May 30, 2001, TriQuint and Sawtek filed notification reports, together with requests for early termination of the waiting period, with the
Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. The merger may also be subject to various foreign
antitrust laws, some of which may require TriQuint and Sawtek to make filings with foreign antitrust authorities. TriQuint and Sawtek intend to make filings with any foreign antitrust authorities, if
required, and will not be permitted to complete the merger until any applicable waiting periods have expired or been terminated. 

    In
addition, the completion of this merger is subject to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part, compliance with the
rules of the Nasdaq National Market and compliance with applicable corporate laws of the States of Florida and Delaware. 

Certain securities laws considerations  

    The shares of TriQuint common stock to be issued in the merger will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These shares will be freely
transferable under the Securities Act, except for TriQuint common stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an affiliate of Sawtek. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals
or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with Sawtek and may include Sawtek's officers and directors, as well as its principal shareholders. Sawtek's affiliates may not
sell their TriQuint common stock acquired in the merger except pursuant to: 


an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of those shares;


an
exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act; or


any
other applicable exemption under the Securities Act. 

No appraisal rights  

    Under Florida corporate law, holders of Sawtek common stock are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger because, on the record date,
Sawtek common stock was designated and quoted for trading on the Nasdaq National Market. Under Delaware corporate law, holders of TriQuint common stock are not entitled to appraisal rights in
connection with the issuance of TriQuint shares to former Sawtek shareholders in connection with the merger. 

Listing on the Nasdaq National Market of TriQuint common stock to be issued in the merger  

    TriQuint has agreed to cause the shares of TriQuint common stock to be issued and to be reserved for issuance in connection with the merger to be approved for
listing on the Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of issuance. 

Delisting and deregistration of Sawtek common stock after the merger  

    If the merger is completed, Sawtek's common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended. 

THE MERGER AGREEMENT    

This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the merger agreement. While TriQuint and Sawtek believe that the
description covers the material terms of the merger agreement, this summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you. The merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex A, and TriQuint and Sawtek urge you to read it carefully.

General  

    Following the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger by Sawtek shareholders and the approval of the share issuance by the TriQuint
stockholders, and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to the merger, Timber Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of TriQuint, will merge with and into Sawtek. Sawtek will
survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of TriQuint. If all conditions to the merger are satisfied or waived, the merger will become effective at the time of the filing of articles of merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida. 

The exchange ratio and treatment of Sawtek common stock  

    At the effective time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of Sawtek common stock will be converted into the right to receive 1.1507 shares of
TriQuint common stock. However, any shares owned by Sawtek, TriQuint or any of their direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries will be cancelled without conversion. TriQuint will adjust the
exchange ratio to reflect any reclassification, stock split, stock dividend, reorganization or other similar change with respect to TriQuint common stock or Sawtek common stock occurring before the
effective time of the merger. 

    Based
on the exchange ratio of 1.1507, and based on the number of shares of Sawtek common stock and options to purchase Sawtek common stock outstanding as of May 25, 2001, a
total of approximately 44,777,000 shares of TriQuint common stock and options to purchase TriQuint common stock will be issued or granted in the merger. 

Treatment of restricted stock of Sawtek  

    Any shares of Sawtek capital stock outstanding at the effective time of the merger which are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition under any restricted stock purchase agreement or other arrangements will be converted into unvested shares of TriQuint common stock based on the exchange ratio and will remain subject to the
same terms, restrictions and vesting schedules as were applicable prior to the effective time of the merger. TriQuint will assume any rights Sawtek held prior to the effective time of the merger to
repurchase these unvested shares. 

Treatment of Sawtek stock options  

    At the effective time of the merger, TriQuint will assume all outstanding options, whether vested or unvested, to purchase shares of Sawtek common stock and
convert them into options to purchase TriQuint common stock subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable prior to the effective time of the merger, including, without limitation, any
repurchase rights or vesting provisions. The number of shares of TriQuint common stock issuable upon the exercise of these stock options will be adjusted based on the exchange ratio. Any fractional
share of TriQuint common stock resulting from such adjustment will be rounded down to the nearest whole number. The exercise price per share of TriQuint common stock issuable under each assumed Sawtek
option will equal the exercise price per share of the Sawtek common stock purchasable under the Sawtek option divided by the exchange ratio. The exercise price will be rounded up to the nearest whole
cent. 

    TriQuint will reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of its common stock for delivery upon a Sawtek optionholder's exercise of his or her option. TriQuint has agreed that
within 10 business days of the closing of the merger, TriQuint will file a registration statement on Form S-8 for the shares of TriQuint common stock issuable with respect to
assumed Sawtek stock options. 

Exchange of certificates  

    Exchange Agent; Exchange Procedures; No Further Ownership Rights.
  After the effective time of the merger, TriQuint's
exchange agent will mail a letter of transmittal and instructions for surrendering Sawtek certificates to each record holder of Sawtek common stock. Only those holders who properly surrender their
certificates in accordance with the instructions will receive certificates representing TriQuint common stock, cash in lieu of any fractional TriQuint common stock and any dividends or
distributions to which they are entitled. The surrendered certificates representing shares of Sawtek common stock will be cancelled. After the effective time of the merger, each certificate
representing shares of Sawtek common stock that have not been surrendered will only represent: 


the
number of whole shares of common stock of TriQuint into which such shares have been converted;


the
right to receive cash in lieu of any fractional share of TriQuint common stock; and


any
dividends or distributions that may be applicable. 

Following
the closing of the merger, Sawtek will not register any transfers of Sawtek common stock on its stock transfer books. 

    No Fractional Shares.
  TriQuint will not issue any fractional shares of common stock in the merger. Instead, each holder
of shares of Sawtek common stock exchanged in the merger who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of common stock of TriQuint will receive cash, without interest, equal to such
fraction multiplied by the average closing price per share of TriQuint common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the two trading days immediately preceding the last full trading day prior to the
closing of the merger. 

    Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares.
  After the effective date of the merger, no dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the closing of the merger with respect to TriQuint common stock will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Sawtek certificate until the holder surrenders his
or her Sawtek certificate in accordance with the letter of transmittal. 

    Lost Certificates.
  If any Sawtek common stock certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, a Sawtek shareholder must
provide an appropriate affidavit certifying that fact to TriQuint's exchange agent. TriQuint or its exchange agent may require a Sawtek shareholder to deliver a bond as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against TriQuint or its exchange agent with respect to any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate. 

Holders of Sawtek common stock should not send in their certificates until they receive a letter of transmittal from the exchange
agent.

which could be expected to impact treatment of the merger as a "reorganization" under the Internal Revenue Code; and 


engaging
in actions with the intent to adversely impact the merger. 

    TriQuint
agreed that until the earlier of the completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement or unless Sawtek consents in writing, TriQuint will conduct its business
in compliance with certain specific restrictions relating to the following: 


actions
which could be expected to impact treatment of the merger as a "reorganization" under the Internal Revenue Code;


the
issuance of dividends or other distributions;


purchase,
acquisition or redemption of its capital stock;


amendment
of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws except as contemplated by the merger agreement;


revaluation
of assets or changing of accounting policies and procedures; and


the
(1) acquisition or agreement to acquire any other business or company if the consideration paid or payable is in excess of $1.45 billion
or (2) sale or agreement to sell TriQuint or substantially all of its assets; except that TriQuint may agree to its acquisition or the sale of substantially all of its assets if its
stockholders will own more than 65% of the voting shares of the acquiring company. 

    The
agreements related to the conduct of Sawtek's and TriQuint's businesses in the merger agreement are complicated and not easily summarized. You are urged to carefully read the
sections of the merger agreement entitled "Conduct of Business by Company," relating to Sawtek and "Conduct of Business By Parent," relating to TriQuint. 

No solicitation by Sawtek  

    Sawtek further agreed to cease, as of the date of the merger agreement, any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
prior to that date with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. 

    An
"Acquisition Proposal" is any inquiry, offer or proposal relating to any Acquisition Transaction, other than an offer or proposal by TriQuint. 

    An
"Acquisition Transaction" is any transaction or series of related transactions, other than the TriQuint/Sawtek merger, involving any of the following: 


the
acquisition or purchase from Sawtek of more than a 10% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of Sawtek or any of its subsidiaries;


any
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or group beneficially owning 10% or more of the total outstanding voting
securities of Sawtek or any of its subsidiaries;


any
merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving Sawtek pursuant to which the Sawtek shareholders immediately preceding
such transaction hold less than 90% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity;


any
sale, lease outside the ordinary course of business, exchange, transfer, license outside the ordinary course of business, acquisition or disposition of
more than 50% of the assets of Sawtek; or


any
liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other significant reorganization of Sawtek. 

    Until
the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, Sawtek and its subsidiaries agreed not to directly or indirectly take any of the following actions: 


solicit,
initiate or induce the making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal;


participate
in any discussions or negotiations with a third party regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal;


take
any other action to knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal;


subject
to limited exceptions, approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or


enter
into any letter of intent or other agreement or contract relating to any Acquisition Transaction. 

    Sawtek's
board of directors may, without breaching the merger agreement, respond to an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by discussing the proposal with the party
making the proposal, furnishing information to the party making the proposal, recommending a Superior Offer (as defined below) to Sawtek shareholders or withdrawing its recommendation of the merger
agreement with TriQuint, if all of the following conditions are met: 


Sawtek
and its subsidiaries have not violated the restrictions set forth above regarding Acquisition Proposals and Acquisition Transactions;


Sawtek's
board determines in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal counsel, that its fiduciary obligations require it to do so;


Sawtek
receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement;


Sawtek
gives prior written notice to TriQuint of discussions or negotiations with, or furnishing of information to, the party making the proposal; and


when
furnishing nonpublic information to the party making the proposal, Sawtek contemporaneously furnishes the same information to TriQuint, to the extent
it has not already been received by TriQuint, or complies with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act, if applicable. 

    For
purposes of the foregoing, any action by any affiliate, officer, director or employee of Sawtek or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of Sawtek is
deemed to be an action by Sawtek. 

    A
"Superior Offer" is an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by a third party to consummate any of: 


a
sale or other disposition by Sawtek of all or substantially all of its assets; or


the
acquisition by any person or group, including by way of tender or exchange offer or issuance by Sawtek, directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership
or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares representing a majority of the then outstanding voting power of Sawtek. 

    In
addition, to qualify as a Superior Offer, Sawtek's board of directors must determine in its good faith (based upon the advice of JP Morgan H&Q) (i) that the acquiring party
is capable of consummating (including, if relevant, the commitment for any necessary financing) and (ii) that is more favorable to Sawtek shareholders than the merger with TriQuint. If the
third party offer includes a due diligence condition, that condition would not alone preclude such offer from being a Superior Offer. 

    Sawtek
has agreed to promptly inform TriQuint of any request for information that Sawtek reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or of any Acquisition Proposal, or
any 

inquiry with respect to or which Sawtek reasonably believes would lead to any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the identity
of the person or group making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Sawtek further agreed to keep TriQuint informed in all material respects of the status and details, including material
amendments or proposed amendments, of any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and to provide TriQuint with advance notice of any meeting of the Sawtek board of directors at which the board
of directors is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal or recommend a Superior Offer to Sawtek shareholders. 

Sawtek shareholders' meeting  

    Sawtek is obligated under the merger agreement to hold and convene the Sawtek special meeting of shareholders for purposes of voting for adoption of the merger
agreement and approval of the merger. Unless Sawtek's board of directors withdraws its recommendations and recommends a Superior Offer, Sawtek's board of directors will recommend that Sawtek
shareholders vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. 

TriQuint stockholders' meeting  

    TriQuint is obligated under the merger agreement to hold and convene the TriQuint special meeting of stockholders for purposes of voting for the issuance of
shares of TriQuint common stock in the merger. TriQuint's board of directors will recommend that TriQuint's stockholders vote in favor of the issuance of TriQuint's shares in connection with the
merger. 

Employee benefits matters  

    Individuals who continue to be employed by Sawtek after the merger is completed who become participants or are subject to TriQuint's employee benefit plans
will, subject to certain qualifications, receive benefits that are in the aggregate, substantially similar to those applicable to employees of Parent in similar functions and positions on similar
terms. 

    Each
person who was an employee of Sawtek immediately prior to the closing of the merger will receive, for the purpose of any service requirements for participation eligibility, or
vesting, for his or her period of continuous service with Sawtek prior to the merger to the extent permitted by TriQuint's benefit programs and consistent with TriQuint's employee benefit plans. No
Sawtek employee, or any of his or her eligible dependents, who, when the merger closes, are participating in a Sawtek group health plan shall be excluded from TriQuint's group plan, or limited in
coverage thereunder, by reason of any waiting period restriction or pre-existing condition limitation. Each Sawtek employee will also receive credit for any deductibles that such
individual has paid or has been charged with under any Sawtek group health plan during the calendar year in effect. 

Sawtek Inc. Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plan and Trust  

    In 2000, Sawtek entered into a 2000 Implementation Agreement, 2000 Modified ESOP Loan Agreement, and 2000 Renewal ESOP Note with HSBC Bank U.S.A., as trustee
of the Sawtek Inc. Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plan and Trust, which we call the Sawtek KSOP. TriQuint has
agreed to assume Sawtek's obligations under the foregoing agreements and not to take any action, fail to take any action or fail to make any contribution, as may be required by the agreements. 

    Subsequent
to the closing of the merger, TriQuint will have the right to terminate the Sawtek KSOP, provided that upon such termination all remaining shares of TriQuint common stock
then held in the Sawtek KSOP's "suspense account" pending release and allocation, shall be released from suspense and allocated to the employees of Sawtek and TriQuint who are then active participants
in the Sawtek KSOP immediately prior to such termination. 

    Subsequent to the merger, the TriQuint common stock remaining in the suspense account of the Sawtek KSOP will be allocated in accordance with Section 5 of the 2000
Implementation Agreement, as adjusted to reflect the share exchange resulting from the merger, unless an earlier allocation is required upon termination of the Sawtek KSOP or by law. However, except
to the extent required by law, or as a result of a stock dividend, stock split or some other form of recapitalization, TriQuint is not obligated to contribute any additional shares of TriQuint common
stock to the Sawtek KSOP. 

    TriQuint
has agreed that employees of Sawtek, TriQuint or any of their affiliates, who were employees of Sawtek immediately prior to the merger, shall continue to participate in the
Sawtek KSOP after the merger, regardless of whether the employee then works for Sawtek, TriQuint or any of their affiliates. TriQuint and Sawtek have agreed that the Sawtek KSOP is intended to
continue to benefit those individuals (and true, new hires of the Sawtek business unit) who benefited immediately prior to the merger. Persons who were employees of TriQuint prior to the merger will
not be eligible generally to participate in the Sawtek KSOP. 

    TriQuint
and Sawtek have also agreed that except for the elimination of the single life annuity and/or joint and survivor annuity forms of distribution currently in the Sawtek KSOP,
neither TriQuint nor Sawtek will eliminate or amend any form of distribution (including without limitation, the normal retirement distribution, in-service distribution, loan and hardship
distribution provisions of the Sawtek KSOP) or vesting provision, except to accelerate the vesting schedule, reduce the waiting period for a distribution to commence, or expand or liberalize the
distribution options available under the Sawtek KSOP. TriQuint has also agreed that for a minimum period of five years after the merger, the "Administrator" and "Investment Advisory Committee" of the
Sawtek KSOP will be committees comprised of a majority of members who then are active participants or former participants in the Sawtek KSOP. TriQuint has also agreed to indemnify any officers or
employees of Sawtek and TriQuint for actions taken as Administrator or members of the Investment Advisory Committee of the Sawtek KSOP. 

Exchange of Sawtek Common Stock Exempt from Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act  

    TriQuint has agreed that it will cause its board of directors to adopt resolutions consistent with the interpretive guidance of the Securities and Exchange
Commission so that the assumption of Sawtek stock options and exchange of Sawtek common stock by TriQuint is an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act.
TriQuint has agreed to take such actions for any officer or director of Sawtek who would become subject to Section 16 by result of his or her relationship with TriQuint after the merger.

a
change in the trading price of TriQuint's or Sawtek's common stock, as the case may be, in and of itself;

such entity); or

Termination of the merger agreement  

    The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to completion of the merger, whether before or after adoption of the merger agreement and approval of
the merger by the Sawtek shareholders and the TriQuint stockholders:

mutual written consent of the board of directors of TriQuint and Sawtek;


by
TriQuint or Sawtek, if the merger is not completed before November 30, 2001, except that this right to terminate the merger agreement is not
available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on or before November 30, 2001 and this action or failure
to act constitutes a material breach of the merger agreement or a material acquisition or proposed acquisition by TriQuint;


by
TriQuint or Sawtek, if there is any final and nonappealable action of a court or governmental authority having jurisdiction over either TriQuint or
Sawtek permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the completion of the merger;

relating to the acquisition by or of TriQuint;

Payment of termination fee by Sawtek  

    Sawtek will pay TriQuint a termination fee of $39.2 million if any of the following conditions occur: 


TriQuint

an
Acquisition Proposal is announced or becomes publicly known; or


the

there
shall exist or have been an Acquisition Proposal that has not been revoked or withdrawn and the merger agreement is terminated because:

the
merger agreement is terminated because Sawtek shareholders do not approve the merger agreement and Sawtek enters into an Acquisition Transaction within
12 months of such termination. 

    Sawtek
will also reimburse TriQuint for its expenses in the event TriQuint terminates the merger agreement because Sawtek violates its representations, warranties or covenants as set
forth above. 

    Sawtek
will pay TriQuint a $1.5 million fee if the merger agreement is terminated because the Sawtek shareholders do not approve the merger and the merger agreement, as long as
the TriQuint stockholders vote in favor of the share issuance. If Sawtek is required to pay both the $39.2 million fee and the $1.5 million fee, payment of the $1.5 million fee
will be credited against the $39.2 million fee. 

    TriQuint
will pay Sawtek a $1.5 million fee if the merger agreement is terminated because the TriQuint stockholders do not approve the share issuance, as long as the Sawtek
shareholders have approved the merger or the merger agreement. 

Operations after the merger  

    Following the merger, it is expected that Sawtek will continue its operations as a wholly owned subsidiary of TriQuint. The shareholders of Sawtek will become
stockholders of TriQuint, and their rights as stockholders will be governed by the TriQuint certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as currently in effect, and the laws of Delaware. See "Comparison
of Rights of Holders of Sawtek Common Stock and TriQuint Common Stock" on page 111 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

Extension, waiver and amendment of the merger agreement  

    TriQuint and Sawtek may amend the merger agreement before completion of the merger by mutual written consent. In addition, either TriQuint or Sawtek may extend
the other's time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts under the merger agreement, waive any inaccuracies in the other's representations and warranties and waive compliance by
the other with any of the agreements or conditions contained in the merger agreement. 

AGREEMENTS RELATED TO THE MERGER    

This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes agreements related to the merger agreement, including the TriQuint
Voting Agreements, the Sawtek Voting Agreements, the Sawtek Affiliate Agreements, the Option Agreement and the Employment Agreements. While TriQuint and Sawtek believe that these descriptions cover

joint proxy statement/prospectus.

TriQuint Voting Agreements  

    By entering into the voting agreements, the TriQuint officers and directors have irrevocably appointed Sawtek as their lawful attorney and proxy. These proxies

    Each
TriQuint stockholder who is a party to a voting agreement agreed not to sell or otherwise transfer the TriQuint stock and options owned, controlled or acquired, either directly

    Under
the affiliate agreements, these Sawtek officers and directors also acknowledged the resale restrictions imposed by Rule 145 and, to the extent applicable, Rule 144
under the Securities Act on shares of TriQuint common stock to be received by them in the merger. In accordance with the affiliate agreements, TriQuint will be entitled to place appropriate legends on
these Sawtek shareholders' certificates evidencing any TriQuint common stock to be received by them and to issue stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for the TriQuint common stock held by

will each hold the Sawtek position assigned to him by the chairman of the board of TriQuint. The employment agreements provide for at-will employment. However, if Dr. Anemogiannis
or Mr. Link is terminated by TriQuint without cause prior to June 30, 2002, Dr. Anemogiannis or Mr. Link, as the case may be, will be entitled to recover damages consisting
of his base salary and benefits under any Sawtek retirement plans for the period beginning with the date of the termination and ending on June 30, 2002, less withholding for applicable taxes. 

Dr. Anemogiannis or Mr. Link would also be reimbursed for any COBRA premiums paid by him after he has elected COBRA coverage under any applicable welfare benefit plans for the period
beginning with the date of termination and ending on June 30, 2002. 

    Mr.
Link and TriQuint are in negotiations regarding the terms of Mr. Link's employment as chief financial officer of TriQuint following the closing of the merger which will be in
addition to those terms set forth above, but have not reached a definitive agreement with regard to the terms of such employment as chief financial officer. However, Mr. Link and TriQuint anticipate
that the additional terms of Mr. Link's employment as chief financial officer of TriQuint will include the following: salary adjustment to reflect the cost of living differential between Orlando and
Portland, payment of relocation and disruption allowance and the grant of a stock option in accordance with TriQuint's policy. 

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

    The following unaudited pro forma combined financial statements give effect to the proposed merger of TriQuint and Sawtek on a pooling of interests basis. The
unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are based on the respective historical consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes of TriQuint and Sawtek, which are incorporated by
reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet assumes the merger took place on March 31, 2001 and combines TriQuint's March 31, 2001
unaudited consolidated balance sheet with Sawtek's March 31, 2001 unaudited consolidated balance sheet. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations assumes that the merger took
place as of the beginning of the periods presented. TriQuint's unaudited consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2001 has been combined with Sawtek's unaudited
consolidated statement of income for the three months ended March 31, 2001. TriQuint's audited statement of operations for December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 has been combined with
Sawtek's audited statement of income for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations for the annual periods
do not present like periods. The use of different closing dates is necessary as each entity has different fiscal year ends. The pro forma reporting with respect to combining TriQuint and Sawtek's
results with different fiscal year ends that are within 93 days and is in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission guidance. The periods combined for purposes of presenting the
unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations are not necessarily indicative of the periods expected to be combined after the date of the closing of the merger. The unaudited pro forma
combined financial statements are based on the estimates and assumptions set forth in the notes to these statements. The pro forma adjustments made in connection with the development of the pro forma
information are preliminary and have been made solely for purposes of developing such pro forma information for illustrative purposes necessary to comply with the disclosure requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations for future periods or the combined financial
position or the results that actually would have been realized had the entities been a single entity during these periods. TriQuint and Sawtek estimate that they will incur direct transaction costs of
approximately $7 million associated with the merger, which are expected to be charged to operations by TriQuint in the fiscal quarter in which the merger is consummated. There can be no
assurance that TriQuint will not incur additional charges in subsequent quarters reflecting costs associated with the merger. 

    These
unaudited pro forma combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto of TriQuint
and Sawtek which are incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Basis of Presentation    

    The pro forma financial statements give effect to TriQuint's acquisition of Sawtek through a merger and exchange of shares. The merger is being accounted for
using the pooling of interests method of accounting. The pro forma financial statements have been prepared on the basis of assumptions described in the following notes. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments necessary to present fairly such pro forma financial statements have been made based on the proposed terms and structure of the Sawtek merger. 

Note 1. Periods Combined  

    The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2001 reflects the financial position of TriQuint after giving effect to the
merger with Sawtek as if this merger occurred on March 31, 2001. 

    TriQuint's
unaudited consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2001 has been combined with Sawtek's unaudited consolidated statement of
operations for the three months ended March 31, 2001. TriQuint's consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 have been combined with
Sawtek's consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The use of different closing dates is necessary as the entities have
different year ends. The pro forma reporting with respect to combining TriQuint's and Sawtek's results with different fiscal year ends that are within 93 days is in accordance with Securities
and Exchange Commission guidance. 

    The
periods combined for purposes of presenting the unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations are not necessarily indicative of the periods expected to be combined after
the date of the closing of the merger. 

Note 2. Merger Costs  

    TriQuint and Sawtek estimate that they will incur direct transaction costs or merger expenses, of approximately $7 million associated with the merger.
These costs consist of investment banking, legal, accounting, filings with regulatory agencies, financial printing and other related costs. 

    TriQuint
expects the merger expenses to be charged to operations in the fiscal quarter in which the merger is consummated. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet gives effect
to such charges as if they had been incurred as of March 31, 2001, but the effects of these costs have not been reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations as they
are nonrecurring in nature. TriQuint expects that substantially all of these merger expenses will be paid out of existing cash reserves within twelve months after the consummation of the merger. 

    The
income tax effect of these charges has also been reflected as a pro forma adjustment. A combined pro forma effective tax rate of 31.6% is assumed. 

Note 3. Treasury Stock  

    This adjustment reflects the retirement of Sawtek treasury stock upon consummation of the merger. 

Note 4. Pro Forma Net Income Per Share  

    The unaudited pro forma combined basic and diluted net income per share are based upon the pro forma combined weighted average number of common and common
equivalent shares of TriQuint and Sawtek outstanding for each period at an assumed exchange ratio of 1.1507 shares of TriQuint common stock for each share of Sawtek common stock. The exchange ratio is
calculated based on the 

closing price of TriQuint of $26.30 and Sawtek of $25.06 on May 14, 2001 and the exchange ratio formula contained in the merger agreement. 

Note 5. Common Stock Par Value  

    The adjustment reflects the addition to par value for the additional shares issued as a result of the merger. Pro forma combined common stock par value
reflects total shares outstanding on a pro forma combined basis at TriQuint's per share par value of $0.001. 

Note 6. Adjusted Diluted Shares  

    Shares used in the diluted calculation of unaudited pro forma combined net income per share are adjusted for the effect of the combined net income position.
TriQuint's net loss for the year ended December 31, 1998 resulted in anti-dilutive shares not included in the historical dilutive loss per common share amounts. TriQuint and Sawtek
had a pro forma combined net income for fiscal year 1998, resulting in the 2,702 anti-dilutive shares of TriQuint becoming dilutive. 

DESCRIPTION OF TRIQUINT CAPITAL STOCK    

Authorized Capital Stock  

    TriQuint's authorized capital stock consists of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, $.001 par value, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.001 par value. 

Common Stock  

    Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding preferred stock, holders of TriQuint common stock are entitled to receive ratably such
dividends as may be declared by TriQuint's board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. TriQuint has not paid any cash dividends on its common stock. Each holder of TriQuint common
stock is entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, except that upon giving notice required by law and in TriQuint's bylaws, stockholders
may cumulate their votes in the election of directors. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of TriQuint, holders of TriQuint common stock are entitled to share ratably in all
assets remaining after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any outstanding preferred stock. Holders of TriQuint common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights or other
subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions available to the TriQuint common stock. All outstanding shares of TriQuint common stock are fully paid and nonassessable, and
the shares of common stock to be issued in exchange for the Sawtek common stock upon completion of the merger will be fully paid and nonassessable. 

    Pursuant
to TriQuint's shareholder rights plan, each share of common stock currently outstanding, all shares of common stock to be issued upon conversion of the 4% subordinated
convertible notes due 2007 and all shares of TriQuint common stock issued in connection with the Sawtek merger has received or will receive, as the case may be, one preferred share purchase right per
share of common stock, which until such right becomes exercisable, trades with the shares of TriQuint common stock. 

    At
June 8, 2001,            shares of TriQuint common stock were outstanding. There were  stockholders of record at June 8, 2001. At
June 8, 2001, options to purchase an aggregate of            shares of TriQuint common stock were also outstanding. 

Preferred Stock  

    TriQuint's board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock (less 25,000 shares which have been designated
series A participating preferred stock) in one or more series and to determine the powers, preferences and rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions, any or all of which may be
greater than the rights of TriQuint common stock, granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued shares of undesignated preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the
designation of such series, without any further vote or action by TriQuint stockholders. It is not possible to state the actual effect of the issuance of any shares of preferred stock upon the rights
of holders of TriQuint common stock until the TriQuint board of directors determines the specific rights of the holders of the TriQuint preferred stock. However, these effects might include: 


restricting
dividends on the TriQuint common stock;


diluting
the voting power of the TriQuint common stock;


impairing
the liquidation rights of the TriQuint common stock; and


delaying
or preventing a change in control of TriQuint without further action by the TriQuint stockholders. 

    In
connection with TriQuint's shareholder rights plan, 25,000 shares of such preferred stock have been designated series A participating preferred stock. No shares of the
series A participating preferred stock have been issued or are issuable until the occurrence of certain triggering events. See "Shareholder Rights Plan." The issuance of TriQuint
preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of TriQuint without further action by its stockholders, may adversely affect the voting and other rights of
the holders of TriQuint common stock and may have the effect of decreasing the market price of the common stock. At present, TriQuint has no plans to issue any shares of TriQuint preferred stock. 

Anti-takeover effects of some provisions of Delaware law and TriQuint's charter documents  

    A number of the provisions of Delaware law and TriQuint's certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make the acquisition of TriQuint through a tender
offer, a proxy contest or other means more difficult and could make the removal of incumbent officers and directors more difficult. These provisions include TriQuint's failure to "opt out" of the
protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as described below, as well as TriQuint's reservation of 5,000,000 shares of blank check preferred. TriQuint expects these
provisions to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of TriQuint to first negotiate with the TriQuint board of
directors. TriQuint believes that the benefits provided by its board of directors' ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal outweigh the disadvantages of
discouraging such proposals. TriQuint believes the negotiation of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal could result in an improvement of its terms. 

Delaware Law  

    TriQuint is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a
publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a "business combination" with an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested
stockholder, unless: 


prior
to the date of the transaction, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted
in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;


the
stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of
determining the number of shares outstanding (a) shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers, and (b) shares owned by employee stock plans in which employee participants
do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or


on
or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by the board and authorized at an annual or special meeting of
stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66

/

% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder. 

    Generally,
a "business combination" includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An "interested
stockholder" is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns or, within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, did own 15% or more of a corporation's
outstanding voting securities.
TriQuint expects the existence of this provision to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions its board of directors does not approve in advance. TriQuint also anticipates
that Section 203 may also discourage attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of TriQuint common stock. 

Charter Documents  

    TriQuint's certificate of incorporation provides for cumulative voting for the election of directors. Section 141 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law provides that a director elected by cumulative voting may not be removed without cause if the number of votes cast against removal would be sufficient to elect such director under cumulative
voting. TriQuint's bylaws define "cause" for the purpose of these provisions to mean: 


continued
willful failure to perform the obligations of a director;


gross
negligence by the director;


engaging
in transactions that defraud TriQuint;


fraud
or intentional misrepresentation including falsifying use of funds and intentional misstatements made in financial statements, books, records or
reports to stockholders or governmental agencies;


material
violation of any agreement between the director and TriQuint;


knowingly
causing TriQuint to commit violations of applicable law (including by failure to act);


acts
of moral turpitude; or


conviction
of a felony. 

    TriQuint's
bylaws establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of TriQuint's stockholders, including proposed nominations of
persons for election to the board of directors. At an annual meeting, TriQuint stockholders may only consider proposals or nominations specified in the notice of meeting or brought before the meeting
by or at the direction of the TriQuint board of directors. TriQuint stockholders may also consider a proposal or nomination by a person who was a stockholder of record on the record date for the
meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has given to TriQuint's Secretary timely written notice, in proper form, of his or her intention to bring that business before the meeting. The
bylaws do not give the TriQuint board of directors the power to approve or disapprove stockholder nominations of candidates or proposals regarding other business to be conducted at a special or annual
meeting of the stockholders. However, TriQuint's bylaws may have the effect of precluding the conduct of that item of business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed. These provisions
may also discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of TriQuint. 

    Under
Delaware law, a special meeting of stockholders may be called by the board of directors or by any other person authorized to do so in the certificate of incorporation or the
bylaws. TriQuint's board of directors is the only party authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders. The limitation on the right of TriQuint's stockholders to call a special meeting will make
it more difficult for a stockholder to force stockholder consideration of a proposal over the opposition of the TriQuint board of directors by calling a special meeting of stockholders. The
restriction on the ability of TriQuint stockholders to call a special meeting also will make it more difficult to replace the TriQuint board until the next annual meeting. 

    Although
Delaware law provides that stockholders may execute an action by written consent in lieu of a stockholder meeting, it also allows TriQuint to eliminate stockholder actions by
written consent. Elimination of written consents of stockholders may lengthen the amount of time required to take stockholder actions since actions by written consent are not subject to the minimum
notice requirement of a stockholder's meeting. However, TriQuint believes that the elimination of stockholders' written consents may deter hostile takeover attempts. Without the availability of
stockholder's actions by written consent, a holder controlling a majority of TriQuint's capital stock would not be able to amend 

TriQuint's bylaws or remove directors without holding a stockholders meeting. The holder would have to obtain the consent of the TriQuint board of directors, to call a TriQuint stockholders' meeting
and satisfy the notice periods determined by the TriQuint board of directors. TriQuint's certificate of incorporation eliminates actions by written consent of stockholders. 

Shareholder Rights Plan  

    In June 1998, TriQuint's board of directors adopted the shareholder rights plan (the "rights plan"). Pursuant to the rights plan, TriQuint declared a
dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a "right") for each outstanding share of TriQuint common stock and each share of TriQuint common stock issued thereafter. Initially, each right entitles
the holder thereof to purchase from TriQuint one share of TriQuint common stock at an exercise price of [$400.00], subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and
similar events. The rights are not exercisable until the occurrence of certain triggering events. The rights will become exercisable only if a person or group acquires 15% or more of TriQuint's common
stock or announces a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in their ownership of 15% or more of TriQuint's common stock. 

    Ten
days after an acquisition or offer by a person or group for 15% or more of TriQuint's common stock, each right becomes exercisable at the right's then current exercise price, for
shares of TriQuint common stock (or, in certain circumstances as determined by the TriQuint board of directors, a combination of cash, property, common stock or other securities) having a value of
twice the right's exercise price. Alternatively, if TriQuint is involved in a merger or other business combination transaction with another person ten or more days after such acquisition or offer,
each right becomes exercisable, at the right's then current exercise price, for shares of common stock of such other person having a value of twice the right's exercise price. The rights are
redeemable up to ten days following the announcement of such acquisition or offer, subject to extension by TriQuint's board of directors, at a price of $0.01 per right. The rights plan expires in
June 2008 unless TriQuint redeems the rights earlier. 

    Pursuant
to the rights plan, TriQuint's board of directors designated 25,000 shares of preferred stock series A participating preferred, and reserved those shares for issuance
under the rights plan. The series A participating preferred purchasable upon exercise of the rights will be nonredeemable and junior to any other series of preferred stock TriQuint may issue
(unless otherwise provided in the terms of such stock). Each share of series A participating preferred will have a preferential cumulative quarterly dividend in an amount equal to 1,000 times
the dividend declared on each share of TriQuint common stock and, in the event of liquidation, the holders of series A participating preferred will receive a preferred liquidation payment equal
to $125,000 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends (the "series A liquidation preference"). Following payment of the series A liquidation preference, and after the holders of
shares of TriQuint common stock shall have received an amount per share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the series A liquidation preference by 1,000, the holders of series A
participating preferred and holders of TriQuint common stock shall share ratably and proportionately the remaining assets to be distributed in liquidation. Each share of series A participating
preferred stock will have 1,000 votes, voting together with the shares of TriQuint common stock as a single class. In the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which shares of
common stock are exchanged for or changed into other securities, cash and/or other property, each share of series A participating preferred will be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount
and type of consideration received per share of TriQuint common stock. 

    The
rights plan is intended to protect TriQuint stockholders in the event of an unsolicited offer to acquire, or the acquisition of, 15% or more of the TriQuint common stock. The
rights are not intended
to prevent a takeover of TriQuint and will not interfere with any tender offer or business combination approved by the TriQuint board of directors. The rights encourage persons seeking control of
TriQuint 

to initiate such an acquisition or offer to acquire through arms-length negotiations with the board of directors. 

Indemnification Arrangements  

    TriQuint's certificate of incorporation limits the liability of its directors and executive officers to the maximum extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware
law provides that directors of a corporation will not be personally liable for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for: 


any
breach of their duty of loyalty to TriQuint or its stockholders;


acts
or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;


unlawful
payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or


any
transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. 

    The
limits on a director or officer's liability in TriQuint's certificate of incorporation do not apply to liabilities arising under the federal securities laws and do not affect the
availability of equitable remedies such as injunctive relief or rescission. 

    TriQuint's
certificate of incorporation together with its bylaws provide that TriQuint must indemnify its directors and executive officers and may indemnify its other officers and
employees and other agents to the fullest extent permitted by law. 

    TriQuint
believes that indemnification under TriQuint bylaws covers at least negligence and gross negligence on the part of indemnified parties. TriQuint's bylaws also permit TriQuint
to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director, employee or other agent for any liability arising out of his or her actions in that capacity, regardless of whether TriQuint's bylaws would
otherwise permit indemnification. TriQuint believes that the indemnification provisions of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as
directors and officers. TriQuint also maintains directors' and officers' liability insurance. 

    TriQuint
has entered into agreements to indemnify its directors, executive officers and other employees as determined by the board of directors. These agreements provide for
indemnification for related expenses including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any such person in any action or proceeding. TriQuint believes that these provisions
and agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as its directors and executive officers. 

    At
present TriQuint is not aware of any pending litigation or proceeding involving any director, officer, employee or agent of TriQuint where indemnification will be required or
permitted. Nor is TriQuint aware of any threatened litigation or proceeding that might result in a claim for indemnification. 

Transfer Agent And Registrar  

    ChaseMellon Shareholder Services LLC serves as the transfer agent and registrar for the TriQuint common stock. ChaseMellon's address is 85 Challenger Road,
Ridgefield Park, New Jersey 07660 and its telephone number is 1-800-522-6645. State Street Bank & Trust Company of California, N.A. serves as the transfer
agent and registrar for the TriQuint 4% convertible subordinated notes due 2007. 

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF
  HOLDERS OF SAWTEK COMMON STOCK AND TRIQUINT COMMON STOCK    

Sawtek shareholders will automatically become TriQuint stockholders at the effective time. Your rights as a TriQuint stockholder will
be determined by TriQuint's certificate of incorporation, TriQuint's bylaws and Delaware law. The following is a summary of the material differences in the rights of holders of TriQuint common stock
and Sawtek common stock. This summary is necessarily general and is not a complete discussion of, and is qualified by, the more detailed provisions of Florida law, Delaware law, Sawtek's articles of
incorporation, TriQuint's certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of each corporation.

Authorized Capital  

    TriQuint.
  TriQuint is authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value of $0.001 per share, and
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value of $0.001 per share. As of the TriQuint record date            shares of TriQuint common stock were issued and outstanding and no shares of
TriQuint preferred stock were issued or outstanding. 

    Sawtek.
  Sawtek is authorized to issue 120,000,000 shares of common stock, par value of $0.0005 per share, and 1,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value of $0.01 per share. As of the Sawtek record date,            shares of Sawtek common stock were issued and outstanding and no shares of Sawtek preferred
stock were issued or outstanding. 

Amendment of Charter documents  

    TriQuint.
  Delaware law generally requires that an amendment to a Delaware corporation's certificate of incorporation
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote thereon. Furthermore, under Delaware law, the holders of the outstanding shares of a class are entitled to vote as
a class upon any proposed amendment to the certificate of incorporation, whether or not entitled to vote thereon by the provisions of the corporation's certificate of incorporation, if the
amendment would increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of such class, increase or decrease the par value of the shares of such class, or alter or change the powers, preferences
or specific rights of the shares of such class so as to adversely affect them. TriQuint's certificate of incorporation does not alter these voting requirements of Delaware law. Delaware law permits a
corporation's board of directors to amend its bylaws without further consent by the stockholders if so provided in the company's certificate of incorporation. TriQuint's certificate of incorporation
provides that the board of directors may amend the bylaws without stockholder consent. 

    Sawtek.
  Florida law generally requires most amendments to a Florida corporation's articles of incorporation be adopted
by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereon upon recommendation of the board of directors, subject to amendments in certain minor respects which do not require
stockholder action. Unless Florida law requires a greater vote, amendments may be adopted by a majority of the shares entitled to vote, a quorum being present. Florida law also permits the board of
directors to amend or repeal the bylaws unless otherwise required by Florida law or the shareholders. The shareholders entitled to vote have concurrent power to amend or repeal the bylaws. 

Notice of Meetings of Shareholders  

    TriQuint.
  TriQuint's bylaws provide that TriQuint must notify its stockholders between 10 and 60 days before any
annual or special meeting of the date, time and place of the meeting. In the case of a special meeting, TriQuint must briefly describe the purpose or purposes of the meeting and in the case of an
annual meeting, TriQuint must specify the matters which the board of directors, at the time of giving the notice, intends to present for action by the stockholders. 

    Sawtek.
  Sawtek's bylaws provide that Sawtek must notify its shareholders between 10 and 60 days before any
annual or special meeting of the date, time and place of the meeting. In the case of a special meeting, Sawtek must specify the purpose or purposes of the meeting. 

Special Meetings of Shareholders  

    TriQuint.
  A special meeting of the stockholders of TriQuint may be called at any time solely by its board of directors. 

    Sawtek.
  A special meeting of the shareholders of Sawtek may be called by the board of directors, the chief executive
officer, the secretary, by any officer instructed by the directors of the chief executive officer or by the holders of at least 10% of the shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. 

Election of Directors  

    TriQuint.
  TriQuint's certificate of incorporation provides for cumulative voting in the election of directors. When
voting for the election of directors, holders of TriQuint stock are entitled to as many votes as shall equal the number of votes which such stockholder would be entitled to cast for the election of
directors with respect to his or her shares of stock multiplied by the number of directors to be elected and may cast all such votes for any director or for any two or more of them as such stockholder
may see fit. 

    Sawtek.
  Sawtek's articles of incorporation do not provide for cumulative voting of directors. Each Sawtek shareholder
is entitled to one vote for each share of Sawtek share he or she holds in the election of directors. 

Number of Directors  

    TriQuint.
  The number of directors is fixed at seven under TriQuint's bylaws. The number of directors may be changed by
amendment to the bylaws adopted by the board of directors or stockholders or by an amendment to TriQuint's certificate of incorporation. Directors are elected at each annual meeting of stockholders
and serve until the next annual meeting. 

    Sawtek.
  Sawtek's bylaws provide for a number of directors between five and ten. The number of directors may be
increased or decreased by amendment to the bylaws or by resolution of the board of directors. 

Removal of Directors  

    TriQuint.
  Under Delaware law, any director or the entire board of directors of a Delaware corporation with cumulative
voting may be removed, with cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors; provided, however, that if, and so long as TriQuint stockholders are
entitled to cumulative voting, if less than the entire board is to be removed, no one director may be removed unless the entire board is removed without cause if the votes cast against his removal
would be sufficient to elect him if then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire board of directors. 

    Sawtek.
  Sawtek's bylaws provide that at any shareholder meeting called expressly for such purpose, any or all directors
may be removed from office with or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors. 

Stockholder Proposals; Advance Notice of Director Nominations  

    TriQuint.
  Business conducted at meetings of stockholders is limited to business that is properly submitted to the
meeting under TriQuint's bylaws. Matters are properly submitted by the board of 

directors, or by any other holder of voting securities of the corporation who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice requirements of applicable law, or those requirements
outlined in TriQuint's certificate of incorporation or bylaws. Director nominations may also be made by stockholders. All stockholder proposals must be made in writing and delivered or mailed to the
Secretary of TriQuint at least 120 days before the estimated mailing date of the proxy statement for the next annual meeting. 

    Sawtek.
  The Sawtek bylaws provide that annual meetings will be held each year for the purpose of electing directors and
transacting such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting. Sawtek's articles of incorporation and bylaws do not contain any specific provisions relating to the notice and
procedural requirements for shareholder nominations of candidates for director. Consequently, Sawtek's shareholders are subject to fewer restrictions concerning nomination of candidates for director
than TriQuint stockholders. 

Blank Check Preferred Stock  

    TriQuint.
  TriQuint's certificate of incorporation authorizes its boards of directors to issue shares of preferred stock
in one or more series and to fix the designations, preferences, powers and rights of the shares to be included in each series. TriQuint's certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 25,000 shares have been designated Series A participating preferred stock in connection with its rights plan. 

    Sawtek.
  Sawtek's articles of incorporation authorizes its boards of directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one
or more series and to fix the designations, preferences, powers and rights of the shares to be included in each series. Sawtek's articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock. 

Anti-Takeover Provisions; Restrictions on Certain Business Combinations  

    TriQuint.
  TriQuint is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an
anti-takeover law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a "business combination" with an "interested stockholder" for a period of
three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless: 


prior
to the date of the transaction, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted
in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;


the
stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of
determining the number of shares outstanding (a) shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers, and (b) shares owned by employee stock plans in which employee participants
do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or


on
or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by the board and authorized at an annual or special meeting of
stockholders, and not by written consent, by the
affirmative vote of at least 66

/

% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder. 

    Generally,
a "business combination" includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An "interested
stockholder" is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns or, within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, did own 15% or more of a corporation's
outstanding voting securities. 

TriQuint has determined that the share issuance is not a business transaction within the meaning of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. 

    Sawtek.
  The Florida control-share acquisition statute provides that when a purchaser of shares of a public corporation
crosses one of three voting thresholds with respect to voting power of the corporation (20%, 33% or 50%) such share has the same voting rights as were accorded the shares before the control-share
acquisition only to the extent granted by resolution approved by the shareholders of the public corporation. The resolution must be approved by each class or series entitled to vote separately on the
proposal by a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by the class or series and by each class or series entitled to vote separately on the proposal by a majority of all the votes entitled to be
cast by that group, excluding all interested shares. The board of directors of Sawtek passed a resolution which makes the Florida control-share acquisition Statute inapplicable in the merger. 

Limitation on Director Liability; Indemnification  

    TriQuint.
  Under Delaware law, a corporation may include in its certificate of incorporation a provision which would,
subject to the limitations described below, eliminate or limit directors' liability for monetary damages for breaches of their fiduciary duty of care. Under Delaware law, a director's liability cannot
be eliminated or limited for: 


breaches
of the duty of loyalty;


acts
or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;


the
payment of unlawful dividends or expenditure of funds for unlawful stock purchases or redemptions; or


transactions
from which such director derived an improper personal benefit. 

    TriQuint's
certificate of incorporation limits the liability of directors to the maximum extent permitted by Delaware law. TriQuint's bylaws provide that TriQuint shall indemnify its
directors and permit TriQuint to obtain insurance on behalf of any director for any liability arising out of his or her actions in his or her capacity, regardless of whether the bylaws or Delaware law
would permit indemnification. 

    Sawtek.
  Under Florida law, a director is not personally liable for monetary damages to the corporation or any other
person for any act or omission as a director, unless the director breached or failed to perform his statutory duties as a director and such breach or failure: 


constitutes
a violation of criminal law, unless the director had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was lawful or had no reasonable cause to believe
his conduct was unlawful;


constitutes
a transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit;


results
in an unlawful distribution pursuant to Section 607.0834;


results
in a derivative action or an action by a shareholder, constitutes a conscious disregard for the best interests of the corporation or willful
misconduct; or


results
in a proceeding other than a derivative action or an action by a shareholder, constitutes recklessness or an act or omission which was committed in
bad faith or with a malicious purpose or in a manner exhibiting wanton and willful disregard of human rights, safety or property. 

    Sawtek's
articles of incorporation and bylaws limit director liability to the fullest extent permitted by Florida law. It is mandatory for a Florida corporation to indemnify a
director, officer, employee or agent against expenses actually and reasonably incurred in successfully defending an action, provided 

the person acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation. 

Actions by Written Consent of Stockholders  

    TriQuint.
  Under Delaware law, stockholders may execute an action by written consent in lieu of a meeting of the
stockholders, but only if such written consent is signed by stockholders representing such number of voting shares outstanding as would have been required to approve such action at an actual meeting
of the stockholders. Delaware law permits a corporation to eliminate such actions by written consent in its certificate of incorporation. TriQuint's certificate of incorporation has eliminated
stockholders' right to act by written consent. 

    Sawtek.
  Under Florida law, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, actions which would be required
or permitted to be taken at an annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken by the written consent of the holders of shares constituting not less than the minimum number of shares that would
be necessary to take such action at a meeting of shareholders at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prior notice is not required for such action. Sawtek's articles of
incorporation permit Sawtek's shareholders to take action without a meeting. 

Stockholder Inspection Rights; Stockholder Lists  

    TriQuint.
  Delaware law and TriQuint's bylaws permit any stockholder of record to inspect for any proper purpose
TriQuint's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records. A proper purpose is for a purpose reasonably related to the stockholder's interest as a stockholder. 

    Sawtek.
  Under Florida law, upon written notice of a demand to inspect corporate records, a shareholder is entitled to
inspect corporate books and records. Except for certain categories of records, including the current articles of incorporation and bylaws, list of names and business addresses of current officers and
directors, and minutes of shareholder meetings and communications directed to shareholders generally, the demand must be made in good faith with a proper purpose, and must state with reasonable
particularity the purpose and the records desired to be inspected, and the records must relate directly to the purpose. 

Dissenters' Appraisal Rights  

    TriQuint.
  Generally, stockholders of a Delaware corporation who dissent from a merger or consolidation of the
corporation for which a stockholders' vote is required are entitled to appraisal rights, requiring the surviving corporation to purchase the dissenting shares at fair value. There are, however,
generally no statutory rights of appraisal with respect to stockholders of a Delaware corporation whose shares of stock are either: (a) listed on a national securities exchange or designated as
a national market system security on an interdealer quotation system by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; or (b) held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders where
such stockholders receive only shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from the merger or consolidation (or cash in lieu of fractional interests therein). 

    Sawtek.
  Under Florida law, a shareholder is entitled to dissent and obtain payment of the fair value of his shares in
the event of, among other things, (a) consummation of a plan of merger to which the corporation is a party, if either (i) shareholder approval is required and the shareholder is entitled
to vote on the merger or (ii) the corporation is a subsidiary that is owned 80% by and is merged into its parent; (b) consummation of a plan of share exchange to which the corporation is
a party as the corporation whose shares will be acquired, if the shareholder is entitled to vote on the plan; (c) consummation of a sale or exchange of substantially all of the property of the
corporation other than in the usual and regular course of the business if shareholder approval is required; (d) an 

amendment to the articles of incorporation that materially and adversely affects rights in respect of the dissenter's shares in specified ways; (e) in the event of a control share acquisition;
or (f) any corporate action taken pursuant to a shareholder vote to the extent that the articles of incorporation provide that dissenters' rights shall apply. However, Florida law does not have
appraisal rights for Florida corporations whose voting stock is listed on a national securities exchange or an interdealer quotation system by the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc., or held of record by at least 2,000 shareholders. 

OTHER PROPOSALS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE TRIQUINT SPECIAL MEETING    

Proposal Two
  Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation
  To Increase Authorized Common Stock    

    TriQuint's board of directors has approved an amendment to Article FOURTH of the Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of its common
stock authorized for issuance from 200,000,000 to 600,000,000 shares. Article FOURTH of TriQuint's Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, currently authorizes TriQuint to issue up to 200,000,000
shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 5,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. TriQuint's authorized common stock is all of a single class,
with equal voting, distribution, liquidation, and other rights. As of June 8, 2001,      shares of TriQuint's common stock were issued and outstanding, and no shares of its
authorized preferred stock were outstanding. In addition, options to acquire an additional            shares of TriQuint common stock were issued and outstanding
and      shares
of TriQuint common stock were reserved for future issuance under its stock option and purchase plans. TriQuint had also reserved 5,088,509 shares of its common stock for issuance upon the conversion
of its outstanding 4% subordinated convertible notes due 2007. 

    In
connection with the proposed acquisition of Sawtek, TriQuint expects to issue approximately  million shares of its common stock and assumed options and warrants to
acquire an additional      shares of TriQuint common stock. Although TriQuint has no immediate plans to issue additional shares of its common stock (other than upon exercise of
outstanding options or conversion of the outstanding subordinated convertible notes), TriQuint anticipates that it may issue additional shares in the future in connection with one or more of the
following: 


other
acquisitions,


strategic
investments,


corporate
transactions, such as stock splits or stock dividends,


financing
transactions, such as public offerings of common stock or convertible securities,


TriQuint's
stock incentive plans, and


otherwise
for corporate purposes that have not yet been identified. 

    In
order to provide TriQuint's board of directors with certainty and flexibility to undertake such transactions to support its future business growth, the TriQuint board deems it
appropriate at this time to increase the number of authorized shares of its common stock. As of June 8, 2001, TriQuint has approximately            shares of authorized, but unissued,
common stock, approximately      shares of outstanding common stock,            shares reserved for issuance to holders of stock awards under all of our stock
incentive plans, and
      shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of warrants expected to be assumed in connection with the merger. 

    The
current number of authorized, but unissued, shares is insufficient to permit the TriQuint board of directors flexibility to continue its future growth. For example, the TriQuint
board currently would be unable to declare a two-for-one stock split that, as is typical, is effected in the form of a stock dividend, because Delaware law will not allow the
board to approve a stock dividend unless a sufficient number of authorized shares is available. TriQuint implemented a three for two stock split in July 1999, a two for one stock split in
February 2000 and a two for one stock split in July 2000. Although the TriQuint board is not currently contemplating any stock split or dividend, the increase in the number of TriQuint's
authorized shares of common stock that is the subject of this proposal will provide the board with the ability to timely undertake transactions that will contribute to its future growth. 

    If this proposal is adopted, the additional authorized shares of common stock may be issued upon the approval of the TriQuint board of directors at such times, in such amounts, and
upon such terms as the TriQuint board of directors may determine, without further approval of the stockholders, unless such approval is expressly required by applicable law, regulatory agencies, or
the Nasdaq Stock Market (or any other exchange or quotation service on which TriQuint common stock may then be listed). Furthermore, stockholders will have no preemptive rights to purchase additional
shares. Stockholder approval of this proposal will not, by itself, cause any change in TriQuint's capital accounts. The issuance of additional shares of common stock may, however, dilute existing
stockholders' equity interest. 

Possible Anti-takeover Effects  

    The additional shares of TriQuint common stock that would become available for issuance if this proposal is adopted could also be used by TriQuint to oppose a
hostile takeover attempt or delay or prevent changes in the control or management of TriQuint. For example, without further stockholder approval, the TriQuint board of directors could strategically
sell shares of common stock in a private transaction to purchasers who would oppose a takeover or favor the current board of directors. Although this proposal to increase the authorized common stock
has been prompted by business and financial considerations and not by the threat of any hostile takeover attempt (nor is TriQuint's board currently aware of any such attempts directed at TriQuint),
stockholders should be aware that approval of this proposal could facilitate future efforts by TriQuint's board of directors to deter or prevent changes in control of TriQuint, including transactions
in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices. Some provisions of TriQuint's charter documents already provide
anti-takeover protections to TriQuint by eliminating the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting and specifying procedures for nominating directors and submitting
proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings. See "Description of TriQuint Capital Stock" on page   of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. TriQuint adopted these
anti-takeover provisions in order to increase the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the board of directors and in the policies set by the board, to discourage
certain types of transactions which may involve an actual or threatened change of control, and to reduce the vulnerability of TriQuint to an unsolicited acquisition proposal. These provisions are also
intended to discourage hostile tactics that may be used in proxy fights. The anti-takeover provisions in TriQuint's charter documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals,
could delay or prevent a change in control transaction, and could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for TriQuint's shares. As a result, these provisions may prevent the
market price of TriQuint common stock from reflecting the effects of actual or rumored takeover attempts and could prevent changes in TriQuint's management. 

    TriQuint's
board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of its
preferred stock without any further vote or action by its stockholders. The board of directors has designated 25,000 shares as Series A participating preferred stock in connection with
TriQuint's shareholders rights plan, although none of those shares are issued or outstanding. The issuance of preferred stock allows TriQuint's board of directors to have flexibility in connection
with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes. However, the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by TriQuint's
stockholders. As a result, the market price of TriQuint common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of its common stock may be adversely affected. The issuance of preferred stock may
result in the loss of voting control to others. TriQuint's board of directors has no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock. 

    Furthermore,
TriQuint is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions. Section 203 prohibits Delaware
corporations whose securities are listed 

for trading on the Nasdaq National Market from engaging, under some circumstances, in a "business combination" with any "interested stockholder" for three years following the date that such
stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. A Delaware corporation may "opt out" of the protections of Section 203 with an express provision in its certificate of incorporation. TriQuint has
not "opted out" of the protections of Section 203. 

    The
proposed amendment to TriQuint's Certificate of Incorporation is not being recommended in response to any specific effort of which TriQuint's board of directors is aware to obtain
control of TriQuint, nor is the board of directors currently proposing to adopt any new anti-takeover measures. Instead, the proposal is being recommended so that, as the need may arise,
TriQuint will have more financial flexibility and will be able to issue shares of common stock without added expense and delay. 

VOTE REQUIRED AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS' RECOMMENDATION    

    The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of TriQuint's outstanding shares of common stock will be required to approve this proposal. 

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THIS PROPOSAL AND RECOMMENDS THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE AMENDMENT OF OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE
OF INCORPORATION TO SET THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT 600,000,000.

Proposal Three
  Adoption of 2001 Stock Option Plan    

    The 2001 Stock Option Plan was adopted by the TriQuint board of directors in May 2001 and 2,400,000 shares were reserved for issuance thereunder,
together with an annual increase in the number of shares of TriQuint common stock reserved for issuance thereunder on the first day of TriQuint's fiscal year, beginning with January 1, 2002, in
an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 15,000,000 shares, (ii) five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of TriQuint as of the last day of the prior fiscal year, or (iii) such
amount as determined by the TriQuint board of directors. As of June 8, 2001, no options to purchase shares were outstanding under the 2001 plan. At this meeting, the TriQuint stockholders are
requested to approve the adoption of the 2001 plan and the reservation of shares for issuance thereunder. 

    The
TriQuint board of directors is seeking stockholder approval of the adoption of the 2001 plan and the reservation of shares thereunder in order to provide TriQuint with a
10 year plan that will provide TriQuint with the ability to issue options throughout its term while eliminating the requirement to solicit periodic approvals of the stockholders of TriQuint to
increase the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2001 plan. The TriQuint board of directors believes that in order to attract and retain qualified employees and consultants for TriQuint,
it is necessary to continue to grant options to such employees and consultants of TriQuint. TriQuint employees, officers and directors, other than those officers and directors employed by TriQuint as
of the date the 2001 plan was approved, are eligible to participate in the 2001 plan. 

    The
2001 plan contains provisions that enable options granted thereunder to comply with Section 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The 2001
Plan provides for certain specific limitations on the number of shares that may be granted to employees pursuant to options under the 2001 Plan so as to comply with the performance-based criteria of
the proposed IRS Regulations under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. This limit is intended to preserve TriQuint's ability to deduct for federal income tax purposes the compensation
expense relating to stock options granted to employees under the 2001 plan. The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993, which was signed into law in August 1993, added (among other things)
Section 162(m) to the Code, which limits the tax deduction for compensation paid to employees of public companies to $1,000,000 per covered employee per year. However, compensation is excluded
from the $1,000,000 calculation if it is considered performance-based, which includes compensation attributable to stock options if, among other things, the 2001 plan under which the options are
granted includes a limit on the maximum number of shares with respect to which stock options may be granted during a specified period to any employee. The 2001 plan contains provisions to limit the
number of shares granted to an existing employee in a fiscal year to 750,000 shares and to limit the number of shares granted to a new employee in a fiscal year to 2,250,000 shares, is solely to
preserve TriQuint's ability to deduct such compensation. To the extent the Board determines in the future that such a limit is not required to preserve the deductibility of compensation related to
such stock options, the TriQuint board of directors may modify or eliminate this limit, subject to approval by the stockholders of such a change. 

    Set
forth below is a summary of the principal features of the 2001 plan. TriQuint will provide, without charge, to each person to whom a proxy statement is delivered, upon request of
such person and by first class mail within three business days of receipt of such request, a copy of the 2001 Plan. Any such request should be directed as follows: Secretary, TriQuint
Semiconductor, Inc., 2300 N.E. Brookwood Parkway, Hillsboro, Oregon 97124; telephone number (503) 615-9000. 

Purpose  

    The purposes of the 2001 plan are to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, to provide additional
incentive to employees and consultants of TriQuint and to promote the success of TriQuint's business. 

Administration  

    The 2001 plan provides for administration by the TriQuint board of directors or by a committee of the TriQuint board of directors. The 2001 plan will be
administered by the compensation committee of the TriQuint board of directors. No member of the TriQuint board of directors who is either presently eligible or who has been eligible at any time within
the preceding year to participate in the 2001 plan may vote on any option to be granted to himself or herself or take part in any consideration of the 2001 plan as it applies to himself or herself,
however such members of the TriQuint board of directors may vote on any other matters affecting the administration of the 2001 plan. The interpretation and construction of any provision of the 2001
plan by the TriQuint board of directors shall be final and conclusive. Members of the TriQuint board of directors receive no compensation for their services in connection with the administration of
the 2001 plan. 

    The
2001 plan will be administered by the TriQuint board of directors if it may administer the 2001 plan in compliance with Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, or
alternatively by a committee designated by the TriQuint board of directors to administer the 2001 Plan, which committee will be constituted to permit the 2001 plan to comply with
Rule 16b-3. The TriQuint board of directors or the committee designated by the TriQuint board of directors will have full power to implement and carry out the 2001 plan, including
the power to determine to what extent options are granted under the 2001 plan and the terms and conditions of such options. 

Eligibility  

    Under the 2001 plan, the TriQuint board of directors is authorized to grant incentive stock options and nonstatutory stock options. However, nonemployee
directors of TriQuint are ineligible to receive options under the 2001 plan. The 2001 plan provides that options may be granted to employees and consultants of TriQuint or any of its designated
subsidiaries. Newly-hired officers, who are employees, may only receive an initial grant from the 2001 plan when first hired. Officers are otherwise ineligible to receive grants from the 2001 plan.
Incentive stock options may be granted only to employees, including new officers and employee directors. The TriQuint board of directors or a committee of the TriQuint board of directors selects the
optionees and determines the number of shares to be subject to each option. The 2001 plan does not provide for a maximum nor a minimum number of option shares which may be granted to any one employee; 

provided, however,

 that an employee may not be granted options to purchase more than 750,000 shares in any fiscal year (or 1,500,000 additional shares
in the case of a new employee's initial employment with TriQuint). Additionally, there is a limit on the aggregate fair market value of shares subject to all incentive stock options, which are
exercisable for the first time in any one calendar year. 

Terms of Options  

    Each option is evidenced by a stock option agreement between TriQuint and the employee or consultant to whom such option is granted and is subject to the
following additional terms and conditions: 

    Exercise of the Option:
  The TriQuint board of directors or its committee determines when options granted under the 2001
plan may be exercised. An option is exercised by giving written notice of exercise to TriQuint or its agent, specifying the number of shares of TriQuint common stock to be 

purchased and tendering payment to TriQuint of the purchase price. Payment for shares issued upon exercise of an option may consist of: 


cash;


check;


promissory
note;


other
shares which (x) in the case of shares acquired upon exercise of an option either have been owned by the optionee for more than six months on
the date of surrender or were not acquired, directly or indirectly, from TriQuint, and (y) have a fair market value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the shares
as to which said option shall be exercised;


consideration
received under a cashless exercise program implemented by TriQuint;


a
reduction in the amount of any company liability;


any
combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or


such
other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of shares to the extent permitted under applicable laws. 

    Options
may be exercised at any time prior to their termination, on or following the date such options are first exercisable. An option may not be exercised for a fraction of a share. 

    Option Price:
  The option price under the 2001 plan is determined by the TriQuint board of directors or its committee,
but, in the case of an incentive stock option granted to (i) an employee who, at the time of the grant of such incentive stock option, owns stock representing more than 10% of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock of TriQuint or any parent or subsidiary, the exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the fair market value per share of TriQuint common stock on the
date the option is granted and (ii) any other employee, in no event shall it be less than 100% of the fair market value of TriQuint common stock on the date the option is granted. The TriQuint
board of directors or its committee may determine the fair market value in its discretion; 
provided, however,
 that where there is a public market for
TriQuint common stock, such fair market value shall be based upon the closing price of TriQuint common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the date the option is granted. 

    Termination of Employment:
  The 2001 plan provides that if the optionee's status as an employee or consultant of
TriQuint is terminated for any reason, other than death or disability, options may be exercised not later than the time specified in the option agreement or, if no time is specified, 3 months
after such termination and may be exercised only to the extent the options were exercisable on the date of termination. 

    Death:
  If an optionee should die while an employee or a consultant of TriQuint, options may be exercised within such
period as specified in the option agreement, but in no event later than the term specified in the notice of grant. In the absence of a specified time, the option remains exercisable for
12 months, but only to the extent the optionee would have been entitled to exercise the option as of the date of death. 

    Disability:
  If the optionee ceases to be an employee or consultant as a result of total or permanent disability,
options may be exercised within such period as specified in the option agreement, but in no event later than the term specified in the notice of grant. In the absence of a specified time, the option
remains exercisable for six months, but only to the extent the optionee would have been entitled to exercise the option as of the date of termination. 

    Termination of Options:
  Options granted under the 2001 plan have a term as determined by the TriQuint board of
directors or its committee upon the grant of the options. The term shall be no more than ten years from the date of grant in the case of an incentive stock option. However, incentive stock options
granted to an optionee who, immediately before the grant of such option, owns stock representing more than ten percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of TriQuint or a
parent or subsidiary corporation, may not have a term of more than five years. No option may be exercised by any person after such expiration. 

    Nontransferability of Options:
  Unless otherwise determined by the TriQuint board of directors or its committee, an
option is nontransferable by the optionee, other than by will or the laws of descent or distribution, and is exercisable only by the optionee during his or her lifetime or, in the event of death, by a
person who acquires the right to exercise the option by bequest or inheritance or by reason of the death of the optionee. However, an optionee may transfer the vested portion of any nonstatutory
option to a member of his or her immediate family or a trust, partnership or limited liability company for the optionee's or his or her immediate family's benefit. 

    Rights upon Exercise:
  Until an option has been properly exercised, that is, proper written notice and full payment have
been received by TriQuint, and a stock certificate evidencing the option shares has been issued, no rights to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder shall exist with respect to
the optioned stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the option. 

    Other Provisions:
  The option agreement may contain such other terms, provisions and conditions not inconsistent with
the 2001 plan as may be determined by the TriQuint board of directors or its committee. 

Adjustment upon Changes in Capitalization  

    In the event any change, such as a stock split or dividend, is made in TriQuint's capitalization which results in an increase or decrease in the number of
outstanding shares of common stock without receipt of consideration by TriQuint, an appropriate adjustment shall be made in the option price and in the number of shares subject to each option. In the
event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of TriQuint, all outstanding options, to the extent not previously exercised, automatically terminate 10 days prior to the consummation of such
proposed action. The TriQuint board of directors may, in its sole discretion, fix a date for termination of the option and give each optionee the right to exercise his or her option as to all or any
part of the optioned stock, including shares as to which the option would not otherwise be exercisable. 

    In
the event of a merger of TriQuint with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets of TriQuint pursuant to which the stockholders of TriQuint prior
to such transaction hold less than 50% of the outstanding capital stock of the surviving corporation immediately after the closing of such transaction (a "Change in Control Transaction"), outstanding
options may be assumed or substituted at the administrator's discretion. At such time, the administrator shall have the discretion: 


to
terminate the plan and permit the optionee to exercise the option to the extent already vested;


to
accelerate the vesting of any portion of or all of the outstanding options; and


to
provide that some or all of the options accelerate if an optionee is terminated by a successor corporation other than voluntarily or for cause within
twelve months following the Change in Control Transaction. 

    Options
are treated in the same manner in the event of a merger or sale of substantially all of the assets of TriQuint in a transaction that is not a Change in Control Transaction. 

Amendment and Termination  

    The TriQuint board of directors may amend the 2001 plan at any time or from time to time or may terminate it without approval of the stockholders, 

provided, however,
 that stockholder approval is
required to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act or with Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, no action by the
TriQuint board of directors or stockholders may alter or impair any option previously granted under the 2001 plan without the consent of the optionee. In any event, the 2001 plan will terminate in
May 2011. 

Tax Information  

    Options granted under the 2001 plan may be either "incentive stock options," as defined in Section 422 of the Code, or nonstatutory options. 

    An
optionee who is granted an incentive stock option will not recognize taxable income either at the time the option is granted or upon its exercise, although the exercise may subject
the optionee to the alternative minimum tax. Upon the sale or exchange of the shares more than two years after grant of the option and one year after exercising the option, any gain or loss will be
treated as long-term capital gain or loss. If these holding periods are not satisfied, the optionee will recognize ordinary income at the time of sale or exchange equal to the difference
between the exercise price and the lower of (i) the fair market value of the shares at the date of the option exercise or (ii) the sale price of the shares. A different rule for
measuring ordinary income upon such a premature disposition may apply if the optionee is also an officer, director, or 10% stockholder of TriQuint. TriQuint will be entitled to a deduction in the same
amount as the ordinary income recognized by the optionee. Any gain or loss recognized on such a premature disposition of the shares in excess of the amount treated as ordinary income will be
characterized as long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending on the holding period. 

    All
other options that do not qualify as incentive stock options are referred to as nonstatutory options. An optionee will not recognize any taxable income at the time he is granted a
nonstatutory option. However, upon its exercise, the optionee will recognize ordinary income generally measured as the excess of the then fair market value of the shares purchased over the purchase
price. Any taxable income recognized in connection with an option exercise by an optionee who is also an employee of TriQuint will be subject to tax withholding by TriQuint. Upon resale of such shares
by the optionee, any difference between the sales price and the optionee's purchase price, to the extent not recognized as taxable income as described above, will be treated as long-term
or short-term capital gain or loss, depending on the holding period. 

    TriQuint
will be entitled to a tax deduction in the same amount as the ordinary income recognized by the optionee with respect to shares acquired upon exercise of a nonstatutory
option. 

    The
foregoing is only a summary of the effect of federal income taxation upon the optionee and TriQuint with respect to the grant and exercise of options under the 2001 plan, does not
purport to be complete, and does not discuss the tax consequences of the optionee's death or the income tax laws of any municipality, state or foreign country in which an optionee may reside. 

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT TRIQUINT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE 2001 PLAN DISCUSSED
ABOVE.

    (a) 
Conversion of Company Common Stock.

then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition, and the certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. The Company shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure

    (b) 
Cancellation of Parent-Owned and Company-Held Stock.

split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,

 No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in
lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by
(ii) the average of the closing price of the Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market ("NASDAQ") on the two trading days immediately preceding the Effective Time. 

    1.7 
Surrender of Certificates.

    (b) 
Parent to Provide Common Stock.
 Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent
for exchange in accordance with this Article I, the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, and cash in
an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled
pursuant to Section 1.7(d). 

    (c) 
Exchange Procedures.
 Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record (as of the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the "
Certificates
"), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d), (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall contain such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional
shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor certificates representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which their shares of Company Common Stock were
converted at the Effective Time, payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holders have the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant
to Section 1.7(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, subject to Section 1.7(d) as to the payment of dividends, to evidence only the ownership of the number of full shares of
Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Common Stock shall have been so converted and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in
accordance with Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d). 

    (d) 
Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares.
 No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
date of this Agreement with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of record of such Certificates shall surrender such Certificates. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificates, the
Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest, certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor along with payment in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) hereof and the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock. 

    (e) 
Transfers of Ownership.
 If certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other
than that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the persons requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent
or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

    (f)  
Required Withholding.
 Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable legal requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

    (g) 
No Liability.
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.7, neither the Exchange Agent,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

    1.8 
No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.
 All shares of Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with the
terms hereof (including any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and 1.7(d)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If after the Effective Time Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I. 

    1.9 
Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.
 In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, certificates representing the
shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates were converted pursuant to Section 1.6, cash for fractional shares, if any, as may
be required pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d); 
provided, however,
 that
Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of such certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock, cash and other distributions, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

    1.10 
Tax and Accounting Consequences.

    (a) It
is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. The parties hereto

necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
