                      JOINT PROXY STATEMENT AND PROSPECTUS

                  Subject to completion, dated April 30, 2001

   iVillage Inc. and Women.com Networks, Inc. have agreed on a merger
transaction involving our two companies. Before we can complete the merger, we
must obtain the approval of both of our companies' stockholders. We are
sending you this joint proxy statement/prospectus to ask you to vote on a
proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger. iVillage
stockholders are also being asked to vote on a proposal to approve the
issuance of iVillage common stock and warrants to Hearst Communications, Inc.,
a proposal to approve a rights offering to Women.com stockholders other than
Hearst Communications and a proposal to increase the number of iVillage's
authorized shares of common stock. iVillage's proposal to approve the merger
agreement and the merger is conditioned on the approval of the proposal to
increase the number of iVillage's authorized shares of common stock.

   In the merger, stockholders of Women.com will be entitled to receive 0.322
of a share of iVillage common stock (subject to adjustment as described below)
in return for each share of Women.com common stock they own. In addition,
Women.com stockholders will receive a cash payment equal to one percent of the
product of the average high and low prices of a share of iVillage common stock
on the Nasdaq National Market on the closing date of the merger multiplied by
0.322 (subject to adjustment as described below). The aggregate cash payment is
currently anticipated to be approximately $250,000.00. Outstanding shares of
iVillage common stock will remain unchanged in the merger. The exchange ratio of
0.322 of a share of iVillage common stock and the cash payment for each share of
Women.com common stock are subject to downward adjustment in the event that
Women.com did not have at least $12.0 million of working capital and $20.0
million in cash as of March 31, 2001. Because the exchange ratio is subject to
adjustment, you will not know the exact number of shares of iVillage common
stock and cash you will receive in the merger when you send in your proxy card.
As a result of the merger, Women.com will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
iVillage. The shares of iVillage common stock issued to stockholders of
Women.com as a result of the merger will be listed on the Nasdaq National Market
under the trading symbol "IVIL."

   In connection with, and subject to the closing of, the merger, Women.com
stockholders (other than Hearst Communications) as of April 16, 2001 will also
receive the right to purchase up to an aggregate of 5,066,661 shares of
iVillage common stock and warrants to purchase up to 1,141,140 shares of
iVillage common stock pursuant to the rights offering described in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. If you owned Women.com common stock on April 16,
2001, you will receive, at no cost, one right for each share of Women.com
common stock that you owned on that date. Each right will entitle the holder
to purchase 0.1973 of a share of iVillage common stock and a warrant to
purchase 0.0444 of a share of iVillage common stock for a cash subscription
price of $0.4232 per right. The rights are not transferable and will not be
listed for trading on any stock exchange.

   If the merger is completed, Hearst Communications, the holder of
approximately 46% of the outstanding shares of Women.com common stock, has
agreed to purchase up to 9,324,000 shares of iVillage common stock and a
warrant to purchase up to 2,100,000 shares of iVillage common stock for an
aggregate purchase price of up to $20.0 million. This investment by Hearst
Communications will be reduced by the amount of common stock and warrants
purchased by Women.com stockholders in the rights offering. Hearst
Communications is a standby underwriter for the rights offering and the
merger.

   The rights are exercisable beginning on the date of this prospectus. The
rights will expire if they are not properly exercised by 5:00 p.m., New York
City time, on May 23, 2001, the date of the Women.com and iVillage special
stockholder meetings.

                                                              Estimated
                                                               Expenses
                             Subscription    Discounts and     Payable      Net Proceeds
                                 Price        Commissions    by iVillage    to iVillage
                             ------------    -------------   -----------    ------------

Total ....................    $10,866,989        None          $100,000     $10,766,989

   The subscription price in the amount of approximately $10.8 million and the
net proceeds to iVillage in the amount of approximately $10.7 million, both as
indicated in the above table, assume that the rights offering is fully
subscribed by all Women.com stockholders on April 16, 2001 (other than Hearst
Communications). There can be no assurance that any Women.com stockholder will
exercise subscription rights.

   Your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to attend your
stockholder meeting, please take the time to vote by completing the enclosed
proxy card.

   We encourage you to read carefully this entire document, including all its
annexes, and we especially encourage you to read the "Risk Factors" section
beginning on page 15.

   We enthusiastically support this combination of our companies, and join with
the other members of our boards of directors in recommending that you vote for
the merger and all of the related proposals.

                            To Be Held May 23, 2001

To the Stockholders of iVillage Inc.:

   The special meeting of stockholders of iVillage Inc. will be held on May 23,
2001, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the Hilton Times Square, Empire Room, 234
W. 42nd Street, New York, New York, for the following purposes:

   o To consider and vote on a proposal, which is conditioned on the approval
     of the proposal to increase the number of authorized shares of iVillage
     common stock, to approve and adopt the merger agreement among iVillage
     Inc., Stanhope Acquisition Sub, LLC, which is a newly formed, wholly
     owned subsidiary of iVillage, and Women.com Networks, Inc., and the
     transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger,
     and the issuance of shares of iVillage common stock to be received by
     stockholders of Women.com pursuant to the merger agreement.

   o To consider and vote on a proposal to approve the issuance of shares of
     iVillage common stock and warrants to acquire iVillage common stock to
     Hearst Communications, pursuant to the amended and restated securities
     purchase agreement between iVillage and Hearst Communications.

   o To consider and vote on a proposal to approve the rights offering to all
     Women.com stockholders other than Hearst Communications.

   o To consider and vote upon a proposal to amend iVillage's amended and
     restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of
     authorized shares of iVillage common stock from 65,000,000 to
     200,000,000.

   Holders of record of shares of iVillage common stock at the close of
business on April 16, 2001 will be entitled to vote at the special meeting or
any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting.

   The iVillage board of directors has determined that the terms of the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by it are fair to and in the best
interests of iVillage and its stockholders. The iVillage board of directors
recommends that stockholders vote at the special meeting to approve and adopt
each of the proposals described above.

   Please take the time to vote by completing and mailing the enclosed proxy
card or following the telephone or Internet voting instructions at the bottom
of your proxy card. A postage-prepaid envelope has been provided for your
convenience if you wish to vote by mail. If your shares are held in "street
name" at a brokerage firm, you must instruct your broker how to vote your
shares. Returning your proxy or voting by telephone or Internet does not
deprive you of your right to attend the special meeting and to vote your
shares in person.

   It is important that you sign, date and return the proxy card in the
enclosed envelope or vote by telephone or Internet so that your shares of
iVillage common stock will be represented, whether or not you plan to attend
the special meeting. If you do not return your card or vote by telephone or
Internet, or if you do not instruct your broker how to vote any shares of
iVillage common stock held for you in "street name," your shares of iVillage
common stock will not be voted at the special meeting, and this will have the
same effect as voting against the foregoing proposals.

   Regardless of the number of shares of iVillage common stock you hold, your
vote is very important.

                                   By Order of the board of directors

To the Stockholders of Women.com Networks, Inc.:

   A special meeting of stockholders of Women.com Networks, Inc. will be held

agreement, including the merger, at the special meeting.

obtain payment in cash of the fair value of their shares of common stock under
applicable provisions of Delaware law. In order to perfect dissenters' rights,
Women.com stockholders must give written demand for appraisal of their shares
before the taking of the vote on the merger at the special meeting and must
not vote in favor of the merger. A copy of the applicable Delaware statutory
provisions is included as Annex D to the attached joint proxy statement/

Rights of Dissenting Women.com Stockholders" in the attached joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:      What will happen in the merger?

A:      The boards of directors of iVillage and Women.com have approved a
        transaction whereby iVillage will acquire Women.com. To accomplish this
        transaction, a subsidiary of iVillage will merge into Women.com,
        resulting in Women.com becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of iVillage.
        iVillage common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the
        trading symbol "IVIL."

Q:      What will I receive in the merger?

A:      If the merger is completed, Women.com stockholders will receive 0.322 of
        a share of iVillage common stock (subject to downward adjustment as
        described below) for each share of Women.com common stock they own. In
        addition, Women.com stockholders will receive a cash payment per share
        equal to one percent of the product of the average high and low prices
        of a share of iVillage common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the
        closing date of the merger multiplied by 0.322 (subject to downward
        adjustment as described below). iVillage will not issue fractional
        shares of common stock. Instead of fractional shares, you will receive
        cash based on the closing price of iVillage common stock on the closing
        date.

        For example, if you own 100 shares of Women.com common stock and the
        average high and low per share price on the Nasdaq National Market on
        the closing date is $1.00, you will receive 32 shares of iVillage
        common stock, a cash payment of $0.32 in exchange for your shares of
        Women.com common stock and an additional cash payment for your 0.2
        fractional share.

        Except as described below, the number of shares of iVillage common stock
        to be issued for each share of Women.com common stock is fixed and will
        not be adjusted based upon changes in the value of these shares. As a
        result, the value of the shares you receive in the merger will not be
        known at the time you vote on the merger and may go up or down as the
        market price for iVillage common stock goes up or down. Women.com is not
        permitted to withdraw from the merger or resolicit the vote of its
        stockholders based solely on changes in the value of the iVillage common
        stock.

        iVillage's stock price has been volatile, and economic and market
        circumstances are subject to change. As an example, the following table
        sets forth the high and low closing sale prices per share of iVillage
        common stock on the Nasdaq National Market during the indicated months
        of 2000 and 2001.

                                                                        Closing Sale

                                                                          Share of
                                                                          iVillage

                                                                       -------------

                                                                       -----   -----

    April 2001 (through
    April 27, 2001) ...............................................    $1.44   $0.50

Q:      Are the 0.322 exchange ratio and the amount of the per share cash
        payment subject to adjustment?

A:      Yes. The 0.322 exchange ratio and the per share cash payment will not be
        increased, but they could be decreased. The exchange ratio of 0.322 of a
        share of iVillage common stock and the cash payment for each share of
        Women.com common stock are subject to a downward adjustment in the event
        that Women.com did not have specified amounts of working capital and
        cash as of March 31, 2001. Because the exchange ratio is subject to
        adjustment, you will not know the exact number of shares of iVillage
        common stock and cash you will receive in the merger when you send in
        your proxy card. For a detailed description of the terms governing
        adjustment of the exchange ratio and cash payment, see the section of
        this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled "The Merger Agreement -
        Merger Consideration."

Q:      Why are iVillage and Women.com proposing the merger?

A:      We believe the merger offers the opportunity to create the world's
        largest and most comprehensive destination for women on the Web. We
        view the merger as a unique opportunity to combine the two top women's
        online media/Web properties to create the most comprehensive
        destination to meet the everyday needs of women online by creating one
        consolidated network of websites regardless of whether or not the
        current Women.com websites are maintained separately or the content is
        integrated into the iVillage website.

        Please read the more detailed description of the reasons for the merger
        on pages 41 through 46.

Q:      What will happen to shares of iVillage common stock in the merger?

A:      Each share of iVillage common stock outstanding will remain outstanding
        as a share of iVillage common stock. Your percentage ownership of
        iVillage's outstanding common stock will decrease as a result of the
        issuance of iVillage common stock in the merger and pursuant to the
        securities purchase agreement with Hearst Communications and the rights
        offering to other Women.com stockholders.

Q:      What do I need to do now?

A:      After carefully reading and considering the information contained in
        this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the annexes, please
        respond by completing, signing and dating your proxy card and returning
        it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope as soon as possible so that
        your shares may be represented at your stockholder meeting. You may
        also vote by using the toll-free telephone number

        included on your proxy card or by Internet in the manner described on
        your proxy card. To assure that we obtain your vote, please return your
        completed proxy card or vote by telephone or Internet even if you
        currently plan to attend your stockholder meeting in person.

Q:      When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A:      We plan to complete the merger after all the conditions to the merger,
        including obtaining the approvals of our stockholders at the
        stockholder meetings, are fulfilled. We currently expect to complete
        the merger by the end of May 2001.

Q:      Should I send in my stock certificates now?

A:      No. If you are an iVillage stockholder DO NOT send in your stock
        certificates.

        If you are a Women.com stockholder, after the merger is completed,
        iVillage will send you written instructions, including a letter of
        transmittal, that explain how to exchange Women.com stock certificates
        for iVillage stock certificates. Please do not send in any Women.com
        stock certificates until you receive these written instructions and the
        letter of transmittal.

Q:      If I have more questions about the merger or related matters or the
        iVillage proposal to increase the number of its authorized shares of
        common stock, where can I find answers?

A:      If you have any questions about the merger or related matters or the
        iVillage proposal to increase the number of its authorized shares of
        common stock or how to submit your proxy, or if you need additional
        copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or the enclosed proxy

                QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE RIGHTS OFFERING
                       (FOR WOMEN.COM STOCKHOLDERS ONLY)

Q:   Why is iVillage conducting this rights offering?

A:   In connection with the proposed combination of the businesses of
     Women.com and iVillage, Hearst Communications, the holder of
     approximately 46% of the outstanding shares of Women.com common stock,
     agreed to purchase up to 9,324,000 shares of iVillage's common stock and
     warrants to purchase up to 2,100,000 shares of iVillage's common stock
     for a total purchase price of $20.0 million. As a condition of Hearst
     Communications' obligation to purchase the shares of iVillage's common
     stock and the warrants, iVillage must offer rights to all of the other
     stockholders of Women.com to purchase their pro rata portion of the
     shares and warrants offered to Hearst Communications. Hearst
     Communications will purchase the number of shares of iVillage common
     stock and warrants to purchase iVillage common stock not subscribed for
     by other Women.com stockholders in the rights offering. Hearst
     Communications is a standby underwriter for the rights offering and the
     merger.

Q:   What is a rights offering?

A:   The rights offering is a distribution of rights on a pro rata basis to
     all of Women.com's stockholders (other than Hearst Communications) who
     held shares of Women.com's common stock on April 16, 2001, the record
     date of the rights offering. "Pro rata" means the proportion of the total
     number of shares of Women.com's outstanding common stock that you and the
     other stockholders of Women.com held on April 16, 2001.

Q:   May I exercise rights for less than my pro rata portion?

A:   Yes. You are not required to subscribe for any rights and, if you choose
     to subscribe, you are not required to subscribe for your entire pro rata
     portion of rights.

Q:   What is a right?

A:   Each right entitles a Women.com stockholder to purchase 0.1973 of a share
     of iVillage's common stock and a warrant to purchase 0.0444 of a share of
     iVillage's common stock for a subscription price of $0.4232 per right.
     iVillage has granted to each Women.com stockholder on April 16, 2001 one
     right for each outstanding share of Women.com common stock held by a
     Women.com stockholder.

Q:   What if my rights result in fractional shares?

A:   If your rights would allow you to purchase a fraction of a share or a
     warrant to purchase a fraction of a share, you may exercise your rights
     only by rounding down to the nearest whole share. You may not purchase
     fractional shares or receive a warrant exercisable for a fraction of a
     share. The subscription price per right will not be reduced based on the
     rounding down of shares and iVillage will not pay cash in lieu of
     fractional shares. In each instance, your total subscription price is
     equal to the total number of rights you elected to exercise multiplied by
     $0.4232 (rounded up to the nearest whole cent).

Q:   What happens if the merger does not close?

A:   If the merger does not close for any reason, then the rights offering
     will be canceled and all subscription payments will be returned, without
     interest.

Q:   May iVillage stockholders participate in the rights offering?

A:   No. The rights are only being offered to the stockholders of Women.com
     (other than Hearst Communications) who held shares of Women.com common
     stock as of April 16, 2001.

Q:   How soon must Women.com stockholders act?

A:   The rights expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 23, 2001, the
     date of the Women.com and iVillage special stockholder meetings. The
     subscription agent must actually receive all required documents and
     payments before that time and date.

Q:   May I change or cancel my exercise of rights after I send in the required
     forms?

A:   No. All exercises of rights are irrevocable unless the conditions to the
     completion of the rights offering are not satisfied or waived before the
     subscription period ends. For a description of the conditions to the
     closing of the rights offering, see the section of this joint proxy
     statement/prospectus entitled "The Rights Offering - Conditions to the
     Offering."

Q:   Is participation in the rights offering recommended by the iVillage or
     Women.com boards of directors?

A:   Neither iVillage's board of directors nor Women.com's board of directors
     makes any recommendation to you about whether you should exercise any
     rights. You should decide whether to subscribe for the rights based

     on your own assessment of your best interests in consultation with your
     financial and legal advisors.

Q:   Is my participation in the rights offering a condition of the merger?

A:   No. The extent of your participation, or your decision not to
     participate, in the rights offering will not affect the closing of the
     merger. If the merger is completed, Hearst Communications has agreed to
     purchase up to 9,324,000 shares of iVillage common stock and a warrant to
     purchase up to 2,100,000 shares of iVillage common stock for an aggregate
     purchase price of up to $20.0 million, except that the number of shares
     of common stock and warrants, and the purchase price payable by Hearst
     Communications, will be reduced by the  number of shares of common stock
     and warrants, if any, purchased by other Women.com stockholders in the
     rights offering.

Q:   How are Women.com stockholders affected if they do not exercise any
     rights?

A:   You are not required to exercise any rights or otherwise take any action
     in response to this rights offering. If you do not exercise any rights,
     the number of shares of iVillage common stock which you will receive in
     exchange for your Women.com common stock upon the closing of the merger
     will not change, but your percentage ownership of iVillage's total
     outstanding common stock after the merger will be lower than if you had
     exercised your rights in full.

Q:   May Women.com stockholders transfer rights?

A:   No. The rights are not transferable and may not be sold. Because the
     rights will not be transferable, they will not be listed for trading on
     Nasdaq, any other quotation system or any stock exchange.

Q:   To whom do Women.com stockholders direct additional questions?

A:   If you have questions about the rights offering or need additional copies
     of offering documents, you should call Continental Stock Transfer and
     Trust Company, the subscription agent, at the toll free number (888) 509-
     5587.

Offering" beginning on page 137.

Summary of iVillage's and Women.com's 2000 Revenues and Operating Losses

Women.com Networks, Inc.
1820 Gateway Drive, Suite 100
San Mateo, California 94404
Telephone: (650) 378-6500

   Women.com Networks, Inc. is a leading Internet media company that offers a
network of web sites dedicated to women. While Women.com offers all the
services that Web users expect in a portal site, including programming,
community, shopping and personalized services, its most distinguishing feature
is its network approach, which unites the most popular brand names in the
world under one user-friendly interactive hub. Brand names such as
Cosmopolitan, Good Housekeeping, Harlequin and Prevention are incorporated
into Women.com's network, which includes 150,000 pages within 17 topical
channels. Women.com makes its programming and services available without
charge to visitors and generates revenue primarily through the sale of
advertisements, promotions, sponsorships and direct marketing. Women.com also
receives production and e-commerce revenues from certain partners.

   Women.com was incorporated in October 1992 as Wire Networks, Inc. In 1998,
Wire Networks changed its name to Women.com Networks. In January 1999,
Women.com Networks entered into a joint venture agreement with Hearst HomeArts
Inc., a subsidiary of The Hearst Corporation, to create Women.com Networks
LLC. In August 1999, Women.com Networks merged with HomeArts. Women.com
Networks LLC was dissolved, and Women.com Networks, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, was the surviving entity. Women.com has been a public company
since October 15, 1999. It is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the
symbol "WOMN."

The Merger (Page 37)

   If all the conditions to the merger are satisfied or waived, Women.com will
merge with Stanhope Acquisition Sub, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of
iVillage created for the purpose of effecting the merger. After the merger,
Women.com will be a wholly owned subsidiary of iVillage and Women.com
stockholders will become iVillage stockholders.

   Either iVillage or Women.com could cancel the merger even if both the
iVillage stockholders and the Women.com stockholders approve the merger.

   Though no formal decision has been reached, following the merger, iVillage
expects to operate the Women.com websites in addition to the iVillage.com
website for an indefinite period. iVillage may in the future integrate the
content on the Women.com websites into the content currently on the iVillage
website. Regardless of whether or not the current Women.com websites are
maintained as a separate site or the content is integrated into the iVillage
website, the two websites will be linked by a graphical/textual link on the
navigation bar or home page on one web site to the other web site and
Women.com's revenues, traffic, users and other key metrics will be
consolidated within the corresponding iVillage metrics in much the same way
that the Astrology.com, FamilyPoint.com, OnlinePsych.com and other websites
acquired by iVillage in recent years are consolidated within the iVillage
Network. Third party tracking services and advertisers will view the iVillage
and Women.com websites, whether or not operated separately, as part of one
consolidated network of websites. iVillage currently expects to primarily
utilize its existing hardware, software and technology infrastructure to
operate the iVillage and Women.com websites after the closing of the merger.
Although compatibility problems between the technology systems operated by
iVillage and Women.com may delay or prevent integration of some Women.com
content into iVillage's website, iVillage does not believe that any
compatibility issues present a material risk to the combined company. Nor does
iVillage believe that there is a material risk that its existing technology
infrastructure will be unable to handle the increased number of page views
expected to be generated by the combined company. Accordingly, iVillage does
not believe the combined company will incur any material expenditure in
integrating the technology systems operated by iVillage and Women.com.
iVillage will continue to maintain its executive offices in New York with
operations coordinated from that location. While no decision has been reached
concerning Women.com's executive offices, iVillage expects to continue to have
offices in California following the completion of the merger.

   In connection with the merger transaction, Hearst Communications agreed to
make an investment in iVillage pursuant to an amended and restated securities
purchase agreement by and between iVillage and Hearst Communications dated as
of February 22, 2001. However, since the merger must be completed before
Hearst Communications is obligated to make this investment, it is possible
that, following the merger, no investment would be made by Hearst
Communications. For more information on this possibility, see "Risk Factors--
Although Hearst Communications has entered into an amended and restated
securities purchase agreement with iVillage which provides for an investment
in iVillage by Hearst Communications of up to $20.0 million, it is possible
that the merger between iVillage and Women.com could close without any
investment by Hearst Communications." At Hearst Communications' request,
iVillage agreed to effectuate the rights offering so that the other Women.com
stockholders would be given the opportunity to participate in the iVillage
investment.

   If the merger is completed, stockholders of Women.com will receive 0.322 of
a share of iVillage common stock (subject to downward adjustment as described
below) for each share of Women.com common stock they own. In addition,
stockholders of Women.com will receive a cash payment (subject to downward
adjustment as described below) equal to one percent of the product of the
average high and low prices of a share of iVillage common stock on the Nasdaq
National Market on the closing date of the merger multiplied by 0.322 (subject
to downward adjustment as described below). Stockholders of Women.com will also
receive a cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares of iVillage common stock
they might otherwise be entitled to receive. The exchange ratio and cash payment
are subject to downward adjustment if Women.com did not have $12.0 million of
working capital and $20.0 million in cash as of March 31, 2001. For a detailed
description of the terms governing the adjustment of the exchange ratio and the
cash payment, see the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled
"The Merger Agreement - Merger Consideration."

These individuals have advised iVillage that they intend to vote all of their

Agreements between Hearst Communications and iVillage (Pages 79 through 87)

   In addition to the voting agreement described above, iVillage and Hearst
Communications entered into a securities purchase agreement dated as of
February 5, 2001 and amended and restated as of February 22, 2001. As a
condition to the closing of the merger, iVillage and Hearst Communications
must also enter into a stockholder agreement and a magazine content license
and hosting agreement and each of the amended and restated securities purchase
agreement and the stockholder agreement (described below) between iVillage and
Hearst Communications must be in full force and effect.

   Pursuant to the amended and restated securities purchase agreement, Hearst
Communications will pay to iVillage up to $20.0 million for up to 9,324,000
shares of iVillage common stock and a warrant to purchase up to 2,100,000
shares of iVillage common stock. The number of shares of iVillage common stock
and warrants to purchase iVillage common stock, and the associated aggregate
purchase price, are subject to reduction to the extent other Women.com
stockholders participate in the iVillage rights offering.

   The number of shares of iVillage common stock and the associated aggregate
purchase price are subject to decrease to the extent:

   o  Women.com did not have at least $12.0 million of working capital and $20.0
      million in cash as of March 31, 2001 and, as a result of this shortfall,
      Hearst Communications is required to, or elects to, purchase additional
      shares of iVillage common stock; or

   o  Women.com stockholders holding more than two percent of the outstanding
      shares of Women.com common stock exercise dissenters' rights under
      Delaware law.

   The amended and restated securities purchase agreement provides that if
Women.com stockholders holding in excess of two percent of the number of shares
of Women.com common stock outstanding as of April 16, 2001, the record date for
the Women.com special stockholders meeting, exercise dissenters' rights in
connection with the merger, iVillage can require Hearst Communications to
purchase additional shares of iVillage common stock at a price per share of
$1.875. The price of $1.875 per share was established pursuant to arms'-length
negotiations between iVillage and Hearst Communications.

   The warrant to be issued to Hearst Communications will have an exercise
price of $0.01 per share and will be exercisable at any time after the date of
issuance until

December 31, 2004 but only if the average closing price of iVillage's common
stock has exceeded $3.75 per share for any fifteen consecutive trading days.

   The stockholder agreement to be entered into between iVillage and Hearst
Communications:

   o limits the number of shares of iVillage common stock that may be held by
     Hearst Communications (as described below);

   o entitles Hearst Communications to have three (subject to adjustment)
     representatives on the iVillage board of directors, and one
     representative on each of the iVillage nominating and compensation
     committees of the board;

   o prohibits Hearst Communications from initiating or engaging in the
     solicitation of iVillage proxies, stockholder proposals and tender offers
     or calling iVillage stockholder meetings; and

   o requires Hearst Communications to vote its iVillage securities in excess
     of 25% (subject to adjustment) of the outstanding iVillage voting
     securities in the manner recommended by the non-Hearst Communications
     board designees.

   The maximum number of iVillage voting securities and outstanding convertible
securities, options, warrants and other rights convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of iVillage common stock that may be held by Hearst
Communications and its affiliates at any point in time will be calculated as
the product of a threshold percentage (calculated as of the closing date) and
the sum of total outstanding voting securities and warrant shares held by
Hearst Communications and its affiliates. Accordingly, the maximum number of
iVillage voting securities that Hearst Communications may hold will change as
the number of outstanding iVillage voting securities and the number of warrant
shares change. The threshold percentage that will be used to calculate this
maximum number, however, will be fixed on the closing date of the merger. This
threshold percentage will be calculated as the total number of outstanding
iVillage voting securities and outstanding convertible securities, on an as-
converted basis, owned by Hearst Communications and its affiliates on the
closing date divided by the sum of the total number of iVillage voting
securities outstanding on the closing date and the number of iVillage voting
securities issuable to Hearst Communications upon exercise of the iVillage
warrant that it holds on the closing date. The specified percentage would be
approximately 32.6% if Hearst Communications invested $20.0 million pursuant
to the amended and restated securities purchase agreement and elected not to,
and was not required to, purchase additional shares of iVillage common stock
under the merger agreement or amended and restated securities purchase
agreement.

"Agreements Between Hearst Communications and iVillage--Magazine Content
License and Hosting Agreement."

opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the Women.com board of
directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the Women.com
stockholders of the merger consideration, including the benefits to be derived
from the Hearst Communications investment following the completion of the
merger, which investment will help iVillage strengthen and expand the business
of the combined company following completion of the merger and the increased
advertising value of the iVillage network derived from the addition of the
Hearst magazines, Women.com content and Women.com users to iVillage. We have
attached this opinion, dated February 5, 2001, as Annex B to this document.
You should read this opinion completely to understand the procedures followed,
assumptions made, matters considered and limitations of the review undertaken.

have attached this opinion, dated February 5, 2001, as Annex C to this
document. You should read this opinion completely to understand the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations of the review
undertaken.

Conditions to the Merger (Page 73)

   iVillage and Women.com will complete the merger when all of the conditions
to completion of the merger are satisfied or waived. For a detailed
description of the conditions to completion of the merger, see the section
entitled "The Merger Agreement - Conditions to the Merger." The merger will
become effective when iVillage and Women.com file a certificate of merger with
the Delaware Secretary of State.

   Assuming approval of the merger by the stockholders of iVillage and
Women.com and the satisfaction or waiver of all other conditions of the merger
agreement, iVillage and Women.com expect to complete the merger by the end of
May 2001.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (Page 75)

   iVillage and Women.com can agree at any time to terminate the merger
agreement without completing the merger, even if Women.com and iVillage
stockholders have approved the merger. Also, either iVillage or Women.com can
decide, without the consent of the other, to terminate the merger agreement
under certain circumstances. For a detailed description of the circumstances
in which the merger agreement may be terminated by iVillage and Women.com, see
the section entitled "The Merger Agreement - Termination."

Termination Fees (Page 75)

   If iVillage terminates the merger agreement because Women.com withdraws or
modifies its recommendation or approval of the merger, or because the
Women.com stockholders do not approve the merger, Women.com is obligated to
pay iVillage a termination fee of $1.0 million.

   If Women.com terminates the merger agreement because the iVillage
stockholders do not approve the merger, iVillage is obligated to pay Women.com
a termination fee of $1.0 million.

"No Solicitation" Provisions (Page 70)

   Women.com has generally agreed not to initiate or engage in discussions with
another party regarding a business combination with that party while the
merger is pending. However, Women.com may consider a superior proposal, may
furnish information about Women.com to a person making a superior proposal and
may participate in discussions of a superior proposal in its exercise of its
fiduciary duties if but only if Women.com's board of directors reasonably
determines in good faith, based on the written advice of independent outside
legal counsel, that it is required to do so to comply with its fiduciary
duties to Women.com's stockholders. For a detailed description of these
restrictions on Women.com's ability to initiate or engage in discussions with
another party regarding a business combination, see "The Merger Agreement --
Competing Acquisition Proposals for Women.com."

Rights of Dissenting Stockholders (Page 64)

   iVillage Stockholders. Under Delaware law, iVillage stockholders are not
entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

   Women.com Stockholders. Under Delaware law, Women.com stockholders are
entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger. If you do not wish
to accept cash and shares of iVillage common stock as payment for your shares
of Women.com common stock in the merger, you will have the right under
Delaware law to have the fair value of your shares of Women.com common stock
determined by the Delaware Chancery Court. This right to appraisal is subject
to a number of restrictions and technical requirements. Generally, in order to
exercise your appraisal rights you must:

   o send a written demand to Women.com for appraisal in compliance with
     Delaware General Corporation Law before the vote on the merger;

   o not vote in favor of the merger; and

   o continuously hold your Women.com common stock, from the date you make the
     demand for appraisal through the closing of the merger.

   Merely voting against the merger will not protect your rights to an
appraisal, which requires following all the steps provided under Delaware law.
Delaware law requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in
further detail in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus
entitled "The Merger -- Rights of Dissenting Women.com Stockholders" and are
attached as Annex D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

   If you vote for the merger, you will waive your rights to seek appraisal of
your shares of Women.com common stock under Delaware Law.

Accounting Treatment (Page 61)

   iVillage intends to account for the merger as a "purchase" for financial
accounting purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America.

Material Federal Income Tax Consequences (Page 61)

   Women.com Stockholders. Women.com and iVillage have structured the merger
so that the merger will be a taxable transaction for United States federal
income tax purposes. In that case, the stockholders of Women.com will
recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes equal to the difference
between (i) the amount of cash received plus the fair market value of the
iVillage stock on the date of the merger and the fair market value on the date
of distribution, if any, of the rights received pursuant to the rights
offering, and (ii) the tax basis in the Women.com stock exchanged therefor.
However, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service may assert that the
merger will constitute a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code
which would result in the stockholders of Women.com not recognizing gain or
loss for federal income tax purposes in the merger.

   In addition, you may have additional consideration received in the merger
equal to the fair market value, if any, of the rights distributed to you
pursuant to the rights offering on the date the rights are distributed.
However, you should not have any material United States federal income tax
consequences as a result of the rights offering if you decide not to exercise
the rights distributed to you pursuant to the rights offering. For a
discussion of the material federal income tax consequences of the rights
offering, see "The Rights Offering--Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences"
(page 143).

   iVillage Stockholders. Because shares of iVillage common stock remain
unchanged, the merger will not cause you to recognize any gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

   This tax treatment may not apply to some stockholders. Determining the
actual tax consequences of the merger to you may be complicated. These
consequences will depend on your specific situation and on variables not
within our control. You should consult your own tax advisor for a full
understanding of the merger's tax consequences for you.

Market Price Information (Page 147)

   iVillage common stock and Women.com common stock are both quoted on the
Nasdaq National Market. On February 5, 2001, the last trading day before
iVillage announced the merger, iVillage common stock closed at $1.72 per share
and Women.com common stock closed at $0.72 per share. On April 26, 2001, the
most recent practicable date before the date of this joint proxy statement/
prospectus, iVillage common stock closed at $1.44 per share and Women.com
common stock closed at $0.30 per share. The market price of iVillage common
stock will fluctuate prior to and after the merger, but the exchange ratio
will not be increased. You should obtain current stock price quotations for
iVillage common stock and Women.com common stock.

   On December 28, 2000, Women.com received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock
Market, Inc. stating that Women.com had failed to maintain a minimum per share
bid price of $1.00 over the last 30 consecutive trading days, which is
required for continued lisiting on the Nasdaq National Market. Pursuant to the
letter, Women.com would have regained compliance with the rules of the Nasdaq
National Market if, during the next 90 calendar days, the bid price of
Women.com's common stock was at least $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive
trading days. Women.com was unable to demonstrate compliance with the rules by
attaining the required minimum bid price for its common stock. On March 29,
2001, Women.com received written notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market that its
shares would be delisted from Nasdaq on April 6, 2001, unless Women.com
requests a hearing to appeal Nasdaq's determination to delist the Women.com
common stock. On April 11, 2001, Women.com received another letter from the
Nasdaq Stock Market raising an additional concern regarding Women.com's
continued listing due to Women.com's receipt of a "going concern"
qualification from its independent auditors. On April 20, 2001, Women.com
submitted a hearing request. According to the March 29th letter from Nasdaq,
this hearing request will stay the delisting of Women.com's common stock
pending the decision of the Nasdaq hearing panel. The hearing has been
scheduled for May 18, 2001.

   On April 20, 2001, iVillage received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market,
Inc. stating that iVillage had failed to maintain a minimum share bid price of
$1.00 for the previous 30 consecutive trading days, which is required for
continued listing on the Nasdaq National Market. iVillage will have until
July 19, 2001 to regain compliance with this continued listing requirement. If
at any time before July 19, 2001, the closing bid price of iVillage's common
stock is at least $1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days, Nasdaq
will determine if iVillage then complies with Nasdaq's continued listing
requirements. If iVillage is unable to demonstrate compliance with the
continued listing requirements on or before July 19, 2001, Nasdaq will provide
iVillage with written notification that its securities will be delisted.

Regulatory Approvals (Page 63)

   iVillage and Women.com do not believe that there are any material regulatory
or governmental approvals required to consummate the merger.

                                                      nominee, you will need to have your broker, custodian bank,

U.S. Income Tax Consequences (Page 143) ...........   The distribution of the rights to the stockholders of Women.com
                                                      should be treated as additional consideration received in the
                                                      merger in an amount equal to the fair market value of the
                                                      rights on the date of distribution. In that case, you will not
                                                      recognize any gain or loss upon the exercise of rights but will
                                                      generally recognize a capital loss equal to your tax basis in
                                                      the rights, if the rights expire unexercised.

                      UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

   We have set forth below information concerning net loss per share from
continuing operations, cash dividends declared and book value per share data
for Women.com and iVillage on both historical and pro forma bases and on a per
share equivalent pro forma basis for Women.com. We have derived the pro forma
net loss per share from continuing operations from the Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 133.
Women.com has not declared any cash dividends since the completion of its
initial public offering in October 1999 and iVillage has not declared any cash
dividends since the completion of its initial public offering in March 1999.
iVillage's management does not expect to pay cash dividends for the
foreseeable future after the completion of the merger. Basic and diluted net
loss per share from continuing operations and the book value per share for the
pro forma presentation is based upon outstanding shares of iVillage common
stock, adjusted to include the estimated number of shares of iVillage common
stock to be issued in the merger for outstanding shares of Women.com common
stock at the time the merger is completed and upon completion of the rights
offering. The per share equivalent pro forma data for shares of Women.com
common stock is based on the assumed conversion of each of the shares of
Women.com common stock into shares of iVillage common stock and issuance of
all the shares of common stock in connection with the rights offering.

   You should read the information set forth below in conjunction with the
respective audited and unaudited financial statements of iVillage and
Women.com included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the Unaudited
Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes
thereto beginning on page 133. See "Where You Can Find More Information"
beginning on page 157.

                                  RISK FACTORS

   In addition to the other information contained in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, you should carefully consider the following risk factors
before you decide how to vote on the proposed transactions and, if you are a
Women.com stockholder, whether to participate in the rights offering.

Risks Relating to the Merger

   Women.com stockholders may receive fewer shares of iVillage common stock or
iVillage may abandon the merger if Women.com does not have specified amounts of
cash and working capital on March 31, 2001.

   The number of shares of iVillage common stock that a Women.com stockholder
will receive for each share of Women.com common stock he or she holds will be
reduced if Women.com has less than $20.0 million of cash or less than $12.0
million of working capital on March 31, 2001. The merger agreement provides that
if there is a shortfall in these amounts and the shortfall does not exceed $4.0
million, the exchange ratio will be adjusted downward so that the aggregate
number of iVillage shares issued to Women.com stockholders will be decreased by
the number of shares of iVillage common stock equal to the greater of the
shortfall of cash or working capital, divided by $1.875. For example, if there
were a $4.0 million shortfall in either cash or working capital, the exchange
ratio would be reduced from 0.322 to 0.277.

   iVillage may terminate the merger and the rights offering if:

o  the shortfall in Women.com's cash or working capital is more than $4.0
   million on March 31, 2001; or

o  as of the day prior to the closing of the merger, Women.com's cash is less
   than the amount on hand as of March 31, 2001 less $166,666 per day for every
   day elapsed since March 31, 2001; or

o  Women.com's working capital immediately prior to the closing of the merger is
   materially less than the difference between the amount of working capital as
   of March 31, 2001 minus the reduction in Women.com's cash on hand since
   March 31, 2001.

   As required by the terms of the merger agreement, on April 2, 2001 Women.com
delivered to iVillage a statement of Women.com's estimated cash and working
capital as of March 31, 2001. According to this statement, Women.com had $20.2
million of cash and $19.1 million of working capital as of March 31, 2001.
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, iVillage is currently reviewing
the statement of cash and working capital and supporting material delivered by
Women.com and, two days prior to the closing of the merger, will deliver to
Women.com the final statement of working capital. There can be no assurance that
the final amounts of cash and working capital as of March 31, 2001 will not be
less than the amounts specified in the estimated statement delivered by
Women.com. Because the exchange ratio is subject to adjustment, you will not
know the exact number of shares of iVillage common stock and cash you will
receive in the merger when you send in your proxy card.

   Because the number of shares of iVillage common stock to be issued to
Women.com stockholders in the merger will not be adjusted to reflect changes
in the market price of iVillage common stock, if the market price of iVillage
common stock declines, the value of the merger consideration received by
Women.com stockholders will be reduced.

   Each Women.com stockholder will receive a fraction of a share of iVillage
common stock in exchange for each share of Women.com common stock that the
stockholder owns. The exchange ratio will not be adjusted based on changes in
the market prices of either iVillage or Women.com common stock. On April 26,
2001, the most recent practicable date before the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, iVillage common stock closed at $1.44 per share and
Women.com common stock closed at $0.30 per share. The value of the iVillage
shares that Women.com stockholders will receive in the merger will change as
the market price of iVillage common stock goes up or down prior to the
completion of the merger. In recent years, and particularly in recent months,
the stock market in general, and the market price of iVillage common stock in
particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations. Events or
circumstances specific to iVillage could cause the price of its common stock
to decline. The market price of iVillage common stock on and after the date of
the merger could be lower than the market price on the date of the merger
agreement, the current market price or the market price on the date of the
Women.com special stockholder meeting. Women.com stockholders should obtain
recent market quotations of iVillage common stock and Women.com common stock
before they vote on adoption of the merger agreement and before they decide
whether to participate in the rights offering.

   The following table illustrates the value of the consideration a holder of
100 shares of Women.com common stock would receive pursuant to the merger
agreement assuming various market prices of iVillage common stock.

(1) This assumes an exchange ratio of 0.322. If the exchange ratio is decreased,
    the total value of consideration you will receive will decrease.

(2) For the purpose of calculating the cash payment, it is assumed that the
    average of the high and low price of a share of iVillage common stock on
    the Nasdaq National Market will be equal to the market closing price on May
    23, 2001.  Because iVillage stock is volatile, the actual value of this
    additional cash payment may be higher or lower.

   iVillage common stock may be delisted and, if it is delisted, trading in
iVillage common stock would decrease substantially and the market price of
iVillage common stock may decline further.

   On April 20, 2001, iVillage received a letter from the Nasdaq National
Market, Inc. stating that iVillage had failed to maintain a minimum share bid
price of $1.00 for the previous 30 consecutive trading days, which is required
for continued listing on the Nasdaq National Market. iVillage will have until
July 19, 2001 to regain compliance with this continued listing requirement. If
at any time before July 19, 2001, the closing bid price of iVillage's common
stock is at least $1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days, Nasdaq
will determine if iVillage then complies with Nasdaq's continued listing
requirements. If iVillage is unable to demonstrate

compliance with the continued listing requirements on or before July 19, 2001,
Nasdaq will provide iVillage with written notification that its securities
will be delisted. At that time, iVillage may appeal the Nasdaq staff's
decision to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel. If iVillage common stock is
delisted from trading, the market price of iVillage common stock may decline
further, possibly to zero, and it may have a material adverse effect on the
ability of iVillage's stockholders to sell their shares. The delisting of
iVillage's common stock would also make it more difficult for iVillage to
raise additional financing.

   It is a condition to the merger that the shares of iVillage common stock
issuable pursuant to the merger be authorized for listing on the Nasdaq
National Market, subject to official notice of issuance.  Accordingly, if
iVillage is delisted prior to completion of the merger, such condition will
not be satisfied and the merger may not be completed, which could have a
material adverse effect on iVillage's business and operations.

   The market price of iVillage common stock may decline after completion of
the merger.

   The market price of iVillage common stock may decline after completion of
the merger if:

   o the integration of the business and operations of Women.com is
     unsuccessful or takes longer than anticipated;

   o the effect of the merger on the combined company's financial results is
     not consistent with the expectations of securities analysts or investors;

   o iVillage does not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as rapidly
     as, or to the extent, anticipated by securities analysts or investors; or

   o following the merger, significant stockholders of iVillage decide to
     dispose of their shares because the results of the merger are not
     consistent with their expectations.

   The warrants that a Women.com stockholder will receive if he or she
participates in the rights offering will be worthless if the price of iVillage
common stock does not exceed $3.75 prior to December 31, 2004 and remain at
that level for 15 consecutive trading days.

   The closing price of iVillage common stock on April 25, 2001 was $1.18 per
share. If you were a Women.com stockholder on April 16, 2001 and you elect to
participate in the rights offering, the warrants that you receive in the
rights offering will be worthless unless the price per share of iVillage
common stock exceeds $3.75 per share for fifteen consecutive trading days
prior to December 31, 2004. Based on the April 25, 2001 closing price of $1.18
per share, iVillage common stock would have to increase by over 217%, and
remain at that level for 15 consecutive trading days, prior to December 31,
2004 in order for the warrants to have any value. Even if this extreme price
appreciation were to be realized, there can be no assurance that the trading
price of iVillage common stock would remain in excess of $3.75 at the time a
participant in the rights offering elects to sell the shares of iVillage
common stock acquired upon exercise of a warrant. Furthermore, if the price of
iVillage common stock does exceed $3.75 for 15 consecutive trading days, it is
possible that Hearst Communications and holders of the warrants issued in the
rights offering will seek to exercise their warrants and sell the underlying
shares as soon as practicable, and those sales may result in a decline in the
trading price of iVillage common stock.

   In attempting to integrate the business and technology of Women.com,
iVillage will incur significant costs which may harm its business.

   iVillage expects to incur costs and commit significant management time
integrating Women.com's operations, technology, Web sites, products, customers
and personnel. These costs may be substantial and may include costs for:

   o integration of operations, including combining teams and processes in
     various functional areas;

   o reorganization or closure of operations and/or facilities, including the
     cost of office space that iVillage is unable to sublease;

   o integration of technology, Web sites and products;

   o fees and expenses of professionals and consultants involved in completing
     the integration process; and

   o potential existing liabilities of Women.com.

   Successful integration of Women.com's operations, technology, Web sites,
products, customers and personnel will place a significant burden on the
management and internal resources of the combined company. The diversion of
the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition
and integration process could have a material adverse effect on the future
business, financial condition and operating results of the combined company.

   If iVillage does not successfully integrate the business and operations of
Women.com, iVillage's financial results and its ability to achieve
profitability will be adversely affected.

   Upon the closing of the merger, iVillage will commence the integration of
Women.com's operations, technology, Web sites, products, customers and
personnel. iVillage will strive to maintain the companies' relationships with
key customers and joint venturers. Integration efforts may be difficult and
unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on
strategic plans, personnel and other decisions. Integration may be made more
difficult because iVillage's operations are centered in New York while
Women.com's operations are centered in California. iVillage does not know
whether it will be successful in these integration efforts and it cannot
assure you that it will be able to integrate the business and operations of
Women.com in a timely and efficient manner. If iVillage cannot successfully
integrate Women.com's operations, technology, Web sites, products, customers
and personnel and maintain its and Women.com's relationships with key
customers and joint venturers, the business, financial condition and results
of operations of the combined company may be seriously harmed.

   Women.com's officers and directors have interests that may influence them to
support and approve the merger.

   The directors and officers of Women.com have interests in the merger that
may be different from, or in addition to, those of the Women.com stockholders,
including the following:

   o as of January 31, 2001, the officers and directors of Women.com own stock
     options to purchase an aggregate of 3,028,293 shares of Women.com common
     stock that will be converted into options to purchase shares of iVillage
     common stock at the time of the merger;

   o several officers of Women.com may receive severance or retention payments
     in connection with the merger under a severance and retention plan of up
     to $5 million that is currently being finalized;

   o iVillage has agreed to maintain directors and officers' insurance for the
     current directors and officers of Women.com for six years and to preserve
     for the same period the rights to indemnification of the current and
     former directors, officers and employees of Women.com; and

   o four of the members of the Women.com board of directors are serving in
     that capacity as representatives of Hearst Communications and, in
     connection with the merger, Hearst Communications has entered into an
     amended and restated securities purchase agreement with iVillage and, as
     a condition to the closing of the merger, will enter into a stockholder
     agreement and a magazine content license and hosting agreement with
     iVillage. See "Agreements between Hearst Communications and iVillage" for
     more information regarding these agreements.

   For the above reasons, the directors and officers of Women.com could be more
likely to vote to approve the merger agreement than if they did not have these
interests. Women.com stockholders should consider whether these interests may
have influenced these directors and officers to support or recommend the
merger.

   You should read this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully and
not consider any particular statement in published news reports or interviews
regarding the merger or the rights offering without carefully considering the
risks and other information contained herein.

   iVillage's Chief Executive Officer, Doug McCormick, has participated in
interviews with the press regarding the merger and the transcripts of these
interviews have been made available to the public by various news services.
For example, interviews of Mr. McCormick appeared on CNNfn: Market Call  on
February 6, 2001 and in siliconalleydaily.com on March 29 and March 30, 2001.
In the course of these interviews, Mr. McCormick made statements regarding the
viability of the combined company and potential profitability from

Internet advertising. These statements were made in isolation and did not
disclose the related risks and uncertainties described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. As a result, these statements should not be considered
in isolation and you should not make any decision regarding the merger or, if
you are a Women.com stockholder, the rights offering, without reading this
entire joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully.

   Management of iVillage has also publicly stated that they project iVillage's
EBITDA, or earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization, to be
positive by the third quarter of 2001. iVillage's projection that its EBITDA,
or earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization, will be
positive by the third quarter of 2001 is primarily based on internal estimates
of revenue growth and declining operating expenses during future periods which
reflect a generally positive trend towards EBITDA profitability over the last
several years. In addition, iVillage has not released forward-looking
information regarding specific revenue or expense estimates for the third
quarter of 2001 to the public due to the inherent uncertainties, contingencies
and risks, some of which are beyond iVillage's control, associated with making
projections that far into the future. As a result, there can be no assurance
that iVillage will attain EBITDA profitability in the third quarter of 2001,
if at all.

   Although, as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
management of iVillage continues to have this projection, this projection is
based upon a number of estimates and assumptions and is inherently subject to
significant uncertainties and contingencies, including the possibility that
costs or difficulties related to the integration of Women.com and iVillage
will be greater than expected, the possibility that the anticipated benefits
of the merger will not be fully realized, the volatile and competitive nature
of the Internet industry and the other factors discussed below in the section
titled "Forward-Looking Statements." Projections are necessarily speculative
in nature, and it can be expected that one or more of the estimates on which
the EBITDA projection was based will not materialize or will vary
significantly from actual results. For these reasons, you should not consider
the EBITDA projection and other projections regarding iVillage and you should
only consider the information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
including the risks described in this section and throughout this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

   Following the merger, Hearst Communications is expected to own approximately
30.0% of the outstanding shares of iVillage common stock and will have three
representatives on the iVillage board of directors, and therefore Hearst
Communications will be able to significantly influence iVillage's corporate
direction and policies.

   Following the merger, Hearst Communications is expected to own approximately
30.0% of the outstanding shares of iVillage common stock. This assumption
assumes that:

   o no Women.com stockholders participate in the rights offering;

   o Hearst Communications is not required to, and does not elect to, purchase
     additional iVillage common stock pursuant to the merger agreement; and

   o there are 54,228,025 shares of iVillage common stock outstanding after
     the merger.

   In addition:

   o  if the actual cash and working capital of Women.com as of March 31, 2001
      is less than $20.0 million of cash and $12.0 million of working capital,
      then Hearst Communications would have the option to purchase additional
      shares of iVillage common stock in an amount equal to the amount of the
      shortfall up to $2.0 million divided by $1.875; or

   o  if the shortfall is more than $2.0 million as of March 31, 2001, but less
      than $4.0 million, then Hearst Communications must purchase additional
      shares of iVillage common stock pursuant to the merger agreement for the
      amount of the shortfall which exceeds $2.0 million, and Hearst
      Communications will have the option to purchase shares with respect to the
      additional $2.0 million shortfall amount.

   In addition, if Women.com stockholders holding in excess of two percent of
the shares of Women.com outstanding on April 16, 2001 exercise dissenters'
rights under Delaware law then Hearst Communications would be required, if
requested by iVillage, to purchase additional shares of iVillage common stock.

   Any shares of iVillage common stock purchased by Hearst as a result of a cash
or working capital shortfall would be purchased at a per share price of $1.875.
If Hearst Communications is required to purchase additional shares of iVillage
common stock because Women.com stockholders holding in excess of two percent of
the shares of Women.com outstanding on April 16, 2001 exercise dissenters'
rights under Delaware law, those shares would also be purchased at a per share
price of $1.875. The number of shares so purchased would be calculated by
multiplying the number of Women.com shares associated with the exercise of
appraisal rights in excess of the two percent threshold by the 0.322 exchange
ratio (subject to adjustment) rounded down to the nearest whole share.

   In addition, Hearst Communications will hold a warrant entitling it to
purchase up to 2,100,000 shares of iVillage common stock, less the number of
shares of iVillage common stock represented by warrants subscribed for by the
other stockholders of Women.com in the rights offering.

   Hearst Communications has agreed not to participate in the rights offering.
Accordingly, any shares of iVillage common stock that Hearst Communications
acquires from iVillage will be shares which are acquired either pursuant to
the merger agreement or the amended and restated securities purchase
agreement.

   Pursuant to a stockholder agreement to be entered into between iVillage and
Hearst Communications, iVillage must appoint three representatives of Hearst
Communications to iVillage's board of directors, with one Hearst
Communications designee appointed to each class of director. The stockholder
agreement provides that the number of Hearst Communications' representatives
is subject to reduction if Hearst Communications' ownership of iVillage common
stock falls below certain threshold levels. There will also be a Hearst
Communications representative on each of the iVillage nominating and
compensation committees.

   Hearst Communications' board representation and stock ownership will allow
Hearst Communications to significantly influence iVillage's corporate
direction and policies, including any mergers, acquisitions, consolidations,
strategic relationships or sales of assets. This board representation and
stock ownership may also discourage or prevent transactions involving an
actual or potential change of control, including transactions in which
iVillage stockholders would otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In
addition, the interests of Hearst Communications, which owns or has
significant investments in other businesses, including cable television
networks, newspapers, magazines and electronic media, may from time to time be
competitive with, or otherwise diverge from, iVillage's interests,
particularly with respect to new business opportunities and future
acquisitions.

   Although Hearst Communications is required to vote all shares that it holds
in excess of 25% (subject to adjustment) of iVillage's voting securities in
accordance with the recommendation of the iVillage board of directors, Hearst
Communications may effectively control stockholder actions, including
approving changes to iVillage's certificate of incorporation or bylaws and
adopting or changing equity incentive plans. Hearst Communications' effective
control over stockholder actions may also determine the outcome of any merger,
consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of iVillage's assets or other
form of change of control that iVillage might consider. See "Agreements
between Hearst Communications and iVillage" for additional information
regarding the matters addressed above.

   Although Hearst Communications has entered into an amended and restated
securities purchase agreement with iVillage which provides for an investment
in iVillage by Hearst Communications of up to $20.0 million, it is possible
that the merger between iVillage and Women.com could close without any
investment by Hearst Communications.

   iVillage and Hearst Communications have entered into an amended and restated
securities purchase agreement which provides for an investment by Hearst
Communications of up to $20.0 million in return for up to 9,324,000 shares of
iVillage common stock and a warrant to purchase up to 2,100,000 shares of
iVillage common stock. One of the conditions to the closing of the investment
contemplated by this agreement is that the merger between iVillage and
Women.com shall have become effective. Since the merger must be completed
before Hearst Communications is obligated to make its investment, it is
possible that, following the merger, no investment would be made by Hearst
Communications. This  could happen, for example, if iVillage is unable to
satisfy its conditions to the closing set forth in the amended and  restated
securities purchase agreement or if, after completion of the merger, Hearst
Communications and iVillage mutually agree to terminate the amended and
restated securities purchase agreement. The absence of the investment by
Hearst Communications following the merger would have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the post-merger
combined company. Women.com's board of directors evaluated the proposed
transaction as a whole, including the proposed investment by Hearst
Communications, and did not ask its financial advisors, Salomon Smith Barney,
to analyze the merger consideration without taking into account the Hearst
Communications investment. Therefore, the Salomon Smith Barney opinion does
not address the possibility that the merger could occur without the Hearst
Communications investment. iVillage's board of directors also evaluated the
proposed transaction as a whole, including the investment by Hearst
Communications, and did not ask Allen & Company Incorporated, its financial
advisor, to evaluate the fairness of the merger absent the investment by
Hearst Communications. Therefore, the Allen & Company opinion also does not
address the possibility that the merger could occur without the Hearst
Communications investment.

   Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the businesses of
iVillage and Women.com and the market prices of iVillage and Women.com common
stock.

   If the merger is not completed for any reason, iVillage and Women.com will
be subject to a number of risks that may affect their respective businesses
and stock prices, including:

   o Women.com could be required to pay iVillage a $1.0 million termination
     fee, or iVillage could be required to pay Women.com a $1.0 million
     termination fee;

   o the market prices of shares of iVillage common stock and Women.com common
     stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of those
     shares reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed;

   o costs related to the merger, such as legal and accounting fees and a
     portion of the investment banking fees, must be paid even if the merger
     is not completed;

   o the benefits that iVillage expects to realize from the merger would not
     be realized; and

   o the diversion of management attention from the day-to-day business of
     iVillage and Women.com and the unavoidable disruption to their employees
     and their relationships with customers and joint venturers during the
     period before consummation of the merger, may make it difficult for the
     companies to regain their market positions if the merger does not occur.

   In addition, as a result of the announcement of the proposed merger with
iVillage, numerous advertisers have informed Women.com of their intent to
delay current and future advertising on the Women.com network until the merger
is completed. Accordingly, Women.com expects its advertising revenues to
decrease significantly. If the merger is not completed and Women.com continues
to operate as an independent company, advertisers that have delayed current or
future advertising may choose to discontinue advertising on Women.com's
network entirely, which would significantly harm Women.com's business.

   If the merger agreement is terminated and Women.com's board of directors
seeks another merger or business combination, Women.com's stockholders cannot
be certain that Women.com will be able to find another company willing to pay
an equivalent or more attractive price than the price to be paid by iVillage
in the merger.

   As a result of questions concerning Women.com's status as a going concern,
Women.com's advertising customers may decide not to do business with
Women.com.

   Women.com's independent certified accountants have included a going concern
qualification in their audit opinion. This qualification states that Women.com
has suffered recurring losses from operations which raise substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. The factors leading to the
going concern qualification have in the past adversely affected, and are
likely to continue to adversely affect, Women.com's ability to obtain new
advertising commitments and continue existing advertising commitments. The
loss of existing advertising commitments and the inability to obtain new
advertising commitments would significantly harm Women.com's business.

Risks Relating to the Combined Company Following the Merger

   Both iVillage and Women.com have limited operating histories and the
combined company will face difficulties encountered in the new and rapidly
evolving markets in which it will operate.

   Both iVillage and Women.com have limited operating histories and face many
of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered in new and rapidly
evolving markets, including the Internet advertising market. As a company
operating in these markets, the combined company following the merger will
face risks and difficulties related to its ability to:

   o attract a larger audience to iVillage.com;

   o increase awareness of the iVillage brand;

   o strengthen user loyalty;

   o offer compelling content;

   o maintain current, and develop new, strategic relationships;

   o attract a large number of advertisers from a variety of industries;

   o respond effectively to competitive pressures;

   o continue to develop and upgrade iVillage's technology; and

   o attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.

   Neither iVillage nor Women.com has achieved profitability and both have
recent and anticipated continuing losses.

   Neither iVillage nor Women.com has achieved profitability and iVillage
expects the combined company to continue to incur operating losses for the
foreseeable future. iVillage incurred net losses attributable to common
stockholders of $191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, $116.6
million for the year ended December 31, 1999 and $43.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 1998. Women.com incurred net losses attributable to common
stockholders of $121.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, $57.1
million for the year ended December 31, 1999 and $13.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 1998. As of December 31, 2000, iVillage's accumulated
deficit was $384.3 million and Women.com's accumulated deficit was $204.2
million. iVillage expects to continue to incur significant operating and
capital expenditures and, as a result, it will need to generate significant
revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. Women.com also expects to
incur significant operating losses and negative cash flows for at least the
next several years.

   Although iVillage's revenues have generally grown in recent quarters, there
can be no assurance that it, or the combined company following the merger,
will achieve sufficient revenues for profitability. Even if the combined
company does achieve profitability, there can be no assurance that it will be
able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If
revenues grow slower than iVillage anticipates, or if operating expenses
exceed iVillage's expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly, its
business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and
adversely affected. Because iVillage's strategy includes acquisitions of and
joint ventures with other businesses, acquisition and joint venture expenses
and any cash used to make these acquisitions and joint ventures will reduce
its available cash.

   iVillage's and Women.com's quarterly revenues and operating results are not
indicative of future performance, are difficult to forecast and have been and
are likely to continue to fluctuate.

   As a result of iVillage's and Women.com's limited operating history, neither
company has historical financial data for a significant number of periods upon
which to forecast quarterly revenues and results of operations. iVillage does
not believe that period-to-period comparisons of its operating results are
necessarily meaningful nor should they be relied upon as reliable indicators
of future performance. In addition, the operating results of the combined
company are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a
result of several factors, many of which are outside iVillage's control, and
any of which could materially harm the business of the combined company. These
factors include:

   o fluctuations in the demand for Internet advertising or electronic
     commerce;

   o bankruptcies or other payment default of Internet companies which are a
     source of advertising revenues;

   o changes in the level of traffic on its network; and

   o fluctuations in marketing expenses and technology infrastructure costs.

   iVillage's revenues for the foreseeable future will remain dependent on user
traffic levels and advertising activity on its Web sites. Future revenues are
difficult to forecast. iVillage plans to expand and develop content, and to
upgrade and enhance its technology and infrastructure development in order to
support its growth. iVillage may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough
to offset any unexpected reduction in revenues in a particular quarter, which
may materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations and
financial condition.

   In one or more future quarters, iVillage's results of operations may fall
below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. If iVillage's
results of operations fall below expectations, the trading price of its common
stock would likely be materially adversely affected. In addition, if the
revenues of iVillage in any particular

quarter are lower than anticipated, iVillage may be unable to reduce spending
in that quarter. If iVillage has a shortfall in revenues in relation to its
expenses, then iVillage's business, results of operations and financial
condition would be materially and adversely affected.

   The combined company may need to raise additional capital and its prospects
for obtaining additional financing are uncertain.

   iVillage currently anticipates that its existing cash and cash equivalents
will be sufficient to meet its anticipated capital expenditures and working
capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. Women.com believes
that its existing cash and cash equivalents may not be sufficient to meet its
anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements beyond June
30, 2001. The amount of cash and cash equivalents that will be available to
the combined company upon completion of the merger cannot be accurately
predicted and depends on many factors, including the amount of revenues
received and expenses incurred by each company during the period prior to the
date on which the merger is completed. Accordingly, the combined company may
need to raise additional funds in the near future to fund its operations.
There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to the
combined company on acceptable terms, or at all. In particular, unless the
market price of iVillage's common stock increases dramatically, it is unlikely
that the combined company will be able to raise funds through a public
offering of its common stock. If adequate funds are not available or are not
available on acceptable terms, the combined company would have to scale back
its business and its business and financial condition would be harmed, or it
may be forced to cease its operations entirely.

   iVillage's business will be harmed if Internet usage does not continue to
grow.

   iVillage's market is new and rapidly evolving. iVillage's business would be
adversely affected if Internet usage does not continue to grow, particularly
usage by women. A number of factors may inhibit Internet usage, including:

   o inadequate network infrastructure;

   o security concerns;

   o inconsistent quality of service;

   o lack of availability of cost-effective, high-speed service;

   o consumers returning to traditional or alternative sources for
     information, shopping and services; and

   o privacy concerns, including those related to the ability of Web sites to
     gather information about users without their knowledge or consent.

   If Internet usage continues to grow significantly, the Internet
infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this
growth and its performance and reliability may decline. In addition, Web sites
have experienced interruptions in their services as a result of outages and
other delays occurring throughout the Internet network infrastructure. If
these outages and delays frequently occur in the future, Internet usage,
including the usage of iVillage Web sites, could grow more slowly or decline.

   The market for Internet advertising is still developing. If the Internet
fails to gain further acceptance as a medium for advertising, the combined
company would have slower revenue growth than expected and would incur greater
than expected losses.

   iVillage expects to continue to derive a substantial portion of its revenues
from sponsorships and advertising for the foreseeable future, as demand and
market acceptance for Internet advertising continues to develop. Accordingly,
iVillage's business depends on market acceptance of the Internet as a medium
for advertising.

   Although there are currently several standards for the measurement of the
effectiveness of Internet advertising, the industry has had difficulty
convincing potential advertisers that Internet advertising is a significant
advertising medium. Advertisers and advertising agencies that have
historically relied on traditional forms of advertising may be reluctant or
slow to adopt online advertising. In addition, advertisers and advertising
agencies that use the Internet as an advertising medium may find online
advertising to be less effective for promoting their products and services
than traditional advertising media, including television, radio and print.
Advertisers and advertising agencies that have invested substantial resources
in traditional methods of advertising

may also be reluctant to reallocate their resources to online advertising.
Moreover, software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being
delivered to an Internet user's computer are available. Widespread adoption of
this software could adversely affect the commercial viability of Internet
advertising. The market for online advertising also depends on the overall
growth and acceptance of electronic commerce. If the markets for online
advertising and electronic commerce fail to develop or develop more slowly
than iVillage expects, or if iVillage is unable to adapt to new forms of
Internet advertising, iVillage would have slower than expected revenue growth
and would incur greater than expected losses, and iVillage's business and
financial condition would be harmed.

   Furthermore, different pricing models are used to sell advertising on the
Internet and it is difficult to predict which, if any, of the models will
emerge as the industry standard. This makes it difficult to project iVillage's
future advertising rates and revenues.

   iVillage has a small number of advertisers and the loss of a number of these
advertisers could adversely affect its financial condition and results of
operations.

   iVillage depends on a small number of advertisers for a significant portion
of its revenues. In 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively, revenues from
iVillage's five largest advertisers accounted for approximately 23%, 20%, and
20% of total revenues; however, no one advertiser accounted for greater than
10% of total revenues. At December 31, 2000, Ford Motor Media accounted for
approximately 11% of the net accounts receivable. At December 31, 1999, no
advertiser accounted for greater than 10% of the net accounts receivable.
iVillage anticipates that after the completion of the merger its results of
operations in any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent
upon revenues from a small number of advertisers. In addition, iVillage's
largest advertisers have in the past varied over time, and iVillage
anticipates that they will continue to do so in the future.

   Consequently, the loss of even a small number of its largest advertisers at
any one time may adversely affect iVillage's business, financial condition and
results of operations, unless iVillage is able to enter into a sufficient
number of new comparable contracts.

   iVillage may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change in its
industry.

   iVillage's market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies,
frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry
standards. The recent growth of the Internet and intense competition in
iVillage's industry exacerbate these market characteristics. To achieve its
goals, iVillage needs to effectively integrate the various software programs
and tools required to enhance and improve its product offerings and manage its
business. iVillage's future success will depend on its ability to adapt to
rapidly changing technologies by continually improving the performance
features and reliability of its services. iVillage may experience difficulties
that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or
marketing of new products and services. In addition, iVillage's new
enhancements must meet the requirements of its current and prospective users
and must achieve significant market acceptance. iVillage also could incur
substantial costs if it needs to modify its services or infrastructures to
adapt to these changes.

   Seasonal and cyclical patterns may adversely affect iVillage's business.

   iVillage believes that advertising sales in traditional media, such as
television and radio, generally are lower in the first and third calendar
quarters of each year. If iVillage's market makes the transition from an
emerging to a more developed market, seasonal and cyclical patterns may
develop also in its market, which, if similar to those in traditional media,
may result in lower advertising revenues in the first and third calendar
quarters of each year. In addition, traffic levels on iVillage's Web sites
typically fluctuate during the summer and year-end vacation and holiday
periods.

   These seasonal and cyclical patterns may adversely affect iVillage's
business, financial condition and results of operations.

   iVillage's uncertain sales cycles could adversely affect its business.

   The time between the date of initial contact with a potential advertiser or
sponsor and the execution of a contract with the advertiser or sponsor is
often lengthy, typically six weeks for smaller agreements and longer for
larger agreements, and is subject to delays over which iVillage has little or
no control, including:

   o advertisers' and sponsors' budgetary constraints;

   o advertisers' and sponsors' internal acceptance reviews;

   o the success and continued internal support of advertisers' and sponsors'
     own development efforts; and

   o the possibility of cancellation or delay of projects by advertisers or
     sponsors.

   During the sales cycle, iVillage may expend substantial funds and management
resources and yet not obtain sponsorship or advertising revenues. Accordingly,
iVillage's results of operations for a particular period may be adversely
affected if sales to advertisers or sponsors forecasted in a particular period
are delayed or do not otherwise occur.

   iVillage relies on third parties to adequately measure the demographics of
its user base and delivery of advertisements on its Web sites. iVillage's
business would be harmed if these third parties fail to provide this service
to iVillage.

   It is important to iVillage advertisers that iVillage accurately measures
the demographics of its user base and the delivery of advertisements on its
Web site. iVillage depends on third parties to provide many of these
measurement services. If these third parties are unable or unwilling to
provide these services to iVillage in the future, iVillage would need to
perform them itself or obtain them from another provider. This could cause
iVillage to incur additional costs or cause interruptions in its business
until it replaces these services. Companies may choose to not advertise on
iVillage Web sites or may pay less for advertising if they perceive iVillage's
demographic measurements are not reliable. Either of these events would
adversely affect iVillage's business.

   Both iVillage and Women.com rely on third parties to drive traffic to their
sites and generate page views, and the business and financial condition of the
combined company would be harmed if these third parties were to no longer
provide this service.

   America Online has accounted for a significant portion of iVillage's online
traffic based on the delivery to iVillage of a guaranteed number of
impressions. Although it is difficult to measure, iVillage believes that
America Online accounts for in excess of 15% of iVillage's online traffic.
iVillage's agreement with America Online does not prohibit America Online from
carrying online sites or developing and providing content that compete with
iVillage's sites, and America Online currently carries competing Web sites.
Although iVillage's agreement with America Online expired on December 31,
2000, it is subject to extension by either party for one year and iVillage is
currently negotiating a new agreement with America Online and, in the interim,
iVillage and America Online have extended the agreement on a monthly basis.
See also "America Online's investments in iVillage competitors may result in
conflicts of interest for America Online that could be adverse to iVillage"
below.

   Women.com relies on its Astronet site to generate a significant portion of
its page views and Astronet depends on America Online for traffic. During the
year ended December 31, 2000, approximately 21% of Women.com's page views were
generated by Astronet and, during that same period, approximately 45% of
Astronet's traffic was generated by America Online. Women.com's business would
be materially harmed if America Online stops carrying Women.com's Astronet
site.

   If America Online discontinues carrying iVillage channels or Women.com's
Astronet site, the combined company's business, results of operations and
financial condition would be materially adversely affected.

   iVillage may not be able to deliver various services if third parties fail
to provide reliable software, systems and related services to it.

   iVillage is dependent on various third parties for software, systems and
related services. For example, iVillage relies on Doubleclick Inc.'s software
for the placement of advertisements, Trellix Corporation for personal space
home pages and Critical Path Inc. for e-mail. Several of the third parties
which provide software and services to iVillage have a limited operating
history, have relatively immature technology and are themselves dependent on
reliable delivery of services from others. As a result, iVillage's ability to
deliver various services to its users may be adversely affected by the failure
of these third parties to provide reliable software, systems and related
services to it.

   America Online's investments in iVillage competitors may result in conflicts
of interest for America Online that could be adverse to iVillage.

   America Online, which has accounted for a significant portion of iVillage's
online traffic, has invested in Oxygen Media, an Internet and television
company that is developing cable and interactive content for women and
children. In addition, Oxygen Media has acquired from America Online the
assets of electra.com, an online women's network, and Thrive Partners LLC, the
operator of thriveonline.com, a health web site, and entered into a television
distribution agreement with AOL Time Warner. As of April 16, 2001, America
Online owned approximately 8.4% of the outstanding common stock of iVillage.
After the merger, America Online is expected to own approximately 4.6% of the
outstanding common stock of iVillage. The relationship between America Online
and Oxygen Media and the relationship between America Online and iVillage may
result in a conflict of interest for America Online, which could adversely
effect iVillage's relationship with America Online, adversely effect current
negotiations of a new agreement with America Online or result in the diversion
of attractive business opportunities from America Online to an entity other
than iVillage. Other principal investors in iVillage, such as NBC, Rho
Management Company, Inc. and, after the merger, Hearst Communications, may
have similar conflicts of interests by virtue of their other investments. For
example, NBC has invested in NBCi.com, an interactive Web site which competes
with iVillage for advertisers, users, content and strategic partners. iVillage
is unable to determine what other competing investments these principal
investors may have since none have publicly disclosed, or otherwise informed
iVillage, of the scope or subject of their specific other Internet or media-
related investments, particularly since both Rho Management Company and Hearst
Communications are privately-held companies. In addition, iVillage does not
have the ability to constrain the investment activity of any of its principal
investors and therefore cannot predict the extent of any future investments in
businesses that are competitive with iVillage.

   Women.com's business relies on Hearst Communications for content and cross-
promotion and loss of that relationship would harm the combined company's
business.

   Information supplied by or developed from the Hearst magazines to which
Women.com has online rights accounts for a significant portion of its current
network's content. Women.com also depends on Hearst Communications to assist
with the effective marketing and promotion of various Hearst magazine sites
that have been part of the Women.com network.

   After the merger, the combined company and Hearst Communications will be
parties to a magazine content license and hosting agreement originally entered
into between Women.com and Hearst Communications and to be assumed by iVillage
in connection with the merger. While this agreement will continue to provide
iVillage with the Hearst Communications content and cross-promotion services
during a three-year term, iVillage may not enjoy these services beyond that
term unless the term is extended. In addition to the content and cross-
promotion services, iVillage may upon termination of the magazine content
license and hosting agreement lose other benefits that Women.com has derived
from its relationship with Hearst Communications, including experience within
the media industry provided by the Hearst Communications representatives on
the board of directors, Hearst Communications' financial and capital resources
and the value created by Hearst Communications' strong magazine brand names.
If the relationship with Hearst Communications were to end the combined
company may not be able to enter into alternative arrangements with third
parties or internally develop the content and cross-promotion services to
replace those derived from the relationship with Hearst Communications.

   In addition, Women.com has relied and the combined company is expected to
rely on Hearst Communications to maintain the quality of its magazine content
and to maintain and expand its magazines' readership base. If the quality or
circulation of Hearst's magazines declines, the content of the combined
company's network would suffer and its business, financial condition and
results of operations could be materially harmed.

   Restrictions on iVillage's ability to enter into sponsorship, advertising or
other business relationships with Hearst Communications' competitors may
adversely affect iVillage's business.

   In connection with the merger, iVillage will assume a magazine content
license and hosting agreement originally entered into between Women.com and
Hearst Communications. That agreement restricts iVillage's ability to enter
into relationships with competitors of Hearst Communications and those
restrictions may prevent

iVillage from expanding its network and enhancing its content and the
visibility of its brand and may cause it to forego potential advertising
revenues from competitors of Hearst Communications. Specifically, the
agreement provides that iVillage may not, without Hearst Communications'
consent:

   o enter into any agreement to include in iVillage's network any Web sites
     for magazines that compete with Hearst Communications magazines;

   o display on the magazine Web sites any advertising or other promotional
     materials from magazines that compete with Hearst Communications
     magazines; or

   o display on an iVillage Web page the brands, logos, trademarks or
     proprietary content of both Hearst Communications and a Hearst
     Communications competitor.

   If iVillage fails to manage its growth effectively, its business and
financial condition could be harmed.

   If iVillage is unable to manage its growth effectively, its business could
be adversely affected. iVillage has experienced and continues to experience
significant growth, both internally and through acquisitions and joint
ventures. This growth has placed, and the proposed merger with Women.com and
iVillage's anticipated future growth in its operations will continue to place,
a significant strain on iVillage's resources. As part of this growth, iVillage
will have to implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and
controls. iVillage's business would be harmed if it is unable to implement
these new systems in a timely and effective manner.

   iVillage may not be able to expand its business through acquisitions and
joint ventures if it is unable to compete successfully for acquisition
candidates and/or joint venture partners and, even if it is successful in this
regard, iVillage's operations may be adversely effected as a result of an
acquisition or joint venture.

   iVillage's business strategy includes growth through business combinations,
acquisitions and joint ventures. iVillage's business could be harmed if it is
unable to implement this business strategy. iVillage's ability to implement
this business strategy depends in large part on its ability to compete
successfully with other entities for acquisition candidates and joint venture
partners. Factors impacting iVillage's ability to compete successfully in this
regard include:

   o iVillage's financial condition relative to the financial condition of its
     competitors; and

   o the attractiveness of iVillage's common stock as potential consideration
     for entering into these types of transactions as compared to the common
     stock of the other entities competing for these opportunities.

   Many of the entities with which iVillage competes for acquisition candidates
and joint venture partners have greater financial resources than those of
iVillage. In addition, iVillage's acquisition program has been materially
adversely effected by the material decline in the market price of iVillage's
common stock. The potential delisting of iVillage's common stock from the
Nasdaq National Market will likely also materially and adversely impact
iVillage's ability to complete future business combinations, acquisitions and
joint ventures.

   If, despite these factors, iVillage is successful in entering into
additional business combinations, acquisitions and joint ventures, its
business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially
and adversely effected if it is unable to integrate the operations of the
acquired companies or joint ventures. iVillage's ability to integrate the
operations of the acquired companies or joint ventures will depend, in part,
on its ability to overcome or address:

   o the difficulties of assimilating the operations and personnel of the
     acquired companies or joint venture entities, and the potential
     disruption of iVillage's ongoing business as a result of these
     assimilation efforts;

   o the difficulties of establishing a new joint venture, including the need
     to attract and retain qualified personnel and the need to attract
     customers and advertisers;

   o the need to incorporate successfully the acquired or shared technology or
     content and rights into iVillage's products and media properties;

   o the difficulties of maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures
     and policies; and

   o the potential impairment of relationships with employees and customers as
     a result of any integration of new management personnel or reduction of
     personnel.

   Acquisitions and joint ventures could also result in additional expenses
associated with the amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential
liabilities associated with the acquired businesses or joint ventures.

   There is intense competition among Internet-based businesses and publishing
companies focused on women and this competition could result in price
reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share.

   The number of Web sites competing for the attention and spending of members,
users and advertisers has increased and iVillage expects it to continue to
increase. iVillage's Web sites compete for members, users and advertisers with
the following types of companies:

   o online services or Web sites targeted at women, such as Oxygen.com and
     condenet.com;

   o cable networks targeting women, such as Oxygen Media, Inc. and Lifetime
     Television;

   o Web search and retrieval and other online service companies, commonly
     referred to as portals, such as America Online, Inc., Terra Networks,
     S.A. and Yahoo! Inc.;

   o e-commerce companies such as Amazon.com; and

   o publishers and distributors of traditional media, such as television,
     radio and print.

   Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins or
loss of market share, any of which could adversely affect iVillage's business,
results of operations and financial condition.

   Lamaze Publishing's magazines directly compete with publishers of pre- and
post-natal publications such as Gruner and Jahr, Primedia and AOL Time Warner.
These publishers have substantially greater marketing, research and financial
resources than Lamaze Publishing. Increased competition may result in less
advertising in Lamaze Publishing's magazines and a decline in Lamaze
Publishing's advertising rates, which could adversely affect its business,
results of operations and financial condition.

   The business of the combined company would be harmed if its systems fail or
experience a slowdown.

   Substantially all of iVillage's communications hardware and some of its
other computer hardware operations are located at Exodus Communications,
Inc.'s facilities in New Jersey and Verio, Inc.'s facilities in California.
Fire, floods, earthquakes, power loss (including as a result of rolling
blackouts), telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events could
damage these systems. These events could also damage the systems used by
Women.com. For example, in May and June 1999, user access to Women.com's
pregnancy channel was disrupted as a result of a system failure. System
failures may adversely affect the combined company's user traffic, which could
adversely affect its revenues and operating results and harm its reputation
with users, advertisers and commerce partners. Computer viruses, electronic
break-ins or other similar disruptive problems, such as those historically
experienced by several leading Web sites, could also adversely affect the
combined company's Web sites. California is in the midst of an energy crisis
that could disrupt the operation of the combined company's Web sites and
increase its expenses. iVillage's insurance policies may not adequately
compensate it for any losses that may occur due to any failures or
interruptions in its systems. iVillage does not presently have any secondary
"off-site" systems or a formal disaster recovery plan.

   iVillage's Web sites must accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver
frequently updated information. iVillage's Web sites have in the past
experienced slower response times or decreased traffic for a variety of
reasons. These occurrences have not had a material impact on iVillage's
business. These types of occurrences in the future could cause users to
perceive iVillage's Web sites as not functioning properly and therefore cause
them to use another Web site or other methods to obtain information.

   In addition, iVillage's users depend on Internet service providers, online
service providers and other Web site operators for access to iVillage's Web
sites. Many of them have experienced significant outages in the past, and
could experience outages, delays and other difficulties due to system failures
unrelated to iVillage's systems.

   iVillage may incur liability for information it publishes or products it has
sold.

   iVillage's business and financial results could be materially and adversely
affected if iVillage were to become liable for damage claims based on
information published by iVillage or products sold by iVillage. For example,
iVillage has been and may be subject to claims for defamation, negligence,
copyright or trademark

infringement, personal injury or other legal theories relating to the
information it publishes on its Web sites. These types of claims have been
brought, sometimes successfully, against providers of Internet services in the
past. In addition, iVillage could be subjected to claims based upon content
that is accessible from its Web sites through links to other Web sites or
through content and materials that may be posted by members in chat rooms or
bulletin boards.

   In addition, through iVillage.com, Lamaze Publishing and iVillage Integrated
Properties, Inc., iVillage distributes publications and broadcasts over its
Web sites and the Newborn Channel information and advice regarding healthcare,
childbirth, infant care and financial and tax issues. iVillage may be exposed
to liability claims in connection with this information.

   iVillage also offers e-mail services through a third party vendor, which may
subject it to potential risks, such as liabilities or claims resulting from
unsolicited e-mail, lost or misdirected messages, illegal or fraudulent use of
e-mail or interruptions or delays in e-mail service.

   Consumers may also sue iVillage if any of the products that it sold before
its sale of assets related to its iBaby site, or before its divestiture of its
iMaternity and PlusBoutique sites, are found to be defective, fail to perform
properly or injure the user. iVillage may also face potential liability in
connection with the sale of products and services by its e-commerce partners.
To date, iVillage has had very limited experience in the sale of products and
the development of relationships with manufacturers or suppliers.

   iVillage's insurance, which covers commercial general liability, may not
adequately protect it against these claims. Liability claims could require
iVillage to spend significant time and money in litigation and to pay
significant damages. As a result, liability claims, whether or not successful,
could seriously damage iVillage's reputation and business. iVillage may also
be forced to implement expensive measures to alter the way its services are
provided to avoid potential liability.

   Possible infringement by third parties of iVillage intellectual property
rights, or claims of intellectual property infringement asserted against
iVillage, could harm iVillage's business.

   iVillage cannot be certain that the steps it has taken to protect its
intellectual property rights will be adequate or that third parties will not
infringe or misappropriate its proprietary rights. Enforcing iVillage's
intellectual property rights could entail significant expense and could prove
difficult or impossible. Any infringement or misappropriation by third parties
could have a material adverse effect on iVillage's future financial results.

   Furthermore, iVillage has invested resources in acquiring domain names for
existing and potential future use. iVillage cannot guarantee that it will be
entitled to use these domain names under applicable trademark and similar laws
or that other desired domain names will be available.

   Although iVillage currently believes that its technologies do not infringe
upon the intellectual property rights of others, in the future third parties
could assert claims of patent, trademark or copyright infringement or
misappropriation of creative ideas or formats against iVillage with respect to
its use of domain names, its content, Web page formats, Web business methods
or any third-party content it carries. iVillage expects that participants in
its markets increasingly will be subject to infringement claims as the number
of services and competitors in its industry segment grows. Any claims, with or
without merit, could be time consuming to defend, result in costly litigation,
divert management attention, require iVillage to enter into costly royalty or
licensing arrangements or prevent it from using important technologies, ideas
or formats, any of which could materially harm iVillage's business, financial
condition or results of operations.

   iVillage may face potential liability for its privacy practices.

   Growing public concern about privacy and the collection, distribution and
use of information about individuals may subject iVillage to increased
regulatory scrutiny and/or litigation. If iVillage is accused of violating the
stated terms of its privacy policy it may be forced to expend significant
amounts of monetary and human resources to defend against these accusations.
iVillage also may be required to make changes to its present and planned
products or services. These consequences, together with any resulting
liability for iVillage's privacy practices, could have a material adverse
effect on iVillage's business, financial condition and results of operations.

   iVillage may be liable if third parties misappropriate its users' personal
information.

   If third parties were able to penetrate iVillage's network security or
otherwise misappropriate its users' personal information or credit card
information, iVillage could be subject to liability arising from claims
related to, among other things, unauthorized purchases with credit card
information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims or other misuse of
personal information, such as for unauthorized marketing purposes. In
addition, the Federal Trade Commission and state agencies have been
investigating various Internet companies regarding their use of personal
information. iVillage could incur additional expenses if new regulations
regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if its privacy
practices are investigated.

   Consumer protection privacy regulations could impair iVillage's ability to
obtain information about its users, resulting in decreased advertising
revenues.

   If iVillage becomes unable to collect personal data from a sufficient number
of the users of its network, iVillage may lose significant advertising
revenues. iVillage's network requests and obtains personal data from users who
register to become members of the network. Registration as a member is
required in order for users to have full access to the services offered by the
network. Personal data gathered from members is used to tailor content to them
and is provided, on an aggregate basis, to advertisers to assist them in
targeting their advertising campaigns to particular demographic groups. The
attractiveness of the iVillage network to current or prospective advertisers
depends in part on iVillage's ability to provide user data to support this
tailoring capability. However, privacy concerns may cause users to resist
providing this personal data. Even the perception of security and privacy
concerns, whether or not valid, may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of
iVillage's use of personal data. In addition, legislative or regulatory
requirements may heighten these concerns if businesses must notify Internet
users that the data may be used by marketing entities to direct product
promotion and advertising to the user. Other countries and political entities,
such as the European Economic Community, have adopted legislation or
regulations containing these notification requirements.

   iVillage's network also uses cookies to track user behavior and preferences.
A cookie is information keyed to a specific server, file pathway or directory
location that is stored on a user's hard drive, possibly without the user's
knowledge, but is generally removable by the user. Information gathered from
cookies is used by iVillage to tailor content to users of its network and may
also be provided to advertisers on an aggregate basis. In addition,
advertisers may themselves use cookies to track user behavior and preferences.
Germany has imposed laws limiting the use of cookies, and a number of Internet
commentators, advocates and governmental bodies in the United States and other
countries have urged the passage of laws limiting or abolishing the use of
cookies. If these laws are passed, it may become more difficult for iVillage
to tailor content to its users, making its network less attractive to users.
Similarly, the unavailability of cookies may restrict the use of tailored
advertising, making iVillage's network less attractive to advertisers and
causing iVillage to lose significant advertising revenues.

   Government regulation and legal uncertainties could add additional costs to
doing business on the Internet.

   There are currently few laws or regulations that specifically regulate
communications or commerce on the Internet. However, laws and regulations may
be adopted in the future that address issues such as user privacy, pricing and
taxation, content, copyrights, distribution, antitrust matters and the
characteristics and quality of products and services. For example, the
Telecommunications Act sought to prohibit transmitting various types of
information and content over the Internet. Several telecommunications
companies have petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to regulate
Internet service providers and online service providers in a manner similar to
long distance telephone carriers and to impose access fees on those companies,
which could increase the cost of transmitting data over the Internet.
Moreover, it may take years to determine the extent to which existing laws
relating to issues such as property ownership, obscenity, libel and personal
privacy are applicable to the Internet or the application of laws and
regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to iVillage's
business. Any new laws or regulations relating to the Internet could adversely
affect iVillage's business.

   In addition, it has been reported that the Labor Department is investigating
the use of volunteers on Web sites. iVillage uses volunteers as Web site
community leaders and there can be no assurance that new government
regulations will not require iVillage to stop using volunteers or,
alternatively, treat them as employees.

   Due to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that, although
iVillage's transmissions over the Internet originate primarily in New York,
the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to
regulate iVillage's business activities. In addition, because iVillage's
service is available over the Internet in multiple states and foreign
countries, these jurisdictions may require iVillage to qualify to do business
as a foreign corporation in each of these states or foreign countries, which
could subject iVillage to taxes and other regulations.

   iVillage's operation of Lamaze Publishing and the Newborn Channel poses a
number of risks that could materially adversely affect its business strategy.

   There are a number of risks in operating Lamaze Publishing and the Newborn
Channel, which are primarily non-Internet businesses, including:

   o the competitiveness of the media and publishing industry;

   o iVillage's limited experience in operating a multi-media publishing
     company;

   o iVillage's ability to identify and predict trends in a timely manner that
     may impact consumer tastes in baby-related information in Lamaze
     Publishing's publications and iVillage's Newborn Channel;

   o iVillage's ability to continue to sell advertising and sponsorships on
     iVillage's Web sites and in Lamaze Publishing's magazines, videos and Web
     site, and iVillage's Newborn Channel;

   o iVillage's ability to continue to commercialize and protect the Lamaze
     mark; and

   o iVillage's ability to maintain and market the Lamaze.com Web site.

   iVillage's inability to perform the functions required for the operation of
Lamaze Publishing and the Newborn Channel in an efficient and timely manner
could result in a disruption of operations of Lamaze Publishing and the
Newborn Channel that could have a material adverse effect on iVillage's
business strategy.

   Satellite transmissions over the Newborn Channel may be interrupted.

   Through iVillage Integrated Properties, iVillage operates the Newborn
Channel, a satellite television network broadcast in over 1,000 hospitals in
the United States. There is a risk that the satellite from which the
transmission is sent may malfunction, interrupting the Newborn Channel's
broadcasts. In the event this occurs, there may be a period of time before the
Newborn Channel can transmit to and from another satellite. Any interruption
in iVillage's ability to transmit the Newborn Channel could have an adverse
impact on its business. In addition, extreme adverse weather could damage
receivers and transmitters on the ground and hinder transmissions.

   If iVillage fails to attract and retain key personnel, its business would be
materially and adversely affected.

   iVillage's future success depends to a significant extent on the continued
services of its senior management and other key personnel, particularly
Douglas McCormick, its Chief Executive Officer, Steven Elkes, its Executive
Vice President--Operations and Business Affairs and Scott Levine, its Chief
Financial Officer. The loss of the services of Messrs. McCormick, Elkes or
Levine would likely harm iVillage's business. iVillage currently does not
maintain "key person" life insurance for any of its personnel.

   iVillage may be unable to retain its key employees or attract, assimilate or
retain other highly qualified employees in the future. iVillage has from time
to time experienced, and expects to continue to experience, difficulty in
hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications
as a result of its rapid growth and expansion and its relatively low stock
price. As a result, iVillage incurred increased salaries, benefits and
recruiting expenses for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999. If
iVillage does not succeed in attracting new personnel or retaining and
motivating its current personnel, its business will be adversely affected.

   Several members of senior management have only recently joined iVillage.

   Several members of iVillage's senior management joined the company in 2000
and 2001 and have not previously worked together. As a result, iVillage's
senior managers are continuing to become integrated as a management team and
may not work together effectively as a team to successfully manage iVillage's
growth.

Voting by Proxy

   You may vote in person at your special meeting or by proxy. We recommend you
vote by proxy even if you plan to attend your special meeting. You can always
change your vote at your special meeting.

   You may vote by completing and mailing the enclosed proxy card, by
telephoning the toll-free number included on the enclosed proxy card, or by
Internet in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. When
you use the telephone or Internet systems, the selected system will verify
that you are a stockholder through the use of a unique control number that is
assigned to you. The telephone and Internet systems allow you to instruct the
proxies how to vote your shares and to confirm that your instructions have
been properly recorded. If you properly submit your proxy to iVillage or
Women.com, as applicable, in time to vote or vote by telephone or Internet,
one of the individuals named as your proxy will vote your shares of common
stock as you have directed. You may vote for or against the proposal or
proposals submitted at your special meeting or abstain from voting.

   If you hold shares of common stock through a broker or other custodian,
please follow the voting instructions for the voting form used by that firm.
If you submit your proxy but do not make specific choices, your proxy will
follow your board of directors' recommendations and your shares will be voted
for their recommendations.

Revoking Your Proxy

   You may revoke your proxy before it is voted by:

   o submitting a new proxy with a later date or changing your vote by
     telephone or by Internet;

   o notifying your company's corporate secretary in writing before your
     special meeting that you have revoked your proxy; or

   o voting in person at your special meeting.

Additional Information

   Voting in Person.  If you plan to attend your stockholder meeting and wish
to vote in person, we will give you a ballot at your meeting. However, if your
shares of common stock are held in the name of a brokerage firm or trustee,
you must obtain from the firm or trustee an account statement, letter or other
evidence of your beneficial ownership of the shares of common stock.

   Proxy Solicitation.  We will each pay our own costs of soliciting proxies.
In addition to this mailing, iVillage and Women.com employees may solicit
proxies personally, electronically or by telephone. iVillage has also

retained a professional proxy solicitation firm, D. F. King & Co., Inc., to
assist in the solicitation of proxies at an estimated cost of $6,500, plus
certain out-of-pocket expenses.

   The extent to which these proxy soliciting efforts will be necessary depends
upon how promptly proxies are submitted. You should submit your proxy by mail,
telephone or Internet. We also will reimburse brokers and other nominees for
their expenses in sending these materials to you and getting your voting
instructions.

   Do not send in any Women.com stock certificates with your proxy cards. The
exchange agent will mail to each Women.com stockholder of record a transmittal
form with instructions for the surrender of stock certificates for shares of
Women.com common stock as soon as practicable after the completion of the
merger.

   iVillage stockholders are not to submit their stock certificates in
connection with the merger.

Other Business; Adjournments and Postponements

   No business other than that specified in the notice of special meeting may
be brought before or acted upon at either stockholder meeting.

   Adjournments or postponements of the stockholder meetings may be made for
the purpose of, among other things, soliciting additional proxies. Any
adjournment may be made from time to time by approval of the stockholders
representing a majority of the votes present in person or by proxy at the
applicable stockholder meeting, whether or not a quorum exists, without
further notice other than by an announcement made at the stockholder meeting.
The proxy holders will have discretionary authority to vote proxies in favor
of an adjournment or adjournments of the meetings to permit further
solicitation of proxies in the event that there are not sufficient votes at
the time of the meeting to approve the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby.

                                   THE MERGER

Background of the Merger

   During the course of the prior three years, various senior management
personnel of iVillage have been involved from time to time in discussions with
members of management of Hearst Communications and Women.com regarding a
variety of topics related to their businesses, including the possibility of
combining the two companies and the potential benefits of combining the two
companies.

    On August 2, 2000, Douglas W. McCormick, Chief Executive Officer of
iVillage, met with Alfred Sikes, one of Hearst Communications' representatives
on the board of directors of Women.com. Mr. McCormick was President and Chief
Executive Officer of Lifetime Television, a joint venture of The Hearst
Corporation and The Walt Disney Company, from 1993 to 1998 and, accordingly,
knew Mr. Sikes quite well. At the meeting on August 2, 2000, Mr. McCormick and
Mr. Sikes talked generally about the possibility of combining iVillage and
Women.com, and referred to the potential transaction as a merger of equals.
Mr. McCormick and Mr. Sikes also discussed the relative strengths of the
iVillage and Women.com brands, and whether Mr. McCormick or Marleen McDaniel,
the Chief Executive Officer of Women.com, would head the combined company. No
agreements on these topics were reached by Mr. McCormick and Mr. Sikes during
this meeting.

    On August 9, 2000, Mr. McCormick had a breakfast meeting with Ms.
McDaniel. This was the first meeting between Mr. McCormick and Ms. McDaniel
during which the potential business combination was discussed. Mr. McCormick
asked Ms. McDaniel whether she would be interested in exploring a potential
business combination, and Ms. McDaniel did not dismiss the idea. As was the
case with the August 2, 2000 meeting between Mr. McCormick and Mr. Sikes, the
two executives spoke of the potential transaction as a merger of equals. Mr.
McCormick and Ms. McDaniel also discussed which of the two of them would act
as chief executive officer of the combined company, but no agreement on this
issue was reached.

    Ms. McDaniel left telephone messages for Mr. McCormick on August 17, 2000
suggesting that Mr. McCormick might want to meet with Women.com's management
team in California. On November 17, 2000, Ms. McDaniel called Mr. McCormick
and left a message that she would be in New York on December 6th, 7th and 8th,
and that she would like to schedule a meeting with Mr. McCormick. Mr.
McCormick subsequently

suggested a meeting on December 7, 2000 and, on November 30, 2000, Ms.
McDaniel confirmed her availability for that meeting, and stated that Mr.
Sikes would also be in attendance.

    During the period from August 17, 2000 to October 5, 2000, Mr. McCormick
had several informal conversations with members of the iVillage board of
directors during which it became clear that the consensus of the iVillage
board was that there would be no support for a merger with Women.com unless
the transaction would result in the stockholders of iVillage owning more than
a majority of the outstanding shares of the combined company.

   On October 5, 2000, there was a regular meeting of the board of directors of
iVillage. During this meeting, John Curran, who was iVillage's Senior Vice
President--Corporate Development at the time, and Enrique Senior of Allen &
Company Incorporated, iVillage's financial advisor, provided the Board with a
presentation on several potential strategic partnerships and mergers being
explored by the iVillage board, including the potential merger with Women.com,
and Mr. McCormick summarized for the iVillage board the status of his
discussions with Mr. Sikes and Ms. McDaniel. The iVillage board of directors
authorized iVillage's management team to continue its discussions with
Women.com and Hearst Communications. The iVillage board of directors confirmed
the view expressed informally through conversations with Mr. McCormick that
there would be no support for any transaction with Women.com unless it would
result in the iVillage stockholders owning more than a majority of the
combined company. The iVillage board also expressed the view that if the
transaction were to receive its support, it would be necessary for the
combined company to be operated at the direction of iVillage's management,
with Mr. McCormick as the Chief Executive Officer.

   On December 7, 2000, Mr. Sikes and Ms. McDaniel met with Mr. McCormick and
Steven A. Elkes, Executive Vice President--Operations and Business Affairs of
iVillage, to continue the discussions relating to the possibility of combining
iVillage and Women.com. During this meeting, Mr. McCormick communicated to Mr.
Sikes and Ms. McDaniel that the combination of iVillage and Women.com would
not be supported by him or the iVillage board unless iVillage's stockholders
ended up with more than a majority of the outstanding shares of the combined
company and Mr. McCormick served as the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman
of the Board of the combined company. During this meeting, there was also a
general discussion of whether the combined company would be able to attract
more end-users and achieve greater economies of scale than the two companies
would were they to continue to operate as separate entities. The meeting
concluded without agreement and no additional meetings or discussions were
scheduled, although Mr. Sikes and Ms. McDaniels agreed to think about the
issues discussed and report back to Mr. McCormick as to whether there
continued to be an interest in pursuing a potential business combination.

   On December 21, 2000, Mr. McCormick met again with Mr. Sikes. During this
meeting, they discussed in general terms the manner in which the combined
company would be operated, and which brands and channels would be continued
after the merger. Mr. Sikes also indicated at this meeting that Hearst
Communications would support a combination where iVillage emerged in a
controlling position. Mr. Sikes and Mr. McCormick agreed to continue their
discussions on the possible business combination and to expand the scope of
iVillage and Hearst Communications senior management involved in the
discussions.

   On January 15, 2001, Mr. Sikes, James Asher, another of Hearst
Communications' representatives on the board of directors of Women.com, and
Mr. McCormick met to discuss the possibility of combining Women.com and
iVillage. The management of the combined company was discussed, and Messrs.
Sikes and Asher expressed a willingness to move forward on the basis that Mr.
McCormick would be the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of
the combined entity. Messrs. Sikes and Asher also agreed that a structure in
which iVillage stockholders ended up owning more than a majority of the
combined company would be acceptable, although there was no agreement on any
particular ownership percentage and, accordingly, no agreement on the exchange
ratio that would apply to the merger. Messrs. Sikes and Asher, on behalf of
Hearst Communications, and Mr. McCormick, on behalf of iVillage, agreed to
submit the issue of the proposed business combination, on a preliminary basis,
to the board of directors of iVillage and Women.com.

   On January 17, 2001, the board of directors of iVillage met to consider
several matters of business including, among other things, preliminary
discussions regarding the form of and parameters for any proposed business
combination with Women.com. At this meeting, Mr. McCormick and other members
of senior management discussed the proposed transaction with the board and the
strategic reasons for the proposed transaction. Upon

completion of its deliberations, the board of directors of iVillage authorized
and directed Mr. McCormick and other members of iVillage's senior management
to pursue further discussions with Hearst Communications and Women.com within
parameters that included a management structure of the combined company led by
Mr. McCormick and majority ownership of the combined company by iVillage
stockholders.

   On January 18, 2001, the board of directors of Women.com held their
regularly scheduled board meeting. Several different  options were discussed
regarding the future of Women.com, including whether to remain an independent
company, seek alternative financing, merge with another company or be acquired
by another company. Salomon Smith Barney, Women.com's financial advisor, gave
a presentation regarding different options. A representative of Cooley Godward
LLP, Women.com's outside legal counsel, discussed the board's fiduciary duties
in considering a strategic business combination. The Women.com board of
directors then directed Ms. McDaniel to pursue discussions with iVillage with
respect to a possible merger transaction with iVillage.

   On January 22, 2000, Mr. McCormick, Mr. Elkes and Scott Levine, Chief
Financial Officer of iVillage, discussed with Allen & Company Incorporated and
various individual board members the advantages and disadvantages of various
types of business combinations.

   On January 22, 2001, Ms. McDaniel, Mr. Sikes, Mr. Asher and Barry Weinman,
another member of the board of directors of Women.com, spoke by telephone
regarding the possibility of pursuing a transaction with iVillage.

   On January 22, 2001, Mr. McCormick spoke by telephone with Mr. Sikes, Mr.
Asher and Mr. Weinman to discuss the potential of proceeding with discussions.
During the period of January 17, 2001 through January 24, 2001, there were a
series of telephone calls between Mr. McCormick, members of senior management
of iVillage and Messrs. Sikes and Asher on behalf of Hearst Communications and
Women.com regarding the structure of a proposed transaction, management
issues, corporate governance issues, the proposed exchange ratio, due
diligence issues and the structure of arrangements with Hearst Communications.
With regard to the structure of arrangements with Hearst Communications, Mr.
Asher stated that Hearst Communications would be willing, as part of the
proposed merger transaction, to make an investment in iVillage in the range of
$20.0 million to $25.0 million. Mr. Asher discussed with senior management of
iVillage the form of this investment, and it was preliminarily agreed that
Hearst Communications would purchase both iVillage common stock and a warrant
to purchase iVillage common stock. The parties discussed at length the manner
of pricing the securities that would be purchased by Hearst Communications and
the terms of the warrant, but no agreements on these issues were reached.

   On January 23, 2001, Mr. Sikes, Mr. Asher, Ms. McDaniel and Erin Ruane,
Senior Vice President, Business and Corporate Development of Women.com, met
with Salomon Smith Barney to discuss financial aspects of the proposed
transaction, the structure of the transaction and the fairness of the
transaction from a financial point of view to the Women.com stockholders.

   On January 24, 2001, Mr. McCormick, Mr. Elkes, Mr. Levine, and Jane
Tollinger, iVillage's Senior Vice President of Operations and Business
Affairs, met with Mr. Sikes, Ms. McDaniel, Ms. Ruane and Mr. Asher to discuss
the specific structure of the transaction, the exchange ratio, the strategic
arrangements with Hearst Communications and management structure. The meeting
concluded with no agreement.

   On January 25, 2001, Messrs. McCormick, Levine and Elkes, and Ms. Tollinger
met with Messrs. Sikes and Asher and Ronald J. Doerfler, Senior Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer of Hearst Communications, and continued to discuss
specific aspects of the proposed transaction structure, the Hearst
Communications investment issues, the exchange ratio, and management
structure. The meeting concluded with no agreement on specific terms for the
proposed transaction.

   On January 26, 2001, Ms. McDaniel and Mr. Asher briefed by telephone the
Women.com board of directors of the status of the proposed transaction.

   On January 26, 2001, Mr. McCormick spoke by telephone with Mr. Asher
regarding specific aspects of the proposed transaction.

   On January 29, 2001, Mr. McCormick and Mr. Levine spoke by telephone with
Ms. McDaniel and Mr. Sikes regarding specific aspects of the proposed
transaction.

   On January 29, 2001, the board of directors of iVillage held a telephonic
meeting. At the meeting, Mr. McCormick provided a report on the discussions
which had taken place with Women.com and Hearst Communications. Mr. McCormick
also summarized the principal terms and open issues relating to a possible
transaction. These open issues related primarily to corporate governance
matters including the number of board seats that Hearst Communications would
be entitled to and the manner in which that number would be adjusted in the
future, the extent to which Hearst Communications would be restricted from
increasing its ownership interest in iVillage and the voting restrictions that
would be imposed upon the shares of iVillage common stock that would be owned
by Hearst Communications after the merger. A representative of Orrick,
Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, iVillage's outside legal counsel, discussed the
board's fiduciary duties in considering a strategic business combination and
further discussed the principal terms of a draft agreement and plan of merger.

   On January 29, 2001, iVillage and Women.com signed a confidentiality
agreement regarding the transaction to begin due diligence.

   Beginning the week of January 29, 2001, there were a series of daily
telephone calls between members of senior management of iVillage and members
of senior management of Hearst Communications and Women.com regarding the
terms of the proposed transaction and due diligence matters. In addition,
iVillage, Hearst Communications and Women.com and their respective advisors
intensified due diligence activities and preparation of definitive
documentation. On January 31, 2001, Messrs. McCormick, Elkes and Levine and
Ms. Tollinger met with Messrs. Sikes and Asher to discuss specific aspects of
the transaction.

   From February 1, 2001 through February 5, 2001, representatives of iVillage,
Hearst Communications and Women.com and their respective advisors conducted
due diligence and negotiated definitive documentation. On February 3, 2001,
representatives of iVillage, Hearst Communications and Women.com agreed to
revise the structure of the merger to make it a taxable transaction so that
stockholders of Women.com may be able to realize any loss they have suffered
on their investment in Women.com.

   On February 2, 2001, the board of directors of iVillage met at the offices
of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP in New York, New York. Mr. McCormick
provided an update of discussions with Hearst Communications and Women.com and
a review of the terms of the transaction and the strategic rationale for the
transaction. Representatives of Allen & Company Incorporated presented to
iVillage's board of directors a summary of its financial analyses of the
transaction. In addition, Allen & Company delivered its oral opinion that the
acquisition of Women.com and the investment in iVillage of an aggregate of
$20.0 million by Hearst Communications pursuant to a securities purchase
agreement and possibly other Women.com stockholders through a rights offering
was fair, from a financial point of view, to iVillage. Representatives of
Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP then reviewed the directors' fiduciary
duties and summarized the principal terms of the proposed agreements. After
its deliberations, the board of directors directed senior management to
continue discussions with Hearst Communications and Women.com.

   On February 4, 2001, the board of directors of iVillage again convened by
telephone to review the status of the negotiations. Mr. McCormick and
representatives of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP provided an update on
the status of the proposed transaction and the terms of the proposed
agreements. Mr. McCormick also summarized the issues upon which the parties
had not yet reached agreement. These open issues related primarily to
corporate governance matters including the number of board seats that Hearst
Communications would be entitled to and the manner in which that number would
be adjusted in the future, the extent to which Hearst Communications would be
restricted from increasing its ownership interest in iVillage and the voting
restrictions that would be imposed upon the shares of iVillage common stock
that would be owned by Hearst Communications after the merger.

   On February 5, 2001, the board of directors of iVillage held a telephonic
board meeting. Mr. McCormick provided the board with an update on the
negotiations and the unresolved issues. A representative of Allen & Company
addressed certain aspects of the unresolved issues and delivered its opinion
as to the fairness of the merger to iVillage. After its deliberations, the
iVillage board of directors approved the merger agreement and the related
agreements and the transactions contemplated by those agreements; declared
them advisable and resolved to recommend that iVillage's stockholders approve
and adopt the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, including the merger, the issuance of shares of iVillage common
stock to be received by stockholders of Women.com pursuant to the merger
agreement, the issuance of iVillage common

stock and warrants pursuant to a securities purchase agreement between
iVillage and Hearst Communications, and the rights offering to Women.com
stockholders.

   On February 5, 2001, the board of directors of Women.com held a telephonic
board meeting at 9:30 a.m., Pacific time. Representatives of Cooley Godward
LLP, Women.com's outside legal counsel, and representatives of Salomon Smith
Barney were also present. Mr. Asher provided an update on the status of the
transaction and the terms of the transaction. Following the presentation, a
representative of Salomon Smith Barney reviewed the terms of the transaction
and discussed its fairness opinion. A representative of Cooley Godward then
reviewed some of the documentation and timing for the transaction. After
discussions and deliberations, the board of directors of Women.com approved by
all directors present the merger agreement and the related agreements and the
transactions contemplated by those agreements; declared them advisable and
resolved to recommend that the Women.com stockholders approve and adopt the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
including the merger and the conversion of shares of Women.com common stock
into shares of iVillage common stock.

   After negotiation of the final terms of the merger agreement and the related
agreements, representatives of each of iVillage and Women.com executed the
merger agreement. In addition, Hearst Communications entered into a securities
purchase agreement with iVillage pursuant to which Hearst Communications
agreed to pay iVillage $20.0 million (subject to adjustment) for iVillage
common stock and warrants to purchase iVillage common stock. Hearst
Communications also entered into a voting agreement with iVillage pursuant to
which Hearst Communications agreed to vote all of its shares of common stock
of Women.com in favor of adoption of the merger. AOL Time Warner Inc.,
National Broadcasting Company, Inc., GE Investments Subsidiary, Inc. and Rho
Management Trust I each entered into voting agreements with iVillage pursuant
to which they agreed to vote all of their shares of common stock of iVillage
in favor of the adoption of the merger.

   On the evening of February 5, 2001, iVillage and Women.com issued a joint
press release announcing the proposed acquisition of Women.com. by iVillage.

Women.com's Reasons for the Merger

   Women.com's board of directors has determined that the terms of the merger
and the merger agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Women.com
and its stockholders, has declared the advisability of the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated by it and has determined to recommend that
the stockholders of Women.com adopt the merger agreement. In its evaluation of
the merger and the merger agreement, Women.com's board of directors consulted
with Women.com's senior management, as well as its legal and financial
advisors. The decision of the Women.com board of directors to approve the
merger and the merger agreement was based upon several potential benefits of
the merger that Women.com's board believes will contribute to the success of
iVillage following the merger compared to Women.com continuing to operate as
an independent business. Women.com's management has also considered a number
of alternatives for enhancing its business, including:

   o acquiring other companies;

   o continuing to execute its business plan and risk being unable to fund its
     operations if the advertising market did not improve substantially by the
     end of the second quarter of 2001;

   o seeking a larger company, such as Hearst Communications, to take
     Women.com private;

   o seeking additional investors to fund Women.com's operations through a
     private placement;

   o merging with another company; and

   o being acquired by another company.

   After considering these options, the board of directors of Women.com and its
financial advisor determined that merging with another company or being
acquired by another company were the only viable options because Women.com did
not want to risk being forced into bankruptcy if the advertising or financial
markets did not improve and view online media companies as attractive
investments. After discussions with Salomon Smith Barney, Women.com determined
that the proposed transaction with iVillage was the best strategic option,

especially in light of the ongoing discussions Women.com and iVillage had been
engaged in during the past 7 months and did not seek competing bids.

   In addition to the potential benefits described under "iVillage's Reasons
for the Merger" that would be applicable to Women.com stockholders, the
Women.com board believes that additional reasons the merger will be beneficial
to Women.com and its stockholders include the following:

   o due to the taxable nature of the merger, the current stockholders of
     Women.com, especially large stockholders like Hearst Communications, will
     be able to realize any loss they may have suffered if the stockholders
     purchased their Women.com stock at a price higher than 0.322 multiplied
     by the price per share of iVillage common stock at the effective time of
     the merger (the result of this calculation cannot be determined until the
     effective time of the merger) without having to sell any of their
     Women.com stock, and the loss could be used to offset any investment
     income earned from other investments during 2001;

   o the availability to iVillage following the merger of greater resources to
     continue to establish, expand and support advertisement sales,
     distribution, and editorial on and through the Women.com web site;

   o the potential synergies created from combining the audience reach,
     distribution and other strengths developed by iVillage with the brand and
     consumer relationships built by Women.com;

   o the ability to merge the complementary content of iVillage and Women.com
     and create a targeted, highly-relevant destination for women on the Web;

   o upon completion of the merger, the combined company is expected to be one
     of the 20 most visited web-sites as measured by third parties who track
     traffic demographics, regardless of whether the websites of Women.com and
     iVillage are combined or remain separate since these third party tracking
     services will view the Women.com and iVillage websites as one
     consolidated network of websites; the large, focused user base of the
     combined company is expected to be more attractive than the user base of
     general content aggregators, including AOL, Yahoo! and MSN, to
     advertisers seeking to focus advertising dollars on one market segment,
     all of which is expected to increase the combined company's advertising
     revenue as it is expected that advertisers will be offered packages where
     advertisements sold would be run on both websites and the combined
     company would be able to provide advertisers on an aggregate basis user
     data on members of the iVillage Network and the Women.com website; and

   o the increased ability to more easily raise funds to continue operations
     and company growth.

   Women.com's board reviewed a number of factors in evaluating the merger. Set
forth below is a list of the material factors reviewed by Women.com's board in
evaluating the merger:

   o information concerning the financial performance and condition, results
     of operations, competitive position, management and business of iVillage
     and Women.com before and after giving effect to the merger, including the
     inability of Women.com to continue to fund its operations at current
     levels past the second quarter of 2001 without a significant capital
     infusion, and after giving effect to the merger the combined company
     would be able to combine its assets and generate greater advertising
     revenues and as a combined entity would be more competitive than iVillage
     and Women.com as separate entities;

   o the disadvantages to Women.com of being a small public company, in that
     its capital structure as a small public company makes it difficult to
     support its capital requirements;

   o current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
     volatility and trading information with respect to iVillage common stock
     and Women.com common stock;

   o the consideration iVillage will issue in the merger in light of
     comparable merger transactions;

   o the belief that the consideration offered by iVillage was the most that
     iVillage was willing to offer;

   o the belief that no third party would be willing to offer more than
     iVillage for the shares of Women.com, based on the fact that iVillage
     fully understands Women.com's business plan, is fully aware of its future
     prospects and is in a better position to appreciate its long-term
     potential than any other potential buyer and also based upon discussions
     with Salomon Smith Barney, which advised Women.com that many potential

     acquirers are preserving cash and focusing their efforts internally on
     operations instead of acquisitions and are no longer interested in
     investing in Internet media companies;

   o the belief that the terms of the merger agreement and related agreements
     are reasonable;

   o the impact of the merger on the customers and employees of Women.com and
     iVillage;

   o the fact that many "dot.com" businesses, including Internet media
     companies, have been unable to generate significant revenues, and as a
     result, have been unable to fund their operations and are going out of
     business or are dramatically reducing their spending, including their
     spending on advertising;

   o the business condition and prospects of Women.com if the proposed
     transaction with iVillage is not completed, which would involve a need
     for significant capital, and an uncertainty of being able to raise
     capital, based on discussions with Women.com's financial advisor, which
     advised Women.com that Internet media companies and Internet-based
     businesses, such as Women.com, were no longer attractive to potential
     investors;

   o results of the due diligence investigation conducted by Women.com's
     management, accountants and legal and financial advisors;

   o the financial presentation and detailed analyses of Salomon Smith Barney,
     including its opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view
     and as of the date of the opinion, of the merger consideration, including
     the benefits to be derived from the Hearst Communications investment
     following the completion of the merger, which include the infusion of
     capital to help iVillage strengthen and expand the business of the
     combined company following completion of the merger and the increased
     advertising value of the iVillage network derived from the addition of
     the Hearst Communications magazines, Women.com content and Women.com
     users to iVillage, provided for in the merger agreement, as more fully
     described below under the caption "Opinion of Women.com's Financial
     Advisor;" and

   o the availability to dissenting stockholders of appraisal rights under the
     Delaware General Corporation Law.

   The foregoing factors provided the basis for the conclusion by Women.com's
board that the proposed transaction with iVillage, which included the
investment by Hearst Communications, was the best and most viable option for
Women.com, which supported the determination that the transaction was fair to
and in the best interests of Women.com and its stockholders.

   Women.com's board also considered the terms of the merger agreement
regarding Women.com's rights and limits on its ability to consider and
negotiate other acquisition proposals, as well as the possible effects of the
provisions regarding termination and termination fees. In addition, it was
noted to Women.com's board that the merger is expected to be a taxable
transaction and accounted for as a purchase.

   The Women.com board also identified and considered a number of potentially
negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger and the merger
agreement, including the following:

   o the risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized;

   o the fact that the proposed exchange ratio is not fixed and could change
     depending on certain metrics that Women.com must meet and the fact that
     the market prices of either company's stock before completion of the
     merger may change in a way that reduces the absolute value delivered to
     Women.com because the ratio does not change if the market values change;

   o the risk that the merger may not be consummated, notwithstanding the
     voting agreement obtained from certain stockholders of both iVillage and
     Women.com, and the effect of the public announcement of the merger on
     Women.com's sales, customer relations and operating results;

   o the risk of management and employee disruption associated with the
     merger, including resignations or layoffs of employees and the fact that
     key technical, sales and management personnel would likely not be
     employed by iVillage following the merger;

   o the fact that the merger agreement requires Women.com to obtain
     iVillage's consent to take a variety of actions prior to the closing of
     the merger;

   o Women.com's limited ability to terminate the merger agreement, including
     the fact that, under certain circumstances, the receipt of a superior
     proposal may allow the Women.com board of directors to change or withdraw
     its recommendation as to the adoption of the merger agreement, but would
     still require Women.com to submit the adoption of the merger agreement to
     a vote of Women.com stockholders;

   o the challenges of integrating Women.com's operations with those of
     iVillage; and

   o other applicable risks described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
     under "Risk Factors."

   Women.com's board concluded, however, that these risks could be managed or
mitigated and that on balance, the merger's potential benefits to Women.com
and its stockholders outweighed the associated risks. This discussion
summarizes the material information and factors considered by Women.com's
board.  In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its
evaluation of the merger, Women.com's board did not find it practicable to,
and did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to, the specific
factors considered in reaching the determination.

Recommendation of Women.com's board of directors

   For the reasons discussed above, the Women.com board of directors believes
that the terms of the merger are fair to and in the best interests of
Women.com's stockholders and recommends that the stockholders vote to approve
the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, including the merger.

   In considering the recommendation of Women.com's board with respect to the
merger agreement, Women.com stockholders should be aware that certain
directors and officers of Women.com have interests in the merger that are
different from, or are in addition to, the interests of other Women.com
stockholders and that iVillage has agreed to continue certain existing
indemnification arrangements in favor of directors and officers of Women.com.
Please see "The Merger - Interests of  Directors and Officers in the Merger
that are Different from Your Interests."

iVillage's Reasons for the Merger

   The board of directors of iVillage believes that the combination of iVillage
and Women.com will create the largest and most comprehensive online
destination for women. The board of directors of iVillage has determined that
the terms of the merger and the merger agreement are fair to and in the best
interests of iVillage and its stockholders, and has determined to recommend
that the stockholders of iVillage approve the merger and adopt the merger
agreement. In reaching the conclusion that the merger is in the best interest
of iVillage and its stockholders, iVillage's board of directors consulted with
iVillage's senior management regarding the strategic and operational aspects
of the merger and the results of due diligence efforts undertaken by senior
management. In addition, iVillage's board of directors consulted with
representatives of Allen & Company Incorporated, financial advisor to
iVillage, regarding selected financial aspects of iVillage's and Women.com's
business and future prospects facing Internet media companies, in general, and
iVillage and Women.com, in particular, as well as the fairness from a
financial point of view to iVillage. iVillage's board also consulted with
iVillage's internal counsel and representatives of its outside legal counsel,
regarding the duties of the members of the board of directors, legal due
diligence matters and the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the
related agreements.

   The following factors, among others, were also evaluated in connection with
the merger:

   o information concerning the financial condition, business, operations,
     strategic objectives and prospects and competitive position of iVillage
     and Women.com before and after giving effect to the merger with
     iVillage's board of directors believing that Women.com has historically
     been a formidable competitor of iVillage with substantial assets,
     customers, and revenues which, if combined with those of iVillage, would
     create the leading online women's network of websites;

   o the market conditions and industry trends affecting iVillage, Women.com
     and internet media companies in general, specifically recent declines in
     the internet advertising market which have made it more difficult for
     each company separately to maintain or increase its respective revenue
     levels;

   o current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
     volatility and trading information with respect to iVillage common stock
     and Women.com common stock, particularly the decline in the Nasdaq Stock
     Market in general and in the market prices of each company's common stock
     since April 2000 which have placed both iVillage and Women.com in
     jeopardy of having their respective common stock delisted from the
     Nasdaq;

   o the Hearst Communications investment would significantly increase
     iVillage's cash reserves and, although iVillage is currently not in need
     of additional financing, if and when iVillage requires further capital
     investment, iVillage may not be able to obtain such an investment on
     favorable terms or at all due to the current market conditions described
     above;

   o the agreements with Hearst Communications regarding licensing of content
     by Hearst Communications to iVillage provide iVillage with a high quality
     additional source of content previously licensed to Women.com, which is a
     competitor prior to the closing of the merger, and the payment by Hearst
     Communications for production services and advertising provides iVillage
     with a substantial additional source of revenue over the next three
     years;

   o iVillage will be required to issue only a minimal amount of cash in the
     merger, thus preserving its available cash for working capital and other
     general corporate purposes, and the total consideration iVillage will
     issue in the merger is favorable in light of merger transactions deemed
     comparable;

   o the merger is not expected to have an adverse effect on the advertisers,
     sponsors, customers and employees of iVillage and provides iVillage with
     access to the potential revenues, resources and strategic value offered
     by Women.com's advertisers, sponsors and customers, as well as to the
     skills and experience provided by Women.com employees;

   o the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and related agreements
     were deemed to be favorable to iVillage and its stockholders in the
     aggregate; and

   o the financial presentation of Allen & Company Incorporated, including its
     opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view as of the date
     of the opinion, of the exchange ratio provided for in the merger
     agreement, as more fully described below under the caption "Opinion of
     iVillage's Financial Advisor."

   The iVillage board believes that the merger and the related agreements will
be beneficial to iVillage and its stockholders for the following reasons:

   o the terms and conditions of the merger and the related agreements are
     reasonable, especially since iVillage will primarily issue its common
     stock as consideration for the acquisition rather than cash and will also
     receive a substantial investment in connection with the overall
     transaction;

   o whether the Women.com and iVillage websites are operated separately or
     integrated into one website, the network of websites resulting from the
     merger will be the most comprehensive online destination for content and
     services targeted to women;

   o whether the Women.com and iVillage websites are operated separately or
     integrated into one website, the network of websites resulting from the
     merger will provide existing and potential new sponsors with increased
     access to one of the most highly targeted and desirable demographics on
     the Internet, with sponsors being able to target all female users of the
     iVillage network, those female users interested in a particular content
     area such as health or astrology, or a combination of these groups;

   o the merger will result in the combined iVillage/Women.com network of
     websites being ranked in the largest 20 digital media/Web properties
     worldwide;

   o the increased level of content and services, as well as the increased
     traffic and number of users, resulting from the merger will make the
     iVillage network of websites more attractive to potential advertisers and
     sponsors and enable the combined company to compete more effectively for
     advertising revenues with other large websites and media properties;

   o the strategic relationship with Hearst Communications resulting from the
     amended and restated securities purchase agreement, stockholder
     agreement, and magazine hosting and license agreement will provide the
     combined company with capital, future guaranteed revenues for advertising
     and production services, access to Hearst Communications content and
     strategic relationships, and access to Hearst Communications' vast media
     experience;

   o access to a significant equity investment from Hearst Communications and
     other Women.com stockholders to enable iVillage to continue to establish,
     expand and support its operations, particularly sales and distribution;
     and

   o the merger and the related agreements will better position iVillage in
     the capital markets due to its improved financial position, strategic
     relationships, and leadership in its online category.

   iVillage's board also identified and considered a number of potentially
negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger and the related
agreements, including the following:

   o the risk that the potential benefits of the merger, including the
     infusion of capital to help iVillage strengthen and expand the business
     of the combined company and the increased advertising value of the
     iVillage network derived from the addition of the Hearst Communications
     magazines, Women.com content and Women.com users, may not be realized;

   o the challenges of integrating Women.com's operations with those of
     iVillage, including combining the respective management teams and
     operational departments of the two companies, consolidating operations
     currently located in different geographic regions, and the substantial
     costs associated with integration;

   o the risk that users, advertisers, sponsors, partners and other third
     parties with whom iVillage and/or Women.com currently do business will
     not continue their relationship with the combined company following the
     merger;

   o the risk that iVillage management will not be able to timely or
     sufficiently reduce operating and other expenditures of the combined
     company in order to achieve operating efficiency and profitability; and

   o the risk that iVillage management will not be able to combine and
     leverage the respective iVillage and Women.com brands and assets in a
     manner that is attractive to users, advertisers and sponsors.

   This discussion of the information and factors considered by iVillage's
board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors
considered. The significant equity investment from Hearst Communications was a
material factor in the iVillage board of directors' determination of whether
or not to approve the merger and the related transactions. The iVillage board
of directors did not consider the possibility that Hearst Communications'
investment and additional commitments would not occur as Hearst
Communications' agreement to such investment was a condition precedent to the
iVillage board's approval of the transactions. iVillage's board did not find
it practicable to, and did not quantify or otherwise assign particular weight
to or rank the specific factors it considered in approving the merger and the
merger agreement. In considering the factors described above, the individual
members of the iVillage board may have given different weight to various
factors. The iVillage board considered all these factors as a whole, and
overall considered them to be favorable to, and to support, its determination.

Recommendation of iVillage's board of directors

   For the reasons discussed above, iVillage's board of directors has approved
the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and has
determined that the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of iVillage and
its stockholders, and recommends that iVillage stockholders vote for approval
of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
including the merger, the issuance of iVillage common stock and warrants to
purchase iVillage common stock pursuant to the amended and restated securities
purchase agreement between iVillage and Hearst Communications and the rights
offering to Women.com stockholders.

Opinion of Women.com's Financial Advisor

   Salomon Smith Barney has acted as the financial advisor to the Women.com
board of directors in connection with the merger. Pursuant to Salomon Smith
Barney's engagement letter dated January 30, 2001, Salomon Smith Barney
rendered an oral opinion to the Women.com board of directors and subsequently
confirmed in writing, that, as of February 5, 2001 and based upon and subject
to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth in the opinion,
its work described below and other factors it deemed relevant, the merger
consideration, including the benefits to be derived from the Hearst
Communications investment following consummation of the merger, was fair to
the holders of Women.com common stock, other than Hearst Communications, from
a financial point of view. Women.com's board of directors believed that the
investment by Hearst Communications was an integral part of the proposed
transaction. As a result, Women.com's board of directors evaluated the
proposed transaction in its entirety, which included the investment by Hearst
Communications, and did not ask Salomon Smith Barney to evaluate the fairness
of the transaction absent the investment by Hearst Communications.

   One of the conditions to Hearst Communications' obligation to make its
investment in iVillage is that the merger between iVillage and Women.com shall
have become effective. Since the merger must be completed before Hearst
Communications is obligated to make its investment, it is possible that,
following the merger, no investment would be made by Hearst Communications.
This could happen, for example, if iVillage is unable to satisfy its
conditions to the closing set forth in the amended and restated securities
purchase agreement or if, after completion of the merger, Hearst
Communications and iVillage mutually agree to terminate the amended and
restated securities purchase agreement. The absence of the investment by
Hearst Communications following the merger would have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the post-merger
combined company.

   The merger agreement and the securities purchase agreement were amended on
February 22, 2001. The merger agreement was amended again on April 27, 2001.
Women.com did not ask Salomon Smith Barney to reconfirm its opinion subsequent
to the amendment of these agreements because Women.com viewed the changes made
by the amendments to be clarifications, not material changes.

   The full text of the written opinion which sets forth the assumptions made,
procedures followed and matters considered by Salomon Smith Barney is set
forth as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and Women.com
stockholders are urged to read Salomon Smith Barney's opinion in its entirety.
The summary of the opinion as set forth in this joint proxy statement/
prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
opinion. Women.com also did not ask Salomon Smith Barney to analyze the merger
consideration without taking into account the Hearst Communications investment
and therefore their opinion does not address the possibility that the merger
could occur without the Hearst Communications investment.

   In arriving at its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney reviewed:

   o a draft of the merger agreement dated as of February 5, 2001;

   o a securities purchase agreement by and between iVillage and Hearst
     Communications dated as of February 5, 2001;

   o a stockholder agreement to be entered into between iVillage and Hearst
     Communications on the closing date of the merger; and

   o an amendment to the Women.com and Hearst Communications content and
     licensing agreement dated February 5, 2001.

   Salomon Smith Barney also held discussions with certain Women.com senior
officers, directors and other representatives and advisors and certain senior
officers and other representatives and advisors of iVillage concerning
Women.com's and iVillage's businesses, operations and prospects. Salomon Smith
Barney examined publicly available business and financial information relating
to Women.com and iVillage, as well as financial forecasts and other
information and data for each that were provided to or otherwise discussed
with Salomon Smith Barney by the managements of Women.com and iVillage
including information regarding strategic implications and operational
benefits anticipated to result from each. Salomon Smith Barney reviewed the
financial terms of the merger as set forth in the draft merger agreement in
relation to, among other things:

   o current and historical market prices and trading volumes of Women.com and
     iVillage common stock;

   o current and historical exchange ratio comparisons;

   o current and prospective capitalization and financial conditions of
     Women.com and iVillage; and

   o implied exchange ratios based upon Women.com's percentage contribution of
     revenues and other metrics to the combined entity.

   Salomon Smith Barney also considered, to the extent publicly available, the
financial terms of other similar transactions recently effected that Salomon
Smith Barney considered relevant in evaluating the merger, and analyzed
financial and stock market data relating to the businesses of Women.com and
iVillage. Salomon Smith Barney also evaluated the relative pro forma financial
impact with respect to the synergies of the merger on the combined company. In
addition, Salomon Smith Barney conducted other analyses and examinations and
considered other information and financial, economic and market criteria as it
deemed appropriate in arriving at its opinion.

   In its review and analysis and in arriving at its opinion, Salomon Smith
Barney assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the information
reviewed by Salomon Smith Barney for the purpose of its opinion and did not
assume any responsibility for independent verification of that information. With
respect to the financial forecasts of Women.com and iVillage, Salomon Smith
Barney assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting best
currently available estimates and judgments of the managements of Women.com and
iVillage, respectively, and Salomon Smith Barney expressed no opinion with
respect to the forecasts or the assumptions on which they are based. Salomon
Smith Barney also has assumed that the merger and the Hearst Communications
investment will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger
agreement and the securities purchase agreement, respectively. Salomon Smith
Barney did not make or obtain or assume any responsibility for making or
obtaining any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets
(including properties and facilities) or liabilities of Women.com or iVillage.

   Salomon Smith Barney's opinion should be read carefully and in its entirety.
It does not imply any conclusion as to the likely trading range for iVillage
common stock following the consummation of the merger or the Hearst
Communications investment, which may vary depending upon, among other factors,
changes in interest rates, dividend rates, market conditions, general economic
conditions and other factors that generally influence the price of securities.
It does not address Women.com's underlying business decision to effect the
merger or the Hearst Communications investment, and Salomon Smith Barney
expresses no view on the effect on Women.com or iVillage of the merger or the
Hearst Communications investment. Salomon Smith Barney's opinion is directed
only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger
consideration, including the benefits to be derived from the Hearst
Communications investment following the consummation of the merger, to the
holders of Women.com common stock, other than Hearst Communications and does
not constitute a recommendation concerning how holders of Women.com common
stock should vote regarding the proposed merger.

   In connection with rendering its opinion to the Women.com board of
directors, Salomon Smith Barney performed several financial analyses, the
material portions of which are summarized below. Salomon Smith Barney believes
that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of
these analyses and the factors it considered, without considering all of these
analyses and factors, could create an incomplete view of the analyses and the
process underlying its opinion. While the conclusions reached in connection
with each analysis were considered carefully by Salomon Smith Barney in
arriving at its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney made various subjective
judgments in arriving at its opinion and did not consider it practicable to,
nor did it attempt to, assign relative weights to the individual analyses and
specific factors considered in reaching its opinion. The following is a
summary of the material financial analyses used by Salomon Smith Barney in
connection with providing its opinion to the Women.com board of directors.
Several of the summaries below include information presented in tabular
format. To fully understand these financial analyses used by Salomon Smith
Barney, the tables must be read with the text of each summary. The tables
alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses.

   Historical Stock Price Performance.  Salomon Smith Barney reviewed the
movements of Women.com common stock and iVillage common stock relative to
their trading volume and price history for the period from January 1, 2000
through February 2, 2001. Salomon Smith Barney noted that during the period
analyzed, Women.com common stock had declined 96% from its 52-week high on
March 7, 2000 of $15.00 per share compared to iVillage's declined depreciation
of 94% from its 52-week high on March 15, 2000 of $27.31 per share. Salomon
Smith Barney also found that the declines in both companies' market
capitalization over the past year were in line with smaller, niche-oriented
online media companies.

   Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis.  Salomon Smith Barney reviewed the
implied historical exchange ratio between Women.com common stock and iVillage
common stock determined by dividing the closing price per share of Women.com
common stock by the closing price per share of iVillage common stock for the
six, three and one month intervals ending February 2, 2001 as well as for the
period from January 1, 2000, through February 2, 2001. The review indicated
that during the periods measured, the closing prices of iVillage common stock
and Women.com common stock implied the following high, low and average
historical exchange ratios:

                             Implied Exchange Ratio

                                                   High    Low    Average
                                                   ----    ----   -------

1 month ........................................   0.41    0.23     0.31
3 months .......................................   0.58    0.18     0.36
6 months .......................................   1.27    0.18     0.41
Since 1/1/2000 .................................   1.27    0.18     0.41

   Salomon Smith Barney noted that the implied exchange ratio of 0.407 based on
the closing stock prices for iVillage and Women.com on February 2, 2001 was
greater than the exchange ratio of 0.322 agreed to in the merger. Salomon
Smith Barney also noted that the exchange ratio of 0.322 is greater than the
low of the exchange ratios calculated over the measured period and greater
than the average exchange ratio during the thirty days ending February 2,
2001. Due to volatility in stock prices, it is customary to view exchange
ratios over a period of time rather than on a single trading day.

   Relative Valuation Analysis. Salomon Smith Barney conducted various
analyses of Women.com and iVillage comparing several indicators of financial
performance on a prospective basis:

   Profit and Loss Performance. The profit and loss performance analysis
analyzed the relative operating performance of iVillage and Women.com on an
annual and quarterly basis for 2000 and as projected for 2001. Salomon Smith
Barney examined the profitability of each company by comparing the cost of
goods sold, sales and marketing and research and development expenses as a
percentage of revenue on a historical basis for each quarter of 2000 and
projected basis for each quarter of 2001. This analysis indicated that, as a
percentage of revenue, Women.com's expenses were consistently higher in the
historical periods and were projected to remain higher during 2001. The
analysis also highlighted iVillage's ability to maintain their revenues during
a difficult market environment while Women.com experienced quarterly declines.

   Cash Burn Analysis. The cash burn analysis compared the cash burn rate of
iVillage and Women.com for the operation of the respective businesses over
each of the four quarters of 2000 and as projected for 2001 to forecast their
respective capital requirements. The cash burn analysis indicated that
iVillage is expected to have more cash than Women.com at the end of 2001
implying a better competitive position for iVillage and its stockholders. This
analysis revealed that iVillage is projected to have positive cash balances
throughout 2001, while Women.com's cash balance is projected to be depleted by
the third quarter of 2001.

   Relative Contribution Analysis. Based upon financial estimates and
projections for Women.com and iVillage, Salomon Smith Barney analyzed the
respective contributions of Women.com and iVillage to the estimated revenues
of the combined company for the fourth quarter of 2000 annualized, calendar
year 2000 and calendar year 2001. Based upon these respective revenue
contributions, Salomon Smith Barney calculated a set of implied exchange
ratios. This set of implied exchange ratios were found by comparing the
relative values contributed to the combined entity by Women.com and iVillage.
In each instance, these relative values were calculated by dividing the
product of the pro forma value of the combined entity and the respective
contribution percentage, minus the respective net debt, by the number of fully
diluted shares of Women.com or iVillage as

appropriate. The result yielded a set of implied exchange ratios that were
then used to imply a stock price based on the closing market price of
Women.com common stock on February 2, 2001. When Salomon Smith Barney compared
this implied stock price to the closing market price of Women.com common stock
on February 2, 2001, it yielded a premium (discount) percentage relative to
the closing market price of Women.com common stock on February 2, 2001.
Salomon Smith Barney noted that given the volatility in stock prices, these
calculations could fluctuate with the fluctuating market price on any
particular day and therefore it is relevant to view the exchange ratios
calculated over a period of time rather than solely on a single trading day.

   In addition, Salomon Smith Barney analyzed the respective contributions of
Women.com and iVillage to the estimated web site unique visitors, page views
and usage hours to the combined company for the month of December 2000 without
any adjustment for potential positive or negative synergies. The following
table shows that these metrics imply a range of exchange ratios of 0.219 to
0.394. Salomon Smith Barney noted that the offered exchange ratio of 0.322 is
within this range of implied exchange ratios. Salomon Smith Barney noted that
these metrics are less relevant because they do not equate to direct measures
of actual revenues or profitability.

   The following table illustrates the implied exchange ratios, stock prices
and premiums for Women.com based upon Women.com's relative contribution to the
combined company's estimated revenues for the fourth quarter of 2000
annualized, calendar year 2000 and calendar year 2001. Salomon Smith Barney
found that this analysis suggested that the estimated revenue contributions of
Women.com implied a range of exchange ratios of 0.163 to 0.236, each of which
are lower than the offered exchange ratio of 0.322.

                                                                             Contribution

    diluted shares outstanding for iVillage and Women.com, respectively.

   Precedent Transaction Analysis. Salomon Smith Barney reviewed publicly
available information for various proposed and completed stock-for-stock
acquisition transactions, all announced since September 20, 1999, that
involved publicly traded companies and that it deemed appropriate in analyzing
the merger. The precedent transactions considered by Salomon Smith Barney were
the following (in each case, the acquiror's name is listed first and the
acquired company's name is listed second):

   o Doubleclick Inc. / @plan.Inc

   o CNET Networks, Inc. / Ziff Davis, Inc. (ZD Net)

   o Media Metrix, Inc. / Jupiter Communications, Inc.

   o Earthlink, Inc. / OneMain.com, Inc.

   o Terra Networks, S.A. / Lycos, Inc.

   o MyPoints.com, Inc. / Cybergold, Inc.

   o America Online, Inc. / MapQuest.com, Inc.

   o CMGI, Inc. / Flycast Communications Corporation

   o MindSpring Enterprises Inc. / Earthlink, Inc.

   o CMGI, Inc. / AdForce, Inc.

   Salomon Smith Barney viewed aspects of each precedent transaction as
comparable to the merger. In general, each precedent transaction involved the
combination of inter-online media companies, where advertising and
subscription are significant components of both the predecessor entities and
the combined entity. In addition, these precedent transactions reflected
similar opportunities for realizing synergies in both revenues and costs
dictated largely by the scale and the similarities of the predecessor
entities. For each precedent transaction, Salomon Smith Barney derived the
target's ratio of pro forma ownership percentage in the newly formed combined
company to its percentage of revenue contributed to the combined company, in
each case the "ownership-to-revenue ratio." The ownership-to-revenue ratio
illustrates the amount of ownership the target received for each 1% of revenue
contributed. In calculating the ownership-to-revenue ratio, Salomon Smith
Barney utilized revenue estimates for the targets' most recently completed
quarter, annualized, and estimates for the following forward fiscal year,
contributed to the combined company without any adjustment for potential
positive or negative synergies.

   With respect to the financial information for the companies involved in the
precedent transactions, Salomon Smith Barney relied on information in publicly
available documents, where available. Salomon Smith Barney noted that the data
it used to perform the analysis for the calendar year 2001 estimates with
respect to Women.com and iVillage were internal projections provided by the
respective managements of these companies. The following table sets forth the
mean and median ratios and pro forma ownership percentages for targets in the
group of precedent transactions analyzed:

                                                                                                                Ownership/

(1) "Forward Year Estimate" is defined as the calendar year revenue estimates
    for the calendar year in which the transaction occurred. It should be noted
    that if the transaction occurred after June 30, the "Forward Year Estimate"
    will be for the calendar year following the year in which the transaction
    occurred.

   Salomon Smith Barney found that the mean pro forma ownership percentage
received by the targets in the precedent transactions was 26.3%. Salomon Smith
Barney noted this analysis showed that based on the offered exchange ratio of
0.322, Women.com stockholders, including Hearst Communications, would receive
approximately 45.2% ownership of the combined entity, an ownership percentage
higher than the mean pro forma ownership percentage received by the targets in
the precedent transactions analyzed. Salomon Smith Barney also found that the
corresponding mean ownership-to-revenue ratio for the targets' most recently
completed quarter, annualized, and the following forward fiscal year were each
86.5% and 75.8%, respectively. Salomon Smith Barney noted that this analysis
showed that based on the offered exchange ratio of 0.322, Women.com
stockholders, including Hearst Communications, would receive an ownership-to-
revenue ratio of 146% for 2000 (its most recently completed quarter,
annualized) and 108% for 2001 (the following forward fiscal year), each a
higher ownership percentage per 1% of revenue contributed than the targets
received in the precedent transactions analyzed.

   Synergies Analysis. Salomon Smith Barney considered the impact of potential
synergies and cost savings expected to be achieved by the management of
Women.com and iVillage in connection with the merger. Based on the financial
information and forecasts discussed with the management of Women.com and
iVillage, Salomon Smith Barney calculated that the merger would have the
following pro forma effects on the revenues and expenses of the combined
company as compared to each company viewed independently:

(4) iVillage cost of goods sold determined by applying Women.com cost of goods
    sold margin.

   Salomon Smith Barney analyzed synergy projections estimated for the year
2000 and 2001 as to the future operating and financial performance of the
combined company. Salomon Smith Barney's pro forma analysis of revenues and
expenses illustrated that relative expenses for sales and marketing and
general administration as a percentage of revenue are substantially higher for
Women.com on its own than it will be for the combined company. In addition,
Salomon Smith Barney's pro forma estimates showed the combined company with an
estimated operating profit of 18.9% in 2001, as compared to a projected 46.3%
and 0.6% operating loss for Women.com and iVillage, respectively.

   The preceding discussion is a summary of the material financial analyses
furnished by Salomon Smith Barney to the Women.com board of directors, but it
does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by
Salomon Smith Barney or of its presentations to the board of directors. The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In addition, the
process of preparing a fairness opinion necessarily requires a broad range of
subjective judgments with respect to appropriate comparable companies,
appropriate multiples of various selected financial data, appropriate discount
rates and other financial and other factors. Analyses and estimates of the
values of companies do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the
prices at which companies or their securities actually may be sold. No
precedent transaction analyzed for comparison is identical to this merger.
Accordingly, any analysis of a precedent transaction is not mathematical;
rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies
involved and other factors that could affect the public trading value of the
target companies or company to which they are being sold. The range of
valuation for any particular analysis should not be taken to be the view of
Salomon Smith Barney of the actual value of Women.com or iVillage.

   The opinion and presentation of Salomon Smith Barney to the Women.com board
of directors, in connection with which Salomon Smith Barney was requested to
evaluate the fairness from a financial point of view of the merger
consideration, including the benefits to be derived from the Hearst
Communications investment following the consummation of the merger, to the
holders of Women.com common stock, other than Hearst Communications, was only
one of many factors taken into consideration by the Women.com board of
directors in making its determination to approve the merger. No limitations
were imposed by the Women.com

board of directors upon Salomon Smith Barney with respect to the investigation
made or the procedures followed by Salomon Smith Barney in rendering its
opinion.

   Salomon Smith Barney is an internationally recognized investment banking
firm that regularly engages in the valuation of companies and their securities
in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings,
competitive bids, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities,
and corporate, estate and other purposes. Women.com retained Salomon Smith
Barney as a financial advisor because of its reputation, expertise in the
valuation of companies and substantial experience in transactions such as the
merger.

   In the past, Salomon Smith Barney has rendered investment banking and
financial advisory services to Women.com for which it has been paid fees.
Pursuant to an engagement letter dated January 30, 2001, Women.com agreed to
pay Salomon Smith Barney a fee upon consummation of the merger. Additionally,
Women.com has agreed to reimburse Salomon Smith Barney for reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses
of Salomon Smith Barney's legal counsel. Women.com has also agreed to
indemnify Salomon Smith Barney and related persons against liabilities,
including liabilities under the federal securities laws, related to or arising
out of its engagement. In the ordinary course of its business, Salomon Smith
Barney and its affiliates may actively trade the securities of Women.com and
iVillage for its own account and the accounts of its customers and,
accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in these
securities.

Opinion of iVillage's Financial Advisor

   At the meeting of the iVillage board on February 2, 2001, Allen & Company
Incorporated delivered its opinion, later confirmed in writing on February 5,
2001, to the effect that, as of that date, the terms of the merger were fair
to iVillage from a financial point of view. iVillage's board of directors
viewed the investment by Hearst Communications as an essential part of the
proposed transaction.  iVillage's board of directors evaluated the proposed
transaction as a whole, including the investment by Hearst Communications.
iVillage therefore did not ask Allen & Company to evaluate the fairness of the
proposed transaction absent the investment by Hearst Communications. The
merger agreement and the securities purchase agreement were amended on
February 22, 2001. The merger agreement was amended again on April 27, 2001.
iVillage did not ask Allen & Company to reconfirm its opinion subsequent to
the amendment of these agreements because iVillage viewed the changes made by
the amendments to be clarifications, not material changes.

   The full text of the written opinion of Allen & Company, dated February 5,
2001, is set forth as Annex C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and
describes the assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review
undertaken. iVillage stockholders are urged to read the opinion carefully and
in its entirety. Allen & Company's opinion is directed only to the fairness to
iVillage, from a financial point of view, of the terms of the merger and does
not constitute a recommendation of the merger over other courses of action
that may be available to iVillage or constitute a recommendation to any
iVillage stockholder on how to vote with respect to the merger. The summary of
the opinion of Allen & Company set forth in this joint proxy statement/
prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
opinion.

   In arriving at its opinion, Allen & Company:

   o reviewed the terms and conditions of the merger, including the draft
     merger agreement and the draft agreements related thereto;

   o reviewed and analyzed publicly available historical business and
     financial information relating to iVillage and Women.com, as presented in
     documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

   o reviewed certain financial, operating and budgetary data provided to
     Allen & Company by iVillage and Women.com relating to their businesses;

   o conducted discussions with certain members of the senior management of
     iVillage and Women.com with respect to the financial condition, business,
     operations, strategic objectives and prospects of iVillage and Women.com,
     as well as prevailing industry trends;

   o reviewed and analyzed public information, including certain stock market
     data and financial information relating to selected public companies in
     lines of business which Allen & Company deemed to be generally

     comparable to iVillage's and Women.com's, as well as analysts' reports
     and estimates for iVillage and Women.com;

   o reviewed the recent trading history of iVillage common stock and
     Women.com common stock, including each company's performance in
     comparison to market indices and to selected companies in comparable
     businesses;

   o reviewed public financial and transaction information relating to
     business combinations which Allen & Company deemed to be comparable to
     the merger;

   o considered premiums and multiples paid in recent transactions which Allen
     & Company deemed comparable to the merger; and

   o conducted other financial analyses and investigations as Allen & Company
     deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of the opinion expressed
     therein.

   In giving its opinion, Allen & Company assumed and relied on the accuracy
and completeness of the information it reviewed for the purpose of its
opinion. Allen & Company did not assume any responsibility for independent
verification of this information or for any independent evaluation or
appraisal of the assets of iVillage or Women.com. Allen & Company assumed that
financial, operating and budgetary data referred to above for iVillage and
Women.com had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the management of iVillage and Women.com.
Allen & Company expressed no opinion with respect to the financial, operating
and budgetary data or the assumptions on which they were based.

   Allen & Company's opinion was necessarily based upon business, market,
economic and other conditions as they existed on, and could be evaluated as
of, the date of its opinion. Allen & Company's opinion does not imply any
conclusion as to the likely trading range of the iVillage common stock
following the consummation of the merger. This may vary depending on, among
other factors, changes in interest rates, dividend rates, market conditions,
general economic conditions and other factors that generally influence the
price of securities.

   Allen & Company also assumed in its analysis that, in all material respects:

   o the representations and warranties of iVillage and Women.com contained in
     the merger agreement were true and correct, iVillage and Women.com will
     perform all of the covenants to be performed by them under the merger
     agreement and all conditions to the consummation of the merger by
     iVillage and Women.com will be satisfied;

   o all material governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents
     required in connection with the consummation of the merger will be
     obtained; and

   o obtaining the required approvals or opinions or consents or amendments,
     modifications or waivers to any agreements to which either iVillage or
     Women.com is a party would not impose any limitation, restrictions or
     conditions or amendments, modification or waivers that would have a
     material adverse effect on iVillage or Women.com or materially reduce the
     contemplated benefits of the merger to iVillage.

   The following is a summary of the presentations made by Allen & Company to
the iVillage board while giving its fairness opinion:

   Status of the Industry. Allen & Company presented an overview of the
current state of the specialized online portal industry. Allen & Company noted
that the industry has recently witnessed severe reductions in market values
and an increase in bankruptcies. The difficult financing environment faced by
Internet companies has led to a decrease in online advertising revenue and a
reduction in the quality of the receivables of advertising-driven online
companies. Allen & Company observed that third parties are projecting
advertising growth in the United States to be slower than previously expected,
due primarily to the loss of dot com advertising revenue. Further, traditional
advertisers have been cautious about spending in online entities without
significant scale or financial resources. This uncertainty has led to a lack
of revenue visibility for most companies supported by online advertising.
Finally, Allen & Company noted that larger companies with funding and scale
will continue to grow market share as undercapitalized companies are forced to
slow expansion or shut down entirely.

   Benefits of the Merger. Allen & Company identified potential benefits of
the proposed merger, including:

   o consolidation of the online women's space;

   o increased advertising concentration;

   o increased scale;

   o increased traffic and revenue opportunities;

   o cost savings due to a reduction in overhead;

   o the cash investment by Hearst Communications; and

   o the continued relationship with Hearst Communications.

   Overview of Women.com. Allen & Company presented an overview of Women.com,
including a description of the content, community, shopping and personalized
services offered by Women.com. Allen & Company reviewed Women.com's historical
operating results for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1997 through 1999,
its estimated operating results for fiscal year 2000 and its budgeted
operating results for fiscal year 2001.

   Allen & Company also reviewed stock price and trading volume data for
Women.com. Allen & Company noted that the general trading patterns of
Women.com common stock have underperformed the NASDAQ Composite Index, Dow
Jones Industrial Average and an index of comparable Internet companies over
the past year.

   Allen & Company also compared selected multiples derived from the February
2, 2001 closing price of Women.com common stock to multiples of a selected
group of publicly traded companies comprised of CNet, Dr. Koop, iVillage,
Market Watch, NBC Internet, Sportsline.com, Star Media and TheStreet.com.
Allen & Company selected these companies because Allen & Company considered
them to have operations similar to the operations of Women.com. Allen &
Company commented that Women.com's stock trades at multiples of revenue, users
and page views below its comparable peers. To illustrate, Allen & Company
highlighted the following multiples:

                                                                                     Revenue          (Millions)
                                                                                   -----------    -------------------
                                                                                                  Unique     Unique
                                                                                    CY     FY1    Users    Page Views
                                                                                   ----   ----    ------   ----------

Enterprise Value Multiples
Maximum........................................................................    5.2x   4.0x    249.1       35.6
Mean...........................................................................    1.9x   1.3x     58.8        6.8
Minimum........................................................................      NM     NM       NM         NM
Women.com......................................................................      NM     NM       NM         NM

Equity Value Multiples
Maximum........................................................................    5.8x   4.3x    383.0       54.7
Mean...........................................................................    2.8x   2.0x     82.0        9.2
Minimum........................................................................    0.7x   0.6x      6.8        0.3
Women.com......................................................................    0.7x   0.5x      3.8        0.1

   These multiples were calculated by dividing either the enterprise value or
the equity value, depending on the stated multiple, by the stated metric. The
enterprise value is equal to the equity value plus total indebtedness less
non-restricted cash (using the latest publicly available balance sheet). The
multiples listed in the "CY" column were calculated using estimated revenue
for the current year. The multiples listed in the "FY1" column were calculated
using estimated revenue for the next fiscal year. In both cases, the estimated
revenue was obtained from publicly available research reports published by
FirstCall Research. "NM" means "not meaningful" and represents multiples that
Allen & Company calculated to be negative and consequently, deemed to have no
relational value to the analysis performed. The "maximum," "mean" and
"minimum" multiples represent the high, average and low, respectively, of all
multiples considered.

   Comparable Transaction Analysis. Allen & Company compared Women.com's
implied transaction enterprise and equity value multiples to publicly
available financial information for twelve selected mergers and acquisitions
in the specialized online portal industry. The transactions analyzed by Allen
& Company were:

   o America Online/Netscape Communications;

   o At Home/Excite;

   o Yahoo/GeoCities;

   o Yahoo/Broadcast.com;

   o NBC/Xoom.com;

   o Walt Disney/Infoseek;

   o Travelocity.com/Preview Travel;

   o CMGI, Inc./Yesmail.com;

   o America; Online/MapQuest.com;

   o Terra Networks/Lycos;

   o InfoSpace/Go2Net; and

   o Primedia/About.com.

   The results of Allen & Company's analysis were as follows:

                                                                                   Revenue            (Millions)
                                                                                -------------    --------------------
                                                                                                 Unique      Unique
                                                                                  CY      FY1     Users    Page Views
                                                                                ------   ----    -------   ----------

Enterprise Value Multiples
Maximum.....................................................................    148.1x     NA    1,048.5        NA
Mean........................................................................     50.2x     NA      285.6        NA
Minimum.....................................................................      4.0x     NA       31.3        NA
Women.com...................................................................      0.2x   0.1x        1.0       0.0
Equity Value Multiples

Mean........................................................................     52.5x     NA      298.9        NA
Minimum.....................................................................      5.3x     NA       41.8        NA
Women.com...................................................................      0.6x   0.4x        3.0       0.1

   These multiples were calculated by dividing either the enterprise value or
the equity value, depending on the stated multiple, by the stated metric. The
multiples listed in the "CY" column were calculated using the trailing twelve
months revenue. Based on its analysis, Allen & Company concluded that the
indicative multiples of revenue, unique page views and unique users for the
proposed merger are at the low end or below the range of multiples paid in
comparable precedent transactions.

   Indicative Premiums Paid. Allen & Company calculated the per share value of
Women.com common stock implied by the merger by multiplying $1.69, which was
the closing price of iVillage common stock on February 2, 2001 (the date Allen
& Company orally delivered its fairness presentation, which was subsequently
confirmed in writing on February 5, 2001), by the exchange ratio of 0.322 and
adding $0.005, which represents cash consideration equal to 1% of the product
of $1.69 and 0.322. Allen & Company noted that the per share value of
Women.com common stock implied by the merger was 20.2% less than the closing
price of the Women.com common stock on February 2, 2001, 12.2% less than the
price of the Women.com common stock one week prior to February 2, 2001 ($0.63)
and 59.7% greater than the Women.com common stock price one month prior to
February 2, 2001 ($0.34). Allen & Company analyzed the premiums paid over pre-
announcement prices in 19 public market merger and acquisition transactions
between $10 million and $50 million in equity value since January 1, 2000. The
transactions analyzed by Allen & Company were:

   o Agritope Inc./Exelixis Inc.;

   o Home Bancorp Inc./Old Kent Financial Corp.;

   o Aquila; Biopharmaceuticals/Antigenics Inc.;

   o Bank Petaluma/Greater Bay Bancorp;

   o Trimark Holdings Inc./Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.;

   o Equality Bancorp/Allegiant Bancorp;

   o Lexington Global Asset Man./ReliaStar Financial Corp.;

   o Marion Capital Holdings/Mutual First Financial;

   o Molecular Biosystems Inc./Alliance Pharmaceutical Corp.;

   o Noodle Kidoodle, Inc./Zany Brainy Inc.;

   o Harbor Federal Bancorp Inc./Provident Bankshares Corp.;

   o Skylands Financial Corp./Fultan Financial Corp.;

   o Milton Federal Financial Corp./BancFirst Ohio;

   o Citation Computer Systems/Cerner Corp.;

   o Cambridge Neuroscience/CeNeS Pharmaceuticals PLC;

   o Fogdog Sports Inc./Global Sports Inc.;

   o BridgeStreet Accomodations/Meristar Hotels & Resorts;

   o Citizens Bancorp/Lincoln Bancorp; and

   o Videonics Inc./FOCUS Enhancements Inc.

   Allen & Company compiled the premiums represented by the acquisition prices
relative to the target companies' share prices one day, one week and one month
prior to the announcement that the target company was to be acquired. The
following table summarizes Allen & Company's results:

                                                                                                Premium Prior to

Women.com ..............................................................................   (20.2%)   (12.2%)   59.7%

Minimum ................................................................................   (12.2%)   (10.2%)   (10.2%)

   Based on the foregoing analysis, Allen & Company concluded that the
indicative premiums paid in the proposed merger are at the low end or below
the range of premiums paid in similar stock-for-stock acquisitions.

   Overview of Combined Company. Allen & Company reviewed the projected pro
forma operating results of the combined company for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2001 and the pro forma balance sheet as of December 31, 2000.
Allen & Company described an analysis of the pro forma ownership of the
combined company resulting from the merger before and after the additional
investment of $20 million by Hearst Communications, noting that the analysis
indicated that iVillage and Women.com would own the following percentages of
the combined company on a fully-diluted basis, using the treasury stock
method, which method assumes that any cash proceeds from the exercise of
options and warrants are used for immediate repurchase of stock on the open
market:

                                                                    Additional
                                                                      Hearst
                                                                  Communications
                                                                    Investment
                                                                  --------------
                                                                  Before   After
                                                                  ------   -----

iVillage .....................................................    66.7%    53.4%
Women.com Holders ............................................    33.3%    46.6%

   The preparation of a fairness opinion is not susceptible to partial analysis
or summary description. Allen & Company believes that its analyses and the
summary set forth above must be considered as a whole and that

selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered by it, without
considering all analyses and factors, could create an incomplete view of the
processes underlying the analysis set forth in its opinion. Allen & Company
has not indicated that any of the analyses which it performed had a greater
significance than any other.

   In determining the appropriate analyses to conduct and when performing those
analyses, Allen & Company made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, financial, market and economic conditions, and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of iVillage and Women.com.
The analyses which Allen & Company performed are not necessarily indicative of
actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or
less favorable than suggested by these analyses. The analyses were prepared
solely as part of Allen & Company's analysis of the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the terms of the merger to iVillage. The analyses do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might
actually be sold or the prices at which any securities may trade at the
present time or at any time in the future.

   Allen & Company is a nationally recognized investment banking firm that is
continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwriting, competitive
bids, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. iVillage
retained Allen & Company based on these qualifications as well as its
familiarity with iVillage. In the ordinary course of its business as a broker-
dealer, Allen & Company may hold positions in and trade in the securities of
iVillage from time to time.

   iVillage entered into an engagement letter agreement with Allen & Company
dated September 28, 1999 and amended on February 22, 2000, in which Allen &
Company agreed to act as iVillage's financial advisor in connection with the
merger and to render an opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the terms of the merger to iVillage. Under the engagement letter,
iVillage agreed to pay a fee to Allen & Company, upon consummation of the
merger. Whether or not the merger is consummated, iVillage has agreed,
according to the engagement letter, to reimburse Allen & Company for all its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including the fees and disbursements of its
counsel, incurred in connection with its engagement by iVillage, and to
indemnify Allen & Company against certain liabilities and expenses in
connection with its engagement.

Interests of Directors and Officers in the Merger that are Different from Your
Interests

   Women.com Directors and Executive Officers

   Upon consummation of the merger, it is anticipated that the directors and
executive officers of Women.com and their affiliates will beneficially own
approximately 3.7% of the then outstanding shares of iVillage common stock,
calculated on the basis set forth under the heading "Information Concerning
Women.com - Principal Stockholders of Women.com."

   As of February 28, 2001, the directors and executive officers of Women.com
held outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of 3,028,293 shares of
Women.com common stock. In addition, William Miller, a non-employee member of
Women.com's board of directors, has received stock options to purchase an
aggregate of 17,500 shares of Women.com common stock. See "The Merger
Agreement - Treatment of Women.com Stock Options" for a description of the
treatment of outstanding Women.com stock options upon consummation of the
merger.

   Marleen McDaniel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Women.com, has an
employment agreement with Women.com under which she will receive severance
benefits in the event that, prior to January 27, 2002, her employment with
Women.com is terminated involuntarily without cause or voluntarily within
sixty days of a material reduction in her responsibilities or compensation or
a relocation of her place of employment by more than fifty miles. These
severance benefits include continuation of base salary and benefits until the
longer of six months from termination or January 27, 2002, and acceleration of
vesting on all options that would have vested as of January 27, 2002.

   A severance and retention plan of up to $5 million is currently being
finalized for Women.com employees. As a result, certain officers of Women.com
may receive severance or retention payments in connection with the merger.

   iVillage has agreed in the merger agreement that all rights to
indemnification existing in favor of those persons who are directors and
officers of Women.com as of the date of merger for their acts and omissions
occurring prior to the effective time of the merger, as provided in
Women.com's bylaws, as in effect as of the date of the merger agreement, and
as provided in the indemnification agreements between Women.com and these
persons, as in effect as of the date of the merger agreement, shall survive
the merger and shall be observed by Women.com to the fullest extent available
under Delaware law for a period of six years from the date of the merger.
iVillage also has agreed to maintain directors' and officers' liability
insurance for Women.com's directors and officers equivalent to Women.com's
current insurance for not less than six years after the effective time of the
merger, subject to certain limitations on the maximum premium payable for this
insurance.

   In connection with the merger, Hearst Communications, the holder of
approximately 46% of the outstanding Women.com common stock, has entered into
an amended and restated securities purchase agreement with iVillage pursuant
to which Hearst Communications has agreed to purchase, for up to $20.0
million, up to 9,324,000 shares of iVillage common stock and warrants to
purchase up to 2,100,000 shares of iVillage common stock, subject to
adjustment as provided in the amended and restated securities purchase
agreement.  In addition, it is a condition to the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the amended and restated securities purchase agreement and the
merger that iVillage and Hearst Communications enter into a stockholder
agreement and a magazine content license and hosting agreement.  Among other
things:

   o the stockholder agreement requires iVillage to appoint three Hearst
     Communications representatives to the iVillage board of directors, one of
     which shall serve on the nominating committee and one of which shall
     serve on the compensation committee, and

   o the magazine content license and hosting agreement requires iVillage to
     pay Hearst Communications a royalty payment based on net advertising
     revenues of at least $3.9 million during the three year term of the
     agreement.

For additional information regarding the amended and restated securities
purchase agreement, the stockholder agreement and the magazine content license
and hosting agreement, see "Agreements between Hearst Communications and
iVillage."

   Four of the members of the Women.com board of directors, James Asher,
Cathleen Black, Mark Miller and Alfred Sikes, are serving in that capacity as
representatives of Hearst Communications.

   As a result of the foregoing, the directors and executive officers of
Women.com may be more likely to vote to approve the adoption of the merger
agreement than Women.com stockholders generally.

   iVillage Directors and Executive Officers

   iVillage does not believe that any of the iVillage directors or executive
officers have interests in the merger that are different from the interests of
iVillage stockholders generally.

   The current iVillage directors and executive officers owned, as of April 16,
2001, approximately 1.5% of the outstanding shares of iVillage common stock,
excluding those shares of iVillage common stock subject to outstanding stock
options.

Exchange of Women.com Stock Certificates for iVillage Stock Certificates

   Each share of Women.com common stock outstanding immediately before the time
of the merger will be converted into the right to receive 0.322 (subject to
adjustment) of a share of iVillage common stock at the time of the merger. In
addition, stockholders of Women.com will receive a cash payment equal to one
percent of the product of the average high and low prices of a share of iVillage
common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the closing date of the merger
multiplied by 0.322 (subject to adjustment). To allow holders of shares of
Women.com common stock to exchange their certificates for certificates of shares
of iVillage common stock, iVillage will deposit with an exchange agent
certificates representing shares of iVillage common stock (plus the cash portion
of the merger consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid
distributions, if any) that will be issued in exchange for the Women.com stock
certificates. The exchange agent will then mail to each holder of shares of
Women.com common stock a transmittal form that will contain instructions for the
surrender of Women.com stock certificates

to be exchanged in the merger. Women.com stockholders who surrender to the
exchange agent their shares of Women.com common stock, along with the
transmittal form, will receive a certificate representing the number of whole
shares of iVillage common stock that they are entitled to receive. These
Women.com stockholders will also receive a check representing the cash portion
of the merger consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any
unpaid dividends and distributions that the stockholder may have a right to
receive.

   The surrendered Women.com certificates will be canceled. If any Women.com
certificates are presented to iVillage or the exchange agent after the merger,
then those certificates will be canceled and exchanged for certificates
representing the shares of iVillage common stock (plus the cash portion of the
merger consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any) that the
holder of the Women.com certificates is entitled to receive under the merger
agreement.

   None of iVillage, the exchange agent or any other person will be liable to
any former Women.com stockholder for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheatment or similar
laws.

Dividend Policy

   iVillage intends to retain all available earnings generated by its
operations for the development and growth of iVillage's business. Since
iVillage's initial public offering, iVillage has not paid cash dividends.
iVillage does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on shares of iVillage
common stock in the foreseeable future. Subject to Delaware law, iVillage's
board of directors will have broad discretion to make any future determination
as to dividend policy. Any determination will depend on a number of factors,
including:

   o future earnings;

   o capital requirements;

   o financial condition;

   o business factors;

   o restrictions contained in iVillage's debt agreements; and

   o any other factors iVillage's board of directors deems relevant.

Women.com's Stock Option and Stock Purchase Plans

   Immediately prior to the effective time, each outstanding option to purchase
shares of Women.com common stock under Women.com's stock option plans subject
to vesting will become fully vested and immediately exercisable.  Women.com
stock options not exercised prior to the effective time will terminate.  No
Women.com stock options will be assumed by iVillage.

   At the effective time, iVillage will issue to the holders of Women.com
common stock options immediately prior to the effective time who are employed
by iVillage at the effective time options to purchase iVillage common stock.
The whole number of iVillage shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of
these options will be determined as follows:

   o if the exercise price per share of the Women.com stock option was $0.25
     or less, the holder of that option will receive options to purchase  1/2
     of one share of iVillage common stock for each share issuable upon
     exercise of his or her Women.com options;

   o if the exercise price per share of the Women.com stock options was more
     than $0.25 but not more than $0.45, the holder of that option will
     receive options to purchase  1/4 of one share of iVillage common stock
     for each share issuable upon exercise of his or her Women.com options;

   o if the exercise price per share of the Women.com stock options was more
     than $0.45 but not more than $1.25, the holder of that option will
     receive options to purchase  1/5 of one share of iVillage common stock
     for each share issuable upon exercise of his or her Women.com options;

   o if the exercise price per share of the Women.com stock options was more
     than $1.25 but not more than $2.00, the holder of that option will
     receive options to purchase  1/6 of one share of iVillage common stock
     for each share issuable upon exercise of his or her Women.com options;
     and

   o if the exercise price per share of the Women.com stock options was more
     than $2.00, the holder of that option will receive options to purchase
     1/7 of one share of iVillage common stock for each share issuable upon
     exercise of your Women.com options;

   Based on the number of Women.com options outstanding as of April 27, 2001,
application of this formula would require iVillage to issue an aggregate of
983,556 options to the former Women.com option holders.

   All shares of iVillage common stock issuable upon exercise these options will
be rounded down to the nearest whole number. The exercise price of these options
will be the closing price of iVillage common stock at the effective time and
will be fully vested on the date of grant. These options will remain exercisable
for the remaining term of the associated Women.com option or until one year
following the option holder's termination by iVillage, whichever occurs first.

   Immediately prior to the effective time, any outstanding purchase rights
under Women.com's Employee Stock Purchase Plan will automatically be exercised
and paid for through accumulated payroll deductions. This will allow
participants to purchase shares of Women.com common stock under the plan prior
to the effective time. This shortened purchase period will expire immediately
following the new purchase date, and the plan will terminate immediately prior
to the effective time.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger

   iVillage intends to account for the merger as a purchase for financial
reporting and accounting purposes, under generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America. After the merger, the results of
operations of iVillage and Women.com will be included in the consolidated
financial statements of iVillage and Women.com. The purchase price will be
allocated based on the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed. Any excess of cost over fair value of the net tangible assets of
Women.com acquired will be recorded as goodwill and other intangible assets
and will be amortized by charges to operations over the expected period of
benefit. These allocations will be made based upon valuations and other
studies that have not yet been finalized.

   If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net
tangible assets of Women.com acquired, the deficiency will be allocated first
to reduce proportionately the values assigned to non-current assets. Should
non-current assets be reduced to zero, any remaining deficiency should be
recorded as a deferred credit and amortized to income over the period of
expected benefit.

   Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are expected to be present at
the iVillage and Women.com special meetings and to be available to respond to
appropriate questions, and will have an opportunity to make a statement if
they desire to do so.

Material Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

   The following are the material United States federal income tax consequences
of the merger, assuming that you are a United States person and hold your
shares of Women.com common stock as capital assets. The following discussion
is based on and subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its
legislative history, applicable Treasury regulations, administrative rulings
and court decisions currently in effect, all of which are subject to change at
any time, possibly with retroactive effect. The following discussion further
assumes that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the provisions
of the merger agreement.

   This discussion does not address all aspects of United States federal income
taxation that may be important to you in light of your particular
circumstances, or if you are subject to special rules, such as rules relating
to:

   o Women.com stockholders who are not citizens or residents of the United
     States;

   o Financial institutions;

   o Tax-exempt organizations;

   o Insurance companies;

   o Mutual funds;

   o Dealers in securities;

   o Women.com stockholders who acquired their shares of Women.com common
     stock by exercising employee stock options or rights or otherwise as
     compensation; and

   o Women.com stockholders who hold their shares of Women.com common stock as
     "qualified small business stock" under Section 1202 of the Internal
     Revenue Code, as "Section 1244 Stock" under Section 1244 of the Internal
     Revenue Code or as part of a hedge, straddle or a constructive sale or
     conversion transaction.

   Women.com and iVillage have structured the merger so that the merger will be
a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes. Provided
that the merger is a taxable transaction, the following federal income tax
consequences will result. Based on the foregoing, as a result of the merger:

   o No gain or loss will be recognized by Women.com as a result of the
     merger.

   o Each Women.com stockholder will recognize gain or loss equal to the
     difference between (i) the sum of the amount of cash received, the fair
     market value of the iVillage stock received (based upon the value of the
     iVillage stock on the date of the merger) and the fair market value, if
     any, of the rights to purchase iVillage common stock and the warrant to
     purchase iVillage common stock distributed in the rights offering (based
     upon the value of such rights and warrant on the date of the merger) and
     (ii) the stockholder's tax basis in the Women.com stock exchanged
     therefor. See "The Rights Offering--Certain Federal Income Tax
     Consequences". This gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss
     and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the stockholder's shares of
     Women.com stock have been held for more than one year at the time of the
     merger.

   o The tax basis of the iVillage common stock received by Women.com
     stockholders in the merger will be equal to its fair market value on the
     date of the merger.

   o The tax holding period of the iVillage common stock that Women.com
     stockholders receive in the merger will begin on the day after the
     merger.

   You will not have any material United States federal income tax consequences
as a result of the rights offering if you decide not to exercise the rights
distributed to you pursuant to the rights offering.  For a discussion of the
material federal income tax consequences of the rights offering see "The
Rights Offering--Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences."

   A Women.com stockholder may be subject to backup withholding at a rate of
31% on the cash payments and fair market value of the iVillage common stock
and rights under the rights offering a Women.com stockholder receives in the
merger. Backup withholding will not apply, however, if a Women.com stockholder
is an exempt recipient (such as a corporation or financial institution) or is
otherwise exempt from backup withholding, if a Women.com stockholder furnishes
its taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to
backup withholding on the appropriate form.

   It is possible that the IRS may assert that the merger constitutes a
"reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
which would result in you not recognizing gain or loss for federal income tax
purposes (except with respect to shares that qualify as dissenting shares
under the Delaware General Corporation Law) and not adjusting your tax basis
to equal the fair market value of iVillage common stock.

   iVillage's obligation to complete the merger is conditioned on, subject to
waiver by iVillage, receipt of a closing tax opinion from Orrick, Herrington &
Sutcliffe LLP, counsel to iVillage, dated the date that the merger is
completed, to the effect that for United States federal income tax purposes no
gain or loss will be recognized by iVillage or its stockholders as a result of
the merger. iVillage does not currently intend to waive the condition relating
to the receipt of a closing tax opinion. Women.com's obligation to complete
the merger is conditioned on, subject to waiver by Women.com, receipt of a
closing tax opinion from Cooley Godward LLP, counsel to Women.com, dated the
date the merger is completed, that addresses the tax treatment of the merger
to the stockholders of Women.com. Specifically, subject to the limitations
described below, Cooley Godward will opine that:

   o each Women.com stockholder will recognize gain or loss equal to the
     difference between:

      o the amount of cash received plus the fair market value of the iVillage
        stock received (based upon the value of the iVillage stock on the date
        of the merger), and the fair market value, if any, of the rights
        received pursuant to the rights offering (based upon the value of the
        rights on the date of distribution), and

      o the stockholder's tax basis in the Women.com stock exchanged therefor;

   o the tax basis of the iVillage common stock received by Women.com
     stockholders in the merger will be equal to its fair market value on the
     date of the merger; and

   o the tax holding period of the iVillage common stock that Women.com
     stockholders receive in the merger will begin on the day after the
     merger.

   Cooley Godward's tax opinion will be subject to the following limitations:

      o the truth and accuracy of all representations and warranties in the
        merger agreement and registration statement, including exhibits
        thereto;

      o authenticity, due and valid execution and delivery of pertinent
        documents relating to the merger;

      o performance of covenants in the merger agreement, including exhibits,
        without waiver or material breach;

      o the opinion is limited to the federal income tax consequences described
        in the tax discussion, including the tax discussion relating to the
        rights offering;

      o the opinion does not address matters dependent on an individual's
        particular circumstances, including the deductibility of any recognized
        losses; and

      o the opinion may be relied on only by Women.com and its stockholders.

   Women.com does not currently intend to waive the condition relating to the
receipt of a closing tax opinion. In addition, neither iVillage nor Women.com
intend to request a ruling from the IRS with respect to the merger.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the
conclusions set forth above or that a court will not sustain a challenge by
the IRS.

   The foregoing discussion is not intended to be a complete analysis or
description of all potential United States federal income tax consequences or
any other consequences of the merger and, except as described herein, does not
address transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to or concurrently with
the merger, other than the rights offering whether or not these transactions
are in connection with the merger. In addition, this discussion does not
address tax consequences which may vary with, or are contingent on, your
individual circumstances. Moreover, this discussion does not address any non-
income tax or any foreign, state or local tax consequences of the merger.
Accordingly, you are strongly urged to consult with your tax advisor to
determine the particular United States federal, state, local or foreign income
or other tax consequences to you of the merger.

Regulatory Filings and Approvals Required to Complete the Merger

   iVillage and Women.com do not believe that there are any material regulatory
or governmental approvals necessary to consummate the merger.

Restrictions on Sale of Shares by Affiliates

   All shares of iVillage common stock that Women.com stockholders will receive
in the merger will be freely transferable, except for shares of iVillage
common stock that are received by persons who are deemed to be "affiliates" of
Women.com under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, at the time of the
Women.com special meeting. These affiliates may resell the shares of iVillage
common stock they receive in the merger in transactions permitted by Rule 145
under the Securities Act or as otherwise permitted under the Securities Act.
Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of Women.com for these purposes
generally include individuals or

entities that control, are controlled by or are under common control with
Women.com, including directors and executive officers of Women.com. Hearst
Communications is considered an affiliate of Women.com, and as such may only
resell the shares it receives in the merger in transactions permitted by Rule
145 of the Securities Act or as otherwise permitted under the Securities Act.
The shares Hearst Communications will receive under the amended and restated
securities purchase agreement in connection with the merger will not be
registered under the Securites Act. As a result, Hearst Communications may not
resell these shares unless they are registered under the Securities Act or
Hearst Communications can rely on an exemption from registration. Because it
will become an affiliate of iVillage after the completion of the merger,
Hearst Communications generally may not resell the shares it receives under
the amended and restated securities purchase agreement for a period of one
year and may only do so afterward in compliance with the requirements of Rule
144 of the Securities Act or as otherwise permitted under the Securities Act.

Rights of Dissenting Women.com Stockholders

   Pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, a
dissenting Women.com stockholder who desires to object to the merger and to
receive the fair value of his or her shares of Women.com common stock in cash
by following the procedure described below may do so by complying with the
provisions of Delaware law pertaining to the exercise of dissenters' rights.
Only those Women.com stockholders entitled to vote on the merger are entitled
to dissent and receive the fair value of their shares. All of the holders of
Women.com's common stock as of the record date are entitled to vote on the
merger and all of the holders may dissent and receive the fair value of their
shares of Women.com common stock. The following is a summary of the applicable
provisions of Delaware law and it is qualified in its entirety by reference to
Delaware law. A copy of the relevant provisions of Delaware law is attached to
this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex D.

   A written demand for appraisal of shares of Women.com common stock must be
delivered to Women.com by a Women.com stockholder seeking appraisal before the
vote on the merger is taken. The written demand must be separate from any
proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against approval and adoption of the
merger. Voting against approval and adoption of the merger, abstaining from
voting or failing to vote with respect to approval and adoption of the merger
will not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262.
By voting against approval and adoption of the merger or by abstaining from
voting in favor of the merger, a Women.com stockholder may preserve his or her
rights of appraisal as a dissenting stockholder.

   Women.com stockholders electing to exercise their appraisal rights under
Section 262 must not vote for approval and adoption of the merger. A vote by a
Women.com stockholder against approval and adoption of the merger is not
required in order for a Women.com stockholder to exercise appraisal rights.
However, if a Women.com stockholder returns a signed proxy but does not
specify a vote against approval and adoption of the merger or a direction to
abstain, the proxy, if not revoked, will be voted for approval and adoption of
the merger, which will have the effect of waiving the Women.com stockholder's
appraisal rights.

   A demand for appraisal will be sufficient if it reasonably informs Women.com
of the identity of the Women.com stockholder and that the Women.com
stockholder intends to demand appraisal. If the Women.com common stock is
owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian, or
custodian, the demand must be executed by the fiduciary. If the Women.com
common stock is owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy
or tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by all joint owners. An
authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute
the demand for appraisal for a Women.com stockholder of record; however, the
agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact
that, in exercising the demand, he or she is acting as agent for the record
owner or owners.

   A Women.com stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights should mail
or deliver his or her written demand to Women.com at its executive offices set
forth under the caption "Summary of the Merger-The Companies" in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus or deliver the demand to Women.com at Women.com's
special meeting. The demand should specify the Women.com stockholder's name
and mailing address and the number of shares of Women.com common stock owned.
It is the responsibility of each Women.com stockholder electing to exercise
appraisal rights to ensure that the written demand is received by Women.com
before the vote is taken at Women.com's special meeting.

   Within ten days after the effective time of the merger, iVillage must
provide notice of the date the merger has become effective to all Women.com
stockholders who have complied with Section 262(d), summarized above, and have
not voted for approval of the merger.

   Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any Women.com
stockholder who has complied with the provisions of Sections 262(a) and (d),
summarized above, is entitled, upon written request, to receive from iVillage
a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Women.com common
stock not voted in favor of approval and adoption of the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and with respect to
which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of
holders of dissenting shares. This statement must be mailed to dissenting
Women.com stockholders within ten days after the written request for it has
been received by iVillage or within ten days after expiration of the time for
delivery of demands for appraisal under Section 262(d), whichever is later.

   Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, either iVillage or
any holder of Women.com common stock who has complied with the required
conditions of Sections 262(a) and (d) and who is otherwise entitled to
appraisal rights may file a petition in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of any
dissenting Women.com stockholders. If a petition for an appraisal is timely
filed, at a hearing on the petition, the court will determine which Women.com
stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights and will appraise the shares of
Women.com common stock owned by those Women.com stockholders, determining the
fair value of those shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with a fair rate of
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
In determining fair value, the court is to take into account all relevant
factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., decided in 1983, the Delaware Supreme
Court, in the context of litigation involving holders of common stock of a
Delaware corporation, expanded the factors that could be considered in
determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of
value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable
in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should be
considered, and that a "[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all
relevant factors involving the value of a company . . . ." The Delaware
Supreme Court stated that in making this determination of fair value the court
must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the
nature of the enterprise and any other facts which could be ascertained as of
the date of the relevant merger which could affect future prospects of the
merged corporation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court held that
"elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are
known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product
of speculation, may be considered."

   Women.com stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that
the fair value of their shares determined under Section 262 could be more
than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration they are to
receive under the merger if they do not seek appraisal of their shares.

   Both fairness opinions and appraisal proceedings review many different
aspects of a company's financial and business circumstances under accepted
valuation techniques, but the perspectives differ. A determination that a
transaction is fair from a financial point of view may be based on a finding
that the price term of a transaction falls within a range of values that would
be fair for other companies involved in similar types of transactions and
circumstances. A finding of this type does not determine what the best
possible price would be, but looks at the transaction as a whole and
determines whether entering the transaction is a reasonable business decision.
In reaching the determination that an offered price is fair from a financial
point of view, consideration is given to the fact that a purchaser of an
entire company may be willing to pay a "control premium" in excess of the fair
market value of the stock. A determination of fair value in an appraisal
proceeding attempts to reduce all of the elements of value of a company to a
set amount rather than focusing on the range of values in similar
transactions. A judicial finding of fair value attempts to ensure that each
dissenting stockholder receives the substantial equivalent of his or her
proportionate interest in a company before the merger occurred. An appraisal
proceeding does not attempt to consider the effects, if any, of the merger
transaction itself on the value of the stock of a company.

   The cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the court and
taxed against the parties as the court deems equitable in the circumstances.
Upon application of a dissenting Women.com stockholder, the court may order
that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any dissenting stockholder
in connection with the

appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged against the value of
shares of Women.com common stock entitled to appraisal. In the absence of a
determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.

   A Women.com stockholder who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with
Section 262 will not, after the effective time of the merger, have any rights
in respect of shares subject to that demand except for appraisal rights and
the right to receive payment of dividends or other distributions, if any, on
shares payable to Women.com stockholders of record as of a date prior to the
effective time.

   At any time within 60 days after the effective time of the merger, a
dissenting Women.com stockholder will have the right to withdraw his or her
demand for appraisal and to accept the terms of the merger. After this period,
a dissenting Women.com stockholder may withdraw his or her demand for
appraisal only with the consent of iVillage. If no petition for appraisal is
filed with the court within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, a
dissenting Women.com stockholder's rights to appraisal will cease. As iVillage
has no obligation to file a petition, a dissenting Women.com stockholder who
desires a petition to be filed is advised to file it on a timely basis. No
petition timely filed in the court demanding appraisal may be dismissed as to
a dissenting Women.com stockholder without the approval of the court, and that
approval may be conditioned upon any terms the court deems just.

   The provisions of Section 262 are technical in nature and complex. Women.com
stockholders desiring to exercise appraisal rights and obtain appraisal of the
fair value of their Women.com common stock should consult counsel, because
failure to comply strictly with the provisions of Section 262 may defeat their
appraisal rights.

Listing on the Nasdaq National Market of Shares of iVillage Common Stock to Be
Issued in the Merger

   It is a condition to the merger that the shares of iVillage common stock
issuable pursuant to the merger be authorized for listing on the Nasdaq
National Market, subject to official notice of issuance. iVillage common stock
is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "IVIL." iVillage
common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq (see risk factor on page 15) and, if
it is delisted prior to completion of the merger, such condition will not be
satisfied and the merger may not be completed.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

   The following is a summary of the material terms of the merger agreement, as
amended as of April 27, 2001. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as
Annex A-1 to this joint proxy statement/prospectus, a copy of the first
amendment to the merger agreement is attached as Annex A-2 to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and a copy of the second amendment to the merger
agreement is attached to Annex A-3 to this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
all of which are incorporated in this document by reference. All references in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus to the merger agreement mean the merger
agreement as amended. This summary is qualified by reference to the merger
agreement. You should read the merger agreement because it, and not this
document, is the legal document that governs the merger.

Merger Structure and Timing

   At the effective time of the merger, Stanhope Acquisition Sub, LLC, a wholly
owned subsidiary of iVillage, referred to in this joint proxy statement/
prospectus as "merger sub," will merge with and into Women.com, which will be
the surviving corporation in the merger and become a wholly owned subsidiary
of iVillage.

   The effective time of the merger will be the time we file the certificate of
merger with the Delaware Secretary of State or at a later time as we may agree
and specify in the certificate of merger. We currently anticipate that we will
complete the merger by the end of May 2001, assuming our stockholders approve
the merger at the special meetings and all other conditions to the merger have
been satisfied or waived.

Merger Consideration

   Exchange Ratio and Cash Consideration.  At the effective time of the
merger, each share of Women.com common stock issued and outstanding immediately
before the effective time of the merger (other than shares of Women.com common
stock held by Women.com, iVillage or the merger sub, which will be canceled and
retired or shares as to which appraisal rights have been demanded, exercised or
perfected in accordance with Delaware law, which shares will be converted into
the right to receive the amount required by Delaware law) will be converted into
0.322 of a share (subject to adjustment as described below) of iVillage common
stock. In addition, stockholders of Women.com will receive a cash payment per
share equal to one percent of the product of the average high and low prices of
a share of iVillage common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the closing
date of the merger multiplied by 0.322 (subject to adjustment as described
below).

   The exchange ratio will be decreased if the shortfall with respect to cash or
working capital of Women.com as of March 31, 2001 was $2.0 million or less, and
Hearst Communications, at its option, may purchase additional shares of iVillage
common stock equal to or less than the shortfall with respect to cash or working
capital, whichever is greater, divided by $1.875, at a purchase price of $1.875
per share. If the shortfall with respect to cash or working capital of iVillage
was more than $2.0 million, but less than $4.0 million, as of March 31, 2001,
then Hearst Communications must purchase additional shares of iVillage common
stock pursuant to the merger agreement for the amount of the shortfall which
exceeds $2.0 million, and Hearst Communications will have the option to purchase
additional shares of iVillage common stock with respect to the shortfall of $2.0
million or less, equal to the shortfall with respect to cash or working capital,
whichever is greater, divided by $1.875. Hearst Communications will pay $1.875
for each share purchased due to any shortfall.

   iVillage may terminate the merger agreement if:

   o  the shortfall is more than $4.0 million as of March 31, 2001;

   o  Women.com's cash on hand immediately prior to the closing of the merger is
      not equal to or greater than the difference between the amount of cash on
      hand as of March 31, 2001 minus the product of $166,666 multiplied by the
      number of days elapsed from March 31, 2001 to the date which is one day
      prior to the date of the closing of the merger; or

   o  working capital immediately prior to the closing of the merger is
      materially less than the difference between the amount of working capital
      as of March 31, 2001 minus the reduction in Women.com's cash on hand since
      March 31, 2001.

   The merger agreement does not specify the manner in which the parties would
determine whether or not such working capital amount is " materially less" than
the difference between the amount of working capital at March 31, 2001 and the
reduction in Women.com's cash since March 31, 2001.

   Fractional Shares. Certificates for fractional shares of iVillage common
stock will not be issued in the merger. Women.com stockholders that would
otherwise receive fractional shares will, instead, be entitled to receive a
cash payment equal to the value of these fractional share interests. The cash
payment for fractional shares is determined by multiplying the per share
closing price of iVillage common stock on the closing date by the fraction of
the share to which the holder is entitled.

Exchange Procedures

   As soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time of the merger, an
exchange agent will mail a letter of transmittal to each holder of record of
Women.com stock certificates. This letter of transmittal must be used in
surrendering Women.com stock certificates to the exchange agent for
cancellation. Upon surrender of a Women.com stock certificate for
cancellation, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal, the holder
of the Women.com stock certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange:

   o an iVillage stock certificate representing the whole number of shares of
     iVillage common stock that the holder has the right to receive;

   o a check representing the cash portion of the merger consideration and the
     amount of cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of iVillage
     common stock, if any; and

   o unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, that the holder has the right
     to receive pursuant to the merger agreement, after giving effect to any
     required withholding tax.

   Women.com stockholders should not send in their Women.com stock certificates
until they receive the letter of transmittal.

   After the effective time of the merger, each Women.com stock certificate,
until surrendered and exchanged, will represent only the right to receive a
certificate representing shares of iVillage common stock and the cash portion
of the merger consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and
unpaid dividends and distributions, if any. Holders of Women.com stock
certificates will not be entitled to receive any dividends or other
distributions declared or made by iVillage having a record date on or after
the effective time of the merger until the Women.com stock certificates are
surrendered for exchange. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of
the Women.com stock certificates, dividends and distributions, if any, will be
paid without interest and less the amount of any required withholding taxes.

Treatment of Women.com Stock Options

   Immediately prior to the effective time, each outstanding option to purchase
shares of Women.com common stock under Women.com's stock option plans subject
to vesting will become fully vested and immediately exercisable.  Women.com
stock options not exercised prior to the effective time will terminate.  No
Women.com stock options will be assumed by iVillage.

   At the effective time, iVillage will issue to the holders of Women.com
common stock options immediately prior to the effective time who are employed
by iVillage at the effective time options to purchase iVillage common stock.
The whole number of iVillage shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of
these options will be determined as follows:

   o if the exercise price per share of the Women.com stock option was $0.25
     or less, the holder of that option will receive options to purchase  1/2
     of one share of iVillage common stock for each share issuable upon
     exercise of his or her Women.com options;

   o if the exercise price per share of the Women.com stock options was more
     than $0.25 but not more than $0.45, the holder of that option will
     receive options to purchase  1/4 of one share of iVillage common stock
     for each share issuable upon exercise of his or her Women.com options;

   o if the exercise price per share of the Women.com stock options was more
     than $0.45 but not more than $1.25, the holder of that option will
     receive options to purchase  1/5 of one share of iVillage common stock
     for each share issuable upon exercise of his or her Women.com options;

   o if the exercise price per share of the Women.com stock options was more
     than $1.25 but not more than $2.00, the holder of that option will
     receive options to purchase  1/6 of one share of iVillage common stock
     for each share issuable upon exercise of his or her Women.com options;
     and

   o if the exercise price per share of the Women.com stock options was more
     than $2.00, the holder of that option will receive options to purchase
     1/7 of one share of iVillage common stock for each share issuable upon
     exercise of your Women.com options;

   Based on the number of Women.com options outstanding as of April 27, 2001,
application of this formula would require iVillage to issue an aggregate of
983,556 options to the former Women.com option holders.

   All shares of iVillage issuable upon exercise these options will be rounded
down to the nearest whole number. The exercise price of these options will be
the closing price of iVillage common stock at the effective time and will be
fully vested on the date of grant. These options will remain exercisable for the
remaining term of the associated Women.com option or until one year following
the option holder's termination by iVillage, whichever occurs first.

   Immediately prior to the effective time, any outstanding purchase rights
under Women.com's Employee Stock Purchase Plan will automatically be exercised
and paid for through accumulated payroll deductions. This will allow
participants to purchase shares of Women.com common stock under the plan prior
to the effective time. This shortened purchase period will expire immediately
following the new purchase date, and the plan will terminate immediately prior
to the effective time.

   iVillage has agreed that, before the effective time of the merger, it will
not enter into any transaction or agreement that would require the consent of
its stockholders other than the proposals submitted to iVillage stockholders
at the special meeting in connection with the merger agreement.

   The merger agreement does not prohibit the actions described above to the

party has otherwise consented in writing.

Competing Acquisition Proposals for Women.com

   Women.com has agreed not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or
encourage, including by way of furnishing material non-public information, or
take any action designed to facilitate, directly or indirectly, any competing
acquisition proposal for Women.com or participate in any discussions or
negotiations concerning an acquisition proposal, or a proposal which may
reasonably lead to an acquisition proposal, for Women.com. Women.com must give
iVillage immediate notice of any proposal which may lead to an acquisition
proposal.

   However, at any time prior to April 6, 2001, Women.com's board of directors
may consider a superior proposal (as defined below), may furnish information
of Women.com to a person making a superior proposal and participate in
discussions of a superior proposal in the exercise of its fiduciary duties if
but only if Women.com's board of directors reasonably determines in good
faith, based on the written advice of independent outside legal counsel, that
it is required to do so to comply with its fiduciary duties to Women.com's
stockholders. Women.com is required to give iVillage immediate notice in
writing of the terms and conditions of the superior proposal, keep iVillage
apprised of the status of any discussions and give iVillage at least 72 hours
advance written notice before it modifies, or proposes publicly to modify, the
recommendation of its board of directors for the approval of the merger. Any
information provided to a person or group in connection with a superior
proposal for Women.com is required to be provided pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement.

   Women.com has also agreed that it will, through its board of directors,
recommend approval of the merger and use its best efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the merger. However, before the date

Women.com's stockholders approve the merger, the Women.com board of directors
may withdraw, modify or change its recommendation regarding the merger if, in
the good faith judgment of the Women.com board of directors based on written
advice of independent outside legal counsel that it must do so in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable law.

   For purposes of the description of the merger agreement in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, "acquisition proposal for Women.com" means, except for
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement:

   o any bona fide proposal or offer from any person relating to any direct or
     indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of the assets of
     Women.com and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more of the
     combined voting power of the shares of Women.com's common stock;

   o any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in
     any other person beneficially owning 20% or more of the combined voting
     power of Women.com's common stock; or

   o any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
     liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Women.com or
     its subsidiaries in which the acquiring person or the acquiring person's
     stockholder(s) will own 20% or more of the combined voting power of
     Women.com.

   For purposes of the description of the merger agreement in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, a "superior proposal" means any proposal made by a third
party:

   o relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of all or
     substantially all of the assets of Women.com and its subsidiaries, taken
     as a whole, or 80% of the combined voting power of the shares of
     Women.com voting stock;

   o relating to any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
     result in any other person beneficially owning 80% or more of the
     combined voting power of Women.com's common stock; or

   o otherwise on terms which the board of directors of Women.com determines
     in its good faith judgment (based upon the advice of a financial advisor
     of nationally recognized reputation), taking into account the person
     making the superior proposal and the legal, financial, regulatory and
     other aspects of the proposal deemed appropriate by the board of
     directors of Women.com (1) is more favorable from a financial point of
     view than the merger to its stockholders, taken as a whole, (2) is
     reasonably capable of being completed and (3) for which financing is then
     committed or is capable of being obtained.

   Before taking any action in connection with a superior proposal for
Women.com, Women.com is required to immediately notify iVillage orally and in
writing of any requests for information or the receipt of any acquisition
proposal for Women.com or, which could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
acquisition proposal for Women.com, including the identity of the person or
group engaging in the discussions or negotiations, requesting the information
or making the competing acquisition proposal for Women.com, and the material
terms and conditions of any acquisition proposal for Women.com. Women.com is
required to keep iVillage fully informed on a timely basis of the status and
details of a superior proposal as well as any related discussions or
negotiations.

Additional Agreements

   iVillage and Women.com have also agreed that:

   o they will allow each other access to their financial, business and other
     information, subject to the confidentiality agreement signed by both
     parties;

   o they will notify each other of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any
     event which would be likely to cause any representation or warranty to be
     untrue or inaccurate and any failure to comply with or satisfy any
     covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
     in the merger agreement;

     recommend an acquisition proposal or an acquisition agreement, except as
     set forth above in "Competing Acquisition Proposals for Women.com," and
     either iVillage or Women.com may take and disclose to its stockholders
     pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act a position with
     respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party, which is
     consistent with its obligations under the merger agreement or make a
     disclosure of this type to its stockholders, if, in the reasonable good
     faith judgment of the board of directors after receiving advice from
     independent outside legal counsel, is consistent with its obligations
     under the merger agreement and is required by applicable law;

   o Women.com will give iVillage the opportunity to participate in the
     defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against Women.com and

     other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as soon as
     practicable after February 5, 2001;

   o they will each use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all

     merger;

     becomes operative, and to minimize the effects of any antitakeover
     statute;

   o Women.com shall have provided iVillage with a Foreign Investment and Real
     Property Tax Act of 1980 Notifications Letter and a notice in accordance
     with Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2).

             AGREEMENTS BETWEEN HEARST COMMUNICATIONS AND iVILLAGE

General

   In addition to the voting agreement described above under "The Voting
Agreements," iVillage and Hearst Communications entered into a securities
purchase agreement dated as of February 5, 2001 and amended and restated as of
February 22, 2001 and, as a condition to the closing of the merger, will enter
into a stockholder agreement and a magazine content license and hosting
agreement. The following is a summary of certain provisions of the amended and
restated securities purchase agreement, the stockholder agreement and the
magazine content license and hosting agreement.

The Amended and Restated Securities Purchase Agreement

   Overview. Pursuant to the amended and restated securities purchase
agreement, Hearst Communications will pay to iVillage an aggregate purchase
price of up to $20.0 million for up to 9,324,000 shares of iVillage's common
stock and a warrant (with an exercise price of $0.01 per share) to purchase up
to 2,100,000 shares of iVillage's common stock. The warrant is exercisable at
any time prior to December 31, 2004, but only if the average closing price of
iVillage common stock exceeds $3.75 for at least fifteen consecutive trading
days. Under the amended and restated securities purchase agreement, iVillage
agreed to conduct a rights offering upon the terms described in "The Rights
Offering." Hearst Communications has agreed to reimburse iVillage for expenses
related to the rights offering that exceed $100,000. The closing of the
transactions contemplated by the amended and restated securities purchase
agreement will occur concurrently with the closing of the merger unless the
closing conditions specified in the amended and restated securities purchase
agreement have not been satisfied or waived (in which case the closing would
occur as soon as practicable after those conditions are satisfied or waived,
unless the amended and restated securities purchase agreement is terminated).

   The number of shares of iVillage common stock to be purchased by Hearst
Communications, and the aggregate purchase price, under the amended and
restated securities purchase agreement are subject to adjustment as described
below under "-Additional Purchase Obligations" and "The Merger Agreement-
Merger Consideration." Additionally, the number of shares of iVillage common
stock and warrants to purchase iVillage common stock to be purchased by Hearst
Communications under the amended and restated securities purchase agreement,
and the aggregate purchase price will be reduced on a one-for-one basis by the
number of shares of iVillage common stock and warrants to purchase iVillage
common stock purchased by the other Women.com stockholders in the rights
offering.

   Representations and Warranties. Both iVillage and Hearst Communications

     iVillage contained in the amended and restated securities purchase
     agreement and the information filed by iVillage with the Securities and
     Exchange Commission.

   Closing Conditions. The obligation of each party to consummate the

agreement are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following
conditions:

   o the absence of any pending or threatened injunction or governmental order
     prohibiting the transaction;

   o the receipt of all necessary governmental approvals; and

   o the merger shall have become effective.

   In addition, Hearst Communications' obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the amended and restated securities purchase
agreement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following
conditions:

   Covenants. Under the amended and restated securities purchase agreement,
iVillage and Hearst Communications covenant that they will:

   o use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary approvals and
     authorizations and to make all necessary filings;

   o obtain the other party's approval prior to making any public announcement
     regarding the transactions contemplated by the amended and restated
     securities purchase agreement;

   o execute and deliver additional documents and take further actions as
     necessary to carry out the terms of the amended and restated securities
     purchase agreement; and

   o cooperate with each other to consummate, as promptly as possible, the
     transactions contemplated by the amended and restated securities purchase
     agreement.

   Termination. The amended and restated securities purchase agreement may be
terminated if both iVillage and Hearst Communications consent in writing to
termination of the agreement. In addition, either party may terminate the
agreement if:

   o the transaction does not close by June 30, 2001;

   o the closing conditions set forth in the amended and restated securities
     purchase agreement are not satisfied;

   o there is a governmental order prohibiting the transaction; or

   o the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to its own terms.

   Indemnification. iVillage and Hearst Communications will indemnify each
other for breaches by the other party of representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in the amended and restated securities
purchase agreement, the stockholder agreement and the warrant. iVillage and
Hearst Communications will not indemnify each other for breaches by the other
party of representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the
magazine content license and hosting agreement, which contains its own
indemnification provisions.

   Additional Purchase Obligations. The amended and restated securities
purchase agreement provides that if Women.com stockholders holding in excess
of two percent of the number of shares of Women.com common stock outstanding
as of the record date for the Women.com special stockholders meeting exercise
dissenters' rights in connection with the merger, iVillage can require Hearst
Communications to purchase additional shares of iVillage common stock at a
price of $1.875 per share.  See "The Merger-Rights of Dissenting Women.com
Stockholders" for information regarding Women.com stockholders' dissenters'
rights.  The number of shares of iVillage common stock that Hearst
Communications would be required to purchase in that event would equal the
number of Women.com dissenting shares in excess of two percent of the
outstanding Women.com shares as of the record date for the Women.com special
stockholders meeting multiplied by the exchange ratio of 0.322 (subject to
adjusstment).

Stockholder Agreement

   As a condition to the closing of the merger, iVillage and Hearst
Communications will enter into a stockholder agreement. The stockholder
agreement sets forth certain obligations, restrictions and limitations
relating to the securities purchased by Hearst Communications pursuant to the
merger agreement and the amended and restated securities purchase agreement.
The stockholder agreement applies to all voting securities of iVillage owned
by Hearst Communications on the date of the agreement and all voting
securities of iVillage subsequently acquired by Hearst Communications. The
following is a summary of the material terms of the stockholder agreement.

   Purchase Restrictions. The stockholder agreement places a cap on the number
of iVillage voting securities that Hearst Communications and its affiliates
may own. This cap may be exceeded only with (i) the unanimous written consent
of the iVillage board of directors or (ii) the approval of all of the non-
Hearst Communications board designees present at a meeting of the iVillage
board of directors at which a quorum is present. Under the stockholder
agreement, Hearst Communications and its affiliates will be prohibited from
owning voting securities of iVillage in excess of a specified percentage of
the total number of iVillage voting securities outstanding at any time. This
specified percentage, which will not be calculated until the closing of the
merger, will be determined by:

   o calculating the total number of outstanding iVillage voting securities
     owned by Hearst Communications or its affiliates on the closing date of
     the merger and the total number of outstanding convertible securities,
     options, warrants or other rights exercisable for or convertible into
     iVillage voting securities, with or without the passage of time or the
     satisfaction of specified conditions, owned by Hearst Communications or
     its affiliates on the closing date of the merger; and

   o dividing the number calculated in the manner described above by the sum
     of the total number of iVillage voting securities outstanding on the
     closing date of the merger and the number of shares of iVillage voting
     securities represented by warrants for iVillage common stock held by
     Hearst Communications or its affiliates on the closing date of the
     merger.

   Assuming that:

   o no Women.com stockholders participate in the rights offering;

   o Hearst Communications is not required to, and does not elect to, purchase
     additional iVillage common stock pursuant to the merger agreement;

   o there are 54,228,025 shares of iVillage common stock outstanding after
     the merger; and

   o Women.com stockholders holding in excess of two percent of the number of
     shares of Women.com common stock outstanding as of the record date for
     the Women.com special stockholders meeting do not exercise dissenters'
     rights in connection with the merger,

the cap would equal 32.6% and Hearst Communications and its affiliates would
be prohibited from owning iVillage voting securities or securities convertible
into or exercisable for iVillage voting securities in excess of 32.6% of the
total number of outstanding iVillage voting securities.

   Restrictions on Stockholder Activities. The stockholder agreement provides
that unless Hearst Communications obtains (i) the unanimous written consent of
iVillage's board of directors or (ii) the approval of all of the non-Hearst
Communications board designees present at a meeting of the iVillage board of
directors at which a quorum is present, Hearst Communications may not, as it
relates to iVillage, initiate or engage in proxy solicitations, solicit
stockholders or induce others to do so, initiate stockholder proposals or
tender offers, call stockholders' meetings, act by written consent or place
any voting securities in a voting trust or other voting agreement.

   Quorum Obligations. The stockholder agreement requires Hearst
Communications and each of its affiliates to be present in person or
represented by proxy at all iVillage stockholder meetings so that their
iVillage shares may be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum.

   Voting Obligations. The stockholder agreement allows Hearst Communications
to vote their iVillage shares as they wish so long as the aggregate amount of
their shares does not exceed 25% of the outstanding iVillage voting securities
as of the date of the calculation. However, any voting securities held by
Hearst Communications or its affiliates in excess of 25% of the outstanding
voting securities must be voted by Hearst Communications and its affiliates in
the manner recommended to iVillage stockholders by (i) the unanimous written
consent of iVillage's board of directors or (ii) the non-Hearst Communications
board designees present at a meeting of the iVillage board of directors at
which a quorum is present. This 25% threshold will be increased to the extent
Hearst Communications is required to purchase additional shares of iVillage
common stock as discussed above under "--The Amended and Restated Securities
Purchase Agreement--Additional Purchase Obligations."

   Board Representation. Effective upon the closing, the stockholder agreement
requires iVillage to appoint three representatives of Hearst Communications to
separate classes of the iVillage board of directors. iVillage must appoint one
of these board members to the nominating committee and one to the compensation
committee. In addition, the stockholder agreement requires iVillage to appoint
five independent directors to the board. An independent director is defined as
any person who is not and has not been for the past three years affiliated
with Hearst Communications or its affiliates or an employee of iVillage or any
of its subsidiaries.

   So long as Hearst Communications or its affiliates holds at least 10% of the
outstanding voting securities of iVillage, Hearst Communications may recommend
and iVillage's nominating committee must recommend to the iVillage board that
number of nominees of Hearst Communications or its affiliates as follows:

   o so long as Hearst Communications holds at least 80% of its initial equity
     investment, Hearst Communications may designate three nominees;

   o so long as Hearst Communications holds at least 66%, but less than 80%,
     of its initial equity investment,  Hearst Communications may designate
     two nominees;

   o so long as Hearst Communications holds at least 10% of the voting
     securities of iVillage, but less than 66% of its initial equity
     investment, Hearst Communications may designate one nominee.

   Hearst Communications' initial equity investment is determined as follows:

   o first, determine the number of iVillage voting securities (including
     securities convertible into or exercisable for iVillage voting
     securities) held by Hearst Communications and its affiliates immediately
     following the closing of the merger;

   o second, divide the number calculated in the manner described above by the
     sum of the total number of outstanding iVillage voting securities as of
     the closing date of the merger and the number of voting securities
     issuable upon conversion or exercise of any other iVillage securities
     held by Hearst Communications or its affiliates as of the closing date of
     the merger; and

   o third, multiply the percentage resulting from steps one and two above by
     the sum of the total number of iVillage voting securities outstanding as
     of the date of the determination and the number of shares of iVillage
     common stock issuable upon exercisable of any warrants held by Hearst
     Communications or its affiliates.

   Hearst Communications currently owns 21,576,447 shares of Women.com. If the
exchange ratio remains at 0.322, those shares would be converted into 6,947,615
shares of iVillage common stock in connection with the merger. If no Women.com
stockholders participate in the rights offering and Hearst Communications makes
the entire $20.0 million investment in iVillage pursuant to the amended and
restated securities purchase agreement, Hearst Communications would acquire an
additional 9,324,000 shares of iVillage common stock, which would increase its
total share ownership in iVillage to 16,271,615 shares. Hearst Communications
would also hold the warrant, acquired pursuant to the amended and restated
securities purchase agreement, which would entitle it to purchase an additional
2,100,000 shares of iVillage common stock if the exercise conditions of the
warrant are met.

   Based on the above assumptions, Hearst Communications' initial equity
investment would be determined as follows:

   o first, determine the number of iVillage voting securities held by Hearst
     Communications immediately following the closing of the merger.  This
     number, which would include the shares issuable upon exercise of the
     warrant and the shares purchased under the amended and restated
     securities purchase agreement, would equal 18,371,615.

   o second, divide 18,371,615 by the sum of the total number of post-merger
     iVillage voting securities and the number of voting securities issuable
     upon exercise of the warrant held by Hearst Communications.  Based on the
     number of outstanding shares of iVillage as of February 5, 2001 and the
     number of outstanding shares of Women.com common stock as of February 28,
     2001, and assuming an exchange ratio of 0.322 and a $20.0 million
     investment in iVillage by Hearst Communications, there would be
     66,142,978 shares of iVillage common stock outstanding immediately
     following the merger.  The sum of 66,142,978 and 2,100,000 (the number of
     shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant) is 68,242,978.  To complete
     the second step of this calculation, we would divide 18,371,615 by
     68,242,978, which results in 0.269.

   o third, to calculate Hearst Communications' initial equity investment, we
     would multiply 0.269 and 68,242,978, which is 18,357,361.

   Hearst Communications' initial equity stake would be increased to the extent
it is required to, or elects to, purchase additional shares of iVillage common
stock under the merger agreement as a result of a shortfall in Women.com's cash
or working capital or the exercise of dissenters' rights by the holders of more
than two percent of the outstanding Women.com common stock. For example, if
Hearst Communications purchased the maximum amount as a result of a cash or
working capital shortfall, it would acquire an additional 2,133,333 shares of
iVillage common stock, which would increase its initial equity investment to
20,479,506. If Hearst Communications also purchased the maximum amount as a
result of the exercise of dissenters' rights by the holders of three percent of
the outstanding shares of Women.com common stock, it would acquire an additional
152,160 shares of iVillage common stock, which, when combined with the amount
purchased in the previous example, would increase its initial equity stake to
20,631,666.

   If, after the election of directors pursuant to the above requirements, the
number of voting securities held by Hearst Communications decreases below the
stated thresholds, any excess directors must immediately resign. If the number
of voting securities held by Hearst Communications falls below ten percent
(10%) of the initial equity investment, all Hearst Communications designated
board members must immediately resign and all quorum and voting obligations
cease. However, if the number of voting securities held by Hearst
Communications returns to 10% or more of the initial equity investment, all
rights and obligations under the agreement revive for the duration of the term
of the agreement.

   The stockholder agreement also provides that if iVillage issues voting
securities in a single transaction or a series of related transactions and the
number of iVillage voting securities outstanding immediately after that
transaction or series of related transactions:

   o is greater than 20% but less than 40%, then, at the request of iVillage,
     Hearst Communications and its affiliates must cooperate with iVillage and
     take all action reasonably necessary to increase the size of the iVillage
     board of directors to 11 and to fill the vacancy resulting therefrom with
     an independent director; or

   o is equal to or greater than 40%, then, at the request of iVillage, Hearst
     Communications and its affiliates must cooperate with iVillage and take
     all action reasonably necessary to increase the size of the iVillage
     board of directors to 12 and to fill the vacancies resulting therefrom
     with two independent directors.

In either case, the independent directors appointed as a result of the
increased board size must be approved by either the unanimous written consent
of the iVillage board of directors or all members of the iVillage board of
directors at any properly noticed board meeting at which a quorum is present,
including all of the non-Hearst Communications board designees present at the
meeting.

   Transfer Restrictions. Except for certain permitted transfers, for so long
as Hearst Communications and its affiliates own voting securities representing
at least 10% of iVillage's outstanding voting securities, Hearst
Communications may not transfer any voting securities of iVillage without (i)
the approval of all of the non-Hearst Communications directors present at a
meeting of the board of directors of iVillage at which a quorum is present or
(ii) the unanimous written consent of the iVillage board of directors. The
following transfers will be

permitted without the approval of the non-Hearst directors or the unanimous
written consent of the iVillage board of directors:

   o a pledge of voting securities pursuant to a bona fide loan transaction
     that creates a mere security interest;

   o a repurchase of voting securities by iVillage;

   o a bona fide gift of voting securities;

   o a sale or transfer of voting securities to a third party that does not
     result in the third party holding more than 10% of iVillage's voting
     securities;

   o a sale or transfer of voting securities pursuant to a tender offer or
     exchange approved by the board of directors;

   o a sale or transfer of voting securities in connection with a merger or
     consolidation approved by the iVillage board of directors; and

   o a sale or transfer in connection with the sale of all or substantially
     all of iVillage's assets approved by the iVillage board of directors.

   In the case of pledges and gifts, Hearst Communications must notify iVillage
in advance and the transferee must agree to be bound by the stockholder
agreement. In addition, without obtaining approval from the non-Hearst
Communications members of the board of directors, Hearst Communications may
transfer voting securities to its affiliates provided that the affiliates
agree to be bound by the terms of the stockholder agreement. In the event that
Hearst Communications ceases to own or control at least 80% of the affiliate
or ceases to control the management or policies of the affiliate, the
affiliate will lose all ownership and voting rights in the voting securities
and will be required to transfer them back to Hearst Communications.

   Term. The stockholder agreement expires in five years unless earlier
terminated by mutual written consent of iVillage and Hearst Communications.
Upon any early termination, any Hearst Communications designees serving on the
iVillage board of directors must resign immediately.

Magazine Content License and Hosting Agreement

   Pursuant to the merger, iVillage will assume an amended and restated
magazine content license and hosting agreement, which was originally entered
into between Women.com and Hearst Communications. Under this agreement, and an
amendment number two to the agreement which iVillage and Hearst Communications
intend to execute upon the closing of the merger, iVillage will provide
production and hosting services for certain web sites affiliated with selected
Hearst magazines, including Good Housekeeping, Redbook, Cosmopolitan and
Country Living. These sites will be part of the iVillage network. The magazine
sites will be on URL's owned by Hearst Communications.

   Under the agreement, as amended, iVillage agrees to provide to Hearst
Communications website production and hosting services, including the creation
of original site content which will be owned by Hearst Communications. In
consideration for these services, Hearst Communications agrees to:

   o pay iVillage at least $5.0 million per year for production services
     during the three-year term of the agreement, for a total of at least
     $15.0 million;

   o place at least $2.0 million of Hearst Communications advertising per year
     (total of at least $6.0 million) on the network, which amount may be
     increased in the second and third years of the agreement if Hearst
     Communications fails to pay iVillage the required fees for production
     services as described above. If a shortfall in production fees occurs in
     the second and third years of the agreement, Hearst Communications must
     place additional advertising in an amount equal to 40% of the production
     fee shortfall; and

   o grant to iVillage a right of first offer on any new internet-based
     development projects initiated by Hearst Communications that are
     appropriate for inclusion on the network.

   iVillage will not be required to pay any monies under its agreement to
provide Hearst Communications website production, content and hosting
services. If those services are provided, they will be provided to Hearst

Communications by iVillage's internal production and technology staff in
exchange for the payments described in the agreement.

   The agreement also provides for revenue sharing between iVillage and Hearst
Communications with respect to advertising revenues obtained by iVillage from
the Hearst magazine websites and other iVillage websites containing
substantial Hearst content. This revenue sharing arrangement requires that
iVillage pay Hearst Communications a royalty payment based on net advertising
revenues of at least $3.9 million during the three year term of the agreement.
This amount is reducible pro rata if Hearst Communications fails to expend the
$5.0 million in production fees in the second and third years of the
agreement.

   Exclusivity. Pursuant to the agreement, iVillage agrees that it will not,
without the prior written consent of Hearst Communications:

   o enter into any agreement to include in iVillage's network of websites any
     sites for magazines that compete with the Hearst magazines listed in the
     agreement;

   o display on the magazine websites any advertising or other promotional
     materials from magazines that compete with the Hearst magazines listed in
     the agreement;

   o display on an iVillage webpage the brands, logos, trademarks or
     proprietary content of both Hearst Communications and a Hearst
     Communications competitor.

   Under the agreement, Hearst Communications agrees that it will not enter
into, with an iVillage competitor, any internet distribution agreements that
relate to Hearst content covered by the agreement nor will it grant any entity
the right to display on the internet content that has appeared on the magazine
websites in substantially the same form and format as it appeared on the
magazine website (other than materials posted on the website verbatim to the
way they were initially published by Hearst Communications). However, Hearst
Communications is permitted to license the content or trademarks of its
magazines to any internet site or portal that is not deemed to be an iVillage
competitor, subject only to the  restrictions in the foregoing sentence, and
to use the Hearst content in international editions of its magazine and on the
internet. The agreement defines an iVillage competitor to include any internet
site, channel, area or online content aggregation service that provides
content primarily for women, is targeted primarily at women, is used primarily
by women and is primarily targeted to any country or region in the world where
iVillage is targeted.

   Warranties. In the agreement, Hearst Communications warrants that it will
not provide any content to iVillage or publish any content that, and iVillage
warrants that it will not post to the magazine websites any content that:

   o infringes on any third party's proprietary rights or rights to publicity
     or privacy;

   o violates any law, statute, ordinance or regulation;

   o is defamatory, trade libelous, unlawfully threatening or harassing;

   o is obscene or pornographic;

   o violates any laws regarding unfair competition, antidiscrimination or
     false advertising; or

   o to the best of the party's knowledge, contains any viruses or other
     damaging computer problems.

   Term. The term of the magazine content license and hosting agreement will
be three years from the effective date of the amendment. However, the
agreement may be terminated by either party immediately upon written notice if
the other party:

   o becomes the subject of any proceeding relating to insolvency,
     receivership or liquidation;

   o files or has filed against it a petition in bankruptcy that is not
     discharged within 30 days;

   o makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or

   o admits in writing its inability to pay debts as they become due.

   In addition, either party has the right to terminate the magazine content
license and hosting agreement in the event of a "change of control" of the
other party. A "change of control" is defined in the magazine content license
and hosting agreement to mean: (i) a sale of all or substantially all of the
assets of iVillage; (ii) a merger or consolidation of iVillage with or into
another corporation or entity with the effect that, immediately after the
merger or consolidation, none of the existing holders of iVillage voting stock
immediately before the  merger or consolidation holds, and the existing
holders of iVillage voting stock immediately before the merger or
consolidation do not hold, in the aggregate, at least 50% of the combined
voting power of the then voting stock of the surviving corporation of the
merger or the corporation or other entity resulting from the consolidation,
(iii) the acquisition of 20% or more of the voting stock of iVillage by an
entity other than Hearst Communications, (iv) the adoption by iVillage of a
plan of complete or partial liquidation or (v) certain bankruptcy events.

   iVillage believes that user support is critical in order to attract and
retain users. iVillage provides user support primarily through e-mail-based
correspondence. Help and feedback buttons are prominently displayed throughout
iVlllage.com, and iVillage.com's user support staff attempts to respond to all
e-mail queries within 24 hours. In addition, community leaders provide e-mail
support for broad-ranging issues. iVillage does not charge for these services.

   Sponsorship and Advertising Revenues

   iVillage has derived a significant amount of its revenues to date from the
sale of sponsorships and advertisements. For the years ended December 31, 2000
and 1999 sponsorship and advertising revenues represented 92% and 95%,
respectively, of iVillage's revenues.

   iVillage's strategy is focused in part on generating a majority of its
advertising revenues from sponsors and merchants who seek a cost-effective
means to reach women online. iVillage is aggressively working to build its
leadership position as the preeminent women's brand to the advertising
community. iVillage's sponsorship arrangements typically differ from
traditional banner advertising in that they are designed to achieve broad
marketing objectives such as brand promotion, awareness, product introductions
and online research. Sponsorships allow iVillage to cater to the specific
goals of advertisers in the areas of impressions, product research, market
research, new product launches, list development, product information,
repositioning, new

account openings, lead generation and transactions. Sponsors also have the
opportunity to develop a dialogue with their key consumer prospects through
iVillage's message boards, chats, polls and special events, which allows
sponsors the opportunity to gain insights into their customers. iVillage's
sponsorship arrangements generally have longer terms than typical banner
advertising placements, provide for higher cost per thousand impressions per
advertiser and independence from page-views as the sole measure of value. In
addition, iVillage occasionally develops extensive content to support the
marketing initiatives of advertisers. iVillage's sponsorship agreements can be
exclusive. However, iVillage believes that the combined company will not have
to terminate any advertising or sponsorship agreement after the merger as a
result of these exclusive relationships.

   iVillage also derives a smaller portion of its sponsorship and advertising
revenues from banner advertisements that are prominently displayed at the top
and bottom of pages throughout iVillage.com. From each banner advertisement,
viewers can hyperlink directly to the advertiser's own Web site, thus
providing the advertiser the opportunity to directly interact with an
interested customer.

   During the first quarter of 2001, iVillage began to offer research to its
sponsors, advertisers and other customers for a fee. Through third party
vendors and internal staff, iVillage provides customers with research that
measures the effectiveness of online advertising and related topics. This
allows iVillage's sponsors and advertisers to help make their online marketing
campaigns more effecitve prior to launching any wide scale initiatives and
provides other customers with important demographic information. Since
iVillage has only recently launched this initiative, iVillage has not received
a significant portion of sponsorship and advertising revenues from paid
research.

   During the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, iVillage's five largest
advertisers accounted for approximately 23% and 20%, respectively, of its
total revenues. At December 31, 2000, Ford Motor Media accounted for
approximately 11% of the net accounts receivable, and at December 31, 1999, no
advertiser accounted for more than 10% of the net accounts receivable.

   Membership

   iVillage believes a large and active membership base is critical to its
success. Some features of iVillage's Web sites are restricted to members.
Membership is free and available to iVillage.com visitors who disclose their
names, e-mail addresses, zip codes, ages and gender and choose a member name
and password to be used throughout member-only areas. Members form
iVillage.com's core audience and are its most valuable users. E-mail, instant
messaging, community challenges, message boards and chats are examples of
members-only benefits.

   iVillage recognizes the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of
member information and has a privacy policy to protect this information. In
addition, iVillage Health is a founding member of the Health Internet Ethics,
or Hi-Ethics, organization. iVillage's current privacy policy is accessible
through a link from the iVillage.com home page as well as every Web page on
iVillage.com, including the page where a person initially registers for
membership. iVillage's current policy is to never sell or disclose to any
third party any member's personal identifying information such as his or her
name or address, unless the member has provided consent in the form of an
"opt-in" or in certain limited situations as described in iVillage's privacy
policy. For example, in some situations, iVillage does allow a third-party
partner access to database information if it is necessary for the delivery of
a member service, such as e-mail. In these instances, the partner has
generally agreed to be bound by iVillage's current policy. iVillage does share
aggregated member information with third parties, such as average age or
geographic dispersion. iVillage also reserves the right to offer members
products and services. iVillage may use information revealed by members and
information built from user behavior to target advertising, content and e-
mail. For instance, iVillage may, on behalf of an advertiser, send e-mail
offers to all members from a particular region or target advertisements to all
users who frequent a specific area of the site.

   During the first quarter of 2001, iVillage offered its members the right to
subscribe to a newsletter in exchange for an upfront subscription fee. The
initial subscription-based newsletter contained information related to
Astrology.com, but iVillage may in the future offer other subscription-based
newsletters to its users, including newsletters related to health, beauty and
other topics. To date, iVillage has not received a significant amount of
revenues from this initiative.

   Lamaze Publishing and the Newborn Channel

   Lamaze Publishing is used to solidify iVillage's leading position in the
parenting category. Lamaze Publishing produces advertising-supported
educational materials for expectant and new parents and is the exclusive
licensee of the LAMAZE mark for use in connection with consumer publications
and other communications, which include print, audio, visual and other
consumer oriented media, that are commercial in nature. Lamaze Publishing is
also the exclusive marketing agent for Lamaze International, Inc., the owner
of the LAMAZE family of marks. iVillage also operates the Lamaze.com Web site.

   Lamaze is a method of childbirth preparation based on the Lamaze philosophy
of birth. The Lamaze philosophy of birth states that birth is "normal, natural
and healthy," and "childbirth education empowers women to make informed
choices in healthcare, to assume responsibility for their health and trust
their inner wisdom".

   Lamaze International was founded by interested parents, childbirth educators
and healthcare providers in 1960 to promulgate these ideas. Lamaze Publishing
was established as a for-profit company in 1990 to provide childbirth and
infant care educational materials.

   During a pregnancy and immediately after the birth of a child, new parents
spend substantial amounts of time with childbirth educators and maternity
nurses seeking information on healthcare issues, the birth process and infant
care. These busy healthcare professionals typically have neither the time nor
the resources to create the consumer publications or communications that would
assist this process and allow parents to absorb this material at home.

   The Lamaze Publishing business strategy is to provide these consumer
publications or communications to childbirth educators and maternity nurses
free of charge, and offset the expense incurred by selling print advertising
and commercial messages to advertisers who target the young family market.

   Lamaze Publishing publications, used and distributed to parents by
childbirth educators and maternity nurses nationwide, include:

   o Lamaze Parents, a prenatal publication used in childbirth education.
     Topics include prenatal nutrition, the role of the childbirth partner,
     and the physical and emotional challenges of pregnancy. Childbirth
     educators distribute Lamaze Parents to expectant parents on the first
     night of class. Lamaze Parents had an average annual circulation of
     approximately 2,400,000 for 2000.

   o Lamaze Baby, a parenting guide for mothers from the time a child is born
     through twelve months of life written entirely by healthcare
     professionals. Lamaze Baby is delivered by maternity nurses to new
     mothers at the hospital bedside shortly after childbirth. The magazine
     covers topics that hospital nurses review with new mothers prior to
     discharge serving as a helpful and time saving tool for nurses in
     educating mothers about infant care. Lamaze Baby had an average annual
     circulation of approximately 3,000,000 for 2000.

   o Revista Lamaze para Padres, a Spanish language prenatal magazine which
     reaches more expectant Hispanic mothers than any other title. Childbirth
     educators distribute Revista Lamaze para Padres to expectant parents on
     the first night of class. Revista Lamaze para Padres had an average
     annual circulation of approximately 550,000 for 2000.

   o "Lamaze You and Your Baby," a 90 minute video textbook providing
     expectant parents with important instruction on infant care. Childbirth
     educators distribute to expectant parents the video, which is later
     returned. This video is distributed yearly to childbirth educators,
     typically during the first four months of the year. In 2000,
     approximately 13,000 childbirth educators ordered approximately 200,000
     copies of this video from Lamaze Publishing.

   o "Lo Mejor para Su Bebe," a 60 minute Spanish-language video textbook that
     provides expectant parents with important instruction on infant care.
     This video is modeled after "Lamaze You and Your Baby". The video is
     distributed yearly to childbirth educators, typically during the first
     four months of the year. In 2000, approximately 5,000 childbirth
     educators ordered approximately 50,000 copies of this video from Lamaze
     Publishing.

   o Lamaze Special Delivery, a program offering advertisers the ability to
     distribute coupons, samples and promotional literature to expectant and
     new parents. Information to be distributed is polybagged with Lamaze
     Parents, Lamaze Baby and Revista Lamaze para Padres.

   Through iVillage Integrated Properties, iVillage also owns the Newborn
Channel, a satellite television network that instructs mothers in their
hospital rooms following birth in over 1,000 hospitals nationwide and, as of
December 31, 2000, reached approximately 2,400,000 new mothers.

   Astrology.com

   Astrology.com is a leading destination for women seeking daily horoscopes,
astrology content and personalized forecasts online. Through iVillage's
network of sites organized by topics of interest to women such as family,
love, money and career, Astrology.com provides a timely, personalized
experience for the user, stimulates commerce sales of monthly and annual
forecasts by subject and creates an advertising environment that is appealing
to advertisers due to targeting possibilities within the site and through e-
mail communication.

   Astrology.com brings iVillage a content and commerce site that is appealing
to iVillage's core demographic of women and a vehicle to drive repeat visits
to iVillage.com through the use of daily horoscopes. Astrology.com accounts
for a substantial portion of iVillage's traffic. iVillage attempts to leverage
the popularity of Astrology.com by using internal promotion and links to
attract Astrology.com users to other areas of iVillage's web site, resulting
in higher average page views and time spent per visit. Astrology.com has also
created an interactive commerce system that provides instantaneous, digital
astrology reports. The system consists of software which operates the Web site
and is capable of generating customized astrology reports based on input from
users.

   iVillage Solutions

   iVillage Solutions is a unique interactive offering which helps companies
create and develop their Web sites, digital commerce platforms and other
aspects of their technology infrastructures.  Previously offered only to
iVillage's joint venture partners, during the first quarter of 2001 iVillage
began to offer iVillage Solutions to other third parties.  Through iVillage
Solutions, iVillage provides third parties with production, web consulting and
other services designed to provide long-term solutions for building, managing
and maintaining their Web sites and other technology.  Since this initiative
is in its initial stages, iVillage has not received a significant amount of
revenues from iVillage Solutions to date.

   Alliances

   iVillage pursues strategic relationships to increase its access to online
customers, build brand recognition and expand its online presence.
Historically, iVillage has pursued strategic alliances to reach online and
offline customers. iVillage's principal strategic alliances and relationships
include the following:

      Media Arrangement

   In November 1998, iVillage entered into an advertising and promotional
agreement with NBC pursuant to which NBC promotes iVillage.com on television,
primarily during prime-time programs, as well as through its Web sites. In
February 2001, iVillage further amended its November 1998 agreement with NBC
to provide for an extension of time during which iVillage must purchase its
advertising or promotional spots on the NBC network. The revised terms require
iVillage to purchase approximately $11.6 million of advertising or promotional
spots between January 30, 2001 and December 31, 2002, with $3.0 million of
advertising or promotional spots being telecast during the year 2001 and
approximately $8.6 million during the year 2002.

      Sponsorship Arrangements

   iVillage has a number of sponsorship arrangements with leading advertisers
and sponsors, including:

   o Fuji Photo Film USA - exclusive sponsorship for the photographic film,
     disposable camera and digital camera categories throughout iVillage's
     network.

   o Glaxo Wellcome - exclusive sponsorship for resource centers for smoking
     cessation, migraine, and asthma that include interactive assessment
     tools, disease-specific newsletters, and enhanced community support.

   o Johnson & Johnson - exclusive sponsor of certain birth control, anti-
     fungal and other pharmaceutical products as well as sponsor of skin care
     resource centers.

   o Kimberly-Clark - exclusive sponsor on certain parenting areas of diapers,
     wipes, training pants and similar products.

   o Unilever - promotion of various Unilever brands in several consumer
     product categories.

      Distribution Arrangements

   iVillage considers branding an important aspect of its distribution
arrangements and seeks distribution relationships where its brand is promoted.
iVillage periodically enters into distribution and content relationships with
major online service companies on the Internet. For example, some of
iVillage's icons are placed within the AOL service and iVillage receives
guaranteed impressions.

      Joint Venture and International License Arrangements

   iVillage  has entered into the following joint venture and international
license arrangements:

   o Cooperative Beauty Ventures, LLC -- iVillage and Unilever have formed,
     through a joint venture arrangement, an independently managed company,
     Cooperative Beauty Ventures, LLC d/b/a Substance.com, to provide women
     with a focused community, an array of interactive, customized online
     services, beauty and personal care products and personalized product
     recommendations. iVillage presently owns 80.1% of the venture and
     Unilever owns the remaining 19.9%. iVillage, over the twenty-year term of
     the venture, is obligated to fund the ongoing business and operations of
     the venture, subject to a maximum funding obligation of $7.0 million.
     Unilever can exercise a "put" option to require iVillage to purchase
     Unilever's remaining ownership interest in the venture for fair market
     value at any time after September 30, 2002 or at any time earlier, if the
     venture permits any person to use the "Substance" mark other than in
     connection with the venture's business or the venture fails to use the
     "Substance" mark in connection with its business from and after May 1,
     2001. At any time on or after September 30, 2002 iVillage can exercise a
     "call" option to require Unilever to sell its remaining interest in the
     venture to iVillage for fair market value; provided that Unilever can
     exercise a "call" option superior to iVillage's "call" option to purchase
     a portion of iVillage's membership interest in the venture for fair
     market value, up to a limit of 50% of the ownership of the venture. In
     addition, at any time on or after September 30, 2002, Unilever can
     exercise a "call" option to purchase a portion of iVillage's membership
     interest in the venture for fair market value, up to a limit of 50% of
     the ownership of the venture. During the year ended 2000, iVillage
     recognized losses from the joint venture of approximately $0.4 million.

   o iVillage UK Limited - In July 2000, iVillage, through a foreign
     subsidiary, entered into a business arrangement with Tesco PLC, a leading
     U.K. supermarket chain, to form iVillage UK Limited, a U.K. company.
     iVillage, through its foreign subsidiary, holds approximately a 50%
     interest in iVillage UK Limited. Through a newly-developed women's
     website (located at www.ivillage.co.uk), iVillage UK Limited serves the
     womens' online market in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland
     through a focused community and an array of interactive, customized
     online solutions and services. iVillage, through its foreign subsidiary,
     will provide marketing, branding, an immaterial amount of cash,
     intellectual property, and other resources through online and offline
     activities in support of iVillage UK Limited and the U.K. and Ireland web
     sites. Tesco will provide $18 million in cash over the three-year period
     following the establishment of the relationship, and online and offline
     promotional considerations. The iVillage.co.uk web site also will promote
     Tesco's retail business. Revenue will be derived primarily from
     advertising and sponsorship. In March 2001, iVillage UK was ranked by
     DoubleClick Inc.'s DART tracking service as the leading women's website
     in the United Kingdom based on the number of unique visitors visiting the
     iVillage UK website.

   o Hindustan Lever Limited - In December 2000, iVillage and Hindustan Lever
     Limited, a Unilever subsidiary, entered into a licensing and technology
     agreement to create a web  site targeting women in India. iVillage,
     through a foreign subsidiary, is licensing technology, brands and other
     intellectual property to Hindustan Lever Limited as part of the
     transaction. Pursuant to the licensing agreement, Hindustan Lever Limited
     will pay an initial set-up fee of $500,000 and iVillage will receive an
     annual royalty on revenue generated. The royalty will be the greater of
     7% of revenues or $500,000. The agreement is subject to necessary
     regulatory approvals in India. The government of India has approved the
     agreement except for the minimum annual royalty payment of $500,000.
     iVillage is currently in discussions with Hindustan Lever Limited
     regarding this exception. The Web site in India will operate under
     Hindustan Lever Limited's direction. Hindustan Lever Limited will also
     provide all capital investments required in maintaining the Web site
     including technology, staffing and marketing support. The web site is
     expected to launch in the second half of 2001.

   Sales, Marketing and Public Relations

      Sales

   As of December 31, 2000, iVillage had a direct sales organization consisting
of 20 sales professionals and 25 sales operations staff. iVillage's sales
organization consults regularly with advertisers and agencies on design and
placement of its Web-based advertising and the production and management of
co-branded Web sites which provide information about advertisers and/or their
products and services, provides customers with advertising management analysis
and focuses on providing a high level of customer satisfaction. Nine
professionals concentrate primarily on advertising sales for the Newborn
Channel, video products, and print advertising sales. iVillage generally seeks
to hire individuals with significant experience in selling advertising and
pre-existing relationships with advertisers in a variety of media.

      Marketing and Public Relations

   iVillage employs a variety of methods to promote the iVillage.com brand and
to attract traffic and new members, including advertising on other Internet
sites, targeted publications, radio stations, national television, cross
promotional arrangements to secure advertising and other promotional
considerations. To extend the iVillage.com brand, iVillage has also entered
into several strategic alliances with offline partners. Please see
"Alliances". In addition, iVillage leverages other audience building
strategies, including working closely with search engine submissions, news
group postings and cross-promotion to properly index materials. iVillage's
marketing department consisted of 30 marketing professionals as of December
31, 2000.

   iVillage's internal public relations staff oversees a comprehensive public
relations program which iVillage believes is a key component of its marketing
and brand recognition strategy. Organized into two primary components that
promote iVillage and the iVillage.com brand, the program targets a trade/
business and consumer audience, respectively. iVillage has also implemented
national long-lead consumer initiatives, such as radio media tours, regional
broadcast media tours, consumer publicity of its Parent Soup book series and
other related activities, and multiple daily media advisories sent to consumer
outlets throughout the United States.

   To maximize distribution of iVillage's publications and the Newborn Channel,
and gain the endorsement of the professional community for these products,
iVillage gives particular attention to marketing efforts targeted to
childbirth educators, maternity nurses and hospitals. A staff of four
marketing professionals contacts hospitals for distribution of the Newborn
Channel and works with the professional community to maintain distribution
levels of iVillage's publications and demonstrate how they can be used as
teaching tools for expectant parents and new mothers. iVillage's
representatives maintain contact with the professional community through trade
shows, professional conferences, consumer publication updates and personal
sales calls.

      Operating Infrastructure

   iVillage's Internet operating infrastructure has been designed and
implemented to support the delivery of millions of page views a day. Assuming
traffic is evenly distributed in a normal pattern, iVillage believes its
current operating infrastructure can support approximately 13 million page
views per day. If necessary, iVillage can increase its capacity by adding
additional servers or entering into agreements with third parties under which

iVillage would receive credit for page views on third party sites. Web pages
are generated and delivered, in response to end-users requests, by any one of
more than 100 servers. Key attributes of this infrastructure include the
ability to support growth, performance and service availability.

   iVillage's servers run on the Sun Solaris, Microsoft NT and Linux operating
systems and use Netscape Enterprise, Apache and Microsoft Corporation's IIS
Web server software.

   iVillage maintains all of its production servers at the New Jersey Data
Center of Exodus Communications, Inc. and Verio, Inc. in San Francisco,
California. iVillage's operations are dependent upon these companies' ability
to protect their respective systems against damage from fire, hurricanes,
power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins and other events.

   Exodus provides comprehensive facilities management services, including
human and technical monitoring of all production servers 24 hours per day,
seven days per week. The servers located at Verio are monitored by iVillage's
California operations staff. Exodus and Verio provide the means of
connectivity for iVillage's servers to end-users via the Internet through
multiple connections. Each facility is powered by multiple uninterruptible
power supplies and backup generators.

   All of iVillage's production data, except Astrology.com, are copied to
backup tapes each night and stored at a third party, off-site storage
facility. Astrology.com's production data is backed up on a daily basis to
local storage. iVillage is in the process of developing a comprehensive
disaster recovery plan to respond to system failures. iVillage keeps all of
its production servers behind firewalls for security purposes and does not
allow outside access, at the operating systems level, except via special
secure channels. Strict password management and physical security measures are
followed. Computer emergency response team alerts are read, and, where
appropriate, recommended action is taken to address security risks and
vulnerabilities.

   iVillage's Web sites must accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver
frequently updated information. Components or features of iVillage's Web sites
have in the past suffered outages or experienced slower response times because
of hardware or software downtime. This has not had a material effect on
iVillage's business.

    iVillage currently expects to primarily utilize its existing hardware,
software and technology infrastructure to operate iVillage and Women.com
websites after the closing of the merger. Although compatibility problems
between the technology systems operated by iVillage and Women.com may delay or
prevent integration of some Women.com content into iVillage's website,
iVillage does not believe that any compatibility issues present a material
risk to the combined company. Nor does iVillage believe that there is a
material risk that its existing technology infrastructure will be unable to
handle the increased number of page views expected to be generated by the
combined company. Accordingly, iVillage does not believe that the combined
company will incur any material expenditure in integrating the technology
systems operated by iVillage and Women.com.

   Broadcasting of the Newborn Channel to hospitals originates from a laser
disc system operated by Group W Network Services, from Group W's facility in
Stamford, Connecticut. The system provides an uplink signal to a satellite
operated by PanAmSat. The signal is received through a satellite dish at each
hospital and distributed to patients' rooms. Group W handles installation and
service of all hospital receiving equipment. iVillage maintains business
interruption insurance in the event programming is interrupted over the
designated satellite.

   Competition

   The market for members, visitors and Internet advertising is new and rapidly
evolving, and competition for members, visitors and advertisers is intense and
is expected to increase significantly in the future. With no substantial
barriers to entry, iVillage expects that competition will continue to
intensify.

   iVillage believes that the primary competitive factors in creating community
on the Internet are:

   o functionality;

   o brand recognition;

   o member affinity and loyalty;

   o demographic focus;

   o variety of value-added services;

   o ease-of-use;

   o quality of service; and

   o reliability and critical mass.

   Other companies or sites which are primarily focused on targeting women
online include Oxygen.com and condenet.com, as well as Web sites targeted to
categories such as health. iVillage will likely also face competition in the
future from:

   o developers of Web directories;

   o search engine providers;

   o shareware archives;

   o content sites;

   o commercial online services;

   o sites maintained by Internet service providers; and

   o other entities that attempt to or establish communities on the Internet
     by developing their own or purchasing one of iVillage's competitors.

   In addition, iVillage could face competition in the future from traditional
media companies, a number of which, including CBS and NBC, have made
significant acquisitions of or investments in Internet companies. Further,
there can be no assurance that iVillage's competitors and potential
competitors will not develop communities that are equal or superior to ours or
that achieve greater market acceptance than iVillage's community.

   iVillage also competes with traditional forms of media, such as newspapers,
magazines, radio and television, for advertisers and advertising revenues.
iVillage believes that the principal competitive factors in attracting
advertisers are:

   o the amount of traffic on iVillage's Web sites;

   o brand recognition;

   o the demographics of iVillage's members and visitors;

   o iVillage's ability to offer targeted audiences; and

   o the overall cost-effectiveness of the advertising medium offered by us.

   iVillage believes that the number of Internet companies relying on Web-based
advertising revenues may increase in the future. Accordingly, iVillage may
face increased competition, which could in turn have a material adverse effect
on its business, results of operations and financial condition.

   Many of iVillage's current and potential competitors, including developers
of Web directories and search engines and traditional media companies, have:

   o longer operating histories;

   o significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources;

   o greater name recognition; and

   o larger existing customer bases.

   These competitors are able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns
for their brands and services, adopt more aggressive advertising pricing
policies and make more attractive offers to potential employees, distribution
partners, commerce companies, advertisers and third-party content providers.
There can be no assurance that Internet content providers and Internet service
providers, including developers of Web directories, search engines, sites that
offer professional editorial content and commercial online services, will not
be perceived by advertisers as having more desirable Web sites for placement
of advertisements. In addition, many of iVillage's current advertising
customers and strategic partners also have established collaborative
relationships

with certain of iVillage's competitors or potential competitors, and other
high-traffic Web sites. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that:

   o iVillage will be able to grow its membership, traffic levels and
     advertiser customer-base at historical levels;

   o iVillage will be able to retain its current members, traffic levels or
     advertiser customers;

   o competitors will not experience greater growth in traffic as a result of
     these relationships which could have the effect of making their Web sites
     more attractive to advertisers; or

   o iVillage's strategic partners will not sever or will elect not to renew
     their agreements with us.

   Several major publishing companies produce products that are directly
competitive with iVillage's magazines. Time Warner, Gruner and Jahr and
Primedia all publish various pre- and post-natal publications. Disney
Publishing and Children's Television Workshop also publish general parenting
magazines. All of these publishers have substantially greater marketing,
research and financial resources than us. iVillage competes by emphasizing the
highly targeted nature of its audience, product quality and the fact that its
publications are used as teaching tools by professionals, and the credibility
and trust parents place in the Lamaze brand name.

   While iVillage's Lamaze Publishing instructional videos and the Newborn
Channel currently have no direct competitors, advertisers in this marketplace
are heavy users of daytime network television and cable television networks
targeted to young parents. The broadcasting companies that provide these
opportunities have invested substantial amounts in programming, sales and
marketing and are much better-known to advertisers than Lamaze Publishing and
the Newborn Channel. To compete, Lamaze Publishing and the Newborn Channel
must convince them that advertising recall and effectiveness obtained in an
educational or hospital setting is superior to that of traditional
broadcasting.

   There can be no assurance that iVillage will be able to compete successfully
against its current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced
by us will not have a material adverse effect on its business, results of
operations and financial condition.

   Intellectual Property, Proprietary Rights and Domain Names

   iVillage regards its copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade names,
trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology and similar intellectual
property as critical to its success, and rely on trademark and copyright law,
trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with its
employees, customers, independent contractors, partners and others to protect
iVillage's proprietary rights. iVillage pursues the registration of its
trademarks and service marks in the United States, and has applied for and
obtained registration in the United States for certain of iVillage's
trademarks and service marks, including "iVillage". Effective trademark,
service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in
every country in which iVillage's products and services are made available
online.

   iVillage has licensed in the past, and expects that it may license in the
future, certain of iVillage's proprietary rights, such as trademarks or
copyrighted material, to third parties. While iVillage attempts to ensure that
the quality of its brand is maintained by these licensees, there can be no
assurance that the licensees will not take actions that might materially
adversely affect the value of its proprietary rights or reputation, which
could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and
results of operations. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by
iVillage to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate or that third
parties will not infringe or misappropriate its copyrights, trademarks, trade
dress and similar proprietary rights. In addition, there can be no assurance
that other parties will not assert claims of infringement of intellectual
property or alter proprietary rights against iVillage.

   iVillage has been subject to claims and expects to be subject to legal
proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of its
business, including claims of alleged infringement of patents, trademarks and
other intellectual property rights of third parties by iVillage and its
licensees. These claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the
expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Further, if
these claims are successful, iVillage may be required to change its
trademarks, alter its content, alter its site format and pay financial
damages. There can be no assurance that these changes of trademarks,
alteration of content or

format or payment of financial damages will not adversely affect its business,
results of operations and financial condition.

   iVillage may be required to obtain licenses from others to refine, develop,
market and deliver new services. There can be no assurance that iVillage will
be able to obtain any license on commercially reasonable terms or at all or
that rights granted pursuant to any licenses will be valid and enforceable.

   Employees

   As of February 20, 2001, iVillage employed 309 full-time employees, of whom
96 were in sales and marketing, 85 were in editorial and community, 53 were in
administration and customer service, and 75 were in technology, operations and
support. As iVillage continues to grow and introduce more products, iVillage
may need to hire more personnel, particularly in the areas of product
development and sponsorship. None of iVillage's current employees are
represented by a labor union or is the subject of a collective bargaining
agreement. iVillage believes that relations with its employees are good.

   Properties

   iVillage is headquartered in New York, New York. In March 2000, iVillage
entered into a fifteen-year lease for approximately 105,000 square feet at
500-512 Seventh Avenue in which iVillage has consolidated its New York City
operations.

   iVillage also leases two floors at 149 Fifth Avenue, which are each for
approximately 10,000 square feet. The lease expires on June 30, 2001 and
iVillage is exploring the possibility of subleasing this space.

   iVillage also leases a sales office that is located at 645 North Michigan
Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. The lease is on a month-to-month basis.

   iVillage's subsidiary, IVN, Inc., formerly known as iBaby, Inc., is
currently leasing approximately 74,000 rentable square feet at a facility
located at 6910 Carroll Road in San Diego, California for use as general
office, administrative, storage, warehousing and distribution which expires in
November 2001. iVillage is exploring the possibility of subleasing this space.

   Lamaze Publishing subleases approximately 10,300 square feet of space at 9
Old Kings Highway, Darien, Connecticut. The sublease expires on June 30, 2005.

   Astrology.com leases approximately 7,400 square feet of space in San
Francisco, California. The lease expires in November 2002.

   Legal Matters

   On May 24, 2000, a complaint was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of
New York in New York County by Insignia/ESG, Inc. f/k/a Insignia/Edward S.
Gordon, Inc., a real estate broker, against iVillage. The complaint alleges a
breach of the provisions of a written agreement between Insignia and iVillage
related to iVillage's failure to pay Insignia a broker's commission in
connection with its lease of office space at 500-512 Seventh Avenue in New
York City. In addition to unspecified damages, the complaint seeks an award of
$2.0 million plus interest thereon. On July 10, 2000, iVillage filed an answer
and counterclaim to Insignia's complaint alleging intentional, malicious,
wrongful and tortious interference by Insignia with iVillage's prospective
contractual relationship with the owner of another New York office building.
In addition to unspecified damages, iVillage's counterclaim seeks an award of
$7.0 million in compensatory damages and $1.0 million in punitive damages as
well as interest thereon from Insignia.

   iVillage believes that the lawsuit and claims asserted against it by
Insignia are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against these
claims.

   On July 22, 1998, Jewish Family and Children's Services filed a Notice of
Opposition in the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board of the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office to iVillage's service mark application for the mark
"PARENTSPLACE.COM". On January 22, 1999, iVillage filed an Answer to the
Notice of Opposition, denying that there was any likelihood of confusion
between iVillage's mark and the mark used by Jewish Family and Children's
Services. In September 2000, iVillage and Jewish Family and Children's
Services entered into a

settlement agreement permitting each party to use its respective mark in a
manner that does not infringe on the other party's primary use of its mark.
The parties also plan to move for dismissal of the Trademark Trial and Appeal
Board proceedings.

   iVillage is not currently subject to any other material legal proceedings.
iVillage may from time to time become a party to various legal proceedings
arising in the ordinary course of its business.

Selected Consolidated Financial Data of iVillage

   The iVillage selected consolidated financial data should be read in
conjunction with iVillage's "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
