              QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE PROPOSED COMBINATION

Q: WHAT ARE SYBASE AND NEON PROPOSING?

A: We propose to acquire all outstanding shares of NEON common stock. We have
   entered into a reorganization agreement with NEON pursuant to which we are
   offering, through Neel Acquisition Corp., our wholly-owned subsidiary, to
   exchange shares of Sybase common stock for each outstanding share of NEON
   common stock. After the offer is completed, subject to approval by the
   stockholders of NEON if necessary, Neel Acquisition Corp. will merge with and
   into NEON. As a result of the offer and the merger, NEON will become a
   wholly-owned subsidiary of Sybase.

Q: WHAT WOULD I RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY NEON SHARES?

A: We are offering to exchange 0.3878 of a share of Sybase common stock for each
   outstanding share of common stock of NEON that is validly tendered and not
   properly withdrawn.

Q: HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO COMPLETE THE OFFER AND MERGER?

A: We hope to complete the offer in the second quarter of 2001. We expect to
   complete the merger shortly after we complete the offer, or if stockholder
   approval for the merger is required, shortly after the special meeting of the
   stockholders to approve the merger. We must also obtain regulatory clearance
   prior to completion of the offer and the merger.

Q: DO I HAVE TO PAY ANY FEES OR COMMISSIONS?

A: If you are the record owner of your shares and you tender your shares in the
   offer, you will not incur any brokerage fees. If you own your shares through
   a broker or other nominee who tenders the shares on your behalf, your broker
   may charge you a fee for doing so. You should consult your broker or nominee
   to determine whether any charges will apply.

Q: DOES NEON SUPPORT THE OFFER AND THE MERGER?

A: Yes. The members of the NEON board of directors, excluding Mr. Melvyn
   Bergstein who was unable to attend the meeting at which the reorganization
   agreement was approved, determined by unanimous vote that the offer is fair
   to and in the best interests of NEON stockholders, and recommend that NEON
   stockholders accept the offer and tender their shares pursuant to the offer.
   NEON's board of directors has approved by unanimous vote of the directors
   participating in the meeting and declared advisable the reorganization
   agreement and the merger. Information about the recommendation of NEON's
   board of directors is more fully set forth in NEON's Solicitation/
   Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which is being mailed to NEON
   stockholders together with this prospectus.

Q: HAS NEON RECEIVED A FAIRNESS OPINION IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFER AND THE
   MERGER?

A: Yes. NEON has received an opinion from Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation
   dated February 20, 2001, to the effect that, as of that date, based upon and
   subject to various considerations set forth in its opinion, the exchange
   ratio in the transaction was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
   holders of NEON common stock. A copy of the opinion is included in NEON's
   Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which is being
   mailed to NEON stockholders together with this prospectus. Stockholders
   should read the opinion carefully in its entirety. The opinion does not
   constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to whether or not
   stockholders should tender shares pursuant to the offer.

Q: HAVE ANY NEON STOCKHOLDERS AGREED TO TENDER THEIR SHARES?

A: Yes. Stockholders of NEON, including directors and executive officers, have
   agreed to tender into the offer outstanding shares representing approximately
   12% of the common stock of NEON outstanding as of February 15, 2001
   (approximately 14% after giving effect to all options which will become
   exercisable within 60 days of February 15, 2001).

Q: WHAT PERCENTAGE OF SYBASE COMMON STOCK WILL NEON STOCKHOLDERS OWN AFTER THE
   OFFER AND THE MERGER?

A: If we obtain all of the shares of NEON pursuant to the offer and the merger,
   former stockholders of NEON would own approximately 14% of the shares of
   common stock of

                                        ii

   Sybase, based upon the number of outstanding shares of Sybase common stock
   and NEON common stock on February 15, 2001 and not taking into account stock
   options of NEON or Sybase.

Q: WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF NEON SHARES IN THE OFFER?

A: The acceptance of NEON shares in the offer is subject to several conditions,
   including:

   - a majority of the outstanding NEON shares, on a fully diluted basis, having
     been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, which we refer to as the
     minimum tender condition,

   - the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the
     HSR Act,

   - the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part having been
     declared effective by the SEC, and

   - NEON having not materially breached any covenant, obligation or agreement
     under the reorganization agreement.

These and other conditions to the offer are discussed in this prospectus under
"The Offer -- Conditions of the Offer" beginning on page 48.

Q: HOW DO I PARTICIPATE IN THE OFFER?

A: To tender your shares, you should do the following:

   - If you hold your shares in your own name, complete and sign the enclosed
     letter of transmittal and return it with your share certificates to America
     Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Exchange Agent for the offer, at the
     address on the back cover of this prospectus.

   - If you hold your shares in "street name" through a broker, ask your broker
     to tender your shares.

   - For more information about the timing of the offer, extensions of the offer
     period and your rights to withdraw your shares from the offer before the
     expiration date, please refer to "The Offer" beginning on page 32.

Q: WILL I BE TAXED ON THE SYBASE SHARES I RECEIVE?

A: A NEON stockholder's receipt of shares of Sybase common stock in the offer or
   the merger will be tax-free for United States federal income tax purposes
   (except for taxes, if any, resulting from the receipt of cash instead of any
   fraction of a Sybase common share), if (1) the offer and the merger are
   completed under the current terms of the reorganization agreement, (2) the
   minimum tender condition for the offer is satisfied and (3) the merger is
   completed promptly after the offer. You are urged to carefully read the
   discussion under "The Offer -- Material Federal Income Tax Consequences"
   beginning on page 43, and to consult your tax advisor as to the consequences
   of participation in the offer and/or the merger.

Q: DO THE STATEMENTS ON THE COVER PAGE REGARDING THIS PROSPECTUS BEING SUBJECT
   TO CHANGE AND THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SEC NOT YET BEING
   EFFECTIVE MEAN THAT THE OFFER HAS NOT COMMENCED?

A: No. The offer has commenced and effectiveness of the registration statement
   is not necessary for you to tender NEON shares. The SEC recently changed its
   rules to permit exchange offers to commence before the related registration
   statement has become effective, and we are taking advantage of the rule
   changes with the goal of combining Sybase and NEON faster than similar
   combinations could be accomplished previously.

Q: IS SYBASE'S FINANCIAL CONDITION RELEVANT TO MY DECISION TO TENDER MY SHARES
   IN THE OFFER?

A: Yes. Since shares of NEON common stock accepted in the offer will be
   exchanged for shares of Sybase common stock, you should consider our
   financial condition before you decide to become one of our stockholders
   through the offer. In considering Sybase's financial condition, you should
   review the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus because
   they contain detailed business, financial and other information about us.

Q: WHERE CAN I FIND MORE INFORMATION ABOUT SYBASE AND NEON?

A: You can find more information about Sybase and NEON as described under "Where
   You Can Find More Information" on page v.

                                    GENERAL

     We are proposing a business combination of Sybase, Inc. and New Era of
Networks, Inc., or NEON, under which Sybase will acquire all outstanding shares
of NEON common stock. We are offering to exchange 0.3878 of a share of Sybase
common stock for each share of NEON common stock validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn. The expiration date is currently April 11, 2001 but we may
extend the offer as described in "The Offer -- Extension, Termination and
Amendment" on page 32.

     We intend, promptly after completion of the offer, to merge Neel
Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sybase and the purchaser in the
offer, with and into NEON. Each share of NEON common stock which has not been
exchanged or accepted for exchange in the offer would be converted in the merger
into the same fraction of a share of Sybase common stock being paid in the
offer. Sybase seeks to acquire ownership of 100% of the NEON stock through the
offer and the merger.

                                 THE COMPANIES

SYBASE, INC.

       integrate, move and manage very large amounts of data and applications
       across diverse computing environments. ESD also provides technical
       support and professional services required by businesses to develop and

     - IANYWHERE SOLUTIONS, INC. (IAS) products and solutions extend enterprise
       systems to remote and wireless devices to enable e-business and
       m-business (mobile business) anywhere, anytime. iAS is a wholly-owned

       and Embedded Computing (MEC) division.

     - BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE (BID) products and solutions let businesses

     - INTERNET APPLICATIONS (IAD) products and solutions allow businesses to
       design, build and deploy distributed and Web-based applications, and to
       extend existing distributed client/server applications (generally
       unsuitable for direct access on the Internet) into the new Web
       environment.

     - FINANCIAL FUSION, INC. (FFI) e-finance solutions and its global service
       and support network enable financial institutions to integrate financial
       services, channels, platforms, technologies and applications for delivery

     NEEL ACQUISITION CORP.
c/o Sybase, Inc.
6475 Christie Avenue
Emeryville, CA 94608
Telephone: (510) 922-3500

     Neel Acquisition Corp. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sybase. Neel
Acquisition Corp. was organized on February 5, 2001 for the purpose of acquiring
the NEON shares tendered in response to our offer and merging with NEON in the
merger. It has not carried on any activities other than in connection with the
reorganization agreement.

     NEW ERA OF NETWORKS, INC.

spanning all major industries including financial services, healthcare,
insurance, manufacturing, and telecommunications, use NEON's products.

                             REASONS FOR THE OFFER

     We believe that the offer and merger represent a compelling opportunity to
enhance value for both Sybase and NEON stockholders. We believe the proposed
offer and merger would achieve the following benefits:

     - Improve our e-business/Enterprise Application Integration Products.

     - Strengthen our market position.

     - Increase our selling opportunities.

     Achieving these objectives depends on successfully integrating companies
that have previously operated independently and is subject to the other
uncertainties described under "Risk Factors" on page 9.

     To review the reasons for the offer and merger in greater detail, see "The
Offer -- Reasons for the Offer and Merger" on page 40.

                             NEON'S RECOMMENDATION

     NEON's board of directors has determined by unanimous vote of the directors
participating in the meeting that the offer is fair to and in the best interests
of NEON stockholders, and recommends that NEON stockholders accept the offer and
tender their shares pursuant to the offer. NEON's board of directors has
determined by unanimous vote of the directors participating in the meeting to
approve and declare advisable the reorganization agreement and the merger.
Information about the recommendation of NEON's board of directors is more fully
set forth in NEON's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9,
which is being mailed to NEON stockholders together with this prospectus.

                                   THE OFFER

     We have attached the reorganization agreement governing the offer and the
merger as Annex A to this prospectus. We encourage you to read this agreement
because it is the legal document that governs the offer and the merger.

WHAT NEON STOCKHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE

     We are offering, upon the terms and conditions set forth in this prospectus
and the related letter of transmittal, 0.3878 of a share of Sybase

common stock for each share of NEON common stock that is validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn.

     Each share of NEON common stock which has not been exchanged or accepted
for exchange in the offer would be converted in the merger into the same
fraction of a share of Sybase common stock being paid in the offer.

     Sybase will not issue any fractional shares of common stock in connection
with the offer or the merger. NEON stockholders will instead receive cash for
any fractional shares otherwise issuable to them.

Example:

     - If you currently own 10 NEON shares of common stock, after the offer and
       the merger you will receive 3 Sybase shares of common stock and a check
       for the value of 87.8% of a share of Sybase common stock, rounded to the
       nearest one cent.

     - On April 3, 2001, the most recent practicable date prior to the filing of
       this document, the last sale price of Sybase common stock on the Nasdaq
       National Market was $12.94. Applying the 0.3878 exchange ratio to the
       Sybase closing price on that date, each holder of NEON common stock would
       be entitled to receive shares of Sybase common stock with a market value
       of approximately $5.02 for each share of NEON common stock. The actual
       value of the Sybase common stock to be issued in the merger, however,
       will depend on the market price at that time, and may be more or less
       than the value given in this example. We urge you to obtain current price
       quotations for NEON and Sybase common stock.

     The shares of Sybase common stock to be issued to NEON stockholders in the
merger will be included for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market.

TIMING OF THE OFFER

     Our offer is currently scheduled to expire on April 11, 2001, but we are
obligated, with some exceptions, to extend our offer from time to time as
necessary until all the conditions to the offer have been satisfied or, where
permissible, waived. See "The Offer -- Extension, Termination and Amendment" on
page 32.

EXTENSION, TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

     We expressly reserve the right, subject to the provisions of the
reorganization agreement, to extend the period of time during which our offer
remains open, and we can do so by giving oral or written notice of an extension
to the Exchange Agent. We are not making any assurance that we will exercise our
right to extend our offer, although we are obligated, with certain exceptions,
to do so until all conditions have been satisfied or, where permissible, waived.
During any extension, all NEON common stock previously tendered and not properly
withdrawn will remain subject to the offer, subject to your right to properly
withdraw your NEON shares.

     We reserve the right to increase the exchange ratio or to make any other
changes in the terms and conditions of the offer by giving notice of such change
to the Exchange Agent and by making a public announcement provided that, without
the prior written consent of NEON, we cannot (a) amend or waive the minimum
tender conditions or (b) change the form or amount of consideration to be paid,
decrease the number of shares sought in the offer, impose conditions to the
offer in addition to those set forth in the reorganization agreement, extend the
expiration date of the offer beyond the initial expiration date of the offer
(except as provided in the reorganization agreement) or make any other change
that is adverse to the holders of the NEON shares.

     We will follow any extension, termination, amendment or delay, as promptly
as practicable, with a public announcement. Any announcement about an extension
will be issued no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business
day after the previously scheduled expiration date. Subject to applicable law
(including Rules 14d-4(d) and 14d-6(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, which require that any material change in the information published, sent
or given to the stockholders in connection with the offer be promptly sent to
stockholders in a manner reasonably designed to inform stockholders of the
change) and without limiting the manner in which we may choose to make any
public announcement, we assume no obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise
communicate the public

announcement other than by making a release to the Dow Jones News Service.

EXCHANGE OF SHARES; DELIVERY OF SYBASE COMMON STOCK

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of our offer, including, if
the offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any extension or
amendment, we will accept for exchange, and will exchange, shares validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn promptly after the expiration date and
promptly after they are tendered during any subsequent offering period.

WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS

     Your tender of NEON common stock pursuant to the offer is irrevocable,
except that, other than during any subsequent offering period, NEON shares
tendered pursuant to the offer may be withdrawn at any time prior to the
expiration date, and, unless we previously accepted them for exchange pursuant
to the offer, may also be withdrawn at any time after May 13, 2001.

     If we elect to provide a subsequent offering period under Exchange Act Rule
14d-11, you will not have the right to withdraw NEON shares that you tender in
the subsequent offering period.

SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD

     We may, although we do not currently intend to, elect to provide a
subsequent offering period of three to 20 business days after the acceptance of
NEON common stock pursuant to the offer if the requirements under Rule 14d-11 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 have been met. You will not have the right
to withdraw any shares of NEON common stock that you tender in the subsequent
offering period. If we elect to provide a subsequent offering period, we will
make a public announcement to that effect no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City
time on the next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date.

PROCEDURE FOR TENDERING SHARES

     For you to validly tender NEON shares pursuant to our offer, either:

     - a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal (or manually
       executed facsimile of that document), along with any required signature
       guarantees, or an agent's message in connection with a book-entry
       transfer, and any other required documents, must be transmitted to and
       received by the Exchange Agent at the address set forth on the back cover
       of this prospectus. In addition, certificates for tendered shares of NEON
       common stock must be received by the Exchange Agent at that address, or
       those shares of NEON common stock must be tendered pursuant to the
       procedures for book-entry tender, in each case before the expiration
       date. See the procedures for tendering shares on page 35 under "The
       Offer -- Procedure for Tendering" for more details; or

     - you must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures as set forth in
       "The Offer -- Guaranteed Delivery" on page 36.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (SEE PAGE 43)

     The offer and the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for
United States federal income tax purposes, if (1) the offer and the merger are
completed under the current terms of the reorganization agreement, (2) the
minimum tender condition for the offer is satisfied and (3) the merger is
completed promptly after the offer. Based on these assumptions, a NEON
stockholder's receipt of Sybase common stock in the offer or the merger will be
tax-free for United States federal income tax purposes (except for taxes, if
any, resulting from the receipt of cash instead of a fraction of a Sybase common
share).

     The above described tax treatment of the offer and the merger to NEON
stockholders depends on, among other things, some facts that will not be known
before the completion of the merger. NEON stockholders are urged to carefully
read the discussion under "The Offer -- Material Federal Income Tax
Consequences" beginning on page 43. That discussion includes a summary of the
tax consequences of participation in the offer and the merger in the event the
assumptions described above are not satisfied. NEON stockholders are urged to
consult their tax advisors as to the consequences of participation in the offer
and/or the merger.

COMPARATIVE PER SHARE MARKET PRICE AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION (SEE PAGE 52)

     Sybase common stock and NEON common stock are listed on the Nasdaq National
Market under the symbols "SYBS" and "NEON," respectively. On February 20, 2001,
the last full trading day before the public announcement of the proposed offer
and merger, the last sale price per share of Sybase common stock on the Nasdaq
National Market was $24.50 and the last sale price per share of NEON common
stock on the Nasdaq National Market was $6.94. On April 3, 2001, the most recent
practicable date prior to the filing of this document, the last sale price per
share of Sybase common stock was $12.94 and the last sale price per share of
NEON common stock was $4.84.

WHAT SYBASE STOCKHOLDERS WILL HOLD AFTER THE MERGER

     Sybase stockholders will continue to own their existing shares of Sybase
common stock after the merger. Sybase stockholders should not send in their
stock certificates in connection with the merger.

OWNERSHIP OF SYBASE AFTER THE MERGER

     Sybase will issue approximately 14,289,957 shares of Sybase common stock to
NEON stockholders in the offer and merger. These shares of Sybase common stock
will represent approximately 14% of the outstanding shares of Sybase common
stock after the merger. This information is based on the number of shares of
Sybase and NEON common stock outstanding on March 8, 2001 and does not take into
account stock options of NEON or Sybase.

STOCKHOLDER VOTE REQUIRED AFTER THE OFFER TO APPROVE THE MERGER

     The merger requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the
shares of NEON common stock outstanding on the record date for the meeting to
approve the merger, unless we have acquired 90% or more of these outstanding
shares, in which case the merger can be accomplished without a vote.

     If the minimum tender condition, as described under the heading "The
Offer -- Conditions of the Offer -- Minimum Tender Condition" on page 48, is
satisfied and we acquire the tendered NEON shares, we will own a majority of the
NEON common stock and approval of the merger by NEON stockholders will be
assured, subject to the other conditions to the merger.

THE STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS

     As of the date of the reorganization agreement, certain directors and
officers and affiliated stockholders of NEON have agreed to tender 4,408,112
shares of NEON common stock representing approximately 12% of the outstanding
common stock of NEON as of February 15, 2001 (approximately 14% after giving
effect to all options which become exercisable within 60 days of February 15,
2001). See "The Reorganization Agreement and the Stockholders Agreements -- The
Stockholder Agreements" on page 62.

NO APPRAISAL OR DISSENTERS' RIGHTS (SEE PAGE 46)

     The offer does not entitle you to appraisal rights with respect to your
NEON shares.

     If at the end of the offer the minimum tender condition has been met but we
have received less than 90% of the outstanding shares of NEON common stock, we
will effect a long-form merger as permitted under Delaware law, which would
require notice to and approval of NEON stockholders. NEON stockholders who did
not tender their shares of NEON common stock during the offer would not have
appraisal rights in connection with a long-form merger.

     If, however, at the end of the offer we have received 90% or more of the
outstanding shares of NEON common stock, we will effect a short-form merger as
permitted under Delaware law. In the event that we complete the transaction
through a short-form merger, stockholders who did not tender their shares of
NEON common stock would have the right under Delaware law to dissent and demand
appraisal rights with respect to their shares of NEON common stock, but only if
they comply with certain statutory requirements. Dissenting stockholders who
comply with the applicable statutory procedures will be entitled to receive a
judicial determination of the fair value of their shares of NEON common stock
(exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger) and to receive payment of this fair value in cash,
together with a fair rate of interest, if any. In the event of

a short-form merger, information regarding these requirements will be provided
to NEON stockholders who have not tendered their shares of NEON common stock.

NEON BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The reorganization agreement provides that, upon acceptance for payment of
NEON shares, we will be entitled to designate a number of directors of NEON
(rounded up to the next whole number) equal to the product of the total number
of directors on NEON's board and the percentage of outstanding NEON shares of
common stock beneficially owned by us.

INTERESTS OF NEON'S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE TRANSACTION (SEE PAGE 53)

     When you consider the NEON board's recommendation that NEON stockholders
tender their shares in the offer, you should be aware that some NEON directors
and executive officers may have interests in the offer and the merger that may
be different from, or in addition to, yours, such as option acceleration, cash
bonuses and employment agreements with the surviving corporation. See "Interests
of NEON Officers and Directors in the Transaction" on page 53 as well as NEON's
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which is being mailed
to NEON stockholders together with this prospectus.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (SEE PAGE 51)

     Sybase will account for the merger as a purchase for financial reporting
purposes.

REGULATORY CLEARANCES (SEE PAGE 49)

     Consummation of the merger is subject to compliance with the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and certain international
antitrust authorities. The notifications required under the HSR Act to the
Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
have been filed and we received notice of early termination on March 9, 2001.
The notifications required by any foreign jurisdiction have been or will be
furnished in due course.

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER (SEE PAGE 48)

     We shall complete the offer only if specific conditions are satisfied or,
in some cases, waived, including the following:

     - a majority of the outstanding shares of NEON common stock, on a
       fully-diluted basis, having been tendered and not properly withdrawn;

     - the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the
       HSR Act;

     - the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part having been
       declared effective by the SEC;

     - receipt of opinions of counsel that the offer and merger will be a
       tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes;

     - absence of any law, court order or regulatory action seeking to delay or
       prohibit the offer or the merger;

     - NEON having not materially breached any covenant, obligation or agreement
       under the reorganization agreement;

     - representations and warranties shall have been true in all material
       respects as of the date of the reorganization agreement and shall be true
       and correct on the date of the expiration of the offer except for certain
       breaches which would not have a material adverse effect; and

     - the reorganization agreement not having been terminated in accordance
       with its terms.

     These conditions are for our sole benefit and may be waived in our sole
discretion (other than the minimum tender condition, the condition relating to
regulatory clearance, conditions relating to the absence of legal impediments to
the offer or the merger and the condition that our registration statement is
declared effective by the SEC).

TERMINATION OF THE REORGANIZATION AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 59)

     Sybase's and NEON's boards of directors can jointly agree to terminate the
reorganization agreement at any time prior to the effective time of the merger.
In addition, either Sybase or NEON can terminate the reorganization agreement
if:

     - the offer shall have expired or been terminated in accordance with the
       reorganization

       agreement without our having accepted any shares of NEON common stock
       pursuant to the offer, other than as a result of our breach of the
       reorganization agreement;

     - we do not consummate the offer by June 30, 2001 (a party in material
       breach of its obligations under the reorganization agreement cannot
       terminate it for this reason);

     - a law or court order prohibits the merger; or

     - any representation or warranty of the other party shall have become
       inaccurate in a material manner, or the other party shall fail to perform
       a material covenant.

     NEON may terminate the reorganization agreement at any time prior to
acceptance of shares for exchange pursuant to the offer in order to enter into a
letter of intent or similar arrangement with respect to a Superior Proposal (as
defined in the reorganization agreement) provided that:

     - NEON is not in breach of certain of its obligations under the
       reorganization agreement;

     - NEON's board of directors has authorized NEON to enter into a Superior
       Proposal;

     - NEON notifies Sybase that it has received a Superior Proposal and that it
       intends to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
       Superior Proposal;

     - Sybase does not make an offer that NEON's board of directors determines
       is at least as favorable to NEON's stockholders as the Superior Proposal,
       within five business days after receipt of notice of the Superior
       Proposal;

     - during such period, NEON has fully cooperated with Sybase regarding
       information about the Superior Proposal;

     - prior to such termination, NEON pays to Sybase the termination fee
       described below; and

     - immediately following such termination NEON enters into a definitive
       agreement to effect such Superior Proposal.

     Sybase can terminate the reorganization agreement if, prior to acceptance
of shares for exchange pursuant to the offer:

     - NEON's board of directors approves or recommends to the NEON stockholders
       an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the reorganization agreement);

     - NEON's board of directors withholds, withdraws, modifies or changes in
       any way adverse to Sybase its recommendation to the NEON stockholders
       that they accept the offer and approve and adopt the reorganization
       agreement and the merger;

     - NEON fails to include in various documents relating to the offer its
       recommendation;

     - NEON's board of directors fails to reaffirm its recommendations within 10
       days of a Sybase request for such reaffirmation, if such request is made
       following the receipt by NEON of an Acquisition Proposal;

     - NEON enters into any letter of intent accepting any Acquisition Proposal;

     - NEON does not recommend rejection of a competing tender or exchange offer
       for 15% or more of NEON's shares; or

     - NEON violates the nonsolicitation provisions of the reorganization
       agreement.

TERMINATION FEE (SEE PAGE 61)

     NEON must pay Sybase a termination fee of $15 million in cash if:

     - the reorganization agreement is terminated by Sybase for any of the
       reasons described in the preceding seven bullet points;

     - the reorganization agreement is terminated by NEON to enter into a letter
       of intent or similar arrangement with respect to a Superior Proposal; or

     - the reorganization agreement is terminated by Sybase or NEON where the
       offer is not completed, prior to such termination an acquisition proposal
       for NEON, other than the offer and the merger, is publicly announced and
       NEON subsequently enters into an agreement to be acquired by a party
       other than Sybase within 9 months of the termination of the
       reorganization agreement.

OPINION OF NEON FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     In deciding to approve the offer and merger, NEON's board of directors
considered the opinion of its financial advisor, Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation, to the effect that, as of February 20, 2001 and based upon and
subject to various considerations set forth in its opinion, the exchange ratio
was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of NEON common stock. A
copy of the opinion is included in NEON's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement
on Schedule 14D-9, which is being mailed to NEON stockholders together with this
prospectus. NEON stockholders should read the opinion carefully in its entirety.
The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to
whether or not stockholders should tender shares pursuant to the offer.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     NEON's stockholders should consider the following matters in deciding
whether to tender their shares of NEON common stock in the offer. You should
consider these matters in connection with the other information that we have
included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus.

RISKS RELATED TO THE PROPOSED OFFER AND MERGER

THE SYBASE COMMON STOCK TO BE RECEIVED BY NEON STOCKHOLDERS IN THE OFFER AND THE
MERGER WILL FLUCTUATE IN VALUE

     The market price of the shares of our common stock to be issued in the
offer and merger for NEON common stock may change as a result of changes in our
or NEON's business, operations or prospects, market assessments of the impact of
the offer and merger or general market conditions. Our results of operations, as
well as the market price of our common stock, may be affected by factors
different from those affecting NEON's results of operations and the market price
of NEON common stock. Because the market price of our common stock fluctuates,
the value of the Sybase shares to be received by NEON stockholders in the offer
or the merger will depend upon the market price of such shares at the time they
are received pursuant to the offer or the merger. There can be no assurance as
to this value. In addition, because the fraction of a Sybase share being offered
for each NEON share is fixed, the amount by which the value of the consideration
actually received by you in the offer or the merger could decline is not
limited. For historical and current market prices of our shares, see
"Comparative Per Share Market Price and Dividend Information" on page 52. On
April 3, 2001, the last practicable date prior to the filing of this document,
the last sale price of Sybase common stock on the Nasdaq National Market was
$12.94. On the basis of this price, the hypothetical value of the consideration
for each share of NEON common stock in the offer and the merger would be $5.02.
The actual market value of the consideration to be received by you for each NEON
share you surrender as of the closing of the offer or the merger could be
materially more or less than $5.02 per share, depending on the market price of
our shares at such time.

WE MAY FACE CHALLENGES IN INTEGRATING NEON'S BUSINESS WITH OURS AND, AS A
RESULT, MAY NOT REALIZE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS OF THE ANTICIPATED MERGER

     We may not be successful in integrating NEON's business with ours.
Integrating our operations and personnel with NEON's will be a complex process.
The integration may not be completed rapidly or achieve the anticipated benefits
of the merger. The successful integration of NEON's business with ours will
require, among other things, integration of our two companies' products and
services, sales and marketing, information and software systems, coordination of
employee retention, hiring and training and coordination of ongoing and future
research and development efforts. The diversion of the attention of management
and any difficulties encountered in the process of combining the companies could
cause the disruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the
combined company's business. Further, the process of combining NEON's business
with ours could negatively affect employee morale and our ability to retain some
of our or NEON's key employees after the merger.

     In addition, we intend after the merger to develop new products and
services that combine NEON's assets with ours. This may result in longer sales
cycles and product implementations, which may cause revenue and operating income
to fluctuate and fail to meet expectations. To date, we have not completed our
investigation into the obstacles, technological, market-driven or otherwise, to
developing and marketing these new products and services in a timely and
efficient way. There can be no assurance that we will be able to overcome these
obstacles, or that a market for such new Sybase products and services will
develop after the merger.

     Also, we could face additional risks inherent in NEON's business that we
were not previously subject to, such as additional requirements in the future to
fund our operations could be significantly increased due to the capital
requirements of NEON's business.

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF NEON HAVE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN THE
TRANSACTION

     NEON stockholders should be aware of potential conflicts of interest and
the benefits available to NEON directors when considering NEON's board of
directors' recommendation to approve the transaction. NEON officers and
directors have stock options, employment agreements and/or benefit plans that
provide them with interests in the transaction that are different from, or in
addition to, interests of NEON stockholders. See "Interests of NEON Officers and
Directors in the Transaction" on page 53.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MAY PROVE INACCURATE

     We have made forward-looking statements in this prospectus about Sybase,
NEON and the proposed combined company that are subject to risks and
uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include the information regarding:

synergies                                  capital spending
efficiencies                               the timetable for completing the merger
cost savings                               allocation of intangibles
revenue enhancements                       integration of operations
capital productivity                       product integration

     The sections in this document that have forward-looking statements include
"Questions and Answers About the Proposed Combination," "Summary," "Selected
Historical and Pro Forma Financial Data," "The Offer -- Background of the
Offer," "The Offer -- Reasons for the Offer and Merger," "Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Condensed Financial Statements" and "The Offer -- Opinion of NEON
Financial Advisor." Our forward-looking statements are also identified by such
words as "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "intends" or similar
expressions.

     The safe harbor provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995 is not available for forward-looking statements made in the context of the
offer. In making these statements, we believe that our expectations are based on
reasonable assumptions. Yet you should understand that the following important
factors (some of which are beyond our and NEON's control), in addition to those
discussed elsewhere in this prospectus and in the documents that we have
incorporated by reference, could affect the future results of Sybase and NEON,
and of the proposed combined company after completion of the merger. These
factors could also cause the results or other outcomes to differ materially from
those expressed in our forward-looking statements:

     Economic and Industry Conditions

     - materially adverse changes in economic or industry conditions generally
       or in the markets served by our companies;

     - product and labor prices, fluctuations in exchange rates and currency
       values;

     - capital expenditure requirements;

     - volatility in the stock market;

     Political/Governmental Factors

     - political developments and law and regulations, such as legislative or
       regulatory requirements, particularly concerning privacy and electronic
       commerce;

     - political stability in relevant areas of the world;

     Technology Advances

     - the development and use of new technology;

     Operating Factors

     - changes in operating conditions and costs;

     - interest rates;

     - access to capital markets;

     Transaction or Commercial Factors

     - our ability to integrate the businesses of Sybase and NEON successfully
       after the merger;

     - the challenges inherent in diverting management's focus and resources
       from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters during
       the integration process;

     - the process of, or conditions imposed in connection with, obtaining
       regulatory clearance for the merger;

     Competitive Factors

     - the actions of competitors;

THE RECEIPT OF SYBASE SHARES COULD BE TAXABLE TO YOU, DEPENDING ON FACTS
SURROUNDING THE OFFER AND MERGER

     We and NEON have structured the offer and the merger to qualify as a
tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes. As a condition to the
consummation of the offer, we and NEON will obtain opinions of Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, and Cooley Godward LLP,
respectively, that, although there is limited authority, the offer and the
merger will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, if (1) the offer and the
merger are completed under the current terms of the reorganization agreement,
(2) the minimum tender condition for the offer is satisfied and (3) the merger
is completed promptly after the offer. However, the ability to satisfy these
factual assumptions, and therefore the federal income tax consequences of the
offer and the merger, depend in part on facts that will not be available before
the completion of the merger. There can be no assurance that the merger will be
completed, or that these factual assumptions will be satisfied.

     If these factual assumptions are not satisfied, a NEON stockholder's
exchange of shares of NEON common stock for shares of our common stock in the
offer or the merger could be a taxable transaction, depending on surrounding
facts. You are urged to carefully read the discussion under "The Offer --
Material Federal Income Tax Consequences" on page 43, and to consult your tax
advisor on the consequences of participation in the offer and/or the merger.

SYBASE WILL INCUR LARGE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES

     In connection with the offer and the merger, large non-cash charges may
make our results of operations more difficult to interpret and may be viewed
unfavorably by investors and the financial community.

POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FROM PRELIMINARY
ESTIMATES REFLECTED IN THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION MAY OCCUR
ONCE THE PURCHASE CONSIDERATION IS FINALLY ALLOCATED TO NEON'S NET ASSETS

     Pro forma results of operations reflect adjustments, which are based upon
preliminary estimates, to reflect the allocation of the purchase consideration
to the acquired assets and liabilities of NEON. The final allocation of the
purchase consideration will be determined after the completion of the merger and
will be based on appraisals and a comprehensive final evaluation of the fair
value of NEON's tangible assets, liabilities and identifiable intangible assets
at the time of the merger. Accordingly, the final determination of tangible and
intangible assets may result in amortization expense that is significantly
higher than the preliminary estimates of these amounts, which would cause our
depreciation and amortization expenses to increase. See "Notes to Unaudited Pro
Forma Combined Condensed Financial Statements" on page 30.

NEED FOR GOVERNMENTAL CLEARANCES MAY DELAY CONSUMMATION OF THE OFFER AND THE
MERGER

     The offer is conditioned upon the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976 for which we received notice of early termination on March 9, 2001. In
addition, other filings with, notifications to and authorizations and approvals
of, various governmental agencies with respect to the offer, the merger and
other transactions contemplated by the reorganization agreement and the
stockholder agreements, relating primarily to antitrust issues, must be made and
received prior to the consummation of the offer and merger. We and NEON are
seeking to obtain all required regulatory clearances prior to the scheduled
completion of these transactions. You should be aware that all required
regulatory clearances may not be obtained on that timetable, restrictions on the
combined operations of the two companies may be sought by governmental agencies
as a condition to obtaining these clearances and operating restrictions imposed
could adversely affect the value of the combined company. Please refer to the
"The Offer -- Conditions of the Offer" and "-- Regulatory Clearances" on pages
48 and 49, respectively, for more information.

PARTNERS OR CUSTOMERS MAY REACT UNFAVORABLY TO THE PROPOSED COMBINATION

     Both we and NEON partner with numerous other technology companies including
software and services firms to deliver Sybase and NEON products to customers.
Some of these partners may feel that the combined company poses new competitive
threats to their businesses and as a result may break their relationships with
us or NEON. For example, the consummation of the offer and the merger will give
IBM the right to terminate its joint development, marketing and reseller
arrangement with NEON. In 2000, 1999 and 1998, royalty revenue from IBM sales of
NEON products accounted for 17%, 8% and 8%, respectively, of NEON's total
revenues. In addition, some of our customers or customers of NEON may view the
combined company as a competitor and, therefore, cancel orders with Sybase or
NEON.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS

THE MARKET FOR OUR STOCK IS HIGHLY VOLATILE

     The trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely over the last
five years and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Several factors have
caused, and in the future may cause, the market price of our common stock to
fluctuate, including:

     - quarterly variations in our operating and financial results;

     - announcements by others of technological innovations;

     - our ability, as compared to the ability of our competitors, to develop
       new products or win customer contracts;

     - changes in prices of our products and services or our competitors'
       products and services;

     - changes in our product mix;

     - changes in our revenues and revenue growth rates, as a whole or for
       individual geographic areas;

     - changes in our business units, products or product categories; and

     - statements or changes in opinions, ratings or earnings estimates made by
       brokerage firms and industry analysts relating to us, our products, the
       market in which we do business, and/or our competitors.

     In addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme
price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price
for many high-technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the
operating performance of these companies.

THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF OUR REVENUES VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY AND ESTIMATION OF OUR
REVENUES IS DIFFICULT

     The timing and amount of our revenues from license fees are subject to a
number of factors that make estimation of revenues and operating results before
the end of a quarter extremely uncertain. We have generally experienced a
seasonal pattern of a decline in license fees from the fourth quarter to the
succeeding first quarter of each fiscal year. This contributes to lower total
revenues and poorer operating results in the first quarter compared to the prior
fourth quarter.

     Historically, we have operated with little or no backlog. As a result,
license fee revenues in any quarter are primarily dependent on orders that are
booked and shipped in the same quarter. In addition, the uncertain timing of
closing of large license agreements increases the risk of quarter-to-quarter
fluctuations and the uncertainty of estimating quarterly operating results. We
have experienced a pattern of recording 50 percent to 70 percent of our
quarterly license fee revenues in the third month of each quarter, with a
concentration of our license fee revenues in the last two weeks of the third
month. Our operating expenses, however, are based on projected annual and
quarterly revenue levels and are incurred approximately ratably throughout each
quarter.

     Because our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, if
projected revenues are not realized in the expected period, our operating
results for that period would be adversely affected and could result in an
operating loss.

     Failure to achieve revenues, earnings, and other operating and financial
results as forecast or anticipated by brokerage firms and industry analysts has
previously resulted in, and in the future could result in, an immediate and
substantial adverse effect on the market price of our stock.

WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE A GROWTH RATE CONSISTENT WITH GROWTH IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH
WE COMPETE

     In the future, we may not achieve rates of growth projected for the
software markets in which we compete, which could have a material adverse effect
on our business. The factors that influence our growth rate include the
following:

     - The market for our software products and services is extremely
       competitive and characterized by dynamic customer demands, rapid
       technological and marketplace changes, and frequent product enhancements
       and new product introductions.

     - To compete successfully against other software providers, our products
       and services in each aspect of our business need to be competitive with
       the products and services offered by our competitors in each line of
       business.

     - We may not successfully provide competitive solutions to customers of our
       products and services and failure to do so could result in the loss of
       existing customers or the inability to attract and retain new customers.

     - A number of our competitors, such as Oracle Corporation, Microsoft
       Corporation, IBM Corporation and Computer Associates, Inc., and our
       potential competitors have or may have significantly greater financial,
       technical, sales and marketing resources, and a larger installed product
       base than ours.

     - Many of our competitors offer additional categories of products, such as
       applications or operating systems that we do not offer, which may provide
       those companies with a competitive advantage in various circumstances.

     - New or enhanced products, many of which have been announced and many of
       which are continually introduced by existing or future competitors in the
       software industry, could increase the competition faced by our products
       and result in greater price pressure on some of our products, especially
       to the extent that market acceptance for personal computer-oriented and
       Windows NT technologies increases at the expense of UNIX-based systems
       upon which many of our products are based.

     - Many products we offer contain components developed by third parties. If
       third party components prove to be defective or are not properly
       supported, market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected.

     - Commercial acceptance of our products and services could be adversely
       affected by critical or negative statements or reports by brokerage
       firms, industry and financial analysts, and industry periodicals
       concerning Sybase and our products, business or competitors, or by the
       advertising or marketing efforts of competitors that could affect
       customer perception.

     - Customer perception could be adversely affected by financial results,
       particularly revenues and profitability, we report, by reductions in the
       applicable market share of our products and by related press reports.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS, OUR
OPERATING RESULTS WILL SUFFER

     Our future results of operations will depend in part on our ability to
enhance existing products, to introduce new products on a timely and
cost-effective basis that will meet dynamic customer requirements and ultimately
to gain market acceptance for those products. Customer requirements for products
can rapidly change as a result of innovations or changes within the computer
hardware and software industries. For example, the widespread use of the
Internet is rapidly giving rise to new customer requirements as well as new
methods and practices of selling, marketing and distributing products and
services.

OUR INTRODUCTION OF NEW OR ENHANCED PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE REVENUES FROM EXISTING
PRODUCTS

     In recent years, we have announced the general availability of a variety of
new products and integrated sets of package applications for customer-specific
customization and data warehouse management. These announcements were intended
to enhance the ability of our partners and direct sales force to market and sell
more complete solutions to customers in a single package and to improve
productivity, revenues and profitability. The associated elimination of the
availability of individual products subsumed within integrated product sets,
however, could have an adverse effect on our other license fees and service
revenue, particularly if integrated product sets are not well received in the
marketplace.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL DEPEND INCREASINGLY ON THE COMPATIBILITY OF OUR
PRODUCTS WITH OTHER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED BY THIRD PARTIES

     The compatibility of our products with existing and future leading,
industry-standard application software products intended to be used in
connection with relational database management systems is important to our
success. Failure to meet existing or future interoperability and performance
requirements of independent vendors marketing software applications in a timely
manner has in the past and could in the future adversely affect the market for
our products. Certain leading applications are not interoperable with our
relational data base management systems, and others may never be available on
our systems.

     In addition, we have designed our application development tools, database
design tools and some of our connectivity products for use with relational data
base management systems offered by our competitors. Vendors of relational data
base management systems and related products supplied by others may become less
willing in the future to provide us with access to products, technical
information and marketing and sales support. If existing and potential
customers, who use relational data base management systems and related products
supplied by others, refrain from purchasing our products due to concerns that
the development, quality and support of our products will diminish over time,
our business could be materially and adversely affected.

CUSTOMER MOVEMENT TOWARD PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS MAY REDUCE THE DEMAND
FOR OUR PRODUCTS

     Many customers use our products to build and deploy their own custom
applications. Increased reliance on prepackaged applications has and may in the
future continue to have the effect of reducing the internal development of
custom applications overall. This type of reduction has and may in the future
continue to have a material and adverse impact on the market for the products we
provide for custom applications.

DELAYS IN PRODUCT INTRODUCTION SCHEDULES COULD HURT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS

     Delays in the scheduled availability of our products, a lack of or decrease
in market acceptance of new or enhanced products, our failure to accurately
anticipate customer demand or to meet customer performance requirements or our
inability to anticipate competitive products and developments could have a
material adverse effect on our business and financial results. We have
experienced delays in introducing some new products in the past. Unanticipated
delays in product availability schedules could result from various factors
including:

     - development or testing difficulties;

     - feature changes;

     - software errors;

     - shortages in appropriately skilled software engineers; and

     - project management problems.

OUR GROWTH IS IN PART DEPENDENT UPON A ROBUST INTERNET INDUSTRY

     Because global commerce and the online exchange of information on the
Internet and other similar open wide area networks are new and evolving, it is
difficult to predict with any assurance whether the Internet will prove to be
and remain a viable commercial marketplace for our products and services. Our
ability to derive revenues from Internet products and services will depend in
part upon a robust Internet industry and our ability to respond to the software
development challenges it presents. Moreover, critical issues concerning the
commercial use of the Internet, including security, reliability, cost, ease of
use and access, and quality of service, remain unresolved and may impact the
growth of Internet use and our products. If the Internet does not continue to
grow as a commercial marketplace, our business could be materially and adversely
affected.

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

     We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our international
operations. For example in 2000, revenues from international operations
represented 39 percent of our total revenues for that period. In 1998 and 1999,
we determined that our operations in several foreign countries did not generate
sufficient revenue to support the cost of maintaining separate subsidiaries in
those countries. Consequently, we closed our foreign subsidiaries in Mexico,
Thailand, Chile, Peru and Venezuela and moved the sales function in those
countries to distributors. In September 2000, we acquired certain assets and
assumed certain liabilities of our distributor in Mexico in light of changing
conditions. If the distributor relationships in these countries are not
successful or we experience other downturns in our international business, our
total revenue could be seriously harmed. Our operations and financial results
also could be significantly affected by factors associated with international
operations, such as:

     - changes in foreign currency exchange rates;

     - uncertainties relative to regional economic circumstances;

     - strength of local economies;

     - political instability in emerging markets;

     - the introduction of the Euro currency units;

     - difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; and

     - the general volatility of international software markets.

     In addition, there have been several recent management and organizational
changes within our international operations. International revenues in absolute
dollars and as a percentage of total revenues may fluctuate in part due to the
growth and, in some cases, the relative immaturity or closure of our
international organizations.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CAN AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY

     Although the pricing strategy for our international operations takes into
account changes in exchange rates over time, we face exposure to adverse
movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over
time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on
our financial position and results of operations. Historically, our primary
exposures have related to non-U.S.-dollar denominated sales and expenses in
Europe, Asia Pacific, Australia and Latin America.

     In order to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we hedge
our exposure on some transactional balances that are denominated in foreign
currencies through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. For
the most part, these exposures consist of intercompany amounts owed by our
international subsidiaries to us, their parent company, as a result of local
sales of software licenses. The majority of these exposures are denominated in
European and Asia Pacific currencies, primarily the Euro and the Hong Kong
dollar. These forward exchange contracts are recorded at fair value and are
short-term in nature (primarily 30 days or less). The success of this activity
depends upon our accurate estimation of future transactions denominated in
various currencies. To the extent that these estimates are overstated or
understated during periods of currency volatility, unanticipated currency gains
or losses could affect our financial position and results of operations. At
December 31, 2000, we had forward exchange contracts to exchange various foreign
currencies for U.S. dollars in the amount of $5.7 million and to exchange U.S.
dollars and Euros into various foreign currencies in the amounts of $9.7 million
and $21.4 million, respectively. Neither the cost nor the fair value of these
foreign currency forward exchange contracts was material at December 31, 2000.
Further, one of two major U.S. multinational banks is a counter party to
substantially all of these contracts and their default on these exchange
contracts could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of
operations.

OUR PRODUCTS CANNOT BE COMPLETELY FREE OF ERRORS AND DEFECTS

     New products or new versions of existing products may, despite testing,
contain undetected errors or "bugs." This could delay the introduction, or
adversely affect commercial acceptance, of these products or give rise to
warranty or other customer claims, which could, in turn, adversely affect our
financial results. Complex software products, such as the type licensed by us
and our competitors, generally are not completely free from "bugs" and other
errors and defects. The existence of these "bugs" may cause our customers to
bring legal claims against us, notwithstanding standard provisions in our
license agreements disclaiming express and implied warranties against errors and
defects. Moreover, not all products or modified versions of products previously
licensed by us meet current standards for Year 2000 compliance, and many of
these are still in use by our customers. Customers using our older software that
is not Year 2000 compliant could have received, or in the future may receive,
erroneous data or experience other software failures of which we or our
customers are not yet aware. Any legal claims that our products are not Year
2000 compliant or are otherwise defective could have a materially adverse impact
on our business and results of operations.

WE HAVE IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE ACQUIRE OTHER BUSINESSES AND MAKE
STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS, WHICH WILL INVOLVE NUMEROUS RISKS AND COULD NEGATIVELY
AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS

     We have made, and in the future may make, acquisitions of, or significant
investments in, other software businesses such as the proposed acquisition of
NEON described in this prospectus. For example: in February 1998, we acquired
Intellidex Systems, L.L.C., a provider of meta data management technology for
deploying and managing data warehouse environments, for cash and contingent
future payments of cash based on specified performance criteria. We accounted
for this transaction as a purchase. As a result $5 million has been paid, and
upon satisfaction of certain conditions, an additional $10 million may be paid.
Such payments are reflected as purchased software, intangible assets or goodwill
on our balance sheet and amortized to expense over a period of no more than
three years. In February 1999, we acquired Data Warehouse Network, an
Ireland-based, privately held provider of packaged, industry-specific business
intelligence applications, for cash and contingent future payments of cash based
on specified performance criteria. We accounted for the transaction as a
purchase. As a result, $4.5 million has been paid and, upon satisfaction of
certain conditions, an additional $3.5 million may be paid. Such payments are
reflected as purchased software, intangible assets or goodwill on our balance
sheet and amortized to expense over a period of no more than three years. In
March 1999, we paid $5.4 million for Convertible Secured Promissory Notes due
December 31, 2002, issued by Demica PLC, a provider of a wholesale banking
application using our technology. The notes bear interest at 8.0% per annum and,
at the time of issuance, were convertible into 29.9% of the total equity of
Demica. On July 13, 2000, we converted the notes, then sold 10% of the resulting
shares for $1.7 million. As a result, we hold 1,816,035 Demica shares. We
account for this investment using the cost method of accounting. In January
2000, we acquired Home Financial Network, a financial services company
specializing in the development of customized e-finance Internet sites, for
approximately $25.9 million cash and approximately 7.8 million shares of our
common stock. In addition, we assumed the options (vested and unvested) held by
former Home Financial Network option holders. We accounted for the acquisition
as a purchase. The historical results of operations for Home Financial Network
and pro forma financial statements of the combined companies have been included
in our current report on Form 8-K dated February 3, 2000, as amended. The
acquisition resulted in an excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
the net assets acquired of approximately $165.1 million. Of this excess, $20.0
million was allocated to customer lists, $18.0 million was allocated to
developed technology, $119.1 million was allocated to goodwill, and $8.0 million
was allocated to in-process research and development. The amount allocated to
in-process research and development will be charged to expense as a
non-recurring charge during 2000 since the in-process research and development
has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future
uses. The amount allocated to customer list, developed technology and goodwill
will be amortized on a straight-line basis over an average of 7 years. The
achievement of the desired benefits of these and future acquisitions and the
successful combination of businesses will depend upon, among other things:

     - whether the integration of the acquired businesses is achieved in an
       efficient manner;

     - successful integration of the companies' related product offerings and
       coordination of their sales, marketing, and research and development
       efforts; and

     - the ability to manage geographically distant organizations.

     Our prior or future acquisitions or investments also face risks commonly
encountered with respect to acquisitions of businesses which may affect the
stability of revenues generated from customers or have a material adverse effect
on our financial results. In connection with the Home Financial Network
acquisition and any other acquisitions, we may incur:

     - costs, liabilities or additional expenses that could adversely affect our
       results of operations and financial condition;

     - difficulties of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired
       businesses;

     - disruption of our ongoing business;

     - the inability of management to maximize our financial and strategic
       position through the successful integration of the acquired business;

     - an inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and
       policies, impairment of relationships with existing and future customers
       and other business associates, and revision of our business plans, which
       in turn could result in unplanned expenses or a loss of anticipated
       benefits from past investments; and

     - additional charges to earnings for amortization of goodwill, because each
       acquisition accounted for as a purchase can increase the amount of
       goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as an asset on our
       financial statements.

OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE OF OUR KEY EXECUTIVE
AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL AND OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY, HIRE AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL
PERSONNEL

     Our success and ability to achieve future revenue and earnings growth
depends in part on our ability to effectively recruit, retain and, in some
cases, train qualified officers, directors and other personnel and on our
officers and key personnel to manage growth and expenses successfully, through
the implementation of appropriate management systems and controls. High rates of
turnover, particularly among management, consulting, engineering or sales staff
and failure to effectively implement or maintain appropriate systems and
controls could materially and adversely affect our product development efforts,
sales of products and services, business and results of operations.

     The competition for officers, directors, and personnel is intense in the
software industry and has increased substantially in recent years. We have
experienced a high rate of employee turnover and there have been a number of
changes in our board of directors and in our executive management team. Although
not anticipated at this time, if in the future there were significant changes in
management, significant increases in employee turnover or adverse comparisons
between our financial and stock price performance relative to companies with
which we compete for employees, there could be a resulting increase in employee
turnover, which could make attraction of quality management and other employees
more difficult.

WE COULD BE HARMED BY COSTLY LITIGATION

     We were a defendant in several class action lawsuits that alleged
violations of federal and state securities laws by us and our officers and
directors and a purported stockholder derivative lawsuit which alleged that
present and former officers and/or directors of Sybase breached fiduciary duties
they owed to us in connection with the underlying circumstances alleged in the
securities class actions. These lawsuits have been settled and will have no
financial impact on us going forward.

     We are a party to various legal disputes and proceedings arising from the
ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, resolution of these
matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position. However, depending on the amount and timing, a nonfavorable
resolution of some or all of these matters could materially affect our future
results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

     An inability to obtain adequate copyright, patent or trade secret
protection for our products in certain countries may have a material adverse
impact on future operating results. Also, as the number of software products and
associated patents increase, it is possible that software developers will become
subject to more frequent infringement claims.

     In the past, third parties have claimed that their patents or other
proprietary rights were violated by Sybase products. It is possible that such
claims will be asserted in the future. Regardless of whether these claims have
merit, they can be time consuming and expensive to defend or settle and can harm
our

business and reputation. We do not believe our products infringe any third party
patents or proprietary rights but there is no guarantee that we can avoid claims
or findings of infringement in the future.

MEASURES TAKEN TO PROTECT PROPRIETARY INFORMATION MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO DETER
MISAPPROPRIATION AND INFRINGEMENT BY US OF OTHERS' RIGHTS COULD OCCUR

     Our business depends in part on the quality of our technological expertise
and proprietary technologies. In order to protect proprietary information and
intellectual property, we enter into license agreements with clients in the
ordinary course of business which contain terms prohibiting unauthorized
reproduction or use of our products and services and those of third parties,
requiring confidentiality agreements with associates, contractors, clients,
potential clients and suppliers who have access to sensitive information, and
limiting access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information. We cannot
assure you that these steps or other procedures we follow will be adequate to
deter misappropriation or infringement of our proprietary rights or independent
third party development of substantially similar products and technology. In
addition, we cannot assure you that our current and future products will not
infringe the proprietary rights of others. Infringement by us of others' rights
could result in lawsuits against us, liabilities to others and adverse effects
on our business, financial condition and operating results.

OUR INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

     The software industry is highly competitive and we face intense
competition. The combined company may encounter competition from new
competitors, including established software companies with substantial
resources. Some of our competitors may have financial, technical, marketing or
other capabilities more extensive than ours or may be able to respond more
quickly to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures. We may
not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors
and competition may adversely affect our business, financial condition or
operating results.

UNTIMELY CLOSURE OF OUR EMERYVILLE, CALIFORNIA OR MASSACHUSETTS DISTRIBUTION
FACILITIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT FINANCIAL RESULTS

     Most of the products we ship in North America come from our Emeryville,
California and Massachusetts distribution facilities. Because of the pattern of
recording a high percentage of quarterly revenues within the last week or two
weeks of the quarter, the closure or inoperability of one or more of the
facilities or a disruption of business operations generally during these weeks,
due to a natural calamity or due to a systems or power failure, could have a
material adverse effect on our ability to record revenues for the quarter and,
therefore, on the overall results of operations for the quarter. Our facilities
in the State of California have recently been subject to electrical blackouts as
a consequence of a shortage of available electrical power. In the event these
blackouts recur, they could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities.

OUR REVENUES ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO FLUCTUATIONS BASED ON GENERAL ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS

     If a general economic downturn or a recession occurs in the United States
or other countries where we have substantial operations, then our customers and
potential customers may substantially and immediately reduce their software
budgets. If this type of an economic downturn occurs, there can be no assurance
that our business will not be materially and adversely affected.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND IN THE WAY WE CHARGE FOR LICENSES COULD
AFFECT OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS

     In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, or
AICPA, issued its Statement of Position 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition,"
and later amended its position by its Statement of Position 98-4 and Statement
of Position 98-9. Based on our interpretation of the AICPA's position, we
believe our current revenue recognition policies and practices are consistent
with Statement of

Position 97-2, Statement of Position 98-4 and Statement of Position 98-9.
However, Technical Practice Aids for these standards continue to be issued by
various accounting standard setters. Any such Technical Practice Aids could lead
to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices, which
could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and
operating results.

     Accounting standard setters, including the SEC and the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, are also currently reviewing the accounting standards related
to business combinations and other areas. Any changes to these accounting
standards or the way these standards are interpreted or applied could require us
to change the way we account for any acquisitions we may pursue, or other
aspects of our business, in a manner that could adversely affect our reported
financial results.

REALIZATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET IS DEPENDENT UPON GENERATION OF SUFFICIENT
TAXABLE INCOME IN FUTURE PERIODS

     At December 31, 2000, we had net deferred tax assets of $47.6 million.
Deferred tax assets are net of a valuation allowance of $10.4 million.
Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of
sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to
obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from tax credit
carry-forwards. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is
subject to adjustment in future periods, if estimates of future taxable income
are reduced. These adjustments could have a material adverse impact on our
effective tax rate and results of operations in future periods.

INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR
INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

     We maintain an investment portfolio containing the securities of various
issuers, types and maturities. These securities are generally classified as
available for sale and, consequently, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair
value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of
stockholders' equity, net of tax, if material. Unrealized gains and losses at
December 31, 2000 were not material. Our cash, cash equivalent and short-term
cash investment balances of $314.0 million at December 31, 2000 consisted
primarily of short-term money market instruments. Our long-term cash investments
of $40.6 million at December 31, 2000 primarily consisted of commercial paper,
bonds and mid-term notes that have maturity dates of more than one year but less
than two years. We do not believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is
material given the short-term nature of our investment portfolio. However, there
can be no assurance that this exposure will not have an adverse effect on our
financial performance.

THE ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS WE HAVE ADOPTED MAY DELAY, DEFER OR PREVENT A
CHANGE OF CONTROL

     We have adopted anti-takeover measures designed to prevent hostile
takeovers that are not approved by the board of directors, but that some, or a
majority of, our stockholders might nevertheless consider to be in their best
interests, including acquisition offers or attempted takeovers that might
otherwise result in the stockholders receiving a premium over the market price
of our common stock. Each outstanding share of our common stock includes a right
to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of our Series A Participating
Preferred Stock, which will generally be afforded economic rights similar to one
share of our common stock in specified events. In the event of the acquisition
of or announcement of a tender or exchange offer for, 15% or more of our common
stock, the rights separate from the common stock and become exercisable. In such
event, holders of the rights will generally be able to purchase, for an exercise
price of $250 a share, an amount of common stock (and in certain circumstances
securities of the acquirer), having a then current market value of two times the
exercise price. The shares of Series A Participating Preferred Stock are
redeemable, at our option, for a specified period at a price of $0.01 per share
and expire in March 2002.

     In addition, certain provisions of Delaware Law, our Certificate of
Incorporation and our Bylaws contain provisions that could delay, deter or
prevent a merger, tender offer or other business combination or a change in
control of Sybase. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, among other
things, restrict the ability of stockholders to call stockholders meetings by
allowing only stockholders holding, in the

aggregate, not less than 10% of the capital stock entitled to cast votes at
these meetings to call a meeting, preclude stockholders from raising new
business for consideration at stockholder meetings unless the proponent has
provided us with timely advance notice of the new business, and limit business
that may be conducted at stockholder meetings to those matters properly
specified in notices delivered to us. Moreover, we have not opted out of Section
203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits mergers, sales of
material assets and some types of self-dealing transactions between a
corporation and a holder of 15% or more of the corporation's outstanding voting
stock for a period of three years following the date the stockholder became a
15% holder, unless an applicable exemption from the rule is available.

FUTURE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF SYBASE CAPITAL STOCK COULD ADVERSELY
AFFECT THE SELLING PRICE OF OUR STOCK

     We may issue additional capital stock, warrants and/or other securities to
raise capital in the future, or in order to attract and retain essential
personnel.

     The increase in the number of outstanding shares of common stock that are
available for sale without restriction due to the registration of these shares
and the perception that a substantial number of these shares may be sold by
certain stockholders, or the actual sale of a substantial number of these shares
by stockholders, could adversely affect the market price of the common stock. We
cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of our common stock may
have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time.

THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT FUTURE REGULATIONS COULD BE ENACTED THAT EITHER
DIRECTLY RESTRICT OUR BUSINESS OR INDIRECTLY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS BY LIMITING THE
GROWTH OF INTERNET COMMERCE

     As Internet commerce evolves, we expect that federal, state or foreign
agencies will adopt regulations covering issues such as user privacy, pricing,
content and quality of products and services. If enacted, these laws, rules or
regulations could limit the market for our products and services, which could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating
results. Although many of these regulations may not apply to our business
directly, we expect that laws regulating the solicitation, collection or
processing of personal/consumer information could indirectly affect our
business. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits certain types of
information and content from being transmitted over the Internet. The
prohibition's scope and the liability associated with a Telecommunications Act
violation are currently unsettled. In addition, although substantial portions of
the Communications Decency Act were held to be unconstitutional, we cannot be
certain that similar legislation will not be enacted and upheld in the future.
It is possible that this type of legislation could expose companies involved in
Internet commerce to liability, which could limit the growth of Internet
commerce generally. Legislation like the Telecommunications Act and the
Communications Decency Act could dampen the growth in Web usage and decrease its
acceptance as a communications and commercial medium.

     The United States government also regulates the export of encryption
technology, which our products incorporate. If our export authority is revoked
or modified, if our software is unlawfully exported or if the United States
government adopts new legislation or regulation restricting export of software
and encryption technology, our business, operating results and financial
condition could be materially adversely affected. Current or future export
regulations may limit our ability to distribute our software outside the United
States. Although we take precautions against unlawful export of our software, we
cannot effectively control the unauthorized distribution of software across the
Internet.

COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

     The following table reflects (a) the historical net income (loss) and book
value per share of Sybase common stock and the historical net income (loss) and
book value per share of NEON common stock in comparison with the unaudited pro
forma net income (loss) and book value per share after giving effect to Sybase's
proposed merger with NEON, and (b) the equivalent historical net income (loss)
and book value per share attributable to .3878 shares of Sybase common stock
which will be received for each share of NEON.

     The historical book value per share is computed by dividing common
stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2000, by the actual common shares
outstanding. The pro forma net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing
the pro forma net income (loss) by the pro forma weighted average number of
shares outstanding, assuming Sybase had merged with NEON at January 1, 2000. The
pro forma combined book value per share is computed by dividing total pro forma
stockholders' equity by the pro forma number of shares of common stock
outstanding at December 31, 2000, assuming the merger had occurred on that date.
The NEON equivalent pro forma combined per share amounts are calculated by
multiplying the Sybase pro forma combined per share amounts by the exchange
ratio of 0.3878.

     The following information should be read in conjunction with (a) the
separate historical financial statements and related notes of Sybase, (b) the
separate historical financial statements and related notes of NEON, and (c) the
unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information and related notes
of Sybase and the selected historical and selected unaudited pro forma financial
data included elsewhere in this prospectus. The pro forma information is
presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of
the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the
merger had been consummated as of the assumed dates, nor is it necessarily
indicative of the future operating results or financial position of the combined
companies.

COMPARATIVE MARKET PRICE INFORMATION

     The following table sets forth the last sale prices per share of Sybase
common stock and NEON common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on February 20,
2001, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the proposed
merger, and on April 3, 2001, the most recent date for which prices were
practically available prior to filing this document. The table also sets forth
the value of the shares of Sybase common stock that a NEON stockholder would
have received for one share of NEON common stock, assuming that the merger had
taken place on those dates. These numbers have been calculated by multiplying
0.3878, the exchange ratio of Sybase shares for each NEON share, by the last
sale price per share of Sybase common stock on those dates. The actual value of
the shares of Sybase common stock a stockholder will receive on the date of the
merger may be higher or lower than the prices set forth below.

          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
give effect to the merger between Sybase and NEON proposed on February 20, 2001
and the acquisition of HFN on January 20, 2000, both accounted for as purchase
business combinations.

     On February 20, 2001 Sybase entered into a reorganization agreement with
NEON for consideration preliminarily valued at $361.0 million, consisting of
14.3 million shares of Sybase common stock valued at $316.6 million as of such
date and 3.1 million options to purchase Sybase common stock valued at an
estimated $32.6 million, and estimated direct acquisition costs of $11.8
million. The estimated direct acquisition costs consist primarily of investment
banker, legal and accounting fees, regulatory filing and printing costs to be
incurred by Sybase and NEON which are directly related to the merger. The actual
value of the consideration for the merger with NEON cannot yet be determined
since the merger has not yet been completed. There can be no assurance that
Sybase and NEON will not incur additional charges related to the merger or that
management will be successful in its efforts to integrate the operations of the
two companies. For the purpose of the following pro forma financial information,
the number of shares of Sybase common stock assumed to be issued in the merger
with NEON is approximately 14.3 million. This amount is based on the number of
common shares of NEON outstanding as of February 20, 2001, the date of the
reorganization agreement. Similarly, the estimated value of options to purchase
Sybase common stock to be issued in the merger with NEON is based on the
outstanding options to purchase shares of NEON common stock as of February 20,
2001. The actual number of shares of Sybase common stock and options to be
issued will be based on the actual outstanding common shares and options of NEON
as of the date of completion of the merger.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet combines the
audited historical condensed balance sheets of Sybase and NEON as of December
31, 2000.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations give
effect to the proposed merger between Sybase and NEON, and the completed
acquisition of HFN, as if it had occurred on January 1, 2000. The unaudited pro
forma combined condensed statement of operations for the year ended December 31,
2000 combines the audited historical statement of operations of Sybase and NEON
for the year ended December 31, 2000, along with the unaudited historical
statement of operations for HFN for the period January 1, 2000 to January 20,
2000.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements include
adjustments, which are based upon preliminary estimates, to reflect the
allocation of purchase consideration to the acquired assets and liabilities of
NEON. The final allocation of the purchase consideration will be determined
after the completion of the merger and will be based on appraisals and a
comprehensive final evaluation of the fair value of NEON's tangible assets
acquired, liabilities assumed, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill at
the time of the acquisition. The final determination of tangible and intangible
assets may result in depreciation and amortization expenses that are different
from the preliminary estimates of these amounts. To the extent that a portion of
the purchase price is allocated to in-process research and development as is
anticipated, a charge will be recognized for the period in which the acquisition
occurs. Any change to depreciation and amortization expenses may be material to
Sybase's results of operations.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements do not
include the realization of cost savings from operating efficiencies, synergies
or other restructurings that may result from the mergers.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed information is presented for
illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating
results or financial position that would have occurred if the merger and the
acquisition had been consummated as of the assumed dates, nor is it necessarily
indicative of future operating results or financial position of the combined
companies. The pro forma adjustments are based upon information and assumptions
available at the time of the filing of this document.

     The pro forma information should be read in conjunction with the
accompanying notes thereto, Sybase's historical financial statements and related
notes thereto incorporated by reference in this prospectus, NEON's historical
financial statements and related notes thereto incorporated by reference in this
prospectus, and other information pertaining to Sybase and NEON included or

and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Risk
Factors" of each company included or incorporated by reference in this

                NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED

                              FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated balance sheet has
been prepared as if the acquisition occurred on December 31, 2000, the date of
the pro forma balance sheet. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed
consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 has
been prepared to reflect the acquisition of NEON by Sybase as if the acquisition
had occurred on January 1, 2000. Sybase will account for the acquisition of NEON
as a purchase business combination. The pro forma combined condensed
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000
reflects the combination of the separate historical statement of operations of
NEON with the pro forma results of Sybase. The Sybase pro forma statement of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 combines the results of Sybase
with HFN, a company acquired by Sybase on January 20, 2000. The pro forma
combined condensed balance sheet reflects the combination of the separate
historical balance sheets of NEON and Sybase as of December 31, 2000.

     The total estimated purchase cost of the acquisition has been allocated on
a preliminary basis to assets and liabilities based on management's
determination of their fair values. The excess of the purchase cost over the
fair value of the net tangible assets acquired has been preliminarily allocated
by management to goodwill and other purchased intangibles. The estimated
purchase price, the excess of the purchase cost over the fair value of the net
tangible assets and the allocation to intangible assets is subject to change
pending completion of the final analysis of the fair values of the stock options
assumed, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The impact of these
changes could be material.

     Pro forma adjustments for the unaudited pro forma combined condensed
balance sheet and statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000
are as follows:

 (1) To reflect the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of NEON
     for a total estimated purchase cost of approximately $361.0 million. The
     purchase consideration consists of the following:

     (a) Issuance of approximately 14,291,000 shares of Sybase common stock with
         a fair value of approximately $316.6 million. The fair value per share
         of common stock issued is based on the average of the closing prices on
         the two days prior to and after the acquisition agreement announcement,
         February 16, February 20, February 21 and February 22, 2001,
         respectively.

     (b) Assumption of options to purchase approximately 3,128,000 shares of
         Sybase common stock with a fair value of approximately $32.6 million.
         The fair value of the options assumed was determined based on the
         Black-Scholes model. Assumptions used in determining the fair value of
         the options assumed under the Black-Scholes model are as follows:

          - Fair market value of the underlying shares is based on the average
            closing price of Sybase shares for February 16, February 20,
            February 21, and February 22.

          - Expected life -- .25 to 4.25 years

          - Expected volatility -- .7093

          - Risk-free interest rate -- 6.18%

          - Expected dividend rate -- 0%

     (c) Merger related costs of approximately $11.8 million consisting
         primarily of fees for investment bankers, attorneys, accountants,
         regulatory filings and financial printing. No pro forma adjustments
         have been made to reflect costs associated with combining the
         operations of the two companies, or severance benefits and costs
         associated with discontinuing some redundant business activities, as
         the nature and amount of these costs have not yet been determined.

 (2) The preliminary allocation of the purchase price over the fair value of net
     tangible assets acquired, using an assumed December 31, 2000 closing date
     for purposes of determining net tangible assets has been determined as
     follows (in millions):

Total purchase price........................................  $361.0
Fair value of identifiable net tangible assets acquired.....  $117.5
Excess of purchase price over fair value of identifiable net
  tangible assets...........................................  $243.5

     The above represents the allocation of the purchase price over the
     estimated fair value of NEON's net tangible assets at December 31, 2000.

     The intrinsic value of the unvested options assumed is approximately $9.4
     million. This amount has been allocated to deferred stock compensation and
     will be amortized to stock compensation expense over the remaining vesting
     periods of the related unvested options. The actual amount of deferred
     compensation will be determined by the intrinsic value of unvested NEON
     options assumed as of the date the merger is consummated and may be
     materially different than the amount assumed for purposes of these pro
     forma financial statements.

 (3) To reflect the elimination of NEON's amortization and asset impairment
     charges related to historical acquisitions and purchases of technology.

 (4) No adjustment to the pro forma tax provision was necessary to estimate the
     tax provision for the combined group.

 (5) To reflect the elimination of NEON's historical stockholders' equity
     accounts.

 (6) To reflect the amortization of the goodwill and other purchased intangibles
     acquired in connection with the NEON acquisition. The goodwill and other
     purchased intangibles are being amortized over 6 years and is subject to
     change pending completion of the evaluation currently being performed by an
     independent third party. To the extent that a portion of the purchase price
     is allocated to in-process research and development, as is anticipated, a
     charge will be recognized for the period in which the acquisition occurs.
     The impact of any change could be material.

 (7) To reflect the amortization of deferred compensation related to unvested
     stock options acquired. The deferred stock compensation is being amortized
     over the unvested stock options' remaining vesting periods assumed to be
     three years.

 (8) Pro forma net income (loss) per share reflects the impact of the
     adjustments above. Pro forma basic net income (loss) per share is computed
     using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
     after the issuance of Sybase common stock to acquire the outstanding shares
     of NEON. Pro forma diluted net income (loss) per share is computed as
     described above and also gives effect to any dilutive options. Stock
     options are excluded from the calculation during loss periods as their
     effect is antidilutive.

 (9) To reflect the amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles
     acquired in the HFN acquisition.

(10) To reflect the amortization of developed technology acquired in the HFN
     acquisition.

(11)To eliminate the one time charge relating to the write off of in-process
    research and development acquired in the HFN acquisition.

(12) Pro forma reclassifications have been made to conform the NEON presentation
     to the Sybase presentation.

                                   THE OFFER

GENERAL

     We are offering to exchange 0.3878 of a share of Sybase common stock for
each outstanding share of NEON common stock validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn, subject to the terms and conditions described in this prospectus and
the related letter of transmittal.

     You will not receive any fractional shares of Sybase common stock. Instead,
you will receive cash in an amount equal to the market value of any fractional
shares you would otherwise have been entitled to receive as described below.

     The expiration date shall refer to 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on
April 11, 2001, unless we extend the period of time for which the offer is open,
in which case the term expiration date means the latest time and date on which
the offer, as so extended, expires.

     If you are the record owner of your shares and you tender your shares
directly to the Exchange Agent, you will not incur any brokerage commissions. If
you own your shares through a broker or other nominee, and your broker tenders
the shares on your behalf, your broker may charge you a fee for doing so. You
should consult your broker or nominee to determine whether any charges will
apply. We will be responsible for any transfer taxes on the exchange of NEON
common stock pursuant to the offer that are imposed on the acquiror of the NEON
stock. You will be responsible for any such transfer taxes that are imposed on
the transferor.

     We are making this offer in order to acquire at least a majority of the
total number of outstanding shares of NEON common stock on a fully diluted basis
(assuming the exercise of all currently exercisable options, rights and
convertible securities and the issuance of all NEON shares NEON is obligated to
issue thereunder). We intend, as soon as possible after completion of the offer,
to have Neel Acquisition Corp., the purchaser in the offer, merge with and into
NEON. The purpose of the merger is to acquire all NEON shares not tendered and
exchanged pursuant to the offer. In the merger, each then outstanding share of
NEON common stock, except for treasury shares of NEON and shares that we hold
for our own account, and, if applicable, NEON shares held by stockholders
exercising appraisal rights, would be converted into the same number of Sybase
shares per NEON share as is paid in the offer.

     Our obligation to exchange shares of Sybase common stock for NEON shares
pursuant to the offer is subject to several conditions referred to below under
"-- Conditions of the Offer," including the minimum tender condition, the
regulatory clearance condition and other conditions that are discussed below.

TIMING OF OUR OFFER

     Our offer is scheduled to expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on
April 11, 2001, but we are obligated, with some exceptions, to extend our offer
from time to time as necessary until all the conditions to the offer have been
satisfied or, where permissible, waived. For more information, you should read
the discussion immediately below under the caption "-- Extension, Termination
and Amendment."

EXTENSION, TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

     We expressly reserve the right (subject to the provisions of the
reorganization agreement), at any time or from time to time, to extend the
period of time during which our offer remains open, and we can do so by giving
oral or written notice of an extension to the Exchange Agent. If we decide to so
extend our offer, we will make an announcement to that effect no later than 9:00
a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the previously
scheduled expiration date. Subject to the provisions of the reorganization
agreement, we are not making any assurance that we will exercise our right to
extend our offer, although the reorganization agreement, subject to exceptions,
currently obligates us to do so until all conditions to the offer have been
satisfied or waived. During an extension, all NEON shares previously tendered
and not properly withdrawn will remain subject to the offer, subject to your
right to withdraw

your NEON shares. You should read the discussion below under the caption
"-- Withdrawal Rights" for more details.

     We reserve the right to increase the exchange ratio or to make any other
changes in the terms and conditions of the offer by giving oral or written
notice of such change to the Exchange Agent and by making a public announcement
provided that, without the prior written consent of NEON, we cannot (a) amend or
waive the minimum tender condition or (b) change the form or amount of
consideration to be paid, decrease the number of shares sought in the offer,
impose conditions to the offer in addition to those set forth in the
reorganization agreement, extend the expiration date of the offer beyond the
initial expiration date of the offer (except as provided in the reorganization
agreement) or make any other change that is adverse to the holders of the NEON
shares.

     We will follow any extension, termination, amendment or delay, as promptly
as practicable, with a public announcement. In the case of an extension, any
announcement will be issued no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date. Subject to
applicable law, including Rules 14d-4(d) and 14d-6(c) under the Exchange Act,
which require that any material change in the information published, sent or
given to stockholders in connection with the offer be promptly sent to
stockholders in a manner reasonably designed to inform stockholders of the
change, and without limiting the manner in which we may choose to make any
public announcement, we assume no obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise
communicate any public announcement other than by making a release to the Dow
Jones News Service.

     We confirm to you that if we make a material change in the terms of our
offer or the information concerning the offer, or if we waive a material
condition of the offer, we will extend the offer to the extent required under
the Exchange Act. If, prior to the expiration date, we change the percentage of
NEON shares being sought or the consideration offered to you, that change will
apply to all holders whose NEON shares are accepted for exchange pursuant to our
offer. If at the time notice of that change is first published, sent or given to
you, the offer is scheduled to expire at any time earlier than the tenth
business day from and including the date that the notice is first so published,
sent or given, we will extend the offer until the expiration of that ten
business day period. For purposes of our offer, a "business day" means any day
other than a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday and consists of the time period
from 12:01 a.m. through 12:00 midnight, New York City time.

SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD

     We may, although we do not currently intend to, elect to provide a
subsequent offering period of three to 20 business days after the acceptance of
NEON shares in the offer if the requirements under Exchange Act Rule 14d-11 have
been met. You will not have the right to withdraw any shares of NEON Common
Stock that you tender in the subsequent offering period. If we elect to provide
a subsequent offering period, we will make a public announcement to that effect
no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time on the next business day after the
previously scheduled expiration date.

EXCHANGE OF NEON SHARES; DELIVERY OF SYBASE COMMON STOCK

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of our offer including, if the
offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of the extension or
amendment, we will accept for exchange, and will exchange, NEON shares validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn promptly after the expiration date and
promptly after they are tendered during any subsequent offering period. In
addition, subject to applicable rules of the SEC, we expressly reserve the right
to delay acceptance for exchange or the exchange of NEON shares in order to
obtain any governmental regulatory approvals. In all cases, exchange of NEON
shares tendered and accepted for exchange pursuant to the offer will be made
only after timely receipt by the Exchange Agent of certificates for those NEON
shares (or a confirmation of a book-entry transfer of those NEON shares in the
Exchange Agent's account at The Depository Trust Company, which we refer to as
"DTC"), a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal or a
manually signed facsimile of that document and any other required documents.

     For purposes of the offer, we will be deemed to have accepted for exchange
NEON shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn as, if and when we
notify the Exchange Agent of our acceptance of the tenders of those NEON shares
pursuant to the offer. The Exchange Agent will deliver Sybase common stock (and
cash instead of any fractional shares of Sybase common stock) in exchange for
NEON shares pursuant to the offer as soon as practicable after receipt of our
notice. The Exchange Agent will act as agent for Sybase for the purpose of
receiving Sybase common stock and any cash to be paid instead of any fractional
shares of Sybase common stock and transmitting the stock and cash, if any, to
you. You will not receive any interest on any cash that we pay you, even if
there is a delay in making the exchange.

     If we do not accept any tendered NEON shares for exchange pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the offer for any reason, or if certificates are
submitted for more NEON shares than are tendered, we will return certificates
for the unexchanged NEON shares to the tendering stockholder or, in the case of
NEON shares tendered by book-entry transfer of unexchanged NEON shares into the
Exchange Agent's account at DTC pursuant to the procedures set forth below under
the discussion entitled "-- Procedure for Tendering," those NEON shares will be
credited to an account maintained within DTC, as soon as practicable following
expiration or termination of the offer.

CASH INSTEAD OF FRACTIONAL SHARES OF SYBASE COMMON STOCK

     We will not issue certificates representing fractional shares of our common
stock pursuant to the offer. Instead, each tendering stockholder who would
otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of our common stock will receive
cash in an amount equal to that fraction multiplied by the closing price of
Sybase common stock, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market, on the first
date on which we accept shares for exchange in the offer.

WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS

     Your tender of NEON shares pursuant to the offer is irrevocable, except
that, other than during a subsequent offering period, NEON shares tendered
pursuant to the offer may be withdrawn at any time prior to the expiration date,
and, unless we previously accepted them for exchange pursuant to the offer, may
also be withdrawn at any time after May 13, 2001. If we elect to provide a
subsequent offering period under Exchange Act Rule 14d-11, you will not have the
right to withdraw NEON shares that you tender in the subsequent offering period.

     For your withdrawal to be effective, the Exchange Agent must receive from
you a written, telex or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal at one of
its addresses set forth on the back cover of this prospectus, and your notice
must include your name, address, social security number, the certificate
number(s) and the number of NEON shares to be withdrawn as well as the name of
the registered holder, if it is different from that of the person who tendered
those NEON shares.

     A financial institution must guarantee all signatures on the notice of
withdrawal unless those NEON shares have been tendered for the account of any
eligible institution. Most banks, savings and loan associations and brokerage
houses are able to provide these signature guarantees for you. The financial
institution must be a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion
Program, an "eligible institution." If NEON shares have been tendered pursuant
to the procedures for book-entry tender discussed under the caption below
entitled "-- Procedure for Tendering," any notice of withdrawal must specify the
name and number of the account at DTC to be credited with the withdrawn NEON
shares and must otherwise comply with DTC's procedures. If certificates have
been delivered or otherwise identified to the Exchange Agent, the name of the
registered holder and the serial numbers of the particular certificates
evidencing the NEON shares withdrawn must also be furnished to the Exchange
Agent, as stated above, prior to the physical release of the certificates. We
will decide all questions as to the form and validity (including time of
receipt) of any notice of withdrawal, in our sole discretion, and our decision
shall be final and binding.

     Neither we, the Exchange Agent, the Information Agent nor any other person
will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or irregularities in
any notice of withdrawal or will incur any liability for failure to give any
notification. Any NEON shares properly withdrawn will be deemed not to have been
validly tendered for purposes of our offer. However, you may retender withdrawn
NEON shares by following one of the procedures discussed under the captions
entitled "-- Procedure for Tendering" or "--Guaranteed Delivery" at any time
prior to the expiration date.

PROCEDURE FOR TENDERING

     For you to validly tender NEON shares pursuant to the offer, (a) the
enclosed letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed (or
manually executed facsimile of that document), along with any required signature
guarantees, or an agent's message in connection with a book-entry transfer, and
any other required documents, must be transmitted to and received by the
Exchange Agent at the address set forth on the back cover of this prospectus,
and certificates for tendered NEON shares must be received by the Exchange Agent
at that address or those NEON shares must be tendered pursuant to the procedures
for book-entry tender set forth below (and a confirmation of receipt of the
tender received, which confirmation we refer to below as a "book-entry
confirmation"), in each case before the expiration date, or (b) you must comply
with the guaranteed delivery procedures set forth below.

     The term "agent's message" means a message, transmitted by DTC to, and
received by, the Exchange Agent and forming a part of a book-entry confirmation,
which states that DTC has received an express acknowledgment from the
participant in DTC tendering the NEON shares which are the subject of the
book-entry confirmation, that the participant has received and agrees to be
bound by the terms of the letter of transmittal and that we may enforce that
agreement against the participant.

     The Exchange Agent will establish accounts with respect to the NEON shares
at DTC for purposes of the offer within two business days after the date of this
prospectus, and any financial institution that is a participant in DTC may make
book-entry delivery of the NEON shares by causing DTC to transfer tendered NEON
shares into the Exchange Agent's account in accordance with DTC's procedure for
the transfer. However, although delivery of NEON shares may be effected through
book-entry at DTC, the letter of transmittal (or a manually signed facsimile
thereof), with any required signature guarantees, or an agent's message in
connection with a book-entry transfer, and any other required documents, must,
in any case, be transmitted to and received by the Exchange Agent at the address
set forth on the back cover of this prospectus prior to the expiration date, or
the guaranteed delivery procedures described below must be followed.

     Signatures on all letters of transmittal must be guaranteed by an eligible
institution, except in cases in which NEON shares are tendered either by a
registered holder of NEON shares who has not completed the box entitled "Special
Issuance Instructions" on the letter of transmittal or for the account of an
eligible institution.

     If the certificates for NEON shares are registered in the name of a person
other than the person who signs the letter of transmittal, or if certificates
for unexchanged NEON shares are to be issued to a person other than the
registered holder(s), the certificates must be endorsed or accompanied by
appropriate stock powers, in either case signed exactly as the name or names of
the registered owner or owners appear on the certificates, with the signature(s)
on the certificates or stock powers guaranteed in the manner we have described
above.

     THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF NEON SHARE CERTIFICATES AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED
DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH DTC, IS AT YOUR OPTION AND RISK, AND THE
DELIVERY WILL BE DEEMED MADE ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE EXCHANGE AGENT.
IF DELIVERY IS BY MAIL, WE RECOMMEND REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT
REQUESTED, PROPERLY INSURED. IN ALL CASES, YOU SHOULD ALLOW SUFFICIENT TIME TO
ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY.

GUARANTEED DELIVERY

     If you wish to tender NEON shares pursuant to our offer and your
certificates are not immediately available or you cannot deliver the
certificates and all other required documents to the Exchange Agent prior to the
expiration date or cannot complete the procedure for book-entry transfer on a
timely basis, your NEON shares may nevertheless be tendered, so long as all of
the following conditions are satisfied:

     - You make your tender by or through an eligible institution;

     - The enclosed notice of guaranteed delivery, properly completed and duly
       executed, substantially in the form enclosed with this prospectus, is
       received by the Exchange Agent as provided below on or prior to the
       expiration date; and

     - The certificates for all tendered NEON shares (or a confirmation of a
       book-entry transfer of tendered securities into the Exchange Agent's
       account at DTC as described above), in proper form for transfer, together
       with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal (or a
       manually signed facsimile thereof), with any required signature
       guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an agent's message)
       and all other documents required by the letter of transmittal are
       received by the Exchange Agent within three Nasdaq trading days after the
       date of execution of the notice of guaranteed delivery.

     You may deliver the notice of guaranteed delivery by hand or transmit it by
facsimile transmission or mail to the Exchange Agent and you must include a
signature guarantee by an eligible institution in the form set forth in that
notice.

     In all cases, we will exchange NEON shares tendered and accepted for
exchange pursuant to our offer only after timely receipt by the Exchange Agent
of certificates for NEON shares (or timely confirmation of a book-entry transfer
of tendered securities into the Exchange Agent's account at DTC as described
above), properly completed and duly executed letter(s) of transmittal (or a
manually signed facsimile(s) thereof), or an agent's message in connection with
a book-entry transfer, and any other required documents.

     By executing a letter of transmittal as set forth above, you irrevocably
appoint our designees as your attorneys-in-fact and proxies, each with full
power of substitution, to the full extent of your rights with respect to your
NEON shares tendered and accepted for exchange by us and with respect to any and
all other NEON shares and other securities (other than the shares of Sybase
common stock) issued or issuable in respect of the NEON shares on or after April
11, 2001. That appointment is effective if and when, and only to the extent
that, we accept the shares of NEON common stock for exchange pursuant to the
offer. All of these proxies shall be considered coupled with an interest in the
tendered NEON shares and therefore shall not be revocable. Upon the
effectiveness of the appointment, all prior proxies that you have given will be
revoked, and you may not give any subsequent proxies (and, if given, they will
not be deemed effective). Our designees will, with respect to the NEON shares
for which the appointment is effective, be empowered, among other things, to
exercise all of your voting and other rights as they, in their sole discretion,
deem proper at any annual, special or adjourned meeting of NEON's stockholders
or otherwise. We reserve the right to require that, in order for NEON shares to
be deemed validly tendered, immediately upon our exchange of those NEON shares,
we must be able to exercise full voting rights with respect to the tendered NEON
shares.

     We will determine questions as to the validity, form, eligibility
(including time of receipt) and acceptance for exchange of any tender of NEON
shares, in our sole discretion, and our determination shall be final and
binding. We reserve the absolute right to reject any and all tenders of NEON
shares that we determine are not in proper form or the acceptance of or exchange
for which may, in the opinion of our counsel, be unlawful. We also reserve the
absolute right to waive any defect or irregularity in the tender of any NEON
shares. No tender of those NEON shares will be deemed to have been validly made
until all defects and irregularities in tenders of those NEON shares have been
cured or waived. Neither we, the Exchange Agent, the Information Agent nor any
other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or
irregularities in the tender of any NEON shares or will incur any liability for
failure to give

notification. Our interpretation of the terms and conditions of our offer
(including the letter of transmittal and instructions thereto) will be final and
binding.

     The tender of NEON shares pursuant to any of the procedures described above
will constitute a binding agreement between us and you upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the offer.

BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER

     In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Corporate Development Group at Sybase,
under the direction of Marty Beard, Sybase's Vice President, Corporate
Development, researched companies offering enterprise application integration
products and identified NEON as a potential candidate for a strategic
relationship.

     In December 2000, NEON engaged Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation
("CSFB") to provide financial advisory services in connection with a possible
business combination involving NEON. In December 2000 and January 2001, CSFB and
officers of NEON contacted approximately seven parties to determine their
interest in engaging in a business combination with NEON.

     On December 27, 2000, Mr. Beard placed a telephone call to George F. (Rick)
Adam, Jr., NEON's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, inviting Mr. Adam to
participate in an initial discussion regarding a possible strategic
relationship.

     On January 1, 2001, Mr. Beard and Mr. Adam had an initial discussion by
telephone. During that conversation, Mr. Beard introduced the possibility of a
business combination transaction, and Mr. Adam expressed an interest in
exploring such a transaction.

     On January 3, 2001, Mr. Adam met, at Sybase's offices in Emeryville,
California, with Mr. Beard, John S. Chen, Sybase's President and Chief Executive
Officer, Raj Nathan, Sybase's General Manager, Internet Applications Division,
and Billy Ho, Sybase's Vice President of Research and Development to discuss a
possible business combination. At the meeting, Mr. Adam and Mr. Chen presented
each other with strategic overviews of their respective companies and confirmed
their mutual interest in pursuing further discussions regarding a possible
business combination.

     On January 12, 2001, Mr. Chen conveyed to Mr. Adam Sybase's proposed terms
for a possible business combination involving Sybase and NEON.

     On January 15, 2001, NEON's board of directors authorized NEON to continue
discussions with Sybase regarding a possible business combination.

     On January 16, 2001, at the direction of Mr. Adam, CSFB contacted Mr. Chen
to express NEON's desire to continue discussions regarding a potential business
combination. At this time, Mr. Chen expressed Sybase's desire to continue
discussions as well.

     On January 17, 2001 NEON and Sybase entered into a mutual nondisclosure
agreement pursuant to which they agreed to exchange confidential information
regarding their respective businesses.

     On January 19, 2001, Mr. Adam, Dr. Patrick Fortune, NEON's President and
Chief Operating Officer, Stephen Webb, NEON's Chief Financial Officer, and Peter
Hoversten, NEON's Chief Technology Officer, met with Pieter Van der Vorst,
Sybase's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Beard and Mark Wilson, Sybase's Senior
Director, Corporate Development, in San Francisco, California to review
strategic, financial, product and operational information about NEON, and to
continue discussions regarding the merits of a business combination. That night,
Mr. Adam and Mr. Chen continued discussions of a possible business combination.

     On January 22, 2001, Merrill Lynch & Co. ("Merrill Lynch") was engaged to
act as Sybase's financial advisor in connection with a possible transaction with
NEON.

     On January 24, 2001, Merrill Lynch began its due diligence review of NEON,
which continued through the signing of the reorganization agreement.
Representatives of Merrill Lynch met with

representatives of NEON management at NEON's offices in Englewood, Colorado to
review background historical information on NEON's strategy, products and
financial and operational performance.

     On January 26, 2001, Sybase transmitted a proposed term sheet and certain
ancillary documents to NEON.

     On January 27, 2001, Mr. Adam notified Mr. Beard that NEON was interested
in continuing discussions with Sybase regarding a possible business combination.

     On January 30 and 31, 2001, several discussions took place among
representatives of Sybase, Merrill Lynch, CSFB and NEON with respect to the
proposed financial terms of the business combination transaction.

     On February 1, 2001, NEON retained Cooley Godward LLP to act as its outside
legal counsel in connection with the possible business combination transaction.
Later that evening, management of the two companies agreed to continue
discussions regarding a business combination transaction and directed their
outside legal counsel to commence negotiation of a definitive reorganization
agreement.

     On February 5, 2001, representatives from Sybase, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &
Rosati, Professional Corporation, outside legal counsel to Sybase, and Ernst &
Young LLP, independent accountants to Sybase, began their due diligence review
of NEON which continued through the signing of the reorganization agreement.

     Between February 5 and February 7, 2001, Mr. Adam, Dr. Fortune, Mr. Webb,
Mr. Hoversten, Fred Horn, NEON's Executive Vice President of Operations, Leonard
Goldstein, NEON's Senior Vice President, Senior Counsel and Secretary, Leslie
Lundberg, NEON's Vice President of Human Resources, Brian Duff, NEON's
Controller, and other members of NEON management met with Mr. Van der Vorst, Mr.
Beard, Mr. Nathan, Dan Carl, Sybase's General Counsel, Pamela George, Sybase's
Vice President of Marketing, Nita White-Ivy, Sybase's Vice President of Human
Resources, and other members of Sybase management, at the offices of Cooley
Godward in San Francisco, California. During these meetings, the parties
discussed the business, financial condition and organization of the two
companies. Simultaneously, Scott Powell, NEON's Group President of Engineering,
and Mr. Ho met in Denver, Colorado, to discuss both companies' product
architecture and specifications.

     On February 6, 2001, the NEON board of directors held a special telephonic
meeting to discuss the potential business combination. Members of NEON's
management and representatives of CSFB explained the background and status of
the negotiations. At this meeting, representatives of Cooley Godward reviewed
the responsibilities of the board of directors in considering the proposed
business combination transaction. The NEON board of directors discussed the
strategic rationale for a proposed business combination and authorized
management to continue negotiations with Sybase. Later that evening, Wilson
Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati delivered drafts of the reorganization agreement and
related agreements to Cooley Godward.

     From February 9, 2001 through February 20, 2001, negotiations on the terms
of the reorganization agreement and related agreements continued among Sybase,
NEON and their respective legal counsel and financial advisors. These
negotiations covered all aspects of the transaction, including, among other
things, the representations and warranties made by the parties, the restrictions
on the conduct of their businesses, the conditions to completion of the offer
and the merger, the provisions regarding termination, the details of the "no
shop" clause, the amount, triggers and payment of the termination fee and the
consequences of termination, and the delivery and terms of the stockholder
agreements. During this period, executive officers of NEON who were asked to
enter into employment and non-competition agreements and agreements amending
certain change of control severance agreements negotiated the terms of these
agreements with Sybase.

     On February 14, 2001, the NEON board of directors held a special telephonic
meeting during which the NEON board of directors discussed the proposed business
combination with Sybase. Mr. Adam reviewed the background of NEON's discussions
with Sybase as well as the current status of negotiations

and reviewed the terms of the proposed business combination transaction.
Representatives of CSFB reviewed the financial terms of the transaction as
proposed at that time. In addition, representatives of Cooley Godward outlined
the board's fiduciary duties and other applicable legal principles in the
context of business combination transactions and reviewed the reorganization
agreement and stockholder agreements and related matters. The NEON board of
directors discussed the strategic, business and financial merits and the timing
of a possible transaction with Sybase and the terms of Sybase's proposal, and
directed management to continue negotiations with Sybase.

     From February 12, 2001 to February 14, 2001, Mr. Chen, Mr. Van der Vorst,
Mr. Beard and representatives of Merrill Lynch had several conversations with
the individual members of the Sybase board of directors regarding the proposed
business combination with NEON, including the strategic rationale for the
transaction and the proposed financial and other transaction terms.

     On February 15, 2001, the Sybase board of directors met and reviewed the
proposed transaction terms and the results of Sybase's due diligence
investigation. Representatives of Merrill Lynch and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &
Rosati also participated. The Sybase board of directors received a presentation
from its financial advisor, Merrill Lynch, concerning the transaction.
Representatives of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati reviewed the proposed
principal terms of the reorganization agreement and outlined the legal
principles applicable to the Sybase board of directors' consideration and
approval of the proposed transaction. The Sybase board of directors, by
unanimous vote of the directors present and voting at the meeting, authorized
Sybase to enter into a reorganization agreement with NEON in substantially the
form proposed at the meeting consistent with the Sybase board of directors'
guidance on certain open issues, including the completion of the audit of NEON's
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2000.

     On February 19, 2001, a representative of Merrill Lynch telephoned a
representative of CSFB to discuss open issues in the negotiations, including
valuation and the potential exchange ratio. In addition, on February 19, 2001,
Mr. Chen telephoned Mr. Adam to discuss open issues in the negotiations,
including valuation and the potential exchange ratio.

     On February 19, 2001, the NEON board of directors held a special telephonic
meeting to review the status of negotiations and discussions with Sybase since
the board's February 14, 2001 meeting and reviewed revised drafts of the
reorganization agreement and related agreements. Representatives of CSFB and
Cooley Godward also participated. Representatives of Cooley Godward reviewed
with the NEON board of directors the main legal principles applicable to the
proposed business combination transaction (including the board's fiduciary
duties and authority in considering the transaction). Representatives of Cooley
Godward also reviewed in detail the principal terms of the proposed
reorganization agreement and related agreements and summarized the remaining
open issues and responded to questions by the NEON board of directors. The NEON
board of directors reviewed and discussed the principal terms of the proposed
transaction, including the exchange ratio, closing conditions, termination
rights, the termination fee, the stockholder agreements and NEON's ability to
consider alternative proposals. Also at this meeting, CSFB reviewed with NEON's
board of directors the financial terms of the transaction proposed at that time
and indicated that, subject to agreement on the final exchange ratio consistent
with the financial terms as proposed at that time, it was prepared to render an
opinion to the NEON board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and
subject to various considerations, the exchange ratio in the transaction was
fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of NEON common stock. After
further deliberation, the NEON board of directors, by the unanimous vote of all
directors present and voting at the meeting:

     - determined that the reorganization agreement and the transactions
       contemplated thereby, including the offer and the merger, are consistent
       with and in furtherance of the long-term business strategy of NEON and
       are advisable and are fair to and in the best interest of NEON and its
       stockholders,

     - approved and adopted the reorganization agreement and the transactions
       contemplated thereby, including the offer and the merger and the
       stockholder agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby,
       together with such changes as were discussed at the meeting,

     - resolved to recommend acceptance of the offer and approval and adoption
       of the reorganization agreement by NEON's stockholders, and

     - authorized Mr. Adam to execute, on behalf of NEON, the reorganization
       agreement and such other documents that certain of NEON's officers find
       necessary or advisable in their sole discretion, together with any
       changes, deletions, additions and alterations that such officers approve
       consistent with the resolutions of the NEON board of directors.

     After the close of trading on the Nasdaq National Market on February 20,
2001, Sybase and NEON agreed on the final exchange ratio of 0.3878 and entered
into the reorganization agreement. Following agreement on the final exchange
ratio, CSFB rendered to the NEON board of directors its written opinion that, as
of February 20, 2001, and based upon and subject to various considerations set
forth in its opinion, the exchange ratio in the transaction was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of NEON common stock, other than Sybase
and its affiliates. CSFB was not aware of any ownership of shares of NEON common
stock by Sybase or its affiliates. A copy of CSFB's opinion is included in
NEON's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which is being
mailed to NEON stockholders together with this prospectus. Stockholders should
read CSFB's opinion carefully in its entirety.

     Also on February 20, 2001, the directors and certain officers and
stockholders of NEON entered into stockholder agreements with Sybase, pursuant
to which they agreed to tender their NEON shares in the offer and vote their
NEON shares in favor of the approval and adoption of the reorganization
agreement. In addition, the directors and certain officers and stockholders of
NEON entered into affiliate agreements with Sybase, acknowledging the
restrictions imposed by the federal securities laws, in some instances, on their
ability to sell Sybase shares following the completion of the offer or the
merger, as applicable. In addition, certain officers of NEON also signed
amendments to the change of control severance agreements to which such officers
are party to, among other things, waive certain severance and other rights that
may be triggered as a direct or indirect result of the transactions contemplated
by the reorganization agreement. Messrs. Adam, Fortune, Horn and Hoversten each
entered into employment and non-competition agreements with Sybase, effective
upon consummation of the merger, under which they agreed not to engage in
certain activities or make certain investments, and not to solicit Sybase
employees, during the period of their employment by the surviving corporation
and for eighteen months following their termination of employment with the
surviving corporation. See the section entitled "Interests of NEON Officers and
Directors in the Transaction" beginning on page 53 of this prospectus,
specifically "-- Certain Executive Agreements" beginning on page 54 of this
prospectus, for a further description of some of these agreements.

     After the parties signed the reorganization agreement, Sybase issued a
press release announcing the transaction.

     On March 15, 2001 Neel Acquisition Corp. commenced the offer.

REASONS FOR THE OFFER AND MERGER

Improve our e-Business/Enterprise Application Integration Products

     - We believe the combination of Sybase and NEON furthers our strategy of
       improving and expanding our product offerings in the
       e-business/enterprise application integration marketplace. This
       marketplace is demanding the integration of new e-business applications
       with existing and older legacy applications on the web to facilitate
       seamless e-business. Enterprise application integration is one of the
       fastest growing areas of the information technology industry and Sybase's
       acquisition of NEON would provides us with processes, integration
       technology, portal servers and other elements critical for our growth in
       this area.

Strengthen our Market Position

     - We believe the combination of Sybase and NEON will strengthen our
       position in the emerging e-business marketplace. Acquisition of NEON's
       technology would broaden Sybase's e-business platform, enabling it to
       respond to customer demand by providing products complimentary to
       Sybase's application server, replication server and messaging middleware.
       We believe an enhanced e-business platform would meet the needs of
       customers interested in maximizing and integrating all business
       interactions, from the consumer to suppliers and the back-office.

     - We believe the combination of Sybase and NEON will enable us to
       strengthen our market presence by broadening the total number of products
       available to customers and allowing customers to develop e-business
       solutions faster.

     - NEON's strength in the manufacturing, distribution, retail and utilities
       vertical markets should provide an opportunity for us to expand our
       presence into those vertical markets.

Increase Our Selling Opportunities

     - We believe enterprises will increasingly demand e-business implementation
       and integration services from one vendor. The combined products of Sybase
       and NEON will allow us to meet this demand and offer our customers
       additional products and capabilities, as well as reach new customers who
       are seeking a broad e-business/enterprise application integration
       solution.

     - NEON has over 3,000 worldwide customers, mostly in the Fortune Global
       2000, which we believe will provide opportunities for cross-selling of
       other Sybase products.

Improve Organizational Capabilities

     - NEON had approximately 1,000 employees as of February 23, 2001. Many of
       these employees, including 260 engineers, 280 consultants, and 85 sales
       representatives, we believe will strengthen Sybase's development,
       professional services and sales capabilities.

     - We believe that the combined company's capabilities will allow us to
       deliver new e-business solutions to the market faster, in months instead
       of years.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE NEON BOARD; FACTORS CONSIDERED

     In approving the offer, the merger, the reorganization agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the reorganization agreement and recommending that
all holders of NEON shares accept the offer and tender their NEON shares
pursuant to the offer, the NEON board of directors considered a number of
factors, including:

     - the complementary strategies and direction of NEON, a leading supplier of
       e-business integration software and services, and Sybase, a leading
       global provider of software solutions that help businesses manage and
       deliver information across distributed mixed computing environments,
       including the Internet;

     - the combination of Sybase's e-business platform products and NEON's suite
       of e-business integration products, creating a complete e-business
       infrastructure solution for companies building on-line businesses;

     - the opportunity for NEON to access Sybase's installed base of 40,000
       customers for cross-selling opportunities, and to leverage Sybase's
       distribution channels to drive sales of NEON's e-business integration
       products;

     - Sybase offers a more significant international presence for the
       distribution of NEON products;

     - the exchange ratio for the offer and the merger representing a premium of
       65.2% over the closing price of the NEON common stock on the Nasdaq
       National Market on February 16, 2001, the last

       trading day prior to the NEON board's approval of the reorganization
       agreement, as well as 80.2% and 82.5% premiums over the average of the
       closing prices for the ten and 30 trading days, respectively, ending on
       February 16, 2001;

     - the presentations of CSFB regarding the financial terms of the proposed
       transaction and the opinion of CSFB that, as of February 20, 2001 and
       based upon and subject to the various considerations set forth in the
       CSFB opinion, the exchange ratio in the transaction was fair, from a
       financial point of view, to the holders of NEON common stock, other than
       Sybase and its affiliates. A copy of the opinion is included in NEON's
       Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which is being
       mailed to NEON stockholders together with this prospectus. NEON
       stockholders should read the opinion carefully in its entirety;

     - the financial and other terms of the offer, the merger and the
       reorganization agreement, including the benefits of the transaction being
       structured as a first-step exchange offer and second-step merger, which
       may provide NEON's stockholders with an opportunity to receive shares of
       Sybase common stock on an accelerated basis;

     - the opportunity for the holders of the NEON shares to participate in a
       significantly larger and more diversified company and, as stockholders of
       the combined company, to have greater liquidity in their shares and to
       benefit from any future growth of the combined company;

     - the strengths and weaknesses of Sybase's and NEON's businesses and the
       key attributes and opportunities of the combined company in terms of,
       among other things, products, sales, customers, management, and financial
       and competitive position;

     - the nature of the e-business software industry and the belief of NEON's
       board of directors that greater size and resources are increasingly
       required for companies to successfully compete in this industry;

     - the increasing competition that NEON faces from both existing and
       potential competitors, many of which have greater assets and resources
       than NEON, which has occurred as a result of, among other reasons, the
       consolidation taking place in the software industry in general;

     - historical information concerning Sybase's and NEON's respective
       businesses, financial performance and condition, operations, technology,
       management and competitive position, including public reports concerning
       results of operations filed with the SEC;

     - the consideration to be received by NEON stockholders in the offer and
       the merger and an analysis of the market value of the Sybase common stock
       to be issued in exchange for the NEON common stock in light of comparable
       transactions;

     - current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
       volatility and trading information with respect to Sybase common stock
       and the NEON common stock;

     - the belief that the terms of the reorganization agreement, including the
       parties' representations, warranties and covenants, and the conditions to
       the parties' respective obligations, are reasonable;

     - the impact of the offer and the merger on NEON's customers and employees;
       and

     - reports from management, legal advisors and financial advisors as to the
       results of their due diligence investigation of Sybase.

     NEON's board of directors also considered the terms of the reorganization
agreement regarding NEON's rights to consider and negotiate other acquisition
proposals, as well as the possible effects of the provisions regarding
termination fees. In addition, NEON's board of directors noted that the offer
and merger are expected to be a tax-free transaction. NEON's board of directors
also considered various alternatives to the offer and the merger, including
remaining as an independent company. NEON's board of directors believed that
these factors, including the NEON board's review of the terms of the
reorganization agreement, supported the board's recommendation of the offer and
the merger when viewed

together with the risks and potential benefits of the offer and the merger.
NEON's board of directors also identified and considered a variety of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the offer and the
merger, including, but not limited to:

     - the risk that the potential benefits sought in the offer and the merger
       might not be fully realized;

     - certain risks applicable to Sybase's business (see the section of this
       prospectus under the heading "Risk Factors -- Risks Related to Our
       Business" on page 12);

     - the possibility that the offer and the merger might not be completed and
       the effect of public announcement of the offer and the merger on NEON's
       sales and operating results, and its ability to attract and retain key
       technical, marketing and management personnel;

     - the risk that the terms of the transaction could be dilutive to Sybase's
       earnings and that such potential dilution could negatively impact the
       trading price of Sybase common stock.

     - the substantial charges to be incurred in connection with the offer and
       the merger, including costs of integrating the businesses and transaction
       expenses arising from the offer and the merger;

     - the risk that despite the efforts of the combined company, key technical,
       marketing and management personnel might not remain employed by the
       combined company; and

     - the difficulty of managing separate operations at different geographic
       locations.

     NEON's board of directors believed that these risks were outweighed by the
potential benefits of the offer and the merger.

     The NEON board of directors did not assign relative weights to the
foregoing factors or determine that any factor was of particular importance.
Rather, the NEON board of directors viewed its position and recommendations as
being based on the totality of the information presented to and considered by
the NEON board of directors. In addition, individual members of the NEON board
of directors may have given different weights to different factors.

     The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the
NEON board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to
include the material factors considered by the NEON board of directors. In view
of the wide variety of factors, both positive and negative, considered by the
NEON board of directors, the NEON board of directors did not find it practical
to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific
factors considered.

OPINION OF NEON FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     On February 20, 2001, CSFB delivered its opinion to NEON's board of
directors that, as of that date, based upon and subject to the various
considerations set forth in the CSFB opinion, the exchange ratio in the
transaction was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of NEON common
stock, other than Sybase and its affiliates. CSFB was not aware of any ownership
of shares of NEON common stock by Sybase or its affiliates.

     WE INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE THE FULL TEXT OF THE CSFB OPINION DATED
FEBRUARY 20, 2001. THE FULL TEXT OF THE WRITTEN OPINION OF CSFB, WHICH SETS
FORTH THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS ON THE REVIEW
UNDERTAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE OPINION IS ATTACHED AS SCHEDULE II TO NEON'S
SOLICITATION/RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT ON SCHEDULE 14D-9, WHICH IS BEING MAILED
TO NEON STOCKHOLDERS TOGETHER WITH THIS PROSPECTUS. WE URGE NEON STOCKHOLDERS TO
READ THE OPINION IN ITS ENTIRETY AND THE DISCUSSION IN NEON'S
SOLICITATION/RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT REGARDING THE OPINION.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following discussion summarizes the material United States federal
income tax consequences of the offer and the merger to holders of NEON shares
who exchange their NEON shares for Sybase shares in the offer and/or the merger.
This discussion and the tax opinions described below are based on the

Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the "Code"),
applicable Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations and court
decisions in effect as of the date of this prospectus, all of which may change,
possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could alter the tax
consequences described in this summary and the tax opinions.

     This discussion of material federal income tax consequences of the offer
and the merger is intended to provide only a general summary, and is not a
complete analysis or description of all potential federal income tax
consequences of the offer and/or the merger. It does not address all aspects of
federal income taxation that may be important to a holder of NEON shares in
light of that holder's particular circumstances or to a holder subject to
special rules, such as:

     - a foreign entity or an individual stockholder who is not a citizen or
       resident of the United States;

     - a financial institution or insurance company;

     - a tax-exempt organization;

     - a dealer or broker in securities;

     - a stockholder who is subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of
       the Code;

     - a stockholder whose shares are qualified small business stock for
       purposes of Section 1202 of the Code;

     - a stockholder who holds NEON shares as part of a hedge, appreciated
       financial position, straddle, constructive sale or conversion
       transaction;

     - a stockholder who acquired NEON shares pursuant to the exercise of
       incentive stock options or who holds NEON shares that are subject to a
       substantial risk of forfeiture; or

     - a stockholder who does not hold NEON shares as capital assets.

     In addition, this discussion does not address any state, local or foreign
income tax or non-income tax consequences of the offer and/or the merger or of
any transactions other than the offer and the merger. We urge holders of NEON
shares to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular federal
income tax or other tax consequences to them of participation in the offer
and/or the merger.

     Although there is limited authority, the offer and the merger will be
treated for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code if, among other things, all of the following
factual assumptions (which we refer to as the supporting conditions) are met:

     - the offer and the merger are completed under the current terms of the
       reorganization agreement;

     - the minimum tender condition for the offer is satisfied; and

     - the merger is completed promptly after the offer.

     The consummation of the offer is conditioned upon the receipt by Sybase and
NEON of tax opinions to the foregoing effect from Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &
Rosati, Professional Corporation and Cooley Godward LLP, respectively. These
opinions will rely upon, and the consequences summarized below under "-- Federal
Income Tax Consequences If the Offer and Merger Qualify As a Reorganization" are
based upon, representations and covenants made by Sybase and NEON, and those
contained in certificates of officers of Sybase and NEON to be delivered to tax
counsel prior to the consummation of the offer, and upon certain assumptions,
including the absence of changes in facts or in law between the date of the
consummation of the offer and the effective time of the merger. If any of those
representations, covenants or assumptions is inaccurate, the tax consequences of
the offer and the merger could differ materially from those summarized below
under "-- Federal Income Tax Consequences If the Offer and Merger Qualify As a
Reorganization." In addition, the ability to satisfy the supporting conditions,
and therefore the federal income tax consequences of the offer and the merger,
depend in part on facts that will not be available before the completion of the
merger. There can be no assurance that the merger will be completed, or that the
supporting conditions will be satisfied. If the supporting conditions are not
satisfied, the opinions of

Cooley Godward and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati described above may not be
relied upon. Furthermore, Cooley Godward's and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &
Rosati's opinions will neither bind the IRS nor preclude the IRS or the courts
from adopting a contrary position. NEON stockholders should be aware that
neither the IRS nor any court has ruled on the tax treatment of a combination of
transactions identical to the offer and the merger and no ruling has been or
will be requested from the IRS in connection with the offer and the merger.
Accordingly, it is possible that the offer and/or the merger may not qualify as
a reorganization, and the tax consequences of the offer and the merger could
differ materially from those summarized below under "-- Federal Income Tax
Consequences If the Offer and Merger Qualify As a Reorganization." See
"-- Federal Income Tax Consequences If the Offer and Merger Do Not Qualify As a
Reorganization."

     Federal Income Tax Consequences If the Offer and Merger Qualify As a
Reorganization. Assuming that the offer and the merger qualify as a tax-free
reorganization, for federal income tax purposes:

     - A holder of NEON shares will not recognize any gain or loss on its
       exchange in the offer or the merger of its NEON shares for Sybase shares.

     - If a holder of NEON shares receives cash instead of a fraction of a
       Sybase share, the holder will be required to recognize capital gain or
       loss, measured by the difference between the amount of cash received
       instead of that fraction of a share and the portion of the tax basis of
       that holder's NEON shares allocable to that fraction of a share. This
       gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder has
       held the NEON shares exchanged for that fraction of a Sybase share for
       more than one year at the time such NEON shares are accepted in the offer
       or at the effective time of the merger, as the case may be. The
       deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations for both
       individuals and corporations.

     - A holder of NEON shares will have a tax basis in the Sybase shares
       received in the offer or the merger equal to (1) the tax basis in the
       NEON shares surrendered by that holder in the offer or merger, reduced by
       (2) any tax basis in such NEON shares that is allocable to a fraction of
       a Sybase share for which cash is received.

     - The holding period for Sybase shares received in exchange for NEON shares
       in the offer or the merger will include the holding period for NEON
       shares surrendered in the offer or the merger.

     - Under specified circumstances, holders of NEON shares may be entitled to
       appraisal rights in connection with the merger. See "-- Purpose of the
       Offer; The Merger; Appraisal Rights" below. If appraisal rights are
       available and a holder of NEON shares receives cash pursuant to the
       exercise of appraisal rights, such holder will recognize gain or loss,
       measured by the difference between the amount realized and such holder's
       tax basis in such NEON shares. Holders of NEON shares who exercise
       appraisal rights are urged to consult their own tax advisors.

     - NEON will not recognize gain or loss as a result of the offer and the
       merger.

     Federal Income Tax Consequences If the Offer and Merger Do Not Qualify as a
Reorganization. The tax consequences described above are based on factual
assumptions, representations and covenants, including the satisfaction of the
supporting conditions. If any of those factual assumptions, representations or
covenants are not satisfied or observed, or in the event of a contrary ruling by
the IRS or a court, the federal income tax consequences of the offer and the
merger to holders of NEON shares could differ materially from those summarized
above under "-- Federal Income Tax Consequences If the Offer and Merger Qualify
As a Reorganization." In that event, exchanges by NEON stockholders pursuant to
the offer and/or the merger could be taxable transactions for federal income tax
purposes depending on the particular facts surrounding the offer and/or the
merger, some of which may not be known before the completion of the merger or
later points in time.

     If the offer and/or the merger is taxable, each NEON stockholder
participating in the offer and/or the merger, as applicable, will recognize
capital gain or loss, measured by the difference between the fair market value
of the Sybase shares (together with any cash instead of a fraction of a Sybase
common

share) received by such stockholder and such stockholder's tax basis in the NEON
shares surrendered. This gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if
such stockholder had held such NEON shares for more than one year at the time
such NEON shares are accepted in the offer or at the effective time of the
merger, as applicable.

     Federal Income Tax Consequences If the Merger Is Not Consummated. In
addition to the limitations, assumptions and qualifications described above, no
opinion has been given concerning any tax consequences of the offer if the
merger is not consummated, or if the merger is not consummated promptly after
the offer. Except as described under this heading, if the merger is not
consummated, exchanges pursuant to the offer generally will be taxable
transactions for federal income tax purposes with the consequences described
above under "-- Federal Income Tax Consequences If the Offer and Merger Do Not
Qualify As a Reorganization."

     Even if the merger is not consummated, the offer will still be treated for
federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code so long as the following factual assumptions are met:

     - in general, Neel Acquisition Corp. must acquire at least 80% of the NEON
       shares in the offer;

     - any acquisition of additional NEON shares from other stockholders that
       Sybase or Neel Acquisition Corp. may decide to effect must not be for
       consideration other than Sybase voting stock; and

     - the representations and covenants made by Sybase and NEON to Cooley
       Godward and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati must remain effective.

     Whether these factual assumptions will be satisfied will not be known at
the time of the offer and there can be no assurances that such factual
assumptions will be satisfied.

     We urge each holder of NEON shares to consult his or her own tax advisor to
determine the particular United States federal, state or local or foreign income
or other tax consequences of participation in the offer and/or the merger.

     Federal Backup Withholding. To prevent backup federal income tax
withholding with respect to cash, if any, received pursuant to the offer and/or
the merger, you must either provide the exchange agent with your correct
taxpayer identification number and certify whether you are subject to backup
withholding of federal income tax by completing the substitute Form W-9 included
in the letter of transmittal or establish a basis for exemption from backup
withholding. Some stockholders (including, among others, all corporations and
some foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and
reporting requirements. In order for a foreign individual to qualify as an
exempt recipient, the stockholder must submit a Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8EXP or
W-8IMY, as appropriate, signed under penalties of perjury, attesting to that
individual's exempt status. NEON stockholders that fail to provide their
taxpayer identification numbers and the appropriate certifications or that fail
to establish an exemption as described above will be subject to backup
withholding of 31% on cash amounts received in the offer and/or the merger and
may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the IRS. If withholding is made and
results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained. Cash amounts paid
pursuant to the tender offer and/or the merger will be reported to the extent
required by the Code to NEON stockholders and the IRS.

     Each NEON stockholder that receives our common shares in the offer and/or
the merger is required to file a statement with his, her or its federal income
tax return setting forth the stockholder's basis in the NEON shares surrendered
and the fair market value of our common shares and the proceeds from the cash in
lieu of fractional shares received in the offer and the merger and is required
to retain permanent records of these facts relating to the offer and the merger.

PURPOSE OF THE OFFER; THE MERGER; APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Purpose. We are making the offer in order to acquire control of at least a
majority of the common stock of NEON on a fully diluted basis. The offer is the
first step in our acquisition of NEON and is

intended to facilitate the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of NEON
common stock. We intend, as soon as practicable after completion of the offer,
to have Neel Acquisition Corp. merge with and into NEON. The purpose of the
merger is to acquire all NEON shares not tendered and exchanged pursuant to the
offer. In the merger, each then outstanding NEON share (except for NEON shares
held in NEON's treasury and NEON shares owned by Sybase or Neel Acquisition
Corp. and, if applicable, NEON stockholders exercising appraisal rights) would
be converted into the right to receive the same number of Sybase shares as is
paid in the offer subject to appraisal rights that may be exercised under the
Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL").

     Approval of the Merger. Under Section 251 of the DGCL, the approval of the
board of directors of a company and the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of its outstanding shares are required to approve and adopt a merger
and a reorganization agreement. The NEON board of directors has previously
approved the merger. Accordingly, if we complete the offer, we would have a
sufficient number of NEON shares to approve the merger without the affirmative
vote of any other holder of NEON shares. Therefore, unless the merger is
consummated in accordance with the short-form merger provisions under the DGCL
described below (in which case no action by the stockholders of NEON, other than
by Sybase acting in its capacity as the majority shareholder, will be required
to consummate the merger), the only remaining corporate action of NEON will be
the approval and adoption of the reorganization agreement by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the outstanding NEON shares.

     Possible Short-Form Merger. Section 253 of the DGCL would permit the merger
to occur without a vote of NEON's stockholders (a "short-form merger") if Sybase
were to acquire at least 90% of the outstanding NEON shares in the offer or
otherwise (including as a result of purchases by Sybase during any subsequent
offering period). If, however, we do not acquire at least 90% of the then
outstanding NEON shares pursuant to the offer or otherwise, and a vote of NEON's
stockholders is required under the DGCL, a longer period of time will be
required to effect the merger.

     Appraisal Rights. NEON stockholders do not have appraisal rights in
connection with the offer.

     If we complete the offer but less than 90% of the outstanding NEON shares
are validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the offer, we will effect a
long-form merger (as described above) as permitted under Section 251 of the
DGCL. NEON stockholders who have not exchanged their NEON shares in the offer
will not have appraisal rights in connection with a long-form merger.

     However, if at least 90% of the outstanding NEON shares are validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn in the offer, we will effect a short-form
merger (as described above) as permitted under Section 253 of the DGCL, NEON
stockholders at the time of a short-form merger will have the right under
Section 262 of the DGCL to dissent and demand appraisal of their NEON shares.
Under Section 262, dissenting stockholders who comply with the applicable
statutory procedures will be entitled to receive a judicial determination of the
fair value of their NEON shares (exclusive of any element of value arising from
the accomplishment or expectation of the merger) and to receive payment of this
fair value in cash, together with a fair rate of interest, if any. In Cede & Co.
and Cinerama, Inc. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of the State of
Delaware construed Section 262 of the DGCL and held that the "accomplishment or
expectation" exclusion from the calculation of fair value set forth in the
preceding sentence is narrow and is designed to eliminate use of pro forma data
and projections of a speculative variety relating to the completion of a merger.
The court held that it is appropriate to include in the calculation of fair
value any known elements of value. We cannot assure you as to the methodology a
court would use to determine fair value or how a court would select which of the
elements of value are to be included in such a determination.

CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

     The offer is subject to a number of conditions, which are described below:

Minimum Tender Condition

     There must be validly tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the
expiration of the offer a number of NEON shares which will constitute at least a
majority of the total number of outstanding NEON shares on a fully diluted basis
(as though all currently exercisable options or other securities convertible
into or exercisable or exchangeable for NEON shares had been so converted,
exercised or exchanged) as of the date that we accept the NEON shares pursuant
to our offer. Based on information supplied by NEON, the number of NEON shares
needed to satisfy the minimum tender condition would have been approximately
19,898,416 as of February 15, 2001.

Regulatory Clearance Condition

     This condition has been satisfied as the waiting period under the HSR Act
has been terminated.

Registration Statement Effectiveness Condition

     The registration statement on Form S-4 of which this prospectus is a part
must have become effective under the Securities Act and not be the subject of
any stop order or proceedings seeking a stop order.

Nasdaq Listing Condition

     The shares of Sybase common stock issuable to NEON stockholders in the
offer and the merger must have been approved for listing on the Nasdaq National
Market, subject to official notice of issuance, or be exempt from such
requirement under the applicable laws, regulations and rules of the Nasdaq Stock
Market, Inc.

Tax Opinion Conditions

     Sybase and NEON must have received opinions from their respective counsel,
reasonably satisfactory to both, on the basis of customary facts,
representations and assumptions, that the offer and the merger will be a
tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes; provided that if NEON's
counsel does not render the opinion, this condition shall still be considered
satisfied if counsel to Sybase renders the opinion to NEON.

Other Conditions of the Offer

     The offer is also subject to the conditions that, at the time of acceptance
for exchange of NEON shares pursuant to the offer:

          (1) There shall not have been any action taken, law enacted, judgment
     entered or similar barrier imposed, by any governmental entity, other than
     the application of the waiting period provisions of the HSR Act to the
     offer or the merger, and there shall not be pending any action, suit or
     proceeding by any governmental entity against Sybase, NEON, Neel
     Acquisition Corp. or any of their respective subsidiaries, that, in the
     reasonable judgment of Sybase, is likely, directly or indirectly, to:

             (i) prohibit, or make illegal, the acceptance for payment of or
        payment for NEON common stock or the consummation of the offer or the
        merger,

             (ii) render Neel Acquisition Corp. unable to accept for payment or
        pay for some or all of the shares of NEON common stock,

             (iii) impose material limitations on the ability of Sybase
        effectively to exercise full rights of ownership of the NEON shares,
        including the right to vote the NEON common stock purchased by it on all
        matters properly presented to NEON's stockholders,

             (iv) prohibit or impose any material limitations on Sybase's direct
        or indirect ownership or operation (or that of any of its affiliates) of
        all or a material portion of its or NEON's businesses or assets,

             (v) compel Sybase or its affiliates to dispose of or hold separate
        any portion of the business or assets of NEON or Sybase and their
        respective subsidiaries which would be material in the context of NEON
        and its subsidiaries taken as a whole,

             (vi) oblige NEON, Sybase or any of their respective subsidiaries to
        pay material damages in connection with the transactions contemplated by
        the reorganization agreement or

             (vii) otherwise constitute a material adverse effect on NEON or, as
        a result of the transactions contemplated by the reorganization
        agreement, Sybase;

          (2) NEON shall not have materially breached any of its covenants,
     obligations or agreements under the reorganization agreement; the
     representations and warranties of NEON contained in the reorganization
     agreement shall have been true and correct in all material respects as of
     the date of the reorganization agreement and shall be true and correct in
     all respects on and as of the date of the expiration of the offer with the
     same force and effect as if made on that date, except for certain breaches
     which individually or in the aggregate do not constitute a material adverse
     effect;

          (3) all change of control severance agreements entered into between
     selected NEON officers and NEON and Amendment No. 1 to the Preferred Shares
     Right Agreement, dated August 5, 1998 shall be in full force and effect;
     and

          (4) the reorganization agreement shall not have been terminated in
     accordance with its terms.

REGULATORY CLEARANCES

     We and NEON have agreed pursuant to the reorganization agreement to use all
reasonable efforts to take whatever actions are required to obtain necessary
regulatory approvals with respect to the offer and the merger. Other than
clearance under the antitrust laws applicable to the offer and the merger which
are described below, the SEC declaring the effectiveness of the registration
statement of which this prospectus is a part and the filing of a certificate of
merger under the DGCL with respect to the merger, we do not believe that any
additional material governmental filings are required with respect to the offer
and the merger.

     Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR
Act") and the related rules, the merger may not be completed until we and NEON
notify and furnish information to the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice and specified waiting period requirements
have been satisfied. The notifications required under the HSR Act to the Federal
Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice have
been filed and we received notice of early termination on March 9, 2001.

     We and NEON also conduct operations in Germany where other regulatory
filings or approvals are required in connection with the completion of the offer
or the merger. We and NEON have made all necessary filings required by the
German regulatory authorities. With respect to such filings, we cannot be
certain that the German approvals or consents will be granted and, if these
approvals or consents are received, we cannot be certain as to the date of those
approvals or consents. In addition, we cannot be certain that we will be able to
cause NEON or its subsidiaries to satisfy or comply with those laws or that
compliance or noncompliance will not have adverse consequences for NEON or any
subsidiary of NEON after purchase of the shares of NEON common stock pursuant to
the offer or the merger.

POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF OUR OFFER

     Reduced Liquidity; Possibly no Longer Included for Quotation. The tender of
NEON shares pursuant to the offer will reduce the number of holders of NEON
shares and the number of NEON shares that might otherwise trade publicly and
could adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the remaining

NEON shares held by the public. NEON shares are included for quotation and
principally traded on the Nasdaq National Market. Depending on the number of
NEON shares acquired pursuant to the offer, following consummation of the offer,
NEON shares may no longer meet the requirements of the Nasdaq National Market
for continued quotation. The NASD's requirements for continued inclusion in the
Nasdaq National Market, among other things, require that an issuer have either:

     - at least 750,000 publicly held shares, held by at least 400 stockholders
       of round lots, with a market value of at least $5 million and net
       tangible assets of at least $4 million and at least two registered and
       active market makers for the shares; or

     - at least 1,100,000 publicly held shares, held by at least 400
       stockholders of round lots, with a market value of at least $15 million
       and at least four registered and active market markers, and either:

       - a market capitalization of at least $50 million; or

       - total assets and total revenue of at least $50 million each for the
         most recently completed fiscal year or two of the last three most
         recently completed fiscal years.

     The shares might nevertheless continue to be included in the Nasdaq
National Market with quotations published in the Nasdaq "additional list" or in
one of the "local lists," but if the number of holders of the shares were to
fall below 300, the number of publicly held shares were to fall below 500,000 or
there were not at least two registered and active market makers for the shares,
the NASD's rules provide that the shares would no longer be "qualified" for
Nasdaq reporting and Nasdaq would cease to provide any quotations. Shares held
directly or indirectly by directors, officers or beneficial owners of more than
10% of the shares are not considered as being publicly held for this purpose.
If, following the closing of offer, the shares of NEON no longer meet the
requirements of the NASD for continued inclusion in the Nasdaq National Market
or in any other tier of Nasdaq and the shares were no longer included in the
Nasdaq National Market or in any other tier of Nasdaq, the market for NEON
shares could be adversely affected.

     If the NEON shares no longer meet the requirements of the NASD for
continued inclusion in any tier of the Nasdaq, it is possible that the shares
would continue to trade in the over-the-counter market and that price quotations
would be reported by other sources. The extent of the public market for the NEON
shares and the availability of quotations for NEON shares would, however, depend
upon the number of holders of shares remaining at that time, the interest in
maintaining a market in NEON shares on the part of securities firms, the
possible termination of registration of the shares under the Exchange Act, as
described below, and other factors. We cannot predict whether the reduction in
the number of NEON shares that might otherwise trade publicly would have an
adverse or beneficial effect on the market price for, or marketability of, the
NEON shares.

     According to NEON, there were, as of March 8, 2001, approximately
36,848,779 shares of NEON common stock outstanding.

     Status as "Margin Securities." The NEON shares are presently "margin
securities" under the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, which has the
effect, among other things, of allowing brokers to extend credit on the
collateral of NEON shares. Depending on the factors similar to those described
above with respect to market quotations, following consummation of the offer,
the NEON shares may no longer constitute "margin securities" for the purposes of
the Federal Reserve Board's margin regulations, in which event the NEON shares
would not be eligible as collateral for margin loans made by brokers.

     Registration Under the Exchange Act. NEON shares are currently registered
under the Exchange Act. NEON can terminate that registration upon application to
the SEC if the outstanding shares are not listed on a national securities
exchange, quoted on an automated inter-dealer quotation system or if there are
fewer than 300 holders of record of NEON shares. Termination of registration of
the NEON shares under the Exchange Act would reduce the information that NEON
must furnish to its stockholders and to the SEC and would make certain
provisions of the Exchange Act, such as the short-swing profit recovery

provisions of Section 16(b) and the requirement of furnishing a proxy statement
in connection with stockholders meetings pursuant to Section 14(a) and the
related requirement of furnishing an annual report to stockholders, no longer
applicable with respect to NEON shares. In addition, if NEON shares are no
longer registered under the Exchange Act, the requirements of Rule 13e-3 under
the Exchange Act with respect to "going-private" transactions would no longer be
applicable to NEON. Furthermore, the ability of "affiliates" of NEON and persons
holding "restricted securities" of NEON to dispose of these securities pursuant
to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be impaired or eliminated. If
registration of the shares under the Exchange Act were terminated, they would no
longer be eligible for Nasdaq reporting or for continued inclusion on the
Federal Reserve Board's list of "margin securities."

RELATIONSHIPS WITH NEON

     Except as set forth herein, neither we nor, to the best of our knowledge,
any of our directors, executive officers or other affiliates has any contract,
arrangement, understanding or relationship with any other person with respect to
any securities of NEON, including, but not limited to, any contract,
arrangement, understanding or relationship concerning the transfer or the voting
of any such securities, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or
calls, guaranties of loans, guaranties against loss or the giving or withholding
of proxies. Except as described herein, there have been no contacts,
negotiations or transactions since January 1, 1997, between us or, to the best
of our knowledge, any of our directors, executive officers or other affiliates
on the one hand, and NEON or its affiliates, on the other hand, concerning a
merger, consolidation or acquisition, a tender offer or other acquisition of
securities, an election of directors, or a sale or other transfer of a material
amount of assets. Neither we nor, to the best of our knowledge, any of our
directors, executive officers or other affiliates has since January 1, 1997 had
any transaction with NEON or any of its officers, directors or affiliates that
would require disclosure under the rules and regulations of the SEC applicable
to the offer.

     Neither we nor, to the best of our knowledge, any of our directors,
executive officers or other affiliates beneficially owns or has any right to
acquire, directly or indirectly, any NEON shares and neither we nor, to the best
of our knowledge, any of our directors, executive officers or other affiliates
has effected any transaction in the NEON shares during the past 60 days.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     The merger of Sybase and NEON will be accounted for as a "purchase," as
that term is used under generally accepted accounting principles, commonly
referred to as "GAAP", for accounting and financial reporting purposes. NEON
will be treated as the acquired corporation for these purposes. NEON's assets,
liabilities and other items will be adjusted to their estimated fair value on
the closing date of the merger and combined with the historical book values of
the assets and liabilities of Sybase. Applicable income tax effects of these
adjustments will be included as a component of the combined company's deferred
tax asset or liability. The difference between the estimated fair value of the
assets, liabilities and other items (adjusted as discussed above) and the
purchase price will be recorded as an intangible asset and amortized against the
combined company's earnings over six years following completion of the merger.
For further information concerning the amount of goodwill or other intangibles
to be recorded in connection with the merger and the amortization of that
goodwill, see "Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial
Statements" on page 30.

     Sybase has prepared the unaudited pro forma financial information contained
in this prospectus using the purchase accounting method to account for the offer
and the merger. See "Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial
Statements" on page 26.

FEES AND EXPENSES

     We have retained Merrill Lynch to provide certain financial advisory
services to us in connection with the offer and the merger. Merrill Lynch will
receive customary compensation for these services. We have agreed to indemnify
Merrill Lynch and related persons against certain liabilities and expenses in

connection with its services as financial advisor, including certain liabilities
and expenses under the federal securities laws. From time to time, Merrill Lynch
and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities of NEON for
their own account or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may hold a
long or short position in these securities.

     We have retained Corporate Investor Communications, Inc. to act as
Information Agent in connection with the offer. The Information Agent may
contact holders of NEON shares by mail, telephone, telex, telegraph, e-mail and
personal interview and may request brokers, dealers and other nominee
stockholders to forward material relating to the offer to beneficial owners of
NEON shares. We will pay the Information Agent reasonable and customary
compensation for these services in addition to reimbursing the Information Agent
for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. We have agreed to indemnify the
Information Agent against certain liabilities and expenses in connection with
the offer, including certain liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws.

     In addition, we have retained American Stock Transfer & Trust Company as
the Exchange Agent. We will pay the Exchange Agent reasonable and customary
compensation for its services in connection with the offer, will reimburse the
Exchange Agent for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will indemnify the
Exchange Agent against certain liabilities and expenses, including certain
liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws.

     Except as set forth above, we will not pay any fees or commissions to any
broker, dealer or other person for soliciting tenders of NEON shares pursuant to
the offer. We will reimburse brokers, dealers, commercial banks and trust
companies and other nominees, upon request, for customary clerical and mailing
expenses incurred by them in forwarding offering materials to their customers.

          INTERESTS OF NEON OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE TRANSACTION

     The information contained in the Information Statement attached as Schedule
I to the Schedule 14D-9 of NEON dated March 15, 2001 is incorporated herein by
reference.

     Except as described in this prospectus or incorporated herein by reference
as a result of the previous sentence, as of the date of this prospectus, there
exists no material agreement, arrangement or understanding or any actual or
potential conflict of interest between NEON or its affiliates and (1) NEON's
executive officers, directors or affiliates or (2) Sybase or Neel Acquisition
Corp. or their respective executive officers, directors or affiliates.

TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS

     The reorganization agreement provides that each outstanding option to
purchase shares of NEON common stock under the NEON stock option plans will be
assumed upon consummation of the merger by Sybase and shall thereafter be
exercisable for that number of shares of Sybase common stock equal to the number
of shares of NEON common stock for which it is exercisable multiplied by the
exchange ratio rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Sybase
common stock. In addition, the per share exercise price of each assumed option
shall be determined by dividing the original exercise price by the exchange
ratio rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

     According to the terms of the NEON 1995 Stock Option Plan, 1998
Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan and 1997 Director Option Plan, 12 months of
unvested options held by employees, directors and officers of NEON shall
accelerate in the event that the employee, director or officer is terminated
without cause or as a result of constructive termination at any time within 12
months following consummation of the offer.

     In addition, George F. (Rick) Adam, Jr., Frederick T. Horn, Peter
Hoversten, Leonard Goldstein and Stephen E. Webb and Dr. Patrick J. Fortune hold
unvested options that will become exercisable in full upon consummation of the
Offer. (See "-- Certain Executive Agreements" below.)

     The following table sets forth, with respect to each of the executive
officers and non-employee directors of NEON:

     - the number of shares of NEON common stock subject to options held by such
       persons that will be exercisable immediately upon the consummation of the
       merger (including options that are currently exercisable as well as
       options which will become exercisable in connection with the transactions
       contemplated by the reorganization agreement);

     - the range of exercise prices of the options held by such persons;

     - the weighted average exercise price of the options held by such persons;
       and

     - the cash value (i.e., the total stock value less the exercise price) of
       all options held by such persons which are in-the-money (i.e. represent a
       positive spread between the respective exercise prices of the options and
       the per share of NEON common stock value of the consideration to be
       received in the offer and the merger), based upon an assumed per share of
       NEON common stock amount of

       consideration to be received by NEON stockholders in the offer and the
       merger of $6.54 in Sybase common stock, based on the last sales price of

CERTAIN EXECUTIVE AGREEMENTS

     In connection with the negotiation of the reorganization agreement, Sybase
required that the change of control severance agreements between NEON and each
of Messrs. Adam, Horn, Hoversten, Goldstein and Webb and Dr. Fortune be amended
with new terms to be effective upon the consummation of the offer. Each of the
amended change of control severance agreements provides that all NEON options
granted to such person prior to the date of the amended agreements will vest and
all restrictions on restricted stock held by such person will lapse upon
consummation of the offer. The amended agreements of Mr. Goldstein and Mr. Webb
provide for a cash payment of $750,000 to be paid to each of them upon
consummation of the offer. The amended agreements of Mr. Horn, Mr. Hoversten and
Dr. Fortune provide cash payments of $1,092,000, $390,000 and $1,560,000,
respectively, based upon their continued employment with Sybase following the
consummation of the offer. The cash payments to Mr. Horn, Mr. Hoversten and Dr.
Fortune are payable as follows: 5/13 on the 12-month anniversary of the
consummation of the offer, 3/13 on the 18-month anniversary of the consummation
of the offer, and the remaining 5/13 on the 24-month anniversary of the
consummation of the offer. If any of Mr. Horn, Mr. Hoversten or Dr. Fortune is
terminated by Sybase without cause prior to the 24-month anniversary of the
consummation of the offer, he will receive his respective cash payment (less any
amounts previously paid) in a lump sum payment. The amended agreement of Mr.
Adam does not provide for a cash payment.

     This summary of the terms of the amended change of control severance
agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the
amended change of control severance agreements, which have been filed as
exhibits (e)(6) through (e)(11) of NEON's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement
on Schedule 14D-9 and are incorporated herein by reference. Information
regarding the prior change of control severance agreements with certain
executive officers is included in Schedule I of NEON's
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 .

     Also, Dr. Franz Koepper is a party to a Change of Control Severance
Agreement with NEON, dated January 30, 2001, which provides that if Dr. Koepper
is terminated other than "for cause" (as defined

therein) within 18 months following the consummation of the offer, Dr. Koepper
will receive a lump sum cash payment equal to 100% of his annual compensation,
accelerated vesting of all NEON options held and, for a period of one year
following the date of termination, continued employee benefits. This summary of
the terms of Dr. Koepper's Change of Control Severance Agreement is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Change of Control
Severance Agreement, which has been filed as exhibit (e)(12) of NEON's
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 and is incorporated
herein by reference. Information regarding Dr. Koepper's employment agreement
with NEON is included in Schedule I of NEON's Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9.

     In connection with the negotiation of the reorganization agreement, Sybase
required that Messrs. Adam, Horn and Hoversten and Dr. Fortune enter into
employment and non-competition agreements in order to help retain these officers
following the merger. These agreements, which become effective only upon the
effective date of the merger, provide for initial base salaries of $400,000 for
Mr. Adam, $400,000 for Dr. Fortune, $300,000 for Mr. Horn and $250,000 for Mr.
Hoversten. The agreements provide for annual target bonuses of up to $200,000 in
the cases of Mr. Adam and Dr. Fortune, up to $120,000 in the case of Mr. Horn,
and up to $100,000 in the case of Mr. Hoversten. The agreements provide that
upon the effective date of the merger, Messrs. Adam, Horn and Hoversten and Dr.
Fortune will be granted stock options to purchase 155,000, 125,000, 125,000 and
125,000 shares of Sybase common stock, respectively, 1/8 of which will vest on
the six-month anniversary of the merger (based upon continued employment) and
1/48 of which will vest monthly thereafter through the 48th month following the
effective date of the Merger (based upon continued employment). The agreements
for Messrs. Adam, Horn and Hoversten and Dr. Fortune provide that in the event
they are terminated "without cause," they will receive (provided the officer
executes a release in favor of Sybase) a severance payment as follows: an amount
equal to 18 months of salary and bonus in the case of Mr. Adam, an amount equal
to the senior vice president severance package then applicable to such employees
in the case of Dr. Fortune and an amount equal to the vice president severance
package then applicable to such employees in the cases of Mr. Horn and Mr.
Hoversten. Each of the agreements also provides for certain restrictive
covenants on behalf of the officers in favor of Sybase, including provisions
regarding noncompetition, nonsolicitation and nondisclosure of confidential
information.

     This summary of the terms of the employment and non-competition agreements
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the employment
agreements (and the amendments thereto), which have been filed as exhibits
(e)(13) through (e)(20) of NEON's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 and are incorporated herein by reference. Information regarding
employment agreements between NEON and certain of its executive officers is
included in Schedule I of NEON's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9.

INDEMNIFICATION

     From and after the effective time of the merger, Sybase will fulfill and
honor in all respects the obligations of NEON pursuant to the provisions of each
indemnification agreement between NEON and its directors or officers in effect
prior to the effective time of the merger and the indemnification provisions of
the NEON certificate of incorporation in effect as of the date of the
reorganization agreement (or indemnification provisions at least as favorable as
the provisions of the NEON certificate of incorporation). Furthermore, Sybase
has agreed to maintain for six years after the effective time of the Merger,
subject to certain cost limitations, a policy of directors' and officers'
liability insurance covering the directors and officers of NEON.

          THE REORGANIZATION AGREEMENT AND THE STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS

     The following descriptions of the reorganization agreement and the
stockholder agreements describe the material terms of such agreements but does
not purport to describe all the terms of such agreements. The complete text of
the reorganization agreement, and the form of the stockholder agreement are

attached as Annex A and Annex B, respectively, to this prospectus. All
stockholders are urged to read the reorganization agreement and the form of the
stockholder agreement in their entirety because they are the legal documents
that govern the offer and the merger.

THE OFFER

     Terms of the Offer. The reorganization agreement provides for the
commencement by Neel Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sybase, of
this offer to exchange all outstanding shares of NEON common stock for shares of
Sybase common stock. The reorganization agreement provides for the consideration
that we will pay in the offer, including the exchange ratio of 0.3878 of a share
of Sybase common stock for each share of NEON common stock. The reorganization
agreement provides that the initial expiration date of the offer is the
twentieth business day following commencement of the offer and that the offer is
subject to a number of conditions, including the minimum tender condition. For a
description of those matters, refer to the discussion under "The Offer" on page
32 of this prospectus.

     The reorganization agreement prohibits Neel Acquisition Corp., without the
consent of NEON, from amending or waiving the minimum tender condition or
amending the offer to change the form or amount of consideration to be paid,
decreasing the number of shares of NEON common stock sought in the offer,
imposing additional conditions to the offer, extending the expiration date of
the offer except as described below or making any other change which is adverse
to the holders of the shares of NEON common stock.

     Mandatory Extensions of the Offer. If any of the conditions to the offer is
not satisfied or waived on any scheduled expiration date of the offer, Neel
Acquisition Corp. will extend the offer for successive extension periods of not
more than 10 business days until all conditions to the offer are satisfied or
waived; provided that Neel Acquisition Corp. is not required to extend the offer
beyond June 30, 2001.

     Optional Extensions of the Offer. Neel Acquisition Corp. will have the
right to extend the offer (i) after acceptance of shares in the initial offering
period, as it may be extended, for a further period of time by means of a
subsequent offering period not to exceed 20 business days for the purpose of
having Sybase and Neel Acquisition Corp. collectively own at least 90% of the
outstanding shares of NEON common stock and (ii) for any period required by any
rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff applicable
to the offer.

     Prompt Payment for NEON Shares after the Closing of the Offer. Subject to
the conditions of the offer, Neel Acquisition Corp. will accept for payment and
pay for, promptly after the expiration of the offer, all shares of NEON common
stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the offer.

THE MERGER

     The Merger. The reorganization agreement provides that Neel Acquisition
Corp. will be merged with and into NEON no later than the second business day
following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the
reorganization agreement unless the parties agree to another date. Under the
terms of the reorganization agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each
share of NEON common stock will be converted into the right to receive from Neel
Acquisition Corp. 0.3878 of a share of Sybase common stock for each share of
NEON common stock, the same per share consideration paid to holders of NEON
common stock who exchanged their NEON shares in the offer. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the merger consideration will not be payable in respect of NEON
shares held by NEON, Sybase or Neel Acquisition Corp.

     Effective Time of the Merger. The merger will become effective upon the
filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of Delaware or
such later time as is agreed by NEON and Sybase and specified in the certificate
of merger. The filing of the certificate of merger will take place as soon as
practicable on or after the closing date of the merger.

NEON BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Upon the acceptance for exchange of shares of NEON common stock pursuant to
the offer, Sybase will be entitled to designate a number of directors of NEON
(rounded up to the next whole number) that equals the product of (i) the total
number of directors on NEON's board of directors (giving effect to the election
of additional directors) and (ii) the percentage that the number of shares
beneficially owned by Sybase and Neel Acquisition Corp. bears to the total
number of shares of NEON common stock outstanding. Until the merger has become
effective, NEON's board of directors shall include at least two members who were
directors of NEON prior to the consummation of the offer. The reorganization
agreement provides that, prior to the effective time of the merger, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the continuing NEON directors will be required
for NEON to:

     - amend or terminate the reorganization agreement;

     - waive any rights, benefits or remedies under the reorganization
       agreement;

     - extend the time for performance of Sybase's or Neel Acquisition Corp.'s
       obligations under the reorganization agreement; or

     - approve any other action by NEON which is reasonably likely to adversely
       affect the interests of NEON's stockholders with respect to the
       transactions contemplated by the reorganization agreement.

TREATMENT OF NEON STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK

     At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding NEON option,
regardless of the extent vested, shall become an option to acquire, on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under the NEON stock option, the same
number of shares of Sybase common stock as the holder of the NEON option would
have been entitled to receive pursuant to the reorganization agreement had the
holder exercised the NEON option in full immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger multiplied by the exchange ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole number. The price per share shall equal the per share exercise price at
which the NEON option was exercisable immediately prior to the effective time,
divided by the exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

     Sybase has agreed to take all action necessary to implement the above,
including the reservation for issuance and listing of a sufficient number of
shares of Sybase common stock for delivery upon exercise of these assumed
options. Sybase has agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-8 with
respect to the shares of Sybase common stock subject to the above options as
soon as is reasonably practicable (and in any event within 10 business days)
after the effective time of the merger.

     Shares of Sybase common stock that are issued upon conversion of shares of
NEON common stock that immediately prior to the effective time of the merger are
unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other
agreement will continue to be unvested or subject to the same options, risks or
other conditions after the effective time of the merger unless the relevant
agreement provides that the option, risk or condition will be altered or will
terminate on consummation of the merger.

COVENANTS AND REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     Reasonable Efforts. The reorganization agreement provides that each of
Sybase and NEON will use its reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary to
close the offer and the merger.

     Conduct of Business Pending the Appointment of Directors. The
reorganization agreement obligates NEON, until the first acceptance for exchange
of shares of NEON common stock pursuant to the offer, to conduct its operations
in the ordinary course of business. The reorganization agreement expressly
restricts the ability of NEON to engage in certain material transactions, such
as purchases and sales of assets or the sale or redemption of outstanding
securities of NEON, without the prior written consent of Sybase.

     No Solicitation of Alternative Transactions. The reorganization agreement
provides that, except in the circumstances described below, NEON will not,
directly or indirectly:

     - solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to assist, facilitate,
       induce or encourage the making, submission or announcement of, any
       Acquisition Proposal (as defined below);

     - engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
       knowingly furnish any information relating to NEON or any of NEON's
       subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books
       or records of NEON or any of NEON's subsidiaries to any person that has
       made, or knowingly take any other action to assist or facilitate any
       inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may
       reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;

     - approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or

     - enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract,
       agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any
       Acquisition Proposal.

     However, the reorganization agreement does provide that in response to an
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach by NEON of
its obligations not to solicit alternative transactions and following delivery
to Sybase of notice of the Acquisition Proposal, NEON's board of directors may,
subject to certain conditions:

     - engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with or furnish to
       any third party that makes a bona fide Acquisition Proposal nonpublic
       information relating to NEON or any of NEON's subsidiaries under a
       confidentiality agreement no less favorable than the confidentiality
       agreement between NEON and Sybase and/or

     - following receipt of such an Acquisition Proposal, withhold, withdraw,
       modify or change in a manner adverse to Sybase or fail to make its
       recommendation to its stockholders of the offer and the merger,

if, in each case, the NEON board of directors concludes in good faith (after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that
the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below) and
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that it is necessary to take such action(s) in order to satisfy its fiduciary
duties to NEON's stockholders under Delaware law.

     "Acquisition Proposal" means any offer or proposal by a third party
relating to:

     - any acquisition or purchase from NEON by any person or group of more than
       15% of the outstanding voting securities of NEON or any of its
       subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
       would result in any person or group beneficially owning 15% or more of
       the outstanding voting securities of NEON or any of its subsidiaries or
       any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
       involving NEON pursuant to which the stockholders of NEON immediately
       preceding that transaction would hold less than 85% of the equity
       interests in the surviving or resulting entity of that transaction;

     - any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business),
       exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of
       business), acquisition, or disposition of more than 15% of the
       consolidated assets of NEON; or

     - any liquidation or dissolution of NEON.

     "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal not
received in violation of the solicitation prohibitions of the reorganization
agreement for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of NEON common stock
on terms that the NEON board of directors determines in good faith by a majority
vote, after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal, are more favorable to the NEON stockholders than the offer
and the merger; provided that no proposal shall be deemed a "Superior Proposal"
if any

financing required to consummate the transaction contemplated in that offer is
not committed and is not likely in the good faith judgment of the NEON board of
directors to be obtained by that party on a timely basis.

     Antitrust Laws. Each of Sybase and NEON will take those lawful actions that
are necessary to make the filings required under any applicable antitrust laws
in connection with the reorganization agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the reorganization agreement.

     Employee Benefits. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we have
agreed to give credit under all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements maintained by us or the surviving corporation (other than
sabbatical benefits) to each employee of NEON or its subsidiaries for all
service with NEON or its subsidiaries. In addition, we have agreed to provide
employees of NEON and its subsidiaries who are retained by us with the benefits
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those benefits provided to our
similarly situated employees; provided that such benefits are available on
reasonable terms, we are permitted to make any changes required by law and there
shall be no duplication of benefits.

     Representations and Warranties. The reorganization agreement contains a
number of customary representations and warranties relating to each of the
parties and their ability to consummate the offer and the merger. All
representations and warranties of each party expire upon the filing of the
certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

TERMINATION OF THE REORGANIZATION AGREEMENT

     Termination by Mutual Agreement. The reorganization agreement may be
terminated at any time prior to the effective time of the merger by mutual
written consent of the Sybase and NEON boards of directors.

     Termination by either Sybase or NEON. The reorganization agreement may be
terminated by either Sybase or NEON:

          (1) at a time prior to the effective time of the merger if:

        the reorganization agreement without Sybase or Neel Acquisition Corp.
        having accepted for exchange any shares of NEON common stock, except

             (ii) the offer has not been consummated on or before June 30, 2001,
        unless the failure to consummate the offer is principally caused by or
        results from the action or failure to act of the party seeking
        termination and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of
        the reorganization agreement; or

             (iii) there shall be any applicable law or regulation that makes
        consummation of the merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or any
        judgment, injunction, or order which is final and nonappealable
        prohibiting the consummation of the merger; or

          (2) at any time prior to the first acceptance for exchange of shares
     of NEON common stock pursuant to the offer, if any representation or
     warranty of the non-terminating party contained in the reorganization
     agreement was when made or becomes untrue or inaccurate such that, overall,
     the untruths or inaccuracies would reasonably be expected to have a
     material adverse effect on the non-terminating party, or the
     non-terminating party materially breaches any covenant or agreement
     contained in the reorganization agreement, if that untruth, inaccuracy or
     breach has not been or is incapable of being cured by the non-terminating
     party within 30 days following receipt by the non-terminating party of
     written notice from the terminating party of the, untruth, inaccuracy or
     breach.

     Termination by Sybase. Sybase can terminate the reorganization agreement at
any time prior to the first acceptance of shares of NEON common stock in the

     recommends to the NEON stockholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the
     offer and the merger;

          (2) the NEON board of directors, or any of its committees, withholds,
     withdraws, modifies or changes in any way adverse to Sybase, or fails to
     make, its recommendation to the NEON stockholders that they accept the
     offer and approve and adopt the reorganization agreement;

          (3) NEON fails to include in various documents relating to the offer

     during the pendency of an Acquisition Proposal;

          (5) NEON enters into any letter of intent or similar document or any
     agreement, contract or commitment (other than a confidentiality agreement
     as permitted by the reorganization agreement) accepting any Acquisition
     Proposal;

          (6) a tender or exchange offer relating to 15% or more of the shares
     of NEON common stock is commenced by a third party, and NEON does not send
     to its stockholders pursuant to certain rules under the Exchange Act,
     within 10 business days of the day that the offer is first published, sent
     or given, a statement that NEON recommends rejection of that tender or

provided that:

          (1) NEON is not in breach of its obligations under the conditions
     listed below and under the nonsolicitation provisions of the reorganization
     agreement and continues to comply with all such obligations in all
     respects;

          (2) the NEON board of directors has authorized, subject to complying
     with the terms of the reorganization agreement, NEON to enter into a
     definitive written agreement for a transaction that constitutes a Superior
     Proposal;

          (3) NEON notifies Sybase in writing that it has received a Superior
     Proposal and intends to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
     that Superior Proposal, attaching the most current version of that
     agreement to the notice;

          (4) Sybase does not make, within five business days after receipt of
     NEON's written notice of its intention to enter into a definitive agreement
     for a Superior Proposal, any offer that the NEON board of directors in good
     faith determines, after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
     recognized standing and its outside legal counsel, is at least as favorable
     to NEON's stockholders as such Superior Proposal;

          (5) during that period NEON has fully cooperated with Sybase,
     including but not limited to, informing Sybase of the terms and conditions
     of such Superior Proposal, and the identity of the person making such
     Superior Proposal, with the intent of enabling both parties to agree to a
     modification of the terms and conditions of the reorganization agreement so
     that the transactions contemplated by the reorganization agreement may be
     effected;

          (6) prior to NEON's termination under these circumstances, NEON pays
     to Sybase the termination fee as described below under "-- Termination
     Fee"; and

          (7) immediately following such termination NEON enters into a
     definitive agreement to effect the Superior Proposal.

TERMINATION FEE

     If the reorganization agreement is either terminated:

     - by Sybase prior to the first acceptance for exchange of shares of NEON
       common stock as described under "-- Termination of the Reorganization
       Agreement -- Termination by Sybase"; or

     - by NEON as described under "-- Termination of the Reorganization
       Agreement -- Termination by NEON,"

then NEON shall be required to pay to Sybase a termination fee in an amount
equal to $15 million in immediately available funds.

     If Sybase or NEON terminates the reorganization agreement as described in
paragraphs (1)(i) and (1)(ii) under "-- Termination of the Reorganization
Agreement -- Termination by either Sybase or NEON" prior to the first acceptance
of shares of NEON common stock in the offer and no event described under
"-- Termination of the Reorganization Agreement -- Termination by Sybase" has
occurred, and (i) after the date of the reorganization agreement and prior to
the date of termination of the reorganization agreement any Acquisition Proposal
has been publicly announced or has become publicly known and not withdrawn at
least 5 business days prior to the termination by NEON and (ii) within 9 months
following termination of the reorganization agreement either a Company
Acquisition occurs or NEON enters into an agreement or binding letter of intent
providing for a Company Acquisition (and such Company Acquisition is later
consummated), then NEON shall pay to Sybase, no later than one business day
after Sybase demands payment, $15 million in immediately available funds.

     For purposes of the preceding paragraph, "Company Acquisition" means any of
the following transactions (other than the offer and the merger):

     - a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
       liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving NEON pursuant
       to which the NEON stockholders immediately preceding that transaction
       hold less than 50% of the aggregate equity interests in the surviving or
       resulting entity of the transaction or a parent entity following the
       transaction;

     - a sale or other disposition by NEON of a business or assets representing
       50% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets of
       NEON immediately prior to such sale; or

     - the acquisition by any person or group (including by way of a tender
       offer or an exchange offer or issuance by NEON), directly or indirectly,
       of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of
       shares representing in excess of 50% of the voting power of the then
       outstanding shares of capital stock of NEON.

AMENDMENTS

     The reorganization agreement may be amended by action taken by Sybase, Neel
Acquisition Corp. and NEON at any time prior to the closing of the merger. The
reorganization agreement provides that if Sybase designates directors of NEON
prior to the effective time of the merger, any amendment of the reorganization
agreement, any termination of the reorganization agreement by NEON, any
extension by NEON of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of Sybase or Neel Acquisition Corp. under the reorganization
agreement, waiver by NEON of any rights of NEON under the reorganization
agreement or any approval of any other action by NEON which is reasonably likely
to adversely affect the interests of the NEON stockholders with respect to the
transactions provided for under the reorganization agreement, will require the
concurrence of a majority of the NEON directors then in office who were not
designated by Sybase.

THE STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS

     Parties. As an inducement for Sybase and Neel Acquisition Corp. to enter
into the reorganization agreement, immediately prior to the signing of the
reorganization agreement, certain of NEON's directors and officers and
affiliated stockholders entered into stockholder agreements with Sybase.

     The obligations of those stockholders under the stockholder agreements
cover, in the aggregate, 4,408,112 NEON shares, which represented approximately
12% of the outstanding NEON shares as of February 15, 2001 (approximately 14%
after giving effect to all options which will become exercisable within 60 days
of February 15, 2001).

     Agreement to Tender. Each stockholder who signed a stockholder agreement
agreed to tender in the offer and not withdraw that portion of his or her shares
of NEON covered by such stockholder agreement as well as any additional NEON
shares acquired by such stockholders after the date of the stockholder
agreement.

     Proxy. Each stockholder who signed a stockholder agreement granted Sybase
or any nominee of Sybase a proxy to vote or grant a consent with respect to that
portion of that stockholder's NEON shares covered by the stockholder agreement:

     - in favor of the adoption and approval of the reorganization agreement and
       the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the reorganization
       agreement;

     - against the approval of any Acquisition Proposal;

     - against any merger, consolidation, business combination or sale of assets
       of NEON with any party other than Sybase;

     - against the reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation or winding up
       of NEON or any other extraordinary transaction involving NEON;

     - against the corporate action that would prevent or delay consummation of
       the offer, the merger or any other transaction contemplated by the
       reorganization agreement; or

     - against any other matters relating to the foregoing.

     Termination. All obligations under the stockholder agreements terminate
upon the earlier of (i) the effective time of the merger or (ii) the termination
of the reorganization agreement in accordance with its terms.

STATE ANTI-TAKEOVER LAWS

     Under Delaware law, a Delaware corporation generally may not engage in a
"business combination" with an "interested stockholder" for a period of three
years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder.
"Business combination" includes a merger, consolidation, asset sale or other
transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder.
"Interested stockholder" is a person who, together with affiliates and
associates, owns, or within three years, did own 15% or more of the
corporation's voting stock. This prohibition does not apply if

     - the corporation has elected not to be governed by these restrictions;

     - prior to the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder,
       the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business
       combination or the transaction resulting in the stockholder's becoming an
       interested stockholder;

     - upon consummation of the transaction resulting in the stockholder's
       becoming an interested stockholder, the stockholder owns at least 85% of
       the outstanding voting stock of the corporation, excluding voting stock
       owned by directors who are also officers and certain employee stock
       plans; or

     - at or subsequent to the time that the stockholder became an interested
       stockholder, the business combination is approved by the board and
       authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by
       written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the
       outstanding voting stock that the interested stockholder does not own.

     Neither Sybase nor NEON has elected not to be governed by these
restrictions. The NEON board of directors has taken the necessary action to make
the above restrictions on business combinations inapplicable to the offer and
the merger.

                                       iii

                      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

     This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of February 20, 2001, among Sybase, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Neel Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and New Era of Networks, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Company").

                                    RECITALS

     The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and Company have
approved this Agreement, and declared advisable that Merger Sub make an exchange
offer (the "Offer") to exchange shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") for all of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Company Common Stock"), of
Company (the "Shares") and the merger of Merger Sub with and into Company (the
"Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("Delaware
Law").

     A. It is intended that, for United States federal income tax purposes, the
Offer and the Merger (together, the "Transaction") shall be treated as an
integrated transaction and shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"). For accounting purposes, the Merger is intended to be accounted for as
a "purchase" under United States generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP").

     B. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition and
inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement: (1) the
directors, executive officers and certain stockholders of Company are entering
into Stockholder Agreements in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit
A (the "Company Stockholder Agreements"), (2) the Company Affiliates (as defined
in Section 5.15) are entering into Company Affiliate Agreements in substantially
the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Company Affiliate Agreements"), and
(3) George Adam, Patrick Fortune, Fredrick Horn and Peter Hoversten are entering
into Employment and Non-Competition Agreements in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C.

     C. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, (i) certain
officers of Company have entered into amendments to the Change of Control
Severance Agreements to which such officers are party to, among other things,
waive certain severance and other rights that may be triggered as a direct or
indirect result of the transactions contemplated hereby (each, a "Severance
Agreement Amendment"), and (ii) Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company have amended (the "Rights Plan Amendment") the Preferred Shares Right
Agreement, dated August 5, 1998 (the "Company Rights Plan"), to render the
Rights thereunder inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Company Stockholder
Agreements.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree
as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                            THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

     SECTION 1.01  The Offer. (a) Provided that (i) this Agreement shall not
have been terminated in accordance with Section 7.01 and (ii) none of the events
set forth in Annex I hereto that would entitle Parent and Merger Sub to fail to
consummate the Offer shall have occurred and be continuing, Merger Sub shall, as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof, commence the Offer. Each Share
accepted by Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer shall be exchanged for the right to
receive from Merger Sub that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. For

                                       A-1

purposes of this Agreement, the "Exchange Ratio" shall mean 0.3878. The initial
expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth business day following
commencement of the Offer. The Offer shall be subject to the condition that
there shall be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer prior
to the expiration date of the Offer and not withdrawn a number of Shares which,
together with the Shares then owned by Parent and Merger Sub (if any) represents
at least a majority of the total number of outstanding Shares, assuming the
exercise of all currently exercisable options, rights and convertible securities
(if any) and the issuance of all Shares that Company is obligated to issue
thereunder (such total number of outstanding Shares being hereinafter referred
to as the "Fully Diluted Shares") (the "Minimum Condition") and to the other
conditions set forth in Annex I hereto. Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve
the right to waive the conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the
terms or conditions of the Offer; provided that, without the prior written
consent of Company, no change may be made which decreases the number of Shares
sought in the Offer, changes the form or amount of consideration to be paid,
imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex I,
changes or waives the Minimum Condition or any of the other conditions set forth
in Annex I, extends the Offer (except as set forth in the following two
sentences), or makes any other change to any of the terms and conditions to the
Offer which is adverse to the holders of Shares. Subject to the terms of the
Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction (or waiver to the extent permitted
by this Agreement) of the conditions to the Offer, Merger Sub shall accept for
payment all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as
soon as practicable after the applicable expiration date of the Offer and shall
pay for all such Shares promptly after acceptance; provided that (x) Merger Sub
shall extend the Offer for successive extension periods not in excess of 10
business days per extension if, at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer or
any extension thereof, any of the conditions to the Offer shall not have been
satisfied, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived, and (y)
Merger Sub may extend the Offer if and to the extent required by the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). In
addition, Merger Sub may extend the Offer after the acceptance of Shares
thereunder for a further period of time by means of a subsequent offering period
under Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), of not more than 20 business days to meet the
objective (which is not a condition to the Offer) that there be validly
tendered, in accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to the expiration
date of the Offer (as so extended) and not withdrawn a number of Shares which,
together with Shares then owned by Parent and Merger Sub, represents at least
90% of the Fully Diluted Shares. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
will be issued in connection with the exchange of Parent Common Stock for Shares
upon consummation of the Offer, but in lieu thereof each tendering stockholder
who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
that otherwise would be received by such holder) in the Offer shall receive from
Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
equal to the product obtained by multiplying such fraction by the closing price
of one (1) share of Parent Common Stock on the first date Merger Sub accepts
Shares for exchange in the Offer, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market
("NASDAQ").

     (b) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register
the offer and sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the
"Registration Statement"). The Registration Statement will include a preliminary
prospectus containing the information required under Rule 14d-4(b) promulgated
under the Exchange Act (the "Preliminary Prospectus"). As soon as practicable on
the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file with
the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer which
will contain or incorporate by reference all or part of the Preliminary
Prospectus and form of the related letter of transmittal (together with any
supplements or amendments thereto, collectively the "Offer Documents") and (ii)
cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares. Parent,
Merger Sub and Company each agree promptly to correct any information provided
by it for use in the Registration Statement or the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect.
Parent and Merger Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
holders of Shares, in

                                       A-2

each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws.
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule TO, the Registration Statement and the Offer Documents
prior to their being filed with the SEC. Parent agrees to provide Company and
its counsel with any comments Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive in
writing from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents as soon as
practicable after receipt of such written comments.

     SECTION 1.02  Company Action. (a) Company hereby consents to the Offer and
represents that its Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held on or
prior to the date hereof, has by the unanimous vote of all directors present and
voting (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are consistent with and in
furtherance of the long-term business strategy of Company and are advisable and
are fair to and in the best interest of Company and its stockholders, (ii)
approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger and the Company Stockholder Agreements and
the transactions contemplated thereby, which approval constitutes approval under
Section 203 of Delaware Law such that the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and the Company Stockholder Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, are not and shall not be subject to
any restriction pursuant to Section 203 of Delaware Law, and (iii) resolved to
recommend acceptance of the Offer and approval and adoption of this Agreement by
Company's stockholders (the recommendations referred to in this clause (iii) are
collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "Recommendations"). Company
has been advised that all of its directors and executive officers and each
stockholder party to the Company Stockholder Agreements currently intend to
tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer.

     (b) As soon as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced, Company
will file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (the "Schedule 14D-9")
which shall include the opinion of Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation
referred to in Section 2.20 and, subject to Section 5.03(b), shall include the
Recommendations; provided, however, that prior to the Appointment Time the Board
of Directors of Company may withhold, withdraw, modify or change in a manner
adverse to Parent, or fail to make, its Recommendations in accordance with the
terms of Section 5.03(b). Company, Parent and Merger Sub each agree promptly to
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to
the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect. Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9
as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to its being filed with the
SEC. Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel with any comments Company
or its counsel receives in writing from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 as soon as practicable after receipt of such written comments.

     (c) Company will promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub with a list of its
stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists of
securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case as of
the most recent practicable date, and will provide to Parent and Merger Sub such
additional information (including, without limitation, updated lists of
stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such other
assistance as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request in connection with the
Offer.

     SECTION 1.03  Directors. (a) Effective upon the acceptance for payment by
Merger Sub of Shares pursuant to the Offer (the "Appointment Time"), Parent
shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next
whole number, on Company's Board of Directors that equals the product of (i) the
total number of directors on Company's Board of Directors (giving effect to the
election of any additional directors pursuant to this Section 1.03) and (ii) the
percentage that the number of Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub (including
Shares accepted for payment) bears to the total number of Shares outstanding,
and Company shall take all action reasonably necessary to cause Parent's
designees to be elected or appointed to Company's Board of Directors, including,
without limitation, increasing the

                                       A-3

number of directors, or seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent
directors, or both; provided that, prior to the Effective Time, Company's Board
of Directors shall always have at least two members who were directors of
Company prior to consummation of the Offer (each, a "Continuing Director"). If
the number of Continuing Directors is reduced to less than two for any reason
prior to the Effective Time, the remaining and departing Continuing Directors
shall be entitled to designate a person to fill the vacancy. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Parent's designees are elected to
Company's Board of Directors prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote
of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required for Company to (a)
amend or terminate this Agreement or agree or consent to any amendment or
termination of this Agreement, (b) waive any of Company's rights, benefits or
remedies hereunder, (c) extend the time for performance of Parent's and Merger
Sub's respective obligations hereunder, or (d) approve any other action by
Company which is reasonably likely to adversely affect the interests of the
stockholders of Company (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their affiliates
(other than Company and its subsidiaries)), with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

     (b) Company's obligations to appoint designees to its Board of Directors
shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated
thereunder. Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section
1.03 and Rule 14f-l in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.03
and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to Company
and its officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-l. Parent will supply to Company in writing and be solely responsible for
any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and
affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

     SECTION 1.04  The Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section
1.05) and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
Company (the "Merger"), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and Company shall continue as the surviving corporation. Company as the
surviving corporation after the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as
the "Surviving Corporation."

     SECTION 1.05  Effective Time; Closing. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, Company and Merger Sub shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the
"Certificate of Merger") (the time of such filing (or such later time as may be
agreed in writing by Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of
Merger) being the "Effective Time") as soon as practicable on or after the
Closing Date (as herein defined). Unless the context otherwise requires, the
term "Agreement" as used herein refers collectively to this Agreement and Plan
of Reorganization and the Certificate of Merger. The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati,
Professional Corporation, One Market, Spear Street Tower, Suite 3300, San
Francisco, California, at a time and date to be specified by the parties, which
shall be no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article VI, or at such other time, date and
location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the "Closing Date").

     SECTION 1.06  Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions
of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation,
and all debts, liabilities and duties of Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

     SECTION 1.07  Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.

     (a) Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, subject to the
provisions of Section 5.14 hereof, the Certificate of Incorporation of Company
shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be the same in substance as the
Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time (except that the name of Company shall remain "New Era of
Networks, Inc."), and such Certificate of Incorporation of Company, as so
amended and restated, shall be the Certificate of

                                       A-4

Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with Delaware Law and such Certificate of Incorporation.

     (b) Bylaws. At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of Section
5.14 hereof, the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be adopted as the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.

     SECTION 1.08  Directors and Officers. The initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time until their successors shall have been duly elected and
qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time until their
successors shall have been duly elected and qualified.

     SECTION 1.09  Effect on Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of
the following securities, the following shall occur:

          (a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common
     Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
     than any share of Company Common Stock to be canceled and extinguished
     pursuant to Section 1.09(b)) will be automatically converted (subject to
     Sections 1.09(e) and (f)) into the right to receive a fraction of a share
     of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (together with the cash
     in lieu of Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock as specified below, the
     "Merger Consideration") upon surrender of the certificate representing such
     share of Company Common Stock in the manner set forth in Section 1.10
     hereof (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon
     delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner set forth in
     Section 1.12 hereof). Except to the extent otherwise provided for in any
     plan or agreement listed on Section 2.03 or 2.18 of the Company Schedule
     applicable to such shares, any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a
     repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any
     applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with
     Company, then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such
     shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the
     same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the
     certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may
     accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. Company shall take all
     action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective
     Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other
     right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other
     agreement.

          (b) Cancellation of Company-Owned and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share
     of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Company or any direct or indirect
     wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or Company, immediately prior to the
     Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
     thereof.

          (c) Stock Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plans. (i) At the Effective
     Time, all options to purchase Company Common Stock then outstanding under
     Company's 1995 Stock Option Plan, 1997 Director Option Plan, 1998
     Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan, Century Analysis, Inc. 1996 Equity
     Incentive Plan, Convoy Corporation 1997 Stock Option Plan and Microscript
     1997 Stock Option Plan (the "Company Option Plans"), and the Company Option
     Plans themselves, shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with Section
     5.11(a) hereof.

             (ii) At the Effective Time, all purchase rights then outstanding
        under Company's 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), and the
        ESPP itself, shall be treated as set forth in Section 5.11(b) hereof.

          (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of Common Stock, $0.001
     par value per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued
     and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
     into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of

                                       A-5

     Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.
     Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock
     immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
     evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving
     Corporation.

          (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio, the Merger
     Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to the Offer or the
     Merger shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock
     split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
     distribution of securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
     for Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), extraordinary cash
     dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
     exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock
     or Company Common Stock occurring or having a record date on or after the
     date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

          (f) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
     will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of
     shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
     fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all
     fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received
     by such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holder's Certificates(s) (as
     defined in Section 1.10(c)) receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded
     to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product obtained
     by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of one (1) share of
     Parent Common Stock on the trading day immediately prior to the Effective
     Time, as reported on Nasdaq.

     SECTION 1.10  Surrender of Certificates.

     (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the
Merger.

     (b) Exchange Fund. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available to the Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this Article I,
an "Exchange Fund" consisting of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 1.09(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, and cash in an amount estimated to be sufficient for payment in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.09(f) and any dividends or other
distributions to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled
pursuant to Section 1.10(d).

     (c) Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of
the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and shall contain such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 1.09(a), cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section
1.09(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.10(d).
Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor certificates representing the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock into which their shares of Company Common Stock
were converted pursuant to Section 1.09(a), payment in lieu of fractional shares
which such holders have the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.09(f) and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.10(d), and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered,
outstanding Certificates will be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to
evidence only the ownership of the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
into which such shares of Company Common Stock shall have been so converted
pursuant to Section 1.09(a) (including any voting, notice or other rights
associated with the ownership of such shares of Parent Common Stock under the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Parent or under Delaware

                                       A-6

Law) and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any
fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.09(f) and any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.10(d).

     (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to
the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of record of such
Certificates shall surrender such Certificates. Subject to applicable law,
following surrender of any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall deliver
to the record holders thereof, without interest, certificates representing whole
shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor along with payment in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.09(f) hereof and the amount of
any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

     (e) Transfers of Ownership. If certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the persons
requesting such exchange will have (i) paid to Parent or any agent designated by
it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than
that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or (ii)
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

     (f) Required Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required
to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or state, local or foreign
law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

     (g) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.10, neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any
party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     (h) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with the
provisions of this Section 1.10 shall thereafter look only to Parent for the
shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 1.09(f) and any
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which
they are entitled pursuant to Section 1.10(d), in each case, without any
interest thereon.

     SECTION 1.11  No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All
shares of Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof
(including any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Sections 1.09(f) and
1.10(d)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. There shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares
of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article I.

     SECTION 1.12  Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall
issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, certificates

                                       A-7

representing the shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificates were converted pursuant to Section
1.09(a), cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to
Section 1.09(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
1.10(d); provided, however, that Parent or the Exchange Agent, may, in its or
their discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of such
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and the payment of cash
and other distributions, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

     SECTION 1.13  Tax and Accounting Consequences.

     (a) Tax. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Transaction shall
constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury
Regulations.

     (b) Accounting. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall
qualify as a purchase for accounting purposes.

     SECTION 1.14  Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Merger Sub, Company, the Surviving Corporation and otherwise) to take all such
necessary action.

     SECTION 1.15  Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 1.09, if the
Merger is effectuated pursuant to Section 253 of Delaware Law, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has
demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Delaware Law shall not be
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder
fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his or her right to appraisal.
If after the Effective Time such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses
his or her right to appraisal, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration. Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received
by Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. Any
amounts paid to a holder pursuant to a right of appraisal will be paid by
Company out of its own funds and will not be reimbursed by Parent or any
affiliate of Parent.

                                   ARTICLE II

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

     Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub, subject to
such exceptions as are disclosed in writing in the disclosure letter supplied by
Company to Parent dated as of the date hereof and certified by a duly authorized
officer of Company (the "Company Schedule"), which disclosure shall provide an
exception to or otherwise qualify the representations and warranties of Company
contained in the section of this Agreement corresponding by number to such
disclosure and the other representations and warranties herein to the extent
such disclosure shall reasonably appear to be applicable to such other
representations or warranties, as follows:

     SECTION 2.01  Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. (a) Each of
Company and its subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and
has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
assets and properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted.
Each of

                                       A-8

Company and its subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, consents, certificates, approvals
and orders ("Approvals") necessary to own, lease and operate the properties it
purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure to have such Approvals would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Company. Company and each of its subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good
