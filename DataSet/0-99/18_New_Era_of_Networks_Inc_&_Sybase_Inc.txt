EMPLOYMENT AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

                                                                 EXHIBIT (d)(10)

                    EMPLOYMENT AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

            This EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of the 20th
day of February, 2001 by and between SYBASE, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Sybase"), and RICK ADAM, an individual residing at Cherry Hills, Co. (the
"Employee").

                                   BACKGROUND

            The Employee is a shareholder of [NEON] and is employed by [NEON].
Sybase and [NEON] have entered into an Agreement And Plan of Reorganization
dated of even date herewith (the "Merger Agreement") which requires, among other
things, that the Employee enter into this Agreement as part of the merger
described in the Merger Agreement (the "Merger"). This Agreement is to be
effective only upon the Effective Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) at
which time Sybase will assign all of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to the Surviving Corporation (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
Sybase wishes to secure on behalf of the Surviving Corporation the services of
the Employee upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, and the
Employee wishes to render such services to the Surviving Corporation upon the
terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants herein contained and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as
follows:

1)    EMPLOYMENT BY THE SURVIVING CORPORATION. Sybase agrees to employ the
      Employee as Division President of the Surviving Corporation, and the
      Employee accepts such employment and agrees to perform such duties as are
      consistent with his title and position. Employee's duties shall be those
      customarily performed by a person holding the same title at a company of
      similar size and industry as the Surviving Corporation, and he shall
      report directly to the John Chen of the Surviving Corporation. The
      Employee agrees to devote his full business time to the business of the
      Surviving Corporation and/or its Affiliates and to faithfully, diligently
      and competently perform his duties hereunder.

2)    TERM OF EMPLOYMENT. The Term of this Agreement shall commence on the
      Effective Date and continue until terminated as set forth herein. The
      parties agree that Employee's employment will be "at will" employment and
      may be terminated at any time with or without cause or notice. Employee
      understands and agrees that neither his job performance nor promotions,
      commendations, bonuses or the like give rise to or in any way serve as the
      basis

Page 1

     for modification, amendment or extension, by implication or otherwise, of
     his employment hereunder.

3)   COMPENSATION. As compensation for all services to be rendered by the
     Employee to the Surviving Corporation and/or its Affiliates in all
     capacities during the Term, the Employee shall receive the following
     compensation and benefits:

     a)  SALARY. An annual base salary of ($400,000) (the "Base Salary"), less
         required withholdings, which shall be paid on a regular basis in

         and policies.

     b)  BONUS. The Employee shall be eligible to receive bonuses in accordance
         with such bonus plans as are applicable to employees of the Surviving
         Corporation from time to time. For calendar year 2001, the targeted
         bonus is $200,000 less required withholdings (which bonus shall only be
         payable to the extent earned under the terms of the applicable bonus
         plan).

     c)  PARTICIPATION IN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. The Employee shall be
         permitted during the Term, if and to the extent eligible, to
         participate in all employee benefit plans, policies and practices now
         or hereafter maintained by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation
         for employees having positions with the Surviving Corporation
         commensurate with the Employee's position with the Surviving
         Corporation. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Surviving
         Corporation from terminating or amending any such plans or coverage so
         as to eliminate, reduce or otherwise change any benefit payable
         thereunder, so long as such change similarly affects all Surviving
         Corporation employees having positions with the Surviving Corporation
         that are commensurate with the Employee's position with the Surviving
         Corporation.

     d)  EXPENSES. The Surviving Corporation shall pay or reimburse the Employee
         for all reasonable expenses actually incurred or paid by the Employee
         during the Term in the performance of the Employee's duties under this
         Agreement, upon submission and approval of expense statements, vouchers
         or other supporting information, in accordance with the then customary
         practices of the Surviving Corporation.

     e)  VACATION. The Employee shall be entitled to vacation in accordance with
         Sybase policy.

     f)  WITHHOLDING OF TAXES. The Surviving Corporation may withhold from any
         compensation payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city and
         other taxes as shall be required pursuant to any law or governmental
         regulation or ruling.

     g)  STOCK OPTIONS. The Surviving Corporation shall grant to Employee stock
         options (the "Employee Option") to acquire up to 155,000 shares of

         vest such that 1/8th of such option shares shall

          shares shall vest each month thereafter through the 48th month after
          the Effective Date. Otherwise, the stock options granted will be upon
          the same terms and conditions as are generally provided under the
          Sybase, Inc. Stock Plans.

          which the Surviving Corporation shall have given notice to the
          Employee of its intention to terminate this Agreement because of such
          disability. Disability shall be determined in accordance with the
          terms of the applicable policies and benefit plans of the Surviving

          written notice to the Employee terminate this Agreement immediately,
          and the Employee shall have no right to receive any compensation or
          benefit hereunder on and after the date of such notice, in the event

                should know or that he intends to be seriously injurious to the

                being understood that business decisions made by the Employee
                in good faith are not to be considered grounds for termination
                for Cause); or

            the Employee has not violated the terms of Section 7 of this
            Agreement. (Payment of the severance payments does not constitute
            an acknowledgement by the Surviving Corporation of the Employee's

            (ii)  for a period equal to the earlier of 24 mos or (y) the date
                  upon which Employee and his covered dependents become covered
                  under comparable group health, plans of another employer,
                  payment of applicable premiums under COBRA for group health
                  coverage in order to provide the Employee and his covered
                  dependents equivalent

Page 4

                     coverage to that which they were entitled to while Employee
                     was an employee of the Surviving Corporation immediately
                     prior to his termination; and

               (iii) all previously accrued vacation pay.

          b)   PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION FOR CAUSE, DEATH OR DISABILITY. If this
               Agreement is terminated by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
               Sections 4(a), 4(b) or 4(c), the Employee shall receive only the
               amounts owing through the Termination Date.

     6)   REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY OF EMPLOYEE. The Employee represents and
          warrants that neither the execution nor the delivery of this
          Agreement, nor the employment of the Employee by the Surviving
          Corporation will result in the breach of any agreement to which the
          Employee is a party, except where any such breach would not have a
          material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or
          operations of the Surviving Corporation.

     7)   COVENANTS. The Employee acknowledges that: (i) he is one of the
          limited number of persons who will develop the business of the
          Surviving Corporation; (ii) his work for the Surviving Corporation has
          brought him and will continue to bring him into close contact with
          many confidential affairs not readily available to the public; and
          (iii) the covenants contained in this Section 7 will not involve a
          substantial hardship upon his future livelihood. In light of such
          acknowledgement, and in partial consideration of the several
          agreements made by Sybase with the Employee in the Merger Agreement
          and in order to induce the Surviving Corporation to enter into this
          Agreement and the Merger Agreement, the Employee covenants and agrees
          that:

          a)   NON-COMPETE. During the period of his employment by the Surviving
               Corporation under this Agreement and for 18 months following the
               termination of the Employee's employment for any reason, provided
               the Surviving Corporation is not in breach of its obligations
               under Section 5, the Employee shall not, directly or indirectly:
               (i) in any manner whatsoever engage in any capacity with any
               Restricted Business in a Restricted Territory (as such terms are
               defined below) for the Employee's own benefit or for the benefit
               of any Person other than the Surviving Corporation; or (ii) have
               any interest as owner, sole proprietor, shareholder, partner,
               lender, director, officer, manager, employee, consultant, agent
               or otherwise in any Restricted Business in a Restricted
               Territory; provided, however, that the Employee may hold,
               directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, not more than
               two percent (2%) of the outstanding securities of any person or
               entity which are listed on any national securities exchange or
               regularly traded in the over-the-counter market notwithstanding
               the fact that such person or entity is a Restricted Business in a
               Restricted Territory.

               "Restricted Business" shall mean (A) a business which is
               competitive with the Surviving Corporation's business engaged in
               by the Surviving Corporation at the date of his

Page 5

          termination of employment (the "Surviving Corporation's Business")
          and (B) Oracle Systems Corporation, Informix Corporation, the
          database product groups or organizations of Computer Associates, the
          database product groups or organizations of Microsoft Corporation and
          the database product groups of organizations of IBM. Notwithstanding
          the above, the Employee may become an employee of or consultant to or
          have an interest as owner, sole proprietor, shareholder, partner,
          lender, director, officer, manager, employee, consultant, agent or
          otherwise in a business unit of a larger enterprise which enterprise
          then has another business unit engaged in a business competitive with
          the Surviving Corporation's Business, provided that the business unit
          of the larger enterprise for which Employee provides services or in
          which he has an interest is neither (1) in a business competitive
          with the Surviving Corporation's Business and is located in a
          geographically separate location from the competitive business unit
          and the Employee has no responsibility and has no role whatsoever in
          the competing business unit nor (2) a company or business unit listed
          in clause B of this paragraph.

          "Restricted Territory" shall mean the larger of (i) the counties,
          cities and states of the United States of America and each political
          subdivision of Canada, Australia, Japan, each member of the European
          Economic Community and any other country in which the Surviving
          Corporation's products are sold or licensed during the term of the
          non-compete obligations or (ii) if (i) is found unenforceable, the
          counties, cities, states and political subdivisions of any country in
          which the Surviving Corporation's products are sold, distributed or
          licensed during the term of the non-compete obligations.

          The parties intend that the covenants contained in this Section 7(a)
          shall be construed as a series of separate covenants, one for each
          county, city, state and other political subdivision of each country
          in the Restricted Territory. Except for geographic coverage, each
          separate covenant shall be deemed identical in terms to the covenant
          contained in the preceding paragraphs. If, in any judicial
          proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce any of the separate
          covenants (or any part thereof) deemed included in said paragraphs,
          then such unenforceable covenant (or such part) shall be deemed
          eliminated from this Agreement for the purpose of those proceedings
          to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants
          (or portions thereof) to be enforced by such court. It is the intent
          of the parties that the covenants set forth herein be enforced to the
          maximum degree permitted by applicable law.

          In the event that the provisions of this Section 7(a) should ever be
          deemed to exceed the scope, time or geographic limitations of
          applicable law regarding covenants not to compete, then such
          provisions shall be reformed to the maximum scope, time or geographic
          limitations, as the case may be, permitted by applicable laws.

     b)   NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Concurrently with the
          execution of this Agreement, the Employee shall enter into a
          Nondisclosure And Assignment of Inventions

Page 6

          Agreement in the form attached hereto.

     c)   NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES OF AND CONSULTANTS TO THE SURVIVING
          CORPORATION. During the period of his employment by the Surviving
          Corporation under this Agreement and for 18 months following the
          termination of the Employee's employment for any reason, the Employee
          shall not, directly or indirectly, initiate communications with,
          solicit, persuade, entice, induce or encourage any individual who is
          then or who has been within the preceding 12-month period, an
          employee of or consultant to the Surviving Corporation to terminate
          an employment or consulting relationship with the Surviving
          Corporation, as the case may be, or to become employed by or enter
          into a contract or other agreement with any other person, and the
          Employee shall not approach any such employee or consultant for any
          such purpose or authorize or knowingly approve the taking of any such
          actions by any other person.

    d)    NON-SOLICITATION OF CUSTOMERS. During the period of his employment by
          the Surviving Corporation under this Agreement and for 18 months
          following the termination of the Employee's employment for any
          reason, the Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit,
          persuade, entice, induce, encourage (or assist in connection with any
          of the foregoing) any person who is then or has been within the
          preceding 24-month period a customer or account of the Surviving
          Corporation, or any infomediary, affiliate, service provider or
          fulfillment entity that does  business with the Surviving
          Corporation, or any actual customer leads whose identity the Employee
          learned during the course of his employment with the Surviving
          Corporation, to terminate or to adversely alter its contractual or
          other relationship with the Surviving Corporation.

     e)   RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UPON BREACH. If the Employee breaches or
          threatens to commit a breach of, any of the provisions of this
          Section 7 (collectively, the "Restrictive Covenants"), the Surviving
          Corporation shall have the right and remedy to seek from any court of
          competent jurisdiction specific performance of the Restrictive
          Covenants or injunctive relief against any act which would violate
          any of the Restrictive Covenants, it being acknowledged and agreed
          that any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable
          injury to the Surviving Corporation and that money damages will not
          provide an adequate remedy to the Surviving Corporation.

     f)   REPRESENTATION OF THE EMPLOYEE. The Employee is (i) familiar with the
          covenants in this Section 7, (ii) is fully aware of his obligations
          hereunder, (iii) finds the length of time, scope and geographic
          coverage of these covenants to be reasonable, and (iv) is receiving
          specified, bargained-for consideration for these covenants.

8)   MISCELLANEOUS.

g)   COUNTERPARTS; FACSIMILE EXECUTION. This Agreement may be executed in two or

     activities which may validly and enforceably be covered.

k)   ADR. Except as provided herein, no civil action with respect to any
     dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this agreement
     may be commenced until the matter has been submitted to JAMS/ENDISPUTE, or
     its successor, for mediation. Either

Page 9

     party may commence mediation by providing to JAMS/ENDISPUTE and the other
     party a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the
     dispute and the relief requested. The parties will cooperate with
     JAMS/ENDISPUTE and with one another in selecting a mediator from
     JAMS/ENDISPUTE's panel of neutrals, and in scheduling the mediation
     proceedings. The parties covenant that they shall participate in the
     mediation in good faith, and that they shall share equally in its costs.
     All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made
     in the course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents,
     employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator and any
     JAMS/ENDISPUTE employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for
     any purpose, including impeachment, in any litigation or other proceeding
     involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible
     or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as
     a result of its use in the mediation. Either party may seek equitable
     relief prior to the mediation to preserve the status quo pending the
     completion of that process. Except for such an action to obtain equitable
     relief, neither party may commence a civil action with respect to the
     matters submitted to mediation until after the completion of the initial
     mediation session, or 45 days after the date of filing the written request
     for mediation, whichever occurs first. Mediation may continue after the
     commencement of a civil action, if the parties so desire. The provisions of
     this Clause may be enforced by any Court of competent jurisdiction, and the
     party seeking enforcement shall be entitled to an award of all costs, fees
     and expenses, including attorneys fees, to be paid by the party against
     whom enforcement is ordered.

l)   SUPERCEDES OLD AGREEMENTS. Employee agrees that the terms of this Agreement
     supercede the terms of any and all employment arrangements he may have had
     with the Surviving Corporation in their entirely (except that that certain
     Agreement dated 2/16/01, 2001 shall survive). Employee agrees that
     Employee's decision to terminate such employment arrangements and enter
     into this Agreement does not constitute constructive termination of any
     employment arrangement Employee had with [NEON].

m)   COSTS OF ENFORCEMENT OR DEFENSE. In the event of any litigation with
     respect to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to be
     paid by the other party hereto all costs of enforcement or defense, as the
     case may be, paid or incurred in connection with the enforcement or
     defense, including reasonable attorney fees and legal costs.

n)   DELAYS OR OMISSIONS. No delay or omission to exercise any right, power or
     remedy accruing to either party upon any breach or default of the other
     party thereto shall impair any such right, power or remedy of such
     non-defaulting party, nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such
     breach or default or an acquiescence therein, or of or in any similar
     breach or default thereafter occurring; nor shall any waiver of a breach or
     default be deemed to be a waiver of any other breach or default.

Page 10

      o)    RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. Sybase and the Employee each acknowledge that
            they have been represented by competent counsel during the
            negotiation and execution of this Agreement and therefore waive the
            application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
            providing that ambiguities in any agreement will be construed
            against the party drafting the agreement.

      p)    CLOSING. This Agreement shall become effective at the time of the
            Closing on the Effective Date.

            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of
the date first above written.

EMPLOYMENT AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

                                                                 EXHIBIT (d)(11)

                    EMPLOYMENT AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

      This EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of the 20th day of
February 2001 by and between SYBASE, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Sybase"),
and PAT FORTUNE, an individual residing at Englewood, Co. (the "Employee").

                                   BACKGROUND

      The Employee is a shareholder of [NEON] and is employed by [NEON]. Sybase
and [NEON] have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated of
even date herewith (the "Merger Agreement") which requires, among other things,
that the Employee enter into this Agreement as part of the merger described in
the Merger Agreement (the "Merger"). This Agreement is to be effective only
upon the Effective Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) at which time
Sybase will assign all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to
the Surviving Corporation (as defined in the Merger Agreement). Sybase wishes
to secure on behalf of the Surviving Corporation the services of the employee
upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, and the Employee wishes to
render such services to the Surviving Corporation upon the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants herein contained and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as
follows:

1) EMPLOYMENT BY THE SURVIVING CORPORATION. Sybase agrees to employ the Employee
   as Senior Vice President of the e-business Platform Division, and the
   Employee accepts such employment and agrees to perform such duties as are
   consistent with his title and position. Employee's duties shall be those
   customarily performed by a person holding the same title at a company of
   similar size and industry as the Surviving Corporation, and he shall report
   directly to the Rick Adam of the Surviving Corporation. The Employee agrees
   to devote his full business time to the business of the Surviving
   Corporation and/or its Affiliates and to faithfully, diligently and
   competently perform his duties hereunder.

2) TERM OF EMPLOYMENT. The Term of this Agreement shall commence on the
   Effective Date and continue until terminated as set forth herein. The
   parties agree that Employee's employment will be "at will" employment and
   may be terminated at any time with or without cause or notice. Employee
   understands and agrees that neither his job performance nor promotions,
   commendations, bonuses or the like give rise to or in any way serve as the
   basis

Page 1

     for modification, amendment or extension, by implication or otherwise, of
     his employment hereunder.

3.   COMPENSATION.  As compensation for all services to be rendered by the
     Employee to the Surviving Corporation and/or its Affiliates in all
     capacities during the Term, the Employee shall receive the following
     compensation and benefits:

     a)   SALARY.  An annual base salary of ($400,000) (the "Base Salary"),
          less required withholdings, which shall be paid on a regular basis in
          accordance with the Surviving Corporation's normal payroll procedures
          and policies.

     b)   BONUS.  The Employee shall be eligible to receive bonuses in
          accordance with such bonus plans as are applicable to employees of
          the Surviving Corporation from time to time. For calendar year 2001,
          the targeted bonus is $200,000 less required withholdings (which
          bonus shall only be payable to the extent carried under the terms of
          the applicable bonus plan).

     c)   PARTICIPATION IN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.  The Employee shall be
          permitted during the Term, if and to the extent eligible, to
          participate in all employee benefit plans, policies and practices now
          or hereafter maintained by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation
          for employees having positions with the Surviving Corporation
          commensurate with the Employee's position with the Surviving
          Corporation. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Surviving
          Corporation from terminating or amending any such plans or coverage
          so as to eliminate, reduce or otherwise change any benefit payable
          thereunder, so long as such change similarly affects all Surviving
          Corporation employees having positions with the Surviving Corporation
          that are commensurate with the Employee's position with the Surviving
          Corporation.

     d)   EXPENSES.  The Surviving Corporation shall pay or reimburse the
          Employee for all reasonable expenses actually incurred or paid by the
          Employee during the Term in the performance of the Employee's duties
          under this Agreement, upon submission and approval of expense
          statements, vouchers or other supporting information, in accordance
          with the then customary practices of the Surviving Corporation.

     e)   VACATION.  The Employee shall be entitled to vacation in accordance

          becomes physically or mentally disabled, the Surviving Corporation
          may, by written notice to the Employee, terminate this Agreement, in
          which event the Term shall terminate 30 days after the date upon
          which the Surviving Corporation shall have given notice to the
          Employee of its intention to terminate this Agreement because of such
          disability. Disability shall be determined in accordance with the
          terms of the applicable policies and benefit plans of the Surviving

     c)   TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. The Surviving Corporation may at any time by
          written notice to the Employee terminate this Agreement immediately,
          and the Employee shall have no right to receive any compensation or
          benefit hereunder on and after the date of such notice, in the event
          that an event of "Cause" occurs. For purposes of this Agreement
          "Cause" shall mean:

          (i)   the continuous failure by the Employee to perform the material
                duties and responsibilities that are reasonably consistent with
                his position which remain uncured for a period of fifteen (15)
                days after receipt of notice thereof from the Surviving
                Corporation;

          (ii)  a conviction of, a plea of nolo contendere, a guilty plea or
                confession by the Employee to a felony or the committing of an
                act of fraud or material dishonesty against, or the
                embezzlement, theft or misappropriation of property belonging
                to, the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates;

          (iii) the Employee personally engaging in conduct that he reasonably
                should know or that he intends to be seriously injurious to the
                business of the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates (it
                being understood that business decisions made by the Employee
                in good faith are not to be considered grounds for termination
                for Cause); or

          (iv)  the material breach by the Employee of this Agreement or the
                Nondisclosure and Assignment of Inventions Agreement which is
                not cured within fifteen (15) days after receipt of notice
                thereof from the Surviving Corporation (except for a breach of

Page 3

               Section 7 hereof or a breach of the Nondisclosure and Assignment
               of Inventions Agreement for which no cure period is provided).

     d)   TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE. The Surviving Corporation may terminate
          this Agreement at any time, without cause, and the Employee shall have
          no right to receive any compensation or benefit hereunder after such
          termination except as set forth in Section 5 below. Employee may
          terminate this Agreement without cause, and the Employee shall have no
          right to receive any compensation or benefit hereunder after such
          termination.

     e)   SURRENDER OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY. Upon termination of his employment
          with the Surviving Corporation, Employee shall deliver promptly to the
          Surviving Corporation all property and all tangible forms of
          Confidential Information in accordance with the terms of the
          Nondisclosure and Assignment of Inventions Agreement between Sybase
          and the Employee.

5)   SEVERANCE PAYMENTS AND OTHER RIGHTS.

     a)   CERTAIN SEVERANCE PAYMENTS AND OTHER RIGHTS. If, during the Term, the
          Surviving Corporation terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
          4(d), all compensation payable to the Employee under Section 3 shall
          cease as of the date of termination specified in the Surviving
          Corporation's notice (the "Termination Date"), and the Surviving
          Corporation shall pay or provide to the Employee the following,
          provided that the Employee first enters into and does not revoke a
          binding written agreement releasing all claims, known or unknown, that
          the Employee has or might have against the Surviving Corporation in
          connection with this Agreement and other employment arrangements with
          the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates and for wrongful
          discharge, and provided further that the Employee has not violated the
          terms of Section 7 of this Agreement. (Payment of the severance
          payments does not constitute an acknowledgement by the Surviving
          Corporation of the Employee's compliance with the terms of Section 7.)
          All severance payments shall be subject to applicable tax withholding,
          and shall be in lieu of any further payments under this Agreement or
          under any other employment arrangements between the Employee and the
          Surviving Corporation.

          (i)  a lump sum amount equal to the SVP severance package then
               applicable to employees.

          (ii) for a period equal to the earlier of 24 mos or (y) the date upon
               which Employee and his covered dependents become covered under
               comparable group health, plans of another employer, payment of
               applicable premiums under COBRA for group health coverage in
               order to provide the Employee and his covered dependents
               equivalent

Page 4

                     coverage to that which they were entitled to while Employee
                     was an employee of the Surviving Corporation immediately
                     prior to his termination; and

               (iii) all previously accrued vacation pay.

          b)   PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION FOR CAUSE, DEATH OR DISABILITY. If this
               Agreement is terminated by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
               Sections 4(a), 4(b) or 4(c), the Employee shall receive only the
               amounts owing through the Termination Date.

     6)   REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY OF EMPLOYEE. The Employee represents and
          warrants that neither the execution nor the delivery of this
          Agreement, nor the employment of the Employee by the Surviving
          Corporation will result in the breach of any agreement to which the
          Employee is a party, except where any such breach would not have a
          material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or
          operations of the Surviving Corporation.

     7)   COVENANTS. The Employee acknowledges that: (i) he is one of the
          limited number of persons who will develop the business of the
          Surviving Corporation; (ii) his work for the Surviving Corporation has
          brought him and will continue to bring him into close contact with
          many confidential affairs not readily available to the public; and
          (iii) the covenants contained in this Section 7 will not involve a
          substantial hardship upon his future livelihood. In light of such
          acknowledgement, and in partial consideration of the several
          agreements made by Sybase with the Employee in the Merger Agreement
          and in order to induce the Surviving Corporation to enter into this
          Agreement and the Merger Agreement, the Employee covenants and agrees
          that:

          a)   NON-COMPETE. During the period of this employment by the
               Surviving Corporation under this Agreement and for 18 months
               following the termination of the Employee's employment for any
               reason, provided the Surviving Corporation is not in breach of
               its obligations under Section 5, the Employee shall not, directly
               or indirectly: (i) in any manner whatsoever engage in any
               capacity with any Restricted Business in a Restricted Territory
               (as such terms are defined below) for the Employee's own benefit
               or for the benefit of any Person other than the Surviving
               Corporation; or (ii) have any interest as owner, sole proprietor,
               shareholder, partner, lender, director, officer, manager,
               employee, consultant, agent or otherwise in any Restricted
               Business in a Restricted Territory; provided, however, that the
               Employee may hold, directly or indirectly, solely as an
               investment, not more than two percent (2%) of the outstanding
               securities of any person or entity which are listed on any
               national securities exchange or regularly traded in the
               over-the-counter market notwithstanding the fact that such person
               or entity is a Restricted Business in a Restricted Territory.

               "Restricted Business" shall mean (A) a business which is
               competitive with the Surviving Corporation's business engaged in
               by the Surviving Corporation at the date of his

Page 5

          termination of employment (the "Surviving Corporation's Business")
          and (B) Oracle Systems Corporation, Informix Corporation, the
          database product groups or organizations of Computer Associates, the
          database product groups or organizations of Microsoft Corporation and
          the database product groups or organizations of IBM. Notwithstanding
          the above, the Employee may become an employee of or consultant to or
          have an interest as owner, sole proprietor, shareholder, partner,
          lender, director, officer, manager, employee, consultant, agent or
          otherwise in a business unit of a larger enterprise which enterprise
          then has another business unit engaged in a business competitive with
          the Surviving Corporation's Business, provided that the business unit
          of the larger enterprise for which Employee provides services or in
          which he has an interest is neither (1) in a business competitive
          with the Surviving Corporation's Business and is located in a
          geographically separate location from the competitive business unit
          and the Employee has no responsibility and has no role whatsoever in
          the competing business unit nor (2) a company or business unit listed
          in clause B of this paragraph.

          "Restricted Territory" shall mean the larger of (i) the counties,
          cities and states of the United States of America and each political
          subdivision of Canada, Australia, Japan, each member of the European
          Economic Community and any other country in which the Surviving
          Corporation's products are sold or licensed during the term of the
          non-compete obligations or (ii) if (i) is found unenforceable, the
          counties, cities, states and political subdivisions of any country in
          which the Surviving Corporation's products are sold, distributed or
          licensed during the term of the non-compete obligations.

          The parties intend that the covenants contained in this Section 7(a)
          shall be construed as a series of separate covenants, one for each
          county, city, state and other political subdivision of each country
          in the Restricted Territory. Except for geographic coverage, each
          separate covenant shall be deemed identical in terms to the covenant
          contained in the preceding paragraphs. If, in any judicial
          proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce any of the separate
          covenants (or any part thereof) deemed included in said paragraphs,
          then such unenforceable covenant (or such part) shall be deemed
          eliminated from this Agreement for the purpose of those proceedings
          to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants
          (or portions thereof) to be enforced by such court. It is the intent
          of the parties that the covenants set forth herein be enforced to the
          maximum degree permitted by applicable law.

          In the event that the provisions of this Section 7(a) should ever be
          deemed to exceed the scope, time or geographic limitations of
          applicable law regarding covenants not to compete, then such
          provisions shall be reformed to the maximum scope, time or geographic
          limitations, as the case may be, permitted by applicable laws.

     b)   NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Concurrently with the
          execution of this Agreement, the Employee shall enter into a
          Nondisclosure And Assignment of Inventions

Page 6

          Agreement in the form attached hereto.

     c)   NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES OF AND CONSULTANTS TO THE SURVIVING
          CORPORATION. During the period of his employment by the Surviving
          Corporation under this Agreement and for 18 months following the
          termination of the Employee's employment for any reason, the Employee
          shall not, directly or indirectly, initiate communications with,
          solicit, persuade, entice, induce or encourage any individual who is
          then or who has been within the preceding 12-month period, an
          employee of or consultant to the Surviving Corporation to terminate
          an employment or consulting relationship with the Surviving
          Corporation, as the case may be, or to become employed by or enter
          into a contract or other agreement with any other person, and the
          Employee shall not approach any such employee or consultant for any
          such purpose or authorize or knowingly approve the taking of any such
          actions by any other person.

    d)    NON-SOLICITATION OF CUSTOMERS. During the period of his employment by
          the Surviving Corporation under this Agreement and for 18 months
          following the termination of the Employee's employment for any
          reason, the Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit,
          persuade, entice, induce, encourage (or assist in connection with any
          of the foregoing) any person who is then or has been within the
          preceding 24-month period a customer or account of the Surviving
          Corporation, or any infomediary, affiliate, service provider or
          fulfillment entity that does business with the Surviving
          Corporation, or any actual customer leads whose identity the Employee
          learned during the course of his employment with the Surviving
          Corporation, to terminate or to adversely alter its contractual or
          other relationship with the Surviving Corporation.

     e)   RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UPON BREACH. If the Employee breaches or
          threatens to commit a breach of, any of the provisions of this
          Section 7 (collectively, the "Restrictive Covenants"), the Surviving
          Corporation shall have the right and remedy to seek from any court of
          competent jurisdiction specific performance of the Restrictive
          Covenants or injunctive relief against any act which would violate
          any of the Restrictive Covenants, it being acknowledged and agreed
          that any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable
          injury to the Surviving Corporation and that money damages will not
          provide an adequate remedy to the Surviving Corporation.

     f)   REPRESENTATION OF THE EMPLOYEE. The Employee is (i) familiar with the
          covenants in this Section 7, (ii) is fully aware of his obligations
          hereunder, (iii) finds the length of time, scope and geographic
          coverage of these covenants to be reasonable, and (iv) is receiving
          specified, bargained-for consideration for these covenants.

8)   MISCELLANEOUS.

          of and be binding upon the parties hereto and any successors and
          permitted assigns.

     f)   DEFINITIONS.  For purposes of this Agreement:

                  federal, state, local or otherwise including without
                  limitation, or any department, agency, or political

     JAMS/ENDISPUTE's panel of neutrals, and in scheduling the mediation
     proceedings. The parties covenant that they shall participate in the
     mediation in good faith, and that they shall share equally in its costs.

     or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a
     result of its use in the mediation. Either party may seek equitable relief
     prior to the mediation to preserve the status quo pending the completion of
     that process. Except for such an action to obtain equitable relief,
     neither party may commence a civil action with respect to the matters
     submitted to mediation until after the completion of the initial mediation
     session, or 45 days after the date of filing the written request for
     mediation, whichever occurs first. Mediation may continue after the
     commencement of a civil action, if the parties so desire. The provisions of
     this Clause may be enforced by any Court of competent jurisdiction, and the
     party seeking enforcement shall be entitled to an award of all costs, fees
     and expenses, including attorneys fees, to be paid by the party against
     whom enforcement is ordered.

l)   SUPERCEDES OLD AGREEMENTS. Employee agrees that the terms of this Agreement
     supercede the terms of any and all employment arrangements he may have had
     with the Surviving Corporation in their entirety (except that that certain
     Agreement dated 2/16/01, 2001 shall survive). Employee agrees that
     Employee's decision to terminate such employment arrangements and enter
     into this Agreement does not constitute constructive termination of any
     employment arrangement Employee had with [NEON].

m)   COSTS OF ENFORCEMENT OR DEFENSE. In the event of any litigation with
     respect to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to be
     paid by the other party hereto all costs of enforcement or defense, as the
     case may be, paid or incurred in connection with the enforcement or
     defense, including reasonable attorney fees and legal costs.

n)   DELAYS OR OMISSIONS. No delay or omission to exercise any right, power or
     remedy accruing to either party upon any breach or default of the other
     party hereto shall impair any such right, power or remedy of such
     non-defaulting party, nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such
     breach or default or an acquiescence therein, or of or in any similar
     breach or default thereafter occurring; nor shall any waiver of a breach or
     default be deemed to be a waiver of any other breach or default.

      o)    RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. Sybase and the Employee each acknowledge that
            they have been represented by competent counsel during the
            negotiation and execution of this Agreement and therefore waive the
            application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
            providing that ambiguities in any agreement will be construed
            against the party drafting the agreement.

      p)    CLOSING. This Agreement shall become effective at the time of the
            Closing on the Effective Date.

            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of
the date first above written.

EMPLOYMENT AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

                                                                 EXHIBIT (d)(12)

                    EMPLOYMENT AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

            This EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of the 20
day of February, 2001 by and between SYBASE, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Sybase"), and FRED HORN, an individual residing at Denver, Co. (the
"Employee").

                                   BACKGROUND

            The Employee is a shareholder of [NEON] and is employed by [NEON].
Sybase and [NEON] have entered into an Agreement And Plan of Reorganization
dated of even date herewith (the "Merger Agreement") which requires, among other
things, that the Employee enter into this Agreement as part of the merger
described in the Merger Agreement (the "Merger"). This Agreement is to be
effective only upon the Effective Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) at
which time Sybase will assign all of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to the Surviving Corporation (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
Sybase wishes to secure on behalf of the Surviving Corporation the services of
the Employee upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, and the
Employee wishes to render such services to the Surviving Corporation upon the
terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants herein contained and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as
follows:

1)    EMPLOYMENT BY THE SURVIVING CORPORATION. Sybase agrees to employ the
      Employee as Vice President of the e-business Platform Division and the
      Employee accepts such employment and agrees to perform such duties as are
      consistent with his title and position. Employee's duties shall be those
      customarily performed by a person holding the same title at a company of
      similar size and industry as the Surviving Corporation, and he shall
      report directly to the Pat Fortune of the Surviving Corporation. The
      Employee agrees to devote his full business time to the business of the
      Surviving Corporation and/or its Affiliates and to faithfully, diligently
      and competently perform his duties hereunder.

2)    TERM OF EMPLOYMENT. The Term of this Agreement shall commence on the
      Effective Date and continue until terminated as set forth herein. The
      parties agree that Employee's employment will be "at will" employment and
      may be terminated at any time with or without cause or notice. Employee
      understands and agrees that neither his job performance nor promotions,
      commendations, bonuses or the like give rise to or in any way serve as the
      basis for modification, amendment or extension, by implication or
      otherwise, of his employment hereunder.

3)   COMPENSATION. As compensation for all services to be rendered by the
     Employee to the Surviving Corporation and/or its Affiliates in all
     capacities during the Term, the Employee shall receive the following
     compensation and benefits:

     a)  SALARY. An annual base salary of ($300,000) (the "Base Salary"), less
         required withholdings, which shall be paid on a regular basis in
         accordance with the Surviving Corporation's normal payroll procedures
         and policies.

     b)  BONUS. The Employee shall be eligible to receive bonuses in accordance
         with such bonus plans as are applicable to employees of the Surviving
         Corporation from time to time. For calendar year 2001, the targeted
         bonus is $120,000 less required withholdings (which bonus shall only be
         payable to the extent earned under the terms of the applicable bonus
         plan).

     c)  PARTICIPATION IN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. The Employee shall be
         permitted during the Term, if and to the extent eligible, to
         participate in all employee benefit plans, policies and practices now
         or hereafter maintained by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation
         for employees having positions with the Surviving Corporation
         commensurate with the Employee's position with the Surviving
         Corporation. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Surviving
         Corporation from terminating or amending any such plans or coverage so
         as to eliminate, reduce or otherwise change any benefit payable
         thereunder, so long as such change similarly affects all Surviving
         Corporation employees having positions with the Surviving Corporation
         that are commensurate with the Employee's position with the Surviving
         Corporation.

     d)  EXPENSES. The Surviving Corporation shall pay or reimburse the Employee
         for all reasonable expenses actually incurred or paid by the Employee
         during the Term in the performance of the Employee's duties under this
         Agreement, upon submission and approval of expense statements, vouchers
         or other supporting information, in accordance with the then customary
         practices of the Surviving Corporation.

     e)  VACATION. The Employee shall be entitled to vacation in accordance with
         Sybase policy.

     f)  WITHHOLDING OF TAXES. The Surviving Corporation may withhold from any
         compensation payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city and
         other taxes as shall be required pursuant to any law or governmental
         regulation or ruling.

     g)  STOCK OPTIONS. The Surviving Corporation shall grant to Employee stock
         options (the "Employee Option") to acquire up to 125,000 shares of
         Sybase, Inc common stock. The stock options granted to Employee shall
         vest such that 1/8th of such option shares shall vest six months after
         the Effective Date and 1/48th of such option shares shall vest each
         month thereafter through the 48th month after the Effective Date.
         Otherwise, the stock

Page 2

          options granted will be upon the same terms and conditions as are
          generally provided under the Sybase, Inc. Stock Plans.

4)   TERMINATION.

     a)   TERMINATION UPON DEATH. If the Employee dies during the Term, this
          Agreement shall terminate as of the date of his death.

     b)   TERMINATION UPON DISABILITY. If, during the Term, the Employee
          becomes physically or mentally disabled, the Surviving Corporation
          may, by written notice to the Employee, terminate this Agreement, in
          which event the Term shall terminate 30 days after the date upon
          which the Surviving Corporation shall have given notice to the
          Employee of its intention to terminate this Agreement because of such
          disability. Disability shall be determined in accordance with the
          terms of the applicable policies and benefit plans of the Surviving
          Corporation.

     c)   TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. The Surviving Corporation may at any time by
          written notice to the Employee terminate this Agreement immediately,
          and the Employee shall have no right to receive any compensation or
          benefit hereunder on and after the date of such notice, in the event
          that an event of "Cause" occurs. For purposes of this Agreement
          "Cause" shall mean:

          (i)   the continuous failure by the Employee to perform the material
                duties and responsibilities that are reasonably consistent with
                his position which remain uncured for a period of fifteen (15)
                days after receipt of notice thereof from the Surviving
                Corporation;

          (ii)  a conviction of, a plea of nolo contendere, a guilty plea or
                confession by the Employee to a felony or the committing of an
                act of fraud or material dishonesty against, or the or
                embezzlement, theft or misappropriation of property belonging
                to, the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates;

          (iii) the Employee personally engaging in conduct that he reasonably
                should know or that he intends to be seriously injurious to the
                business of the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates (it
                being understood that business decisions made by the Employee
                in good faith are not to be considered grounds for termination
                for Cause); or

          (iv)  the material breach by the Employee of this Agreement or the
                Nondisclosure and Assignment of Inventions Agreement which is
                not cured within fifteen (15) days after receipt of notice
                thereof from the Surviving Corporation (except for a breach of
                Section 7 hereof or a breach of the Nondisclosure and Assignment
                of Inventions Agreement for which no cure period is provided).

Page 3

      d)    TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE. The Surviving Corporation may terminate
            this Agreement at any time, without cause, and the Employee shall
            have no right to receive any compensation or benefit hereunder
            after such termination except as set forth in Section 5 below.
            Employee may terminate this Agreement without cause, and the
            Employee shall have no right to receive any compensation or benefit
            hereunder after such termination.

      e)    SURRENDER OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY. Upon termination of his
            employment with the Surviving Corporation, Employee shall deliver
            promptly to the Surviving Corporation all property and all tangible
            forms of Confidential Information in accordance with the terms of
            the Nondisclosure and Assignment of Inventions Agreement between
            Sybase and the Employee.

5)    SEVERANCE PAYMENTS AND OTHER RIGHTS.

      a)    CERTAIN SEVERANCE PAYMENTS AND OTHER RIGHTS. If, during the Term,
            the Surviving Corporation terminates this Agreement pursuant to
            Section 4(d), all compensation payable to the Employee under
            Section 3 shall cease as of the date of termination specified in
            the Surviving Corporation's notice (the "Termination Date"), and
            the Surviving Corporation shall pay or provide to the Employee the
            following, provided that the Employee first enters into and does
            not revoke a binding written agreement releasing all claims, known
            or unknown, that the Employee has or might have against the
            Surviving Corporation in connection with this Agreement and other
            employment arrangements with the Surviving Corporation and its
            Affiliates and for wrongful discharge, and provided further that
            the Employee has not violated the terms of Section 7 of this
            Agreement. (Payment of the severance payments does not constitute
            an acknowledgement by the Surviving Corporation of the Employee's
            compliance with the terms of Section 7.) All severance payments
            shall be subject to applicable tax withholding, and shall be in
            lieu of any further payments under this Agreement or under any
            other employment arrangements between the Employee and the
            Surviving Corporation.

            (i)   a lump sum amount equal to the VP severance package then
                  applicable to employees;

            (ii)  for a period equal to the earlier of 24 mos or (y) the date
                  upon which Employee and his covered dependents become covered
                  under comparable group health, plans of another employer,
                  payment of applicable premiums under COBRA for group health
                  coverage in order to provide the Employee and his covered
                  dependents equivalent coverage to that which they were
                  entitled to while Employee was an employee of the Surviving
                  Corporation immediately prior to his termination; and

            (iii) all previously accrued vacation pay.

Page 4

     b)   PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION FOR CAUSE, DEATH OR DISABILITY. If this
          Agreement is terminated by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
          Sections 4(a), 4(b) or 4(c), the Employee shall receive only the
          amounts owing through the Termination Date.

6)   REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY OF EMPLOYEE. The Employee represents and
     warrants that neither the execution nor the delivery of this Agreement, nor
     the employment of the Employee by the Surviving Corporation will result in
     the breach of any agreement to which the Employee is a party, except where
     any such breach would not have a material adverse effect on the business,
     financial condition or operations of the Surviving Corporation.

7)   COVENANTS. The Employee acknowledges that: (i) he is one of the limited
     number of persons who will develop the business of the Surviving
     Corporation; (ii) his work for the Surviving Corporation has brought him
     and will continue to bring him into close contact with many confidential
     affairs not readily available to the public; and (iii) the covenants
     contained in this Section 7 will not involve a substantial hardship upon
     his future livelihood. In light of such acknowledgement, and in partial
     consideration of the several agreements made by Sybase with the Employee in
     the Merger Agreement and in order to induce the Surviving Corporation to
     enter into this Agreement and the Merger Agreement, the Employee covenants
     and agrees that:

     a)   NON-COMPETE. During the period of his employment by the Surviving
          Corporation under this Agreement and for 18 months following the
          termination, of the Employee's employment for any reason, provided the
          Surviving Corporation is not in breach of its obligations under
          Section 5, the Employee shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) in any
          manner whatsoever engage in any capacity with any Restricted Business
          in a Restricted Territory (as such terms are defined below) for the
          Employee's own benefit or for the benefit of any Person other than the
          Surviving Corporation; or (ii) have any interest as owner, sole
          proprietor, shareholder, partner, lender, director, officer, manager,
          employee, consultant, agent or otherwise in any Restricted Business in
          a Restricted Territory; provided, however, that the Employee may hold,
          directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, not more than two
          percent (2%) of the outstanding securities of any person or entity
          which are listed on any national securities exchange or regularly
          traded in the over-the-counter market notwithstanding the fact that
          such person or entity is a Restricted Business in a Restricted
          Territory.

          "Restricted Business" shall mean (A) a business which is competitive
          with the Surviving Corporation's business engaged in by the Surviving
          Corporation at the date of his termination of employment (the
          "Surviving Corporation's Business") and (B) Oracle Systems
          Corporation, Informix Corporation, the database product groups or
          organizations of Computer Associates, the database product groups or
          organizations of Microsoft Corporation and the database product groups
          or organizations of IBM. Notwithstanding the above, the Employee may
          become an employee of or consultant to or have an interest as owner,
          sole proprietor, shareholder, partner, lender, director, officer,
          manager,

Page 5

          employee, consultant, agent or otherwise in a business unit of a
          larger enterprise which enterprise then has another business unit
          engaged in a business competitive with the Surviving Corporation's
          Business, provided that the business unit of the larger enterprise for
          which Employee provides services or in which he has an interest is
          neither (1) in a business competitive with the Surviving Corporation's
          Business and is located in a geographically separate location from the
          competitive business unit and the Employee has no responsibility and
          has no role whatsoever in the competing business unit nor (2) a
          company or business unit listed in clause B of this paragraph.

          "Restricted Territory" shall mean the larger of (i) the counties,
          cities and states of the United States of America and each political
          subdivision of Canada, Australia, Japan, each member of the European
          Economic Community and any other country in which the Surviving
          Corporation's products are sold or licensed during the term of the
          non-compete obligations or (ii) if (i) is found unenforceable, the
          counties, cities, states and political subdivisions of any country in
          which the Surviving Corporation's products are sold, distributed or
          licensed during the term of the non-compete obligations.

          The parties intend that the covenants contained in this Section 7(a)
          shall be construed as a series of separate covenants, one for each
          county, city, state and other political subdivision of each country in
          the Restricted Territory. Except for geographic coverage, each
          separate covenant shall be deemed identical in terms to the covenant
          contained in the preceding paragraphs. If, in any judicial proceeding,
          a court shall refuse to enforce any of the separate covenants (or any
          part thereof) deemed included in said paragraphs, then such
          unenforceable covenant (or such part) shall be deemed eliminated from
          this Agreement for the purpose of those proceedings to the extent
          necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants (or portions
          thereof) to be enforced by such court. It is the intent of the parties
          that the covenants set forth herein be enforced to the maximum degree
          permitted by applicable law.

          In the event that the provisions of this Section 7(a) should ever be
          deemed to exceed the scope, time or geographic limitations of
          applicable law regarding covenants not to compete, then such
          provisions shall be reformed to the maximum scope, time or geographic
          limitations, as the case may be, permitted by applicable laws.

     b)   NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Concurrently with the
          execution of this Agreement, the Employee shall enter into a
          Nondisclosure And Assignment of Inventions Agreement in the form
          attached hereto.

     c)   NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES OF AND CONSULTANTS TO THE SURVIVING
          CORPORATION. During the period of his employment by the Surviving
          Corporation under this Agreement and for 18 months following the
          termination of the Employee's employment for any reason, the Employee
          shall not, directly or indirectly, initiate communications with,
          solicit, persuade, entice, induce or encourage any individual who is
          then or who has been within

Page 6

     the preceding 12-month period, an employee of or consultant to the
     Surviving Corporation to terminate an employment or consulting relationship
     with the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or to become employed
     by or enter into a contract or other agreement with any other person, and
     the Employee shall not approach any such employee or consultant for any
     such purpose or authorize or knowingly approve the taking of any such
     actions by any other person.

d)   NON-SOLICITATION OF CUSTOMERS. During the period of his employment by the
     Surviving Corporation under this Agreement and for 18 months following the
     termination of the Employee's employment for any reason, the Employee shall
     not, directly or indirectly, solicit, persuade, entice, induce, encourage
     (or assist in connection with any of the foregoing) any person who is then
     or has been within the preceding 24-month period a customer or account of
     the Surviving Corporation, or any infomediary, affiliate, service provider
     or fulfillment entity that does business with the Surviving Corporation, or
     any actual customer leads whose identity the Employee learned during the
     course of his employment with the Surviving Corporation, to terminate or to
     adversely alter its contractual or other relationship with the Surviving
     Corporation.

e)   RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UPON BREACH. If the Employee breaches, or threatens to
     commit a breach of, any of the provisions of this Section 7 (collectively,
     the "Restrictive Covenants"), the Surviving Corporation shall have the
     right and remedy to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction specific
     performance of the Restrictive Covenants or injunctive relief against any
     act which would violate any of the Restrictive Covenants, it being
     acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach will
     cause irreparable injury to the Surviving Corporation and that money

            any sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all
            of its assets or business, whether by merger, consolidation or
            otherwise. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
            binding upon the parties hereto and any successors and permitted
            assigns.

      f)    DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Agreement:

            (i)   "Affiliate" shall mean a Person that, directly or indirectly,
                  controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with
                  the Surviving Corporation;

Page 8

          (ii)  "control" as used with respect to any Person, shall mean the
                possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or
                cause the direction of the management or policies, whether
                through ownership of voting securities, by contract or
                otherwise; and

          (iii) "Person" means an individual, sole proprietorship, partnership,
                corporation, association, joint stock Surviving Corporation,
                trust, joint venture, unincorporated organization, institution,
                entity or government (whether federal, state, local or otherwise
                including without limitation, or any department, agency, or
                political subdivision thereof).

     g)   COUNTERPARTS; FACSIMILE EXECUTION. This Agreement may be executed in
          two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original
          but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
          instrument. Facsimile execution and delivery of this Agreement is
          legal, valid and binding execution and delivery for all purposes.

     h)   HEADINGS. The headings in this Agreement are for reference purposes
          only and shall in no way affect the meaning or interpretation of this
          Agreement.

     i)   SURVIVAL. Sections 4(e),5,6,7 and this Section 8 shall survive
          termination of this Agreement for any reason.

     j)   SEVERABILITY. To the extent any provision of this Agreement shall be
          invalid or unenforceable, it shall be considered deleted herefrom and
          the remainder of such provision and of this Agreement shall be
          unaffected and shall continue in full force and effect. In furtherance
          and not in limitation of the foregoing, should the duration of
          geographical extent of, or business activities covered by any
          provision of this Agreement be in excess of that which is valid and
          enforceable under applicable law, then such provision shall be
          construed to cover only that duration, extent or activities which may
          validly and enforceably be covered.

     k)   ADR. Except as provided herein, no civil action with respect to any
          dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this
          agreement may be commenced until the matter has been submitted to
          JAMS/ENDISPUTE, or its successor, for mediation. Either party may
          commence mediation by providing to JAMS/ENDISPUTE and the other party
          a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the
          dispute and the relief requested. The parties will cooperate with
          JAMS/ENDISPUTE and with one another in selecting a mediator from
          JAMS/ENDISPUTE's panel of neutrals, and in scheduling the mediation
          proceedings. The parties covenant that they shall participate in the
          mediation in good faith, and that they shall share equally in its
          costs. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or
          written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties,
          their agents, employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator
          and any JAMS/ENDISPUTE employees, are confidential, privileged and
          inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any litigation
          or other proceeding involving the

Page 9

     parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or
     discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a
     result of its use in the mediation. Either party may seek equitable relief
     prior to the mediation to preserve the status quo pending the completion of
     that process. Except for such an action to obtain equitable relief, neither
     party may commence a civil action with respect to the matters submitted to
     mediation until after the completion of the initial mediation session, or
     45 days after the date of filing the written request for mediation,
     whichever occurs first. Mediation may continue after the commencement of a
     civil action, if the parties so desire. The provisions of this Clause may
     be enforced by any Court of competent jurisdiction, and the party seeking
     enforcement shall be entitled to an award of all costs, fees and expenses,
     including attorneys fees, to be paid by the party against whom enforcement
     is ordered.

l)   SUPERCEDES OLD AGREEMENTS. Employee agrees that the terms of this Agreement
     supercede the terms of any and all employment arrangements he may have had
     with the Surviving Corporation in their entirety (except that that certain
     Agreement dated 2/16/01, 2001 shall survive). Employee agrees that
     Employee's decision to terminate such employment arrangements and enter
     into this Agreement does not constitute constructive termination of any
     employment arrangement Employee had with [NEON].

m)   COSTS OF ENFORCEMENT OR DEFENSE. In the event of any litigation with
     respect to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to be
     paid by the other party hereto all costs of enforcement or defense, as the
     case may be, paid or incurred in connection with the enforcement or
     defense, including reasonable attorney fees and legal costs.

n)   DELAYS OR OMISSIONS. No delay or omission to exercise any right, power or
     remedy accruing to either party upon any breach or default of the other
     party hereto shall impair any such right, power or remedy of such
     non-defaulting party, nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such
     breach or default or an acquiescence therein, or of or in any similar
     breach or default thereafter occurring; nor shall any waiver of a breach or
     default be deemed to be a waiver of any other breach or default.

o)   RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. Sybase and the Employee each acknowledge that they
     have been represented by competent counsel during the negotiation and
     execution of this Agreement and therefore waive the application of any law,
     regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in
     any agreement will be construed against the party drafting the agreement.

p)   CLOSING. This Agreement shall become effective at the time of the Closing
     on the Effective Date.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the
date first above written.

EMPLOYMENT AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

                                                                 EXHIBIT (d)(13)

                    EMPLOYMENT AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

            This EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of the 20th
day of February 2001 by and between SYBASE, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Sybase"), and PETER HOVERSTEN an individual residing at Denver, Co. (the
"Employee").

                                   BACKGROUND

            The Employee is a shareholder of [NEON] and is employed by [NEON].
Sybase and [NEON] have entered into an Agreement And Plan of Reorganization
dated of even date herewith (the "Merger Agreement") which requires, among other
things, that the Employee enter into this Agreement as part of the merger
described in the Merger Agreement (the "Merger"). This Agreement is to be
effective only upon the Effective Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) at
which time Sybase will assign all of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to the Surviving Corporation (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
Sybase wishes to secure on behalf of the Surviving Corporation the services of
the Employee upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, and the
Employee wishes to render such services to the Surviving Corporation upon the
terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants herein contained and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as
follows:

1)    EMPLOYMENT BY THE SURVIVING CORPORATION. Sybase agrees to employ the
      Employee as Vice President and CTO of the e-business Platform Division,
      and the Employee accepts such employment and agrees to perform such duties
      as are consistent with his title and position. Employee's duties shall be
      those customarily performed by a person holding the same title at a
      company of similar size and industry as the Surviving Corporation, and he
      shall report directly to Pat Fortune of the Surviving Corporation. The
      Employee agrees to devote his full business time to the business of the
      Surviving Corporation and/or its Affiliates and to faithfully, diligently
      and competently perform his duties hereunder.

2)    TERM OF EMPLOYMENT. The Term of this Agreement shall commence on the
      Effective Date and continue until terminated as set forth herein. The
      parties agree that Employee's employment will be "at will" employment and
      may be terminated at any time with or without cause or notice. Employee
      understands and agrees that neither his job performance nor promotions,
      commendations, bonuses or the like give rise to or in any way serve as the
      basis

Page 1

     for modification, amendment or extension, by implication or otherwise, of
     his employment hereunder.

3.   COMPENSATION.  As compensation for all services to be rendered by the
     Employee to the Surviving Corporation and/or its Affiliates in all
     capacities during the Term, the Employee shall receive the following
     compensation and benefits:

     a)   SALARY.  An annual base salary of ($250,000) (the "Base Salary"),
          less required withholdings, which shall be paid on a regular basis in
          accordance with the Surviving Corporation's normal payroll procedures
          and policies.

     b)   BONUS.  The Employee shall be eligible to receive bonuses in
          accordance with such bonus plans as are applicable to employees of
          the Surviving Corporation from time to time. For calendar year 2001,
          the targeted bonus is $100,000 less required withholdings (which
          bonus shall only be payable to the extent earned under the terms of
          the applicable bonus plan).

     c)   PARTICIPATION IN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.  The Employee shall be
          permitted during the Term, if and to the extent eligible, to
          participate in all employee benefit plans, policies and practices now
          or hereafter maintained by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation
          for employees having positions with the Surviving Corporation
          commensurate with the Employee's position with the Surviving
          Corporation. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Surviving
          Corporation from terminating or amending any such plans or coverage
          so as to eliminate, reduce or otherwise change any benefit payable
          thereunder, so long as such change similarly affects all Surviving
          Corporation employees having positions with the Surviving Corporation
          that are commensurate with the Employee's position with the Surviving
          Corporation.

     d)   EXPENSES.  The Surviving Corporation shall pay or reimburse the
          Employee for all reasonable expenses actually incurred or paid by the
          Employee during the Term in the performance of the Employee's duties
          under this Agreement, upon submission and approval of expense
          statements, vouchers or other supporting information, in accordance
          with the then customary practices of the Surviving Corporation.

     e)   VACATION.  The Employee shall be entitled to vacation in accordance
          with Sybase policy.

     f)   WITHHOLDING OF TAXES.  The Surviving Corporation may withhold from
          any compensation payable under this Agreement all federal, state,
          city and other taxes as shall be required pursuant to any law or
          governmental regulation or ruling.

     g)   STOCK OPTIONS.  The Surviving Corporation shall grant to Employee
          stock options (the "Employee Option") to acquire up to 125,000 shares
          of Sybase, Inc. common stock. The stock options granted to Employee
          shall vest such that 1/8th of such option shares shall

Page 2

          vest six months after the Effective Date, and 1/48th of such option
          shares shall vest each month thereafter through the 48th month after
          the Effective Date. Otherwise, the stock options granted will be upon
          the same terms and conditions as are generally provided under the
          Sybase, Inc. Stock Plans.

4)   TERMINATION.

     a)   TERMINATION UPON DEATH.  If the Employee dies during the Term, this
          Agreement shall terminate as of the date of his death.

     b)   TERMINATION UPON DISABILITY.  If, during the Term, the Employee
          becomes physically or mentally disabled, the Surviving Corporation
          may, by written notice to the Employee, terminate this Agreement, in
          which event the Term shall terminate 30 days after the date upon
          which the Surviving Corporation shall have given notice to the
          Employee of its intention to terminate this Agreement because of such
          disability. Disability shall be determined in accordance with the
          terms of the applicable policies and benefit plans of the Surviving
          Corporation.

     c)   TERMINATION FOR CAUSE.  The Surviving Corporation may at any time by
          written notice to the Employee terminate this Agreement immediately,
          and the Employee shall have no right to receive any compensation or
          benefit hereunder on and after the date of such notice, in the event
          that an event of "Cause" occurs. For purposes of this Agreement
          "Cause" shall mean:

          (i)    the continuous failure by the Employee to perform the material
                 duties and responsibilities that are reasonably consistent with
                 his position which remain uncured for a period of fifteen (15)
                 days after receipt of notice thereof from the Surviving
                 Corporation;

          (ii)   a conviction of, a plea of nolo contendere, a guilty plea or
                 confession by the Employee to a felony or the committing of an
                 act of fraud or material dishonesty against, or the or
                 embezzlement, theft or misappropriation of property belonging
                 to, the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates;

          (iii)  the Employee personally engaging in conduct that he reasonably
                 should know or that he intends to be seriously injurious to the
                 business of the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates (it
                 being understood that business decisions made by the Employee
                 in good faith are not to be considered grounds for termination
                 for Cause); or

          (iv)   the material breach by the Employee of this Agreement or the
                 Nondisclosure and Assignment of Inventions Agreement which is
                 not cured within fifteen (15) days after receipt of notice
                 thereof from the Surviving Corporation (except for a breach of

Page 3

                  Section 7 hereof or a breach of the Nondisclosure and
                  Assignment of Inventions Agreement for which no cure period
                  is provided).

      d)    TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE. The Surviving Corporation may terminate
            the Agreement at any time, without cause, and the Employee shall
            have no right to receive any compensation or benefit hereunder
            after such termination except as set forth in Section 5 below.
            Employee may terminate this Agreement without cause, and the
            Employee shall have no right to receive any compensation or benefit
            hereunder after such termination.

      e)    SURRENDER OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY. Upon termination of his
            employment with the Surviving Corporation, Employee shall deliver
            promptly to the Surviving Corporation all property and all tangible
            forms of Confidential Information in accordance with the terms of
            the Nondisclosure and Assignment of Inventions Agreement between
            Sybase and the Employee.

5)    SEVERANCE PAYMENTS AND OTHER RIGHTS.

      a)    CERTAIN SEVERANCE PAYMENTS AND OTHER RIGHTS. If, during the Term,
            the Surviving Corporation terminates this Agreement pursuant to
            Section 4(d), all compensation payable to the Employee under
            Section 3 shall cease as of the date of termination specified in
            the Surviving Corporation's notice (the "Termination Date"), and
            the Surviving Corporation shall pay or provide to the Employee the
            following, provided that the Employee first enters into and does
            not revoke a binding written agreement releasing all claims, known
            or unknown, that the Employee has or might have against the
            Surviving Corporation in connection with this Agreement and other
            employment arrangements with the Surviving Corporation and its
            Affiliates and for wrongful discharge, and provided further that
            the Employee has not violated the terms of Section 7 of this
            Agreement. (Payment of the severance payments does not constitute
            an acknowledgement by the Surviving Corporation of the Employee's
            compliance with the terms of Section 7.) All severance payments
            shall be subject to applicable tax withholding, and shall be in
            lieu of any further payments under this Agreement or under any
            other employment arrangements between the Employee and the
            Surviving Corporation.

            (i)   a lump sum amount equal to the VP package in effect on the
                  Termination Date;

            (ii)  for a period equal to the earlier of 24 mos. or (y) the date
                  upon which Employee and his covered dependents become covered
                  under comparable group health, plans of another employer,
                  payment of applicable premiums under COBRA for group health
                  coverage in order to provide the Employee and his covered
                  dependents equivalent

Page 4

                     coverage to that which they were entitled to while Employee
                     was an employee of the Surviving Corporation immediately to
                     his termination; and

               (iii) all previously accrued vacation pay.

          b)   PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION FOR CAUSE, DEATH OR DISABILITY. If
               this Agreement is terminated by the Surviving Corporation
               pursuant to Section 4(a), 4(b) or 4(c), the Employee shall
               receive only the amounts owing through the Termination Date.

     6)   REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY OF EMPLOYEE. The Employee represents and
          warrants that neither the execution nor the delivery of this
          Agreement, nor the employment of the Employee by the Surviving
          Corporation will result in the breach of any agreement to which the
          Employee is a party, except where any such breach would not have a
          material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or
          operations of the Surviving Corporation.

     7)   COVENANTS. The Employee acknowledges that: (i) he is one of the
          limited number of persons who will develop the business of the
          Surviving Corporation; (ii) his work for the Surviving Corporation has
          brought him and will continue to bring him into close contact with
          many confidential affairs not readily available to the public; and
          (iii) the covenants contained in this Section 7 will not involve a
          substantial hardship upon his future livelihood. In light of such
          acknowledgement, and in partial consideration of the several
          agreements made by Sybase with the Employee in the Merger Agreement
          and in order to induce the Surviving Corporation to enter into this
          Agreement and the Merger Agreement, the Employee covenants and agrees
          that:

          a)   NON-COMPETE. During the period of this employment by the
               Surviving Corporation under this Agreement and for 18 months
               following the termination of the Employee's employment for any
               reason, provided the Surviving Corporation is not in breach of
               its obligations under Section 5, the Employee shall not, directly
               or indirectly: (i) in any manner whatsoever engage in any
               capacity with any Restricted Business in a Restricted Territory
               (as such terms are defined below) for the Employee's own benefit
               or for the benefit of any Person other than the Surviving
               Corporation; or (ii) have any interest as owner, sole proprietor,
               shareholder, partner, lender, director, officer, manager,
               employee, consultant, agent or otherwise in any Restricted
               Business in a Restricted Territory; provided, however, that the
               Employee may hold, directly or indirectly, solely as an
               investment, not more than two percent (2%) of the outstanding
               securities of any person or entity which are listed on any
               national securities exchange or regularly traded in the
               over-the-counter market notwithstanding the fact that such person
               or entity is a Restricted Business in a Restricted Territory.

               "Restricted Business" shall mean (A) a business which is
               competitive with the Surviving Corporation's business engaged in
               by the Surviving Corporation at the date of his

Page 5

          termination of employment (the "Surviving Corporation's Business")
          and (B) Oracle Systems Corporation, Informix Corporation, the
          database product groups or organizations of Computer Associates, the
          database products groups or organizations of Microsoft Corporation
          and the database product groups or organizations of IBM.
          Notwithstanding the above, the Employee may become an employee of or
          consultant to or have an interest as owner, sole proprietor,
          shareholder, partner, lender, director, officer, manager, employee,
          consultant, agent or otherwise in a business unit of a larger
          enterprise which enterprise then has another business unit engaged
          in a business competitive with the Surviving Corporation's Business,
          provided that the business unit of the larger enterprise for which
          Employee provides services or in which he has an interest in neither
          (1) in a business competitive with the Surviving Corporation's
          Business and is located in a geographically separate location from
          the competitive business unit and the Employee has no responsibility
          and has no role whatsoever in the competing business unit nor (2) a
          company or business unit listed in clause B of this paragraph.

          "Restricted Territory" shall mean the larger of (i) the counties,
          cities and states of the United States of America and each political
          subdivision of Canada, Australia, Japan, each member of the European
          Economic Community and any other country in which the Surviving
          Corporation's products are sold or licensed during the term of the
          non-compete obligations or (ii) if (i) is found unenforceable, the
          countries, cities, states and political subdivisions of any country
          in which the Surviving Corporation's products are sold, distributed
          or licensed during the term of the non-compete obligations.

          The parties intend that the covenants contained in this Section 7(a)
          shall be construed as a series of separate covenants, one for each
          county, city, state and other political subdivision of each country
          in the Restricted Territory. Except for geographic coverage, each
          separate covenant shall be deemed identical in terms to the covenant
          contained in the preceding paragraphs. If, in any judicial
          proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce any of the separate
          covenants (or any part thereof) deemed included in said paragraphs,
          then such unenforceable covenant (or such part) shall be deemed
          eliminated from this Agreement for the purpose of those proceedings
          to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants
          (or portions thereof) to be enforced by such court. It is the intent
          of the parties that the covenants set forth herein be enforced to the
          maximum degree permitted by applicable law.

          In the event that the provisions of this Section 7(a) should ever be
          deemed to exceed the scope, time or geographic limitations of
          applicable law regarding covenants not to compete, then such
          provisions shall be reformed to the maximum scope, time or geographic
          limitations, as the case may be, permitted by applicable laws.

     b)   NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  Concurrently with the
          exception of this Agreement, the Employee shall enter into a
          Nondisclosure And Assignment of Inventions

Page 6

          Agreement in the form attached hereto.

     c)   NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES OF AND CONSULTANTS TO THE SURVIVING
          CORPORATION. During the period of his employment by the Surviving
          Corporation under this Agreement and for 18 months following the
          termination of the Employee's employment for any reason, the Employee
          shall not, directly or indirectly, initiate communications with,
          solicit, persuade, entice, induce or encourage any individual who is
          then or who has been within the preceding 12-month period, an
          employee of or consultant to the Surviving Corporation to terminate
          an employment or consulting relationship with the Surviving
          Corporation, as the case may be, or to become employed by or enter
          into a contract or other agreement with any other person, and the
          Employee shall not approach any such employee or consultant for any
          such purpose or authorize or knowingly approve the taking of any such
          actions by any other person.

     d)   NON-SOLICITATION OF CUSTOMERS. During the period of his employment by
          the Surviving Corporation under this Agreement and for 18 months
          following the termination of the Employee's employment for any
          reason, the Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit,
          persuade, entice, induce, encourage (or assist in connection with any
          of the foregoing) any person who is then or has been within the
          preceding 24-month period a customer or account of the Surviving
          Corporation, or any infomediary, affiliate, service provider or
          fulfillment entity that does business with the Surviving Corporation,
          or any actual customer leads whose identity the Employee learned
          during the course of his employment with the Surviving Corporation,
          to terminate or to adversely alter its contractual or other
          relationship with the Surviving Corporation.

     e)   RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UPON BREACH. If the Employee breaches, or
          threatens to commit a breach of, any of the provisions of this
          Section 7 (collectively, the "Restrictive Covenants"), the Surviving
          Corporation shall have the right and remedy to seek from any court of
          competent jurisdiction specific performance of the Restrictive
          Covenants or injunctive relief against any act which would violate
          any of the Restrictive Covenants, it being acknowledged and agreed
          that any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable
          injury to the Surviving Corporation and that money damages will not
          provide an adequate remedy to the Surviving Corporation.

     f)   REPRESENTATION OF THE EMPLOYEE. The Employee is (i) familiar with
          the covenants in this Section 7, (ii) is fully aware of his
          obligations hereunder, (iii) finds the length of time, scope and
          geographic coverage of these covenants to be reasonable, and (iv) is
          receiving specified, bargained-for consideration for these covenants.

8)   MISCELLANEOUS.

     b)   ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement contains the entire agreement
          between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
          supersedes all prior contracts and other agreements, written or oral,

     c)   WAIVERS AND AMENDMENTS. This Agreement may be amended, modified,
          superseded, cancelled, renewed or extended, and the terms and

          by the parties or, in the case of a waiver, by the party waiving
          compliance.

     d)   GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
          accordance with and subject to, the laws of the State of California
          without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.

     e)   ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement, and the Employee's rights and obligations
          hereunder, may not be assigned by the Employee. The Surviving
          Corporation may assign this Agreement

Page 8

          and its rights, together with its obligations, hereunder only in
          connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of all or
          substantially all of its assets or business, whether by merger,
          consolidation or otherwise. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit
          of and be binding upon the parties hereto and any successors and
          permitted assigns.

     f)   DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Agreement:

          (i)   "Affiliate" shall mean a Person that, directly or indirectly,
                controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with
                the Surviving Corporation;

          (ii)  "control" as used with respect to any Person, shall mean the
                possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or
                cause the direction of the management or policies, whether
                through ownership of voting securities, by contract or
                otherwise; and

          (iii) "Person" means an individual, sole proprietorship, partnership,
                corporation, association, joint stock Surviving Corporation,
                trust, joint venture, unincorporated organization, institution,
                entity or government (whether federal, state, local or otherwise
                including without limitation, or any department, agency, or
                political subdivision thereof).

     g)   COUNTERPARTS; FACSIMILE EXECUTION. This Agreement may be executed in
          two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original
          but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
          instrument. Facsimile execution and delivery of this Agreement is
          legal, valid and binding execution and delivery for all purposes.

     h)   HEADINGS. The headings in this Agreement are for reference purposes
          only and shall in no way affect the meaning or interpretation of this
          Agreement.

     i)   SURVIVAL. Sections 4(c), 5, 6, 7 and this Section 8 shall survive
          termination of this Agreement for any reason.

     j)   SEVERABILITY. To the extent any provision of this Agreement shall be
          invalid or unenforceable, it shall be considered deleted herefrom and
          the remainder of such provision and of this Agreement shall be
          unaffected and shall continue in full force and effect. In furtherance
          and not in limitation of the foregoing, should the duration of
          geographical extent of, or business activities covered by any
          provision of this Agreement be in excess of that which is valid and
          enforceable under applicable law, then such provision shall be
          construed to cover only that duration, extent or activities which may
          validly and enforceably be covered.

     k)   ADR. Except as provided herein, no civil action with respect to any
          dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this
          agreement may be commenced until the matter has been submitted to
          JAMS/ENDISPUTE, or its successor, for mediation. Either

Page 9

          party may commence mediation by providing to JAMS/ENDISPUTE and the
          other party a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject
          of the dispute and the relief requested. The parties will cooperate
          with JAMS/ENDISPUTE and with one another in selecting a mediator from
          JAMS/ENDISPUTE's panel of neutrals, and in scheduling the mediation
          proceedings. The parties covenant that they shall participate in the
          mediation in good faith, and that they shall share equally in its
          costs. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or
          written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties,
          their agents, employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator
          and any JAMS/ENDISPUTE employees, are confidential, privileged and
          inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any litigation
          or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that
          is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered
          inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the
          mediation. Either party may seek equitable relief prior to the
          mediation to preserve the status quo pending the completion of that
          process. Except for such an action to obtain equitable relief, neither
          party may commence a civil action with respect to the matters
          submitted to mediation until after the completion of the initial
          mediation session, or 45 days after the date of filing the written
          request for mediation, whichever occurs first. Mediation may continue
          after the commencement of a civil action, if the parties so desire.
          The provisions of this Clause may be enforced by any Court of
          competent jurisdiction, and the party seeking enforcement shall be
          entitled to an award of all costs, fees and expenses, including
          attorneys fees, to be paid by the party against whom enforcement is
          ordered.

     l)   SUPERCEDES OLD AGREEMENTS. Employee agrees that the terms of this
          Agreement supercede the terms of any and all employment arrangements
          he may have had with the Surviving Corporation in their entirety
          (except that that certain Agreement dated 2/19/01, 2001 shall
          survive). Employee agrees that Employee's decision to terminate such
          employment arrangements and enter into this Agreement does not
          constitute constructive termination of any employment arrangement
          Employee had with [NEON].

     m)   COSTS OF ENFORCEMENT OR DEFENSE. In the event of any litigation with
          respect to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
          be paid by the other party hereto all costs of enforcement or defense,
          as the case may be, paid or incurred in connection with the
          enforcement or defense, including reasonable attorneys fees and legal
          costs.

     n)   DELAYS OR OMISSIONS. No delay or omission to exercise any right, power
          or remedy accruing to either party upon any breach or default of the
          other party hereto shall impair any such right, power or remedy of
          such non-defaulting party, nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of
          any such breach or default or an acquiescence therein, or of or in any
          similar breach or default thereafter occurring; nor shall any waiver
          of a breach or default be deemed to be a waiver of any other breach or
          default.

Page 10

     o)   RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. Sybase and the Employee each acknowledge that
          they have been represented by competent counsel during the
          negotiation and execution of this Agreement and therefore waive the
          application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
          providing that ambiguities in any agreement will be construed against
          the party drafting the agreement.

     p)   CLOSING. This Agreement shall become effective at the time of the
          Closing on the Effective Date.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of
the date first above written.
