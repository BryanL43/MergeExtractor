NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

To Be Held June 7, 2001

          We will hold the annual meeting of stockholders of Data Critical Corporation, a Delaware corporation, at our

1.  

to consider a proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Data Critical common stock in the merger of Viper Acquisition
Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Data Critical, with and into VitalCom Inc., a Delaware corporation, in which, among other things:



each outstanding share of VitalCom common stock (other than shares held by stockholders who have properly exercised their
appraisal rights) will be exchanged for 0.62 shares of Data Critical common stock; and



Data Critical will assume VitalComs 1993 Stock Option Plan and 1996 Stock Option Plan and assume each option
outstanding under the VitalCom stock option plans.

2.  

to consider a proposal to amend the Data Critical Corporation 1999 Stock Option Plan to increase the total number of shares
of Data Critical common stock that can be issued under the plan;

3.  

to elect two Class II directors to the Data Critical board of directors, who will hold office until the third annual meeting
of stockholders following their election or until their successors are elected and qualified;

4.  

to ratify the Data Critical boards appointment of Arthur Andersen LLP as our independent public accountants;
and

5.  

such other business as may properly come before the annual meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the annual
meeting.

Data Criticals board of directors has determined that the merger is advisable and fair to, and in
the best interests of, Data Critical and its stockholders, has approved the merger and the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that you vote FOR approving the issuance of shares of Data Critical common stock in connection with
the merger. The board also recommends that you vote FOR amending the Data Critical Corporation 1999 Stock Option Plan, FOR electing the boards nominees for director and FOR ratifying the boards
appointment of Data Criticals independent public accountants.

          The Data Critical board of directors has fixed the close of business on May 4, 2001 as the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the annual meeting and any postponement or adjournment of the annual meeting. Only holders of record of Data Critical common stock at the close of business on the record date are
entitled to vote at the annual meeting. The directors elected will be the two candidates receiving the greatest number of votes cast, in person or by proxy, at the annual meeting. Approval of each of the other three proposals to be considered at the
annual meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of the Data Critical common stock present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting if a quorum is present.

returned a proxy.

May 9, 2001

          Dear Stockholder:

          We cordially invite you to attend a special meeting of the stockholders of VitalCom Inc., which will be held
on June 7, 2001, at 9:00 a.m. local time, at our headquarters at 15222 Del Amo Avenue, Tustin, California 92860.

          At the special meeting, you will be asked to approve a merger agreement that will combine our company with
Data Critical Corporation. In the merger, you will be entitled to receive 0.62 shares of Data Critical common stock for each share of VitalCom common stock you own.

          The Data Critical common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol DCCA.
The VitalCom common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Smallcap Market under the symbol VCOM.

          The merger cannot be completed unless the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of
VitalCom common stock as of the record date vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement. Holders of approximately 61% of the outstanding VitalCom common stock have executed voting agreements agreeing to vote their VitalCom shares in favor of
adopting the merger agreement. These VitalCom stockholders have also irrevocably appointed Data Critical representatives as proxies to vote their VitalCom shares in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. Consequently, the voting agreements
effectively ensure that the required approval by VitalCom stockholders will be obtained, regardless of whether or how other VitalCom stockholders vote their shares. This is true even if the VitalCom board of directors withdraws or modifies its
unanimous recommendation that VitalCom stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. Only holders of VitalCom common stock at the close of business on May 4, 2001 will be entitled to vote at the special meeting.

          VitalComs board of directors has determined that the merger is advisable and fair to, and in the best
interests of, VitalCom and its stockholders. The board of directors has approved the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that you vote FOR adopting the merger agreement.

          Attached is a notice of special meeting to stockholders and a joint proxy statement/prospectus, which
describes the merger in detail. For your convenience, the first two pages of the joint proxy statement/prospectus contain frequently asked questions and answers about the proposed merger. Please review the joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully.
In particular, you should carefully consider the discussion under the heading Risk Factors beginning on page 14.

          Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, please complete, sign and date the enclosed proxy card and
return it promptly in the enclosed postage-paid envelope to ensure that your shares are represented at the special meeting. Your stock will be voted in accordance with the instructions you give in your proxy. If you attend the special meeting, you
may vote in person if you wish, even if you have previously returned your proxy card.

Sincerely,

Frank T. Sample

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

To Be Held June 7, 2001

          We will hold a special meeting of stockholders of VitalCom Inc., a Delaware corporation, at our
headquarters, located at 15222 Del Amo Avenue, Tustin, California 92680 on June 7, 2001, at 9:00 a.m. local time for the following purposes:

1.  

To consider a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of March 12, 2001 by and among VitalCom, Data
Critical Corporation and Viper Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Data Critical, pursuant to which Viper Acquisition Corp. will merge with and into VitalCom. In the merger, VitalCom stockholders will receive 0.62 shares of Data Critical
common stock for each share of VitalCom common stock that they hold (other than those shares for which stockholders have properly exercised their appraisal rights), and VitalCom will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Data Critical; and

2.  

To transact such other business as may properly come before the special meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the
special meeting.

The VitalCom board of directors has determined that the merger is advisable and fair to, and in the best
interests of, VitalCom and its stockholders, has unanimously approved the merger and unanimously recommends that you vote FOR adopting the merger agreement.

          The VitalCom board of directors has fixed the close of business on May 4, 2001 as the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. Only holders of record of VitalCom common stock at the close of business on the record date are entitled
to vote at the special meeting. Adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of VitalCom common stock.

          Holders of approximately 61% of the outstanding VitalCom common stock have executed voting agreements
agreeing to vote their VitalCom shares in favor of adopting the merger agreement. These VitalCom stockholders have also irrevocably appointed Data Critical representatives as proxies to vote their VitalCom shares in favor of adopting the merger
agreement. Consequently, the voting agreements effectively ensure that the required approval by VitalCom stockholders will be obtained, regardless of whether or how other VitalCom stockholders vote their shares. This is true even if the VitalCom
board of directors withdraws or modifies its unanimous recommendation that VitalCom stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement.

          As a holder of VitalCom common stock, you have certain appraisal rights with respect to the proposed merger.
In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must not vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement. Your appraisal rights are governed by specific legal provisions contained in section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. A summary of
section 262 is included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus in the section entitled The Special Meeting of VitalCom StockholdersAppraisal rights. The complete text of section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law is
attached as Appendix D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. If VitalCom stockholders beneficially holding more than 10% of VitalCom common stock outstanding as of the VitalCom record date properly exercise their appraisal rights under Delaware
law, then Data Critical will not be obligated to complete the merger. However, Data Critical may nevertheless waive its right not to complete the merger if the 10% threshold is exceeded.

This notice constitutes notice of your appraisal rights as such notice is required under the Delaware
General Corporation Law.

            In considering whether to vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement, you should carefully read this
joint proxy statement/prospectus in its entirety. In particular, you should read the matters referred to under Risk Factors starting on page 14.

You are cordially invited to attend the special meeting. To ensure that you are represented at the
special meeting, however, we urge you to complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy as promptly as possible. We have enclosed a postage-paid envelope for that purpose. If you attend the special meeting, you may vote in person even if you
have returned your proxy card.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE DATA CRITICAL/VITALCOM MERGER

Q:  Why are Data Critical and VitalCom proposing to merge?

A:  The merger will bring two leaders in the wireless hospital communications market together into a single company that Data Critical and VitalCom believe
will enjoy the benefits of scale, superior technology, broader product offerings, a wider customer base and a lower cost structure. Data Critical has concentrated on decentralized wireless communications and has a number of distribution and
marketing arrangements with key industry participants. VitalCom has focused on the centralized monitoring market and has developed innovative technology with far-reaching application to the wireless hospital communications market. The companies
believe that by combining they will be better able to compete, take advantage of market opportunities, and serve the needs of their customers than either company could independently. The merger offers the opportunity to combine and leverage two
highly complementary product lines, technologies and customer bases to the combined companys benefit, while reducing overall costs by consolidating and reducing corporate overhead, corporate and regulatory compliance expenses, and engineering,
manufacturing, management and sales functionswith the ultimate goal of accelerating the path to profitability.

Q:  If I am a VitalCom stockholder, what will I receive in the merger?

A:  If the merger is completed, you will receive 0.62 shares of Data Critical common stock for each share of VitalCom common stock that you own (other than
shares for which you have properly exercised your appraisal rights).

Data Critical will not issue fractions of its shares to you in the merger. Instead, you will receive cash equal to the product of the applicable fraction multiplied by
the average of the last reported sales prices of Data Critical common stock for the last 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the effective date of the merger.

Q:  If I am a Data Critical stockholder, how will the merger affect me?

A:  While the merger will not directly affect your shares of Data Critical stock, your ownership percentage of the combined entity will be diluted. Based on
the capitalization of Data Critical on March 12, 2001, existing Data Critical stockholders will own approximately 70% of the combined company, and the former VitalCom stockholders will own approximately 30% of the combined company.

Q:  Will the exchange ratio change if the price of Data Critical common stock or VitalCom common stock fluctuates?

A:  No. The exchange ratio of 0.62 is fixed and will not be adjusted for any changes in the market price of either Data Critical common stock or VitalCom
common stock.

Q:  Will the shares of Data Critical common stock issued in the merger be freely transferable?

A:  All shares of Data Critical common stock received by VitalCom stockholders in the merger will be unrestricted and freely transferable, other than shares
received by VitalCom stockholders who are deemed to be affiliates of VitalCom or Data Critical. These affiliates will only be able to sell their shares in accordance with the resale restrictions of Rule 145 of the Securities Act.

Q:  What stockholder votes are required to complete the merger?

A:  A majority of the outstanding shares of VitalCom common stock entitled to vote must vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement. In addition, a
majority of the shares present in person or by proxy at the Data Critical annual meeting must vote in favor of issuing the Data Critical common stock to VitalCom stockholders in the merger.

 Holders of approximately 61% of the outstanding VitalCom common stock have executed voting agreements agreeing to vote their VitalCom shares in favor of adopting the
merger agreement. These VitalCom stockholders have also irrevocably appointed Data Critical representatives as proxies to vote their VitalCom shares in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. Consequently, the voting agreements effectively ensure
that the required approval by VitalCom stockholders will be obtained, regardless of whether or how other VitalCom stockholders vote their shares. This is true even if the VitalCom board of directors withdraws or modifies its unanimous recommendation
that VitalCom stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement.

Q:  How can I vote?

A:  After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, you should indicate on your proxy card how you
want to vote, and sign, date and mail the proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible so that your shares are represented at the VitalCom special meeting or Data Critical annual meeting.

Q:  Can I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?

A:  Yes. You may revoke your signed proxy at any time before it is voted at Data Criticals or VitalComs stockholders meeting. To revoke your proxy
you may execute and deliver a proxy with a later date or a written notice of revocation to the corporate secretary (or, if your proxy relates to shares of Data Critical common stock, the assistant secretary). You may also revoke your signed proxy by
attending the stockholder meeting and voting in person.

Q:  If my broker holds my shares in street name, will my broker vote my shares for me?

A:  Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote. You should instruct your broker to vote your shares according to the
directions your broker provides.

Q:  What will happen to my vote if I dont return or mark my proxy card?

A:  If you are a Data Critical stockholder and you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be counted
as a vote FOR the proposals presented at the meeting. If you are a Data Critical stockholder and you fail to return your proxy card, it will have no effect on the vote taken at the annual meeting.

If you are a VitalCom stockholder and you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote in favor
of adopting the merger agreement. If you are a VitalCom stockholder and you fail to return your proxy card, it will have the same effect as a vote against adopting the merger agreement.

Q:  Should VitalCom stockholders send in their stock certificates now?

A:  No. After the merger is completed, Data Critical or its exchange agent will send you written instructions for exchanging your VitalCom stock certificates
for Data Critical stock certificates.

Q:  When do you expect to complete the merger?

A:  Both companies are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. In addition to several other closing conditions, we must obtain approval
from the stockholders of both Data Critical and VitalCom before we can complete the merger. If we obtain all necessary approvals and the other closing conditions are satisfied, we hope to complete the merger in June 2001.

Q:  If I am a VitalCom stockholder, what are the tax consequences of the merger to me?

A:  In most cases, the exchange of shares by VitalCom stockholders will be tax-free for federal income tax purposes. However, you may have to
report a taxable gain or loss if, and to the extent that, you receive cash upon proper exercise of your appraisal rights or for fractional shares. To review the tax consequences to you and to VitalCom in more detail, see the discussion under the
heading The MergerMaterial U.S. federal income tax consequences beginning on page 73. You should also consult your tax advisor.

The Companies

Data Critical.
    Data Critical Corporation is a leader in the design,
manufacture, marketing and support of wireless health information communication systems for use by caregivers. Data Criticals technology enables access to patient-specific vital signs and other diagnostic data. Its systems transmit complex and
time-critical patient data over a wireless network and enable remote access through either its proprietary interactive device, a personal computer or the Internet. Its systems are designed to enhance the quality, cost effectiveness, efficiency,
safety and outcome of healthcare.

          Data Critical has derived substantially all its revenue from two operating segments, Hospital Systems and
Physician Systems. Data Criticals Hospital Systems use a wireless receiver or monitor to provide in-hospital caregivers with remote access to, and alarm notification of, current patient monitoring information. Data Criticals Physician
Systems provide physicians with remote and Internet access to comprehensive patient information through cell phones, pagers and handheld computers. Due to a recently announced restructuring of operations to focus on its core Hospital Systems
business, discussed further on page 45, Data Critical anticipates that the percentage of its revenue and expenses attributable to its Physician Systems will decrease. Additionally, Data Critical may elect to sell some or all of its Physician Systems
business in connection with, or as a result of, this restructuring.

          Data Critical was incorporated in Oklahoma in October 1992 under the name Intellicomm Corp. The company
changed its name to Data Critical Corporation in October 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in March 1998. Data Criticals principal executive offices are located at 19820 North Creek Parkway, Suite 100, Bothell, WA 98011, and its telephone
number is (425) 482-7000.

VitalCom.
    VitalCom Inc. is a leading developer of some of the countrys
largest open and wireless patient information networks for healthcare enterprises. VitalComs PatientNet system creates an enterprise-wide wireless infrastructure and collects patient information from other manufacturers monitoring and
bedside devices. The patient information is analyzed using sophisticated arrhythmia detection software. PatientNet provides caregivers with time-critical access to patient information, including notification of critical patient events in real time.
This information can be distributed via the Internet, a hospital-wide wireless local area network, or LAN, or a hospital intranet. A wide area network, or WAN, can be used to link multiple hospital facilities to information in the PatientNet
system.

          VitalCom was incorporated in California in June 1992 under the name Pacific Communications, Inc. The company
changed its name to New PCI, Inc. and reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992. In December 1995, New PCI, Inc. merged with ACCUCORE, Inc., a Delaware corporation. ACCUCORE changed its name to VitalCom Inc. in January 1996. VitalComs
principal executive offices are located at 15222 Del Amo Avenue, Tustin, CA 92680, and its telephone number is (714) 546-0147.

The Stockholder Meetings

The Data Critical annual meeting (see page 38 and page 102).

          The annual meeting of Data Critical stockholders will be held at Data Criticals headquarters, located
at 19820 North Creek Parkway, Suite 100, Bothell, Washington on June 7, 2001 at 9:00 a.m. local time. At the annual meeting, Data Critical will ask its stockholders to:



approve the issuance of shares of Data Critical common stock in the merger.

          This proposal is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Data Critical merger proposal.
In addition to the Data Critical merger proposal, at the annual meeting Data Critical stockholders will consider and vote on proposals to:



increase the total number of shares of Data Critical common stock that can be issued under the 1999 Data Critical Stock
Option Plan;



elect two Class II directors; and



confirm the appointment of its independent auditors.

          Data Critical stockholders may also consider and vote on such other matters as may be properly brought
before the annual meeting.

Data Critical record date and voting power (see page 39).

          Only holders of record of Data Critical common stock at the close of business on May 4, 2001, the record
date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the annual meeting. There were approximately 181 holders of record of Data Critical common stock at the close of business on the record date, with approximately 11,949,323 shares of Data Critical common
stock issued and outstanding. Each stockholder of record of Data Critical common stock is entitled to cast one vote per share on each matter submitted for stockholder approval.

Data Critical vote required (see page 39).

          The two nominees for director who receive the most votes at the annual meeting will be elected. Approval of
each of the other three proposals to be presented at the annual meeting, including the proposal to approve the issuance of Data Critical common stock in the merger, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of all shares of Data Critical common
stock present, in person or by proxy, at the Data Critical annual meeting.

          As of the record date, the directors and executive officers of Data Critical owned approximately 1,272,712,
or 10.7%, of the outstanding shares of Data Critical common stock entitled to vote at the annual meeting.

The VitalCom special meeting (see page 41).

          The special meeting of VitalCom stockholders will be held at VitalComs headquarters, located at 15222
Del Amo Avenue, Tustin, California, on June 7, 2001 at 9:00 a.m. local time. At the special meeting, VitalCom will ask its stockholders to adopt the merger agreement.

          VitalCom stockholders may also consider and vote on such other matters as may be properly brought before the
special meeting.

VitalCom record date and voting power (see page 41).

          Only holders of record of VitalCom common stock at the close of business on May 4, 2001, the record date,
are entitled to notice of and to vote at the VitalCom special meeting. There were approximately 44 holders of record of VitalCom common stock at the close of business on the record date, with approximately 8,330,933 shares of VitalCom common stock
issued and outstanding. Each stockholder of VitalCom common stock is entitled to cast one vote per share on each matter submitted for stockholder approval.

VitalCom vote required (see page 41).

          Adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of all shares of VitalCom
common stock outstanding on the record date.

            As of the record date, the directors and executive officers of VitalCom owned approximately 4,927,698, or
59.1%, of the outstanding shares of VitalCom common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting.

Voting agreements (see page 42 and page 76).

          Several VitalCom stockholders have entered into voting agreements with Data Critical, in which they agreed
to vote their shares of VitalCom common stock in favor of adopting the merger agreement. They also granted irrevocable proxies to executive officers of Data Critical to vote their shares of VitalCom common stock at the special meeting. Approximately
4,921,230 shares of VitalCom common stock, or approximately 61% of the outstanding shares, are subject to the voting agreements and irrevocable proxies. Consequently, the voting agreements effectively ensure that the required approval by VitalCom
stockholders will be obtained, regardless of whether or how other VitalCom stockholders vote their shares. This is true even if the VitalCom board of directors withdraws or modifies its unanimous recommendation that VitalCom stockholders vote in
favor of adoption of the merger agreement.

The Merger

Ownership and existence of VitalCom after the merger (see page 51).

          If the merger is completed, Viper Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Data Critical, also
referred to as Viper, will merge with and into VitalCom. VitalCom will survive as a wholly owned subsidiary of Data Critical. Each stockholder that owned common stock in VitalCom before the merger (other than those who properly exercise their
appraisal rights under Delaware law), will receive Data Critical common stock in the merger.

Management and operations following the merger (see page 51).

          Before the merger, Data Criticals board of directors consisted of seven members. After the merger, it
will consist of eight members. Frank T. Sample, president, chief executive officer and chairman of the board of VitalCom, will join the Data Critical board of directors. Elizabeth H. Weatherman, a designee of Warburg, Pincus Ventures, L.P., will
also join the Data Critical board of directors. One member of Data Criticals current board of directors, George M. Middlemas, will resign upon the effective time of the merger. Mr. Sample will become the vice chairman of Data Critical and
group president of VitalCom following the merger. Additional announcements regarding the specific composition of Data Criticals management team will follow.

What VitalCom stockholders will receive (see page 77).

          Based on VitalComs capitalization on March 12, 2001, the last trading day before the announcement of
the merger, VitalCom stockholders will receive a total of approximately 5,125,180 shares of Data Critical common stock in the merger. This is equal to 0.62 shares of Data Critical common stock for each outstanding share of VitalCom common
stock.

          VitalCom stockholders will not receive fractional shares. Instead, each VitalCom stockholder otherwise
entitled to a fraction of a share of Data Critical common stock will receive cash. The amount of cash will be equal to the product of the fraction multiplied by the average closing price of Data Critical common stock for the 20 consecutive trading
days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the effective time of the merger.

          Based on Data Criticals capitalization on March 12, 2001, the holders of VitalCom common stock will
hold approximately 30% of the total number of shares of Data Critical common stock outstanding immediately after completion of the merger.

If you are a VitalCom stockholder, do not send in your VitalCom stock certificates until instructed to do
so after the merger is completed. After the merger is completed Data Critical or its exchange agent will instruct VitalCom stockholders how to exchange their VitalCom stock certificates.

          If you are a Data Critical stockholder, you will keep your existing Data Critical stock
certificates.

Interests of VitalCom officers and directors in the merger (see page 71).

          In considering the VitalCom board of directors recommendation that you vote FOR the
adoption of the merger agreement, you should be aware that some officers and directors of VitalCom have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests. These interests involve employment agreements, consulting
arrangements, accelerated vesting of stock options, incentive payments, severance plans and post-merger indemnification by Data Critical.

Conditions to the merger (see page 88).

          The obligations of Data Critical and VitalCom to complete the merger are contingent on a number of
conditions described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus being satisfied or waived.

Termination of the merger agreement; termination fees (see page 90).

          Data Critical and VitalCom may terminate the merger agreement under a number of circumstances
described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. If Data Critical terminates the merger agreement because its board (1) withdraws its recommendation or (2) approves an offer to participate in a different transaction that precludes the merger,
Data Critical will be required to pay VitalCom a termination fee of $500,000. If VitalCom terminates the merger agreement because (1) its board withdraws its recommendation, (2) VitalCom signs a letter of intent with another potential acquirer or
(3) VitalCom breaches its agreement not to solicit other buyers, VitalCom will be required to pay Data Critical a termination fee of $500,000. In addition, if VitalCom completes a merger with another party within one year after termination of its
merger agreement with Data Critical, it will be required to pay Data Critical $1,000,000 minus any previously paid termination fee.

Completion of the merger.

          Assuming that both Data Critical and VitalCom satisfy or waive all of the conditions to effectiveness of the
merger, Data Critical and VitalCom currently anticipate that the merger will be completed in June 2001.

Accounting treatment (see page 75).

          The merger will be accounted for as a purchase.

Opinions of financial advisors (see page 58).

          Data Critical retained U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray to provide financial advice with respect to the merger and
render an opinion as to the fairness of the merger consideration, from a financial point of view, to Data Critical. On March 12, 2001, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray rendered its oral opinion (subsequently confirmed in writing) to the Data Critical
board of directors that the merger consideration to be paid by Data Critical to VitalCom stockholders in the merger is fair, from a financial point of view to Data Critical.

          VitalCom retained Pinnacle Partners, Inc. to provide financial advice with respect to the merger and render
an opinion as to the fairness of the exchange ratio in the merger, from a financial point of view, to VitalComs stockholders. On March 12, 2001, Pinnacle Partners, Inc., rendered its oral opinion (subsequently affirmed in writing) to the
VitalCom board of directors that the exchange ratio in the merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to VitalComs stockholders.

          The final opinions of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and Pinnacle Partners, Inc. are attached as Appendices B
and C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 
We encourage you to read these opinions. These opinions address only the fairness of the merger consideration to Data Critical and the exchange ratio to VitalCom stockholders from a financial point
of view, and you should not consider them a recommendation as to how you should vote.

Material U.S. federal income tax consequences (see page 73).

VitalCom stockholders.    
The merger has been structured so that most VitalCom
stockholders will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the merger, except for tax payable because of cash received by VitalCom stockholders instead of fractional shares of Data Critical common stock or pursuant to
their appraisal rights.

Data Critical stockholders.    
The merger will not be a taxable event for Data
Critical stockholders.

Appraisal rights (see page 42).

VitalCom stockholders.
    Under Delaware law, VitalCom stockholders who do not
vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger and to receive the fair value of their shares in cash rather than shares of Data Critical common stock as specified in the merger
agreement. If you properly request appraisal, the fair value of your shares will be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and may be less than or greater than the value of the consideration to be paid to VitalCom stockholders who do not seek
appraisal. This right to appraisal is subject to a number of restrictions and technical requirements. If you fail to strictly comply with all of the restrictions and requirements, you will lose
your appraisal rights. Generally, in order to exercise your appraisal rights you must:



send a written demand to VitalCom for appraisal in compliance with the Delaware General Corporation Law 
before
 the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement is voted on;



not vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement; and



continuously hold your VitalCom common stock from the date you make the demand for appraisal through the completion of the
merger.

Merely voting against the merger will not protect your rights to an appraisal. The requirements under
Delaware law for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled The Special Meeting of VitalCom StockholdersAppraisal Rights beginning on page 42. The
complete text of section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law is attached as Appendix D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

          If you vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement, you will waive your rights to seek appraisal of your
shares of VitalCom common stock under Delaware law.

          If VitalCom stockholders beneficially holding more than 10% of VitalCom common stock outstanding as of the
VitalCom record date properly exercise their appraisal rights under Delaware law, then Data Critical will not be obligated to complete the merger. However, Data Critical may nevertheless waive its right not to complete the merger if the 10%
threshold is exceeded.

Data Critical stockholders.
    Under Delaware law, Data Critical stockholders are
not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

Listing of Data Critical common stock

          The shares of Data Critical common stock to be issued in the merger will be listed on the Nasdaq National
Market.

COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

          The following table sets forth:



unaudited historical basic and diluted loss and book value per share data of Data Critical and VitalCom as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2000;



unaudited pro forma consolidated basic and diluted net loss and book value per share data of Data Critical and VitalCom after
giving effect to the merger as a purchase, based on an exchange ratio of 0.62 and resulting in 5,125,180 shares of Data Critical common stock to be issued in exchange for outstanding shares of VitalCom common stock in the merger;



unaudited equivalent pro forma consolidated basic and diluted net loss and book value per share data is based upon Data
Criticals unaudited pro forma per share data as of and for the year ended December 31, 2000.

          You should read this information along with the selected historical financial information, the unaudited pro
forma condensed combining financial statements, the separate consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements of Data Critical and VitalCom included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

          The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data, while helpful in illustrating the financial
characteristics of the combined company under one set of assumptions, are not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have been achieved if Data Critical and VitalCom had completed the merger at the beginning
of the periods presented and you should not construe the data as representative of future operating results of the combined company. The pro forma data do not reflect any costs associated with the integration and consolidation of the companies
anticipated by the management of Data Critical.

under the symbol DCCA. There will no longer be any public market for VitalCom common stock.

          Neither Data Critical nor VitalCom has ever declared or paid cash dividends on shares of its common stock.
Data Critical has a general policy to retain earnings for use in its business. The actual prices of shares of Data Critical and VitalCom common stock fluctuate continuously and we cannot guarantee or predict the Data Critical and VitalCom prices per
share up to or at the time they complete the merger.

RISK FACTORS

The merger involves a high degree of risk. Also, by voting in favor of adoption of the merger agreement,
VitalCom stockholders will be choosing to invest in Data Critical common stock. An investment in Data Critical common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider the following risk factors in evaluating whether to adopt the merger
agreement (or, in the case of Data Critical stockholders, in evaluating whether to vote in favor of the issuance of shares of Data Critical common stock in connection with the merger). You should consider these factors in conjunction with the other
information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the appendices to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. If any of the following risks actually occur, the business, financial condition and results of operations of either or both
of Data Critical and VitalCom may be harmed. In such case, the trading price of Data Critical common stock may decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.

Risks related to the merger

Integration of operations will be complex, time consuming and expensive and may harm the results of operations of the combined company.

          The anticipated benefits of the merger will depend in part on whether Data Critical and VitalCom can
integrate their operations in an efficient and effective manner. Successful integration will require favorably combining each companys:



business culture and management style;



business operations, including manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution operations;



strategic business goals;



business development efforts;



geographically separate facilities; and



research and development efforts.

          The combined company may not accomplish this integration successfully. The diversion of managements
attention to the integration effort and any difficulty encountered in combining operations could cause the interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of either or both of the companies businesses. Furthermore, employee morale
may suffer, and the combined company may have difficulty retaining key engineers, managers and other employees. Finally, even if integration is successful, the combined company may not achieve the cost savings originally expected or intended as a
result of the merger. If the combined company cannot successfully accomplish integration of Data Criticals and VitalComs operations efficiently or effectively, the combined companys business will be harmed.

The merger will result in costs of integration and transaction expenses that could harm combined financial results.

          If the benefits of the merger do not exceed the costs of the merger, including the dilution to the Data
Critical stockholders resulting from the issuance of shares of Data Critical common stock in the merger, Data Criticals financial results, including earnings per share, could be harmed. Data Critical and VitalCom estimate that they will incur
aggregate direct transaction costs of approximately $2.1 million associated with the merger and related severance costs of approximately $0.3 million. Data Critical also will incur integration costs after completion of the merger.

          Actual costs may substantially exceed Data Criticals expectations. In addition, unanticipated expenses
associated with integrating the two companies may arise. As a result, Data Criticals business may be harmed. Data Critical expects to incur a non-cash charge, currently estimated to be $1.8 million, in the second quarter of 2001 to reflect
Data Criticals write-off of VitalComs in-process research and development efforts. Data Critical may also incur additional charges in subsequent quarters to reflect costs associated with the merger.

The combined company will need additional capital, and its ability to secure additional funding is uncertain.

          The combined company will require substantial capital resources to conduct its operations. The combined
companys future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:



the time and costs involved in completing the merger and integrating the two companies;



the ability of the combined company to expand its product line and increase sales;



the costs involved in developing, acquiring or licensing new technologies and products;



the ability of the combined company to maintain and establish corporate partnerships, distribution channels and licensing
arrangements;



the ability of the combined company to respond to competitive pressures;



the ability of the combined company to realize long-term cost savings as a result of the merger;



the costs involved in developing or acquiring complementary businesses;



the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims;



the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products;



the time and costs involved in taking advantage of unexpected opportunities; and



other factors not within the combined companys control.

          Data Critical and VitalCom expect that the combined companys cash resources on completion of the
merger will be sufficient to meet planned capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, if these cash resources and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy working capital and capital expenditure requirements, the
combined company may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. Additional capital may be unavailable on satisfactory terms, if at all. The failure to raise additional capital on acceptable terms
when needed would require the combined company to scale back operations, reduce its work force and sell or license technology it would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize itself. The inability to raise adequate additional capital in a timely
manner could force the combined company to forgo business opportunities, curtail product and business development or even cease operations.

The fixed exchange ratio may lessen the consideration being paid to VitalCom stockholders in the merger or, conversely, may result in Data Critical paying more in
the merger than originally expected.

          Each outstanding share of VitalCom common stock, other than shares held by VitalCom stockholders who have
properly exercised their appraisal rights, will convert into 0.62 shares of Data Critical common stock on completion of the merger. This exchange ratio will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either Data Critical common stock or
VitalCom common stock prior to completion of the merger. The market price of Data Critical common stock may vary significantly between now and the completion of the merger. If the market price for Data Critical common stock increases or decreases
before completion of the merger, the

market value of the Data Critical common stock issued in the merger would correspondingly increase or decrease. VitalCom stockholders will not be compensated for decreases in the market price of Data Critical common stock. Similarly, Data Critical
will not receive any extra benefit for increases in the market price of Data Critical common stock, and instead may be required to recognize additional goodwill, which would reduce the combined companys future financial results, including
earnings per share.

The issuance of Data Critical common stock in the merger will dilute the interest of current stockholders and could reduce the financial performance of the
combined company on a per share basis.

          After the merger is completed, current holders of Data Critical common stock will own a smaller percentage
of Data Critical and its voting stock than they currently own. VitalCom stockholders will own a smaller percentage of Data Critical than they currently own of VitalCom. Consequently, both Data Critical and VitalCom stockholders will be less able to
exercise influence over company management and policies than they were before the merger. In addition, the issuance of Data Critical common stock in the merger may reduce Data Criticals net income per share from anticipated levels, and could
reduce the market price of Data Critical common stock unless the combined company can achieve revenue growth or cost savings sufficient to offset the dilutive effect of the issuance.

The merger will result in a change of control of management of VitalCom and may adversely affect the returns of VitalCom stockholders.

          As a result of the merger, VitalCom stockholders will lose the chance to invest in the development and
exploitation of VitalComs products on a stand-alone basis. Additionally, the combined company will have different management than VitalComs current management. The management of the combined company may make strategic and operational
decisions different from those of VitalComs current management. The combined company may not achieve financial results equal or superior to the financial results that VitalCom would have achieved had the companies remained independent.
Accordingly, stockholders of VitalCom may suffer lower returns on their investment as a result of the merger.

If VitalCom stockholders who have agreed not to sell their Data Critical common stock for 90 days after the merger sell some or all of their shares, Data
Criticals stock price may suffer.

          Some VitalCom stockholders have agreed, as part of their voting agreements with Data Critical, not to sell
the Data Critical common stock they receive in the merger for 90 days after the merger. At the end of this period, these holders will be able to sell their Data Critical common stock to the public. Sales of any significant portion of these shares in
the public market after the restrictive period, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of Data Critical common stock to decrease.

The market price of Data Critical common stock may decrease as a result of the merger.

          The market price of Data Critical common stock may decrease significantly if, among other
things:



the integration of Data Criticals and VitalComs operations is unsuccessful;



the combined company does not experience business synergies quickly, or to the extent expected by financial
analysts;



accounting rules do not permit the combined company to immediately write off a significant amount of the purchase price of
the merger as attributable to in-process research and development; or



the increased asset value of the combined company as a result of the merger does not meet the expectations of financial
analysts.

          If the market price of Data Critical common stock decreases, you may lose all or part of your
investment.

The combined companys products may compete with the products of current Data Critical strategic partners, which could result in conflict and reduced
revenues.

          VitalComs existing products compete with the products of several companies, including Agilent
Technologies, Inc., from whom Data Critical currently derives substantial revenues. Thus, as a result of the merger, the combined company will be competing directly with at least one of its largest customers. Agilent may elect to end its
relationship with Data Critical or, alternately, reduce the volume of products it purchases in response to the competitive pressures between Agilent and the combined company. If this happens, the combined companys revenues and results of
operations will suffer.

Data Criticals proprietary technology may be incompatible with VitalComs technology.

          Both Data Critical and VitalCom believe that combining technologies of the two companies will enable the
combined company to develop products that are technologically superior to those of its competitors. However, the technologies of the two companies, when combined, may not yield any technological advances. In addition, if the technologies of the two
companies are not readily compatible, or are incompatible, then the combined company may experience substantial delays in, or impediments to, integrating their technologies and introducing new products. This may result in excess costs or customer
defections, and the combined company may lose any technological advantage that it has or had over its competitors. If this happens, the revenues and results of operations of the combined company will be harmed.

Even if Data Critical and VitalCom are successful in combining their technologies, the business of the combined company will be unsuccessful if new technologies
and related products are rejected by the marketplace.

          The combined companys success depends upon hospitals accepting its products. Even if Data Critical and
VitalCom are successful in combining their technologies, the marketplace may reject products and technologies that are new to the marketplace. The marketplace may be reluctant to use the combined companys information delivery systems because
of negative assumptions or perceptions regarding its products and technologies. If the combined company is unable to create or maintain a market for new products, its business will be harmed.

The combined company will inherit the risks of both Data Critical and VitalCom as such risks existed before the merger.

          VitalCom will represent a substantial portion of the operations, businesses and results of the combined
company. As a result, the combined company will be susceptible to the risks identified below in this joint proxy statement/prospectus related to each of Data Critical and VitalCom. The occurrence of any of the risks identified with respect to either
Data Critical or VitalCom will likely result in harm to the combined company.

Risks related to Data Critical

Data Critical has incurred losses since inception and may never be profitable, which could result in a decline in the value of its common stock and a loss of your
investment.

          Data Critical expects to continue to incur operating losses through the end of 2001, and possibly longer.
Data Critical experienced net losses of $8.6 million from inception through December 31, 1997, $5.8 million in 1998, $6.8 million in 1999 and an additional $13.9 million in 2000. As of December 31, 2000, Data Criticals accumulated deficit was
approximately $39.0 million. Data Critical anticipates incurring significant marketing, product development and general and administrative expenses and, as a result, Data Critical will need to generate significantly higher revenue to achieve and
sustain profitability. Data Critical may never earn profits

and, if the company does become profitable, it may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. As a result, the market price of Data Criticals stock may decline.

Data Criticals inability to maintain or expand sales of StatView or its other Hospital Systems will reduce its revenue.

          During 1998 and 1999, all of Data Criticals revenue was derived from sales of its Hospital Systems. A
substantial portion of these sales came from sales of StatView. During 2000, approximately 90% of Data Criticals total revenue was derived from sales of its Hospital Systems and approximately 76% of its total revenue was attributable to sales
of StatView. As a result of its recently announced restructuring, Data Critical expects sales of its Hospital Systems will represent an even greater percentage of its total revenue. Any factors that reduce the pricing of, demand for or market
acceptance of StatView or Data Criticals other Hospital Systems, including competition or technological change, could significantly reduce Data Criticals revenue and harm its business.

Data Criticals business may fail if Medtronic Physio-Control or Agilent do not successfully perform their agreements with Data Critical.

          By entering into its distribution agreement with Medtronic Physio-Control and its new license agreement with
Agilent, Data Critical now relies on these two companies for sales and installations of most of its Hospital Systems. Prior to this change, direct sales of Data Criticals three key productsStatView, AlarmView and FlexViewaccounted
for the majority of the total sales of Data Criticals Hospital Systems. These sales equaled 68% of total sales for 2000. Consistent with Data Criticals new distribution model, Data Critical transferred substantially all of its Hospital
Systems sales and installation force to Medtronic Physio-Control.

          Pursuant to Data Criticals agreement with Medtronic Physio-Control, Medtronic Physio-Control has
agreed to:



integrate Data Criticals Hospital System sales force with Medtronic Physio-Controls existing sales
force;



train the existing Medtronic Physio-Control sales force to sell Data Criticals Hospital Systems, including StatView,
AlarmView and FlexView;



market and distribute Data Criticals products, including StatView, AlarmView and FlexView;



include Data Criticals products in international sales and marketing programs;



include Data Criticals products in Medtronic Physio-Controls national accounts contracts, which provide access to
large national hospital chains;



include Data Criticals products in the global healthcare exchange, an on-line marketplace for medical devices and
healthcare products;



provide installation and field services for Data Criticals Hospital Systems; and



meet minimum sales and end-user distribution levels.

          If Medtronic Physio-Control and Agilent do not successfully perform, Data Critical will need to rebuild its
direct sales and installation forces or find a new distributor to sell and install its products. If Data Critical is unsuccessful in rebuilding its sales force or in finding alternate means to distribute and install its products, its business will
fail.

Because Data Criticals existing capital resources may be insufficient to fund its product and business development efforts, it may have to curtail or cease
operations.

          Although Data Critical expects that its current cash resources are sufficient to meet its planned capital
requirements for at least the next 12 months, Data Critical may need to raise additional capital sooner than presently anticipated to:



support expansion;



develop new or enhanced systems;



respond to competitive pressures;



acquire complementary businesses or technologies; or



take advantage of other unanticipated opportunities.

          If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy Data Criticals working capital and
capital expenditure requirements, Data Critical may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. Additional capital, if needed, may be unavailable on satisfactory terms, if at all. Data
Criticals failure to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed would require the company to scale back its operations, reduce its work force and sell or license to others technology it would otherwise seek to develop or
commercialize itself. Data Criticals inability to raise adequate additional capital in a timely manner could force the company to forego business opportunities, curtail its development or even cease operations.

Data Criticals competing methods of distributing its Hospital Systems may cause conflicts among its partners and distributors and confusion of the end-user,
resulting in harm to its business.

          Data Critical distributes its Hospital Systems both through its distribution partners and its OEM partners.
In some cases these two channels compete for sales to the same end customers. These conflicts could lead to disputes between Data Criticals partners, disputes between the company and its partners and confusion of the end customer. Data
Criticals failure to manage these issues successfully could result in harm to Data Criticals distribution process and reduce its revenues.

If Agilent or Medtronic Physio-Control fail to distribute Data Criticals products to their customers, Data Critical could receive reduced minimum payment
guaranties or its relationships with those companies could end, resulting in significant harm to its business.

          Under their agreements with Data Critical, Medtronic Physio-Control and Agilent guaranty Data Critical
minimum quarterly revenues. If either company fails to meet those minimums through sales to its customers in any quarter, it is obligated to meet its minimums by purchasing product from Data Critical for its own account.

          Under Data Criticals license agreement with Agilent, Data Critical has agreed to the amount of the
minimums for each quarter of 2001 and 2002. The parties have agreed to renegotiate minimums annually thereafter. If the parties fail to agree on minimums for any subsequent period, the license arrangement may cease to be exclusive and the guarantied
payment obligation will be terminated.

          Under the Medtronic Physio-Control distribution agreement, the guarantied obligations are renegotiated
annually for periods after 2001 to levels reflective of actual historical sales by Medtronic Physio-Control to its customers. The Medtronic Physio-Control agreement allows Data Critical to terminate the agreement in the event that Medtronic
Physio-Control fails to sell a specified percentage of its minimum sales obligations to its customers in two consecutive quarters. This minimum end-user distribution percentage target was not met in the first quarter of 2001.

          Pursuant to these provisions related to minimum obligations, the minimum payment obligations of Agilent and
Medtronic Physio-Control to Data Critical may be reduced or, in the case of Medtronic Physio-Control, the agreement terminated by Data Critical. If this happens and Data Critical is unable to find an alternate means to distribute and install its
products and services, its business will fail.

If Data Criticals relationships with its strategic corporate partners are not successful, its business will be harmed.

          Data Critical depends on several of its partners for key functions, such as sales and distribution of its
products. From time to time, Data Critical may disagree with its partners on business strategy, product development or the interpretation and performance of contracts. Data Criticals key distribution partners, such as Medtronic Physio-Control,
Agilent and Tyco, have substantially more resources than Data Critical. Data Critical is more dependent on these relationships than are its key partners. Because of these disparities, Data Critical may be:



unable to fully enforce its rights under its agreements with its partners;



forced to settle contract disputes in a manner adverse to Data Critical;



forced to renegotiate key terms of its agreements, such as pricing and minimum sales requirements; and



unable to replace services provided to Data Critical by its partners if these relationships fail.

          If Data Critical is unable to successfully manage its relationships with its partners, its business will be
unsuccessful.

Data Criticals quarterly financial results are likely to fluctuate and are not an indication of the companys future performance.

          Data Criticals revenue in any quarter depends significantly on the timing of systems shipped and
installations completed. Any unexpected delays or cancellations of shipments or installations at the end of a quarter could substantially reduce revenue in that quarter, hurt its revenue and impair its business in future periods. Because Data
Critical does not know when, or if, its potential customers will place orders, finalize contracts and permit installation, the company cannot accurately predict revenue and profitability for future quarters. In addition, Data Critical receives
higher revenue and gross margin on direct sales, including those made through its alliances with strategic partners, than it does on OEM sales. Consequently, the mix of sales between distribution channels will have a significant impact on quarterly
and annual revenue and profitability.

          Because the market for Data Criticals products is new and evolving, it is very difficult to predict
future financial results. Data Critical plans to significantly increase its marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses in 2001. Data Criticals expenses are partially based on its expectations regarding future
revenues, and are largely fixed in nature, particularly in the short term. As a result, if its revenues in a period do not meet its expectations, its stock price will likely suffer.

          As a result of Data Criticals distribution alliances with Medtronic Physio-Control and Agilent, and
the significant role each company plays in distributing its products, its quarterly financial results are likely to fluctuate based on the sales of its products made by these companies.

          Data Critical believes that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of its financial statements are not meaningful.
It is likely that in future quarters Data Criticals revenue and earnings may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors and, as a result, the price of its common stock may decline. Data Criticals revenue and earnings
have varied in the past, and Data Critical expects that they will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.

Failure to complete the merger could harm Data Criticals stock price and business.

          If the merger is not completed, Data Critical may be subject to a number of risks, including the
following:



if the current market price of Data Critical common stock reflects an assumption by the market that the merger will occur,
then the price of Data Critical common stock may decline;



Data Critical may be required to pay VitalCom a termination fee as described below in Terms of the
MergerExpenses; Termination Fees;



various costs related to the merger, such as legal and accounting fees and the expenses and fairness opinion fees of Data
Criticals financial advisor, must be paid even if the merger is not completed; and



it might be difficult for Data Critical to enter into a transaction similar to the merger or to otherwise make acquisitions
for a period of time.

          If any of these risks occur, Data Criticals stock price and business may be harmed.

Data Criticals business will be unsuccessful if its technology and products are rejected by the marketplace.

          Data Criticals success depends on hospitals accepting its products. The marketplace may reject Data
Criticals methods of wirelessly transmitting time-critical patient data through networked or non-networked monitoring equipment. The wireless transmission of time-critical patient data is new to the marketplace. The marketplace may be
reluctant to use Data Criticals information delivery systems because of negative assumptions or perceptions regarding the reliability, accuracy, security and safety of transmitting complex and time-critical patient data over wireless devices.
If Data Critical is unable to create or maintain a market for its products, its business will fail.

          Additionally, acceptance of Data Criticals products requires a fundamental change in the way medical
information is communicated and managed by doctors and patients. Physicians may be unwilling to administer healthcare remotely or to integrate Data Criticals products into their daily office workflow. The marketplace may reject the use of
wireless technology to transmit personal or sensitive patient information. If this happens, Data Criticals business may suffer.

Data Critical depends on third-party single-source and limited-source suppliers for necessary components for its Hospital Systems, which could impede its ability
to supply product and harm its business.

          Data Critical uses third-party suppliers and manufacturers to purchase necessary components and to
manufacture and test key parts of its Hospital Systems, including the StatView receiver and the AlarmView transmitter. Certain components, including the bitmap display, are presently only available from a single source. Other parts and components
that Data Critical relies on are available from limited sources. Because Data Criticals choice of suppliers is limited, it may be unable to obtain key components in sufficient quantities, if at all, or at commercially reasonable prices. If
this happens:



Data Criticals manufacturing costs could increase;



its delivery of finished product could be delayed;



customers could delay payment or cancel orders; and



its production process could become economically unfeasible;

possibly resulting in declining revenues and harm to its business.

Data Criticals business will be harmed if it is unable to keep pace with technological innovation in its industry.

          The industries in which Data Critical operates are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in
end-user preferences and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render its existing
systems and proprietary technology obsolete. Data Criticals success depends, in part, on its ability to continue to enhance its existing systems and to develop new systems that meet the changing needs of its customers. If Data Critical is
unable to develop and introduce in a timely manner new and enhanced systems that incorporate the latest developments in medical equipment and wireless communications technologies, its sales will be harmed. The pace of change in information-dependent
markets, such as the healthcare industry, is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards. Data Critical may be unsuccessful in responding to technological developments and changing customer needs. In
addition, Data Criticals systems may become obsolete due to the adoption of new technologies or standards by its customers or competitors. Data Critical has experienced development delays in the past and may experience similar or more
significant delays in the future. Difficulties in system development could materially delay or even prevent the successful introduction or marketing of new or enhanced systems, which could substantially harm Data Criticals business. Data
Criticals inability to successfully develop, introduce and market new or enhanced products or services may harm its business.

If Data Critical is unable to successfully integrate the companies and businesses that it has acquired or may in the future acquire, its business may
suffer.

          Data Critical acquired the businesses of Physix in 1999 and Elixis and Paceart in 2000. In March 2001, Data
Critical agreed to acquire VitalCom. Data Critical may make additional acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including:



difficulties in integrating the operations, products, management and employees of the companies involved;



loss of key employees;



disruption of Data Criticals ongoing business;



inability of Data Critical to maintain key business relationships that the acquired entities have established;
and



improperly evaluating new services and technologies or otherwise being unable to fully exploit the anticipated
opportunity.

          In addition, Data Critical recently announced a restructuring of operations, resulting in a significant
reduction in the number of employees in its Physician Systems business. As a result of this restructuring, Data Critical may elect to sell some or all of its Physician Systems business, including assets acquired in the acquisitions of Physix and
Elixis. If such a sale occurs, Data Critical may nevertheless retain liabilities associated with its Physician Systems business. If this happens, Data Criticals business could be harmed.

          If Data Critical undertakes future acquisitions, it may issue dilutive securities, assume or incur
additional debt obligations, incur large one-time expenses, and acquire intangible assets that would result in significant future expense. Also, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, is contemplating eliminating pooling of interests
accounting for acquisitions and has voted to eliminate the immediate write-off of acquired in-process research and development. The effect of these changes would be to increase the portion of the purchase price for any future acquisitions that must
be charged to Data Criticals cost of revenues and operating expenses in the periods following any such acquisitions. Any of these events could harm Data Criticals business.

Data Criticals investments in other companies may decline in value, which would harm Data Criticals earnings and liquidity.

          Data Critical has in the past, and may in the future, make investments in other companies in the e-commerce
healthcare market. The value of those investments may decline. If this happens, Data Critical could be required to write off some or all of those investments, and its earnings and liquidity would suffer.

Data Criticals infrastructure may be unable to keep pace with, and as a result hinder, its growth.

          Data Critical has rapidly and significantly expanded its operations and expects this expansion to continue.
Data Criticals revenue grew from $471,000 in 1997 to $4.1 million in 1998, and from $9.5 million in 1999 to $17.8 million in 2000. Data Criticals rapid growth has placed significant strain on its administrative, operational and financial
resources and has resulted in ever-increasing responsibilities for its management personnel. Data Critical will be unable to effectively manage its business if it is unable to timely and successfully alleviate the strain on its resources caused by
its rapid growth.

Data Critical may be unable to effectively compete, which would harm Data Criticals business.

          Data Critical faces competition from a number of companies, including SpaceLabs Medical, Inc. Many other
companies selling products using traditional methods of patient monitoring, including direct patient oversight and monitoring through wired systems and voice communications, are well positioned to compete with Data Critical. If these companies enter
this market, Data Critical may be unable to effectively compete and its growth and revenue may suffer.

          Many of Data Criticals potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater
financial, technical, marketing and other resources, better name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than Data Critical. Many of Data Criticals potential competitors may also have well-established relationships with its
existing and prospective customers. Due to these and other advantages, Data Criticals potential competitors may develop products comparable or superior to Data Criticals systems or adapt more quickly to new technologies, evolving
industry standards, new product introductions or changing customer requirements. In addition, there is the possibility that one or more of Data Criticals strategic partners or other medical equipment manufacturers may decide to develop
products that directly compete with its systems. Data Critical also expects that competition will increase as a result of medical equipment, wireless and software industry consolidation. Increased competition is likely to result in price reductions,
reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could cause Data Criticals revenue to decline.

If Data Critical loses members of its senior management team, or if Data Critical does not timely hire a permanent
chief executive officer, Data Critical may be unable to successfully manage its business or achieve its objectives.

          Data Criticals success will depend significantly on the continued contributions of its senior
management team, many of whom would be difficult to replace. In particular, Data Critical believes that its future success depends on Dr. David Albert, chief scientist and chairman emeritus of the board, and Michael Singer, executive vice president
of corporate development and chief financial officer.

          Data Critical currently has a new interim chief executive officer who has held that position since February
2001. Data Critical is currently conducting a search for a permanent chief executive officer. The search may be hindered by a number of factors outside Data Criticals control, including limitations on the number of qualified candidates, hiring
competition from similarly situated companies and the unwillingness of qualified candidates to relocate near the companys business headquarters. If Data Critical does not hire a permanent chief executive officer in a timely manner, or it is
unable to find a qualified candidate, it may be unable to manage its business successfully or otherwise achieve its objectives, which would harm its business.

Data Critical may be unable to hire and retain the personnel necessary to support its expanding business, which could
threaten its future growth.

          Data Critical believes its future success will depend in large part on its ability to identify, attract and
retain engineering, marketing, and customer service and support personnel. Because of the complexity of Data Criticals systems and technologies, Data Critical needs to retain and hire engineers with high levels of
experience in designing complex systems. In addition, although Data Critical has recently entered into a strategic distribution alliance with an intent to enhance its product distribution capabilities, Data Critical may need to nevertheless
substantially expand its sales operations and marketing efforts, both domestically and internationally, in order to increase market awareness and sales of its systems. Data Criticals systems require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at
several people within the information technology departments of its prospective customers. Data Critical will also need to increase its customer service and support organization to support new customers and the expanding needs of existing
customers.

          There are a limited number of people with the necessary technical skills Data Critical requires. Data
Critical must compete with many other companies for these personnel, and cannot assure you that it will be able to hire and retain them in sufficient numbers. Failure to hire and retain the personnel necessary to support Data Criticals
expanding business could threaten its future growth and harm its business.

Data Criticals patents and proprietary technology may not provide it with any benefit, and the patents of others
may prevent Data Critical from commercializing its products, which could harm its business.

          Data Criticals ability to compete effectively will depend in part on its ability to develop, maintain
and license proprietary aspects of its technology, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Data Criticals patents may not adequately protect its technology from the competing use of others. In addition, patent
applications Data Critical files may not result in the issuance of any patents.

          Data Criticals products incorporate technologies that are the subject of patents issued to, or patent
applications filed by, others. Data Critical has obtained licenses for some technologies and may negotiate to obtain additional licenses for technologies patented by others. However, Data Critical may not be able to obtain licenses for technology
patented by others on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or develop alternative technology. Data Criticals current and future proprietary technology and licenses of technology may not be adequate for the operation of its business. The
failure to obtain necessary patents and licenses or to identify and implement alternative technologies would prevent Data Critical from commercializing some of its products under development and would harm its business.

Litigation or enforcement of claims of intellectual property infringement could require Data Critical to spend
substantial amounts of money and could impair its operations.

          Data Critical may become subject to infringement claims and litigation or interference proceedings to
determine the right to use, sell or license intellectual property rights. Data Critical has received correspondence from other parties asserting ownership of intellectual property that is or may be incorporated in its products and products under
development. In addition, Data Critical has notified other parties of the existence of patents or trademarks owned or licensed by Data Critical that Data Critical believes may be incorporated in those parties products. Some of this
correspondence has included offers to negotiate the licensing of the intellectual property. These matters may result in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the intellectual property. Litigation, if successful against
Data Critical, could seek to recover damages as a result of any sales of the products and to enjoin further sales of such products, either of which could harm Data Criticals business.

          Litigation may result in significant expenses to Data Critical and significant diversion of effort by Data
Criticals technical and management personnel, regardless of the outcome. Litigation could result in Data Criticals patent or trademark applications not having priority over others, or failing to provide protection against competitors
with similar intellectual property. Any patents or trademarks issued to Data Critical may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented in the future and the competitive advantage provided by the rights created under the patents, trademarks or licenses
lost. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and Data Critical cannot assure you that a court would not find the third-party claims valid or that Data Critical had no successful defense to such claims. An adverse outcome in litigation or
the failure to obtain a necessary

license could subject Data Critical to significant liability and could prevent Data Critical from selling its products. If this occurs, Data Criticals business could be harmed.

          Data Critical also relies on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing invention to develop and
maintain its competitive position. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to Data Criticals trade secrets or disclose such technology, and Data Critical may be
unable to protect its trade secrets or its rights to its trade secrets, which could harm Data Criticals business.

If Data Criticals existing licensing relationship with the licensor of key wireless technology is terminated, its
business will be harmed.

          Data Critical currently holds an exclusive license from a third-party licensor of key wireless technology
that allows Data Critical to manufacture and produce a significant portion of its wireless monitoring and networking devices based on certain portions of the licensors patented technology. In exchange for this exclusive license, Data Critical
must pay royalties to the licensor for each device manufactured that incorporates the licensors patented technology.

          Data Criticals ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market its products depends
significantly on its ability to maintain its relationship and license terms with this licensor. Data Criticals license agreement with this licensor may be terminated early on short notice by the licensor under certain circumstances, including
the breach of a material term by Data Critical or a change in control of Data Critical that is materially adverse to the licensor. Additionally, if Data Critical fails to pay royalty payments to this licensor or otherwise fails to perform its
obligations under its license agreement, the licensor can terminate the license. If the licensor terminates its agreement with Data Critical, Data Critical would have limited means to commercialize its products and its revenue would be significantly
reduced. The termination of this license would harm Data Criticals business.

Federal and state legislation and regulation affecting the healthcare industry could severely restrict Data
Criticals ability to operate its business.

          Data Critical is subject to federal and state legislation and regulation affecting the healthcare industry.
The federal and state governments extensively regulate the confidentiality and release of patient records. Additional legislation governing the distribution of medical records and health information has been proposed and, in some cases, enacted, at
both the federal and state levels. It may be expensive to implement security or other measures designed to comply with any new legislation. Moreover, Data Critical may be restricted or prevented from delivering patient records or health information
electronically.

          Other legislation currently being considered at the federal level could also negatively affect Data
Criticals business. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 mandates the use of standard transactions and identifiers by October 2002, and prescribes privacy measures and other provisions that are required
by April 2003. Because Data Critical intends to market some of its services as meeting these regulatory requirements, its success will also depend on other healthcare participants complying with these regulations.

          A federal law commonly known as the Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback law, and several similar state laws,
prohibits payments that are intended to induce physicians or others to acquire, arrange for or recommend the acquisition of healthcare products or services. Another federal law, commonly known as the Stark law, prohibits physicians from referring
Medicare and Medicaid patients for designated health services to entities with which they have a financial relationship, unless that relationship qualifies for an explicit exception to the referral ban. The application and interpretation of these
laws are complex and difficult to predict and could constrain Data Criticals financial and marketing relationships.

            These laws and other existing or newly enacted laws and regulations applicable to the healthcare industry
could harm Data Criticals business.

State restrictions on the practice of medicine may negatively affect Data Criticals activities and reduce its
revenues.

          The laws in some states prohibit some business entities, such as Data Critical, from practicing medicine.
This is commonly referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. These laws generally prohibit Data Critical from employing physicians to practice medicine or from directly furnishing medical care to patients.
Each state requires licensure for the practice of medicine within that state, and some states consider the receipt of an electronic transmission of selected healthcare information in that state to be the practice of medicine. Some states have
similar prohibitions on corporate practice and licensure requirements for other regulated healthcare professions (for example, nurse practitioners or pharmacists). These laws restrict Data Criticals activities and the extent to which Data
Critical can provide medical advice to consumers and physicians. If challenged, Data Criticals activities may not be found to be in compliance with these laws. To the extent that Data Critical expands internationally, it may face similar
restrictions on its activities outside the United States. These laws and other existing or newly enacted laws and regulations applicable to the healthcare industry could harm Data Criticals business.

If Data Critical fails to comply with current or future laws or regulations governing the collection, dissemination,
use and confidentiality of patient health information, Data Criticals business could be harmed.

          Consumers sometimes enter private health information about themselves or their family members when using
Data Criticals services. Physicians or other healthcare professionals who use Data Criticals products will directly enter health information about their patients, including information that constitutes a medical record under applicable
law, that Data Critical will store on its computer systems. Also, Data Criticals systems record use patterns when consumers access Data Criticals databases that may reveal health-related information or other private information about the
user. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, the common law, and contractual obligations govern collection, dissemination, use and confidentiality of patient-identifiable health information, including:



state privacy and confidentiality laws;



Data Criticals contracts with customers and partners;



state laws regulating healthcare professionals such as physicians, pharmacists and nurse practitioners;



Medicaid laws;



the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and related rules proposed by the Department of
Health and Human Services; and



Health Care Financing Administration standards for Internet transmission of health data.

          The U.S. Congress has considered proposed legislation that would establish a new federal standard for
protecting and using health information. In addition, the laws of other countries also govern using and disclosing of health information. Any failure by Data Critical or its personnel or partners to comply with any of these legal and other
requirements could result in material liability. Although Data Critical has systems in place for safeguarding patient health information from unauthorized disclosure, these systems may not preclude successful claims against Data Critical for
violation of applicable law or other requirements. Other third-party sites or links that consumers access through Data Criticals web sites also may not maintain systems to safeguard this health information, or may circumvent systems Data
Critical puts in place to protect the information from disclosure. In some cases, Data Critical may place its content on computers that are under the physical control of others, which may increase the risk of an inappropriate disclosure of health
information. For

example, Data Critical currently contracts out the hosting of its web sites to third parties. In addition, future laws or changes in current laws may necessitate costly modifications to Data Criticals systems.

          In early 2001, the Department of Health and Human Services finalized proposed regulations at the federal
level authorized under HIPAA. These regulations establish a new federal standard for privacy of health information. These regulations, compliance with which will not be required any sooner than April 14, 2003, may directly regulate some aspects of
Data Criticals business. Achieving compliance with these regulations could cost Data Critical significant amounts or delay or prevent implementation of its business model. Any noncompliance by Data Critical could result in civil and criminal
penalties.

          Furthermore, Data Critical may expand sales of its systems to international markets. An expansion would
require Data Critical to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws and practices, tariffs and other trade barriers. Data Criticals failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals in foreign markets on a timely basis would harm its
business.

Data Critical may experience substantial delays or difficulties in obtaining required governmental approvals, which
could hinder its ability to distribute its existing systems or introduce future systems.

          As a manufacturer of wireless telecommunications systems, Data Critical is regulated under the
Communications Act of 1934 and FCC regulations, as well as the applicable laws and regulations of the various states administered by state public service commissions. Regulatory requirements affecting Data Criticals operations may change. Any
changes may hurt Data Criticals business by hindering its ability to compete with other wireless telecommunications product manufacturers, to continue providing its existing products and services or to introduce future systems or system
enhancements.

          One example of a change of this type is the recent adoption by the FCC of new rules relating to new
frequency transmission standards for medical telemetry equipment. Data Criticals wireless communication products currently transmit in the UHF 450 MHz to 470 MHz radio bands. In order to reduce interference to wireless medical transmissions
from other signals, most notably those of television stations using High Definition Television (HDTV), the FCC has designated as a new transmission band for wireless telemetry medical equipment the UHF 608 MHz to 614 MHz band. The FCC has announced
that it will not certify any wireless medical telemetry equipment which transmits in the old band after October 2002meaning that any new products for which such certification is sought after that time must comply with the new transmission
standards. Failure to comply with these new standards could prevent Data Critical from introducing new products to the market and substantially reduce the market for any of Data Criticals non-compliant products. Either of these circumstances
could harm Data Criticals business.

          The manufacturing, marketing and sales of medical devices, including many of Data Criticals products,
are subject to regulation by the FDA. In addition, certain material changes or modifications to the intended use, labeling, technological characteristics or manufacturing of cleared or approved medical devices are also subject to FDA clearance or
approval. Generally, before a new medical device can be introduced into the market in the United States, the manufacturer or distributor must obtain FDA clearance by filing a 510(k) pre-market notification or obtain approval of a pre-market
approval, or PMA, application. If a medical device manufacturer or distributor can establish that a device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed FDA 510(k) cleared device for which the FDA has not called for PMAs, the
manufacturer or distributor may seek clearance from the FDA to market the device by filing a 510(k) pre-market notification. The 510(k) pre-market notification may need to be supported by appropriate data, which may include clinical data,
establishing the claim of substantial equivalence to the satisfaction of the FDA. If a manufacturer or distributor of a medical device cannot establish substantial equivalence, the proposed device must be approved through a PMA application, which
must be supported by clinical data. The PMA application approval process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy. To date, Data Critical has received clearance from the FDA to market its current products through the 510(k) pre-market notification
process. Failure to receive or delays in receipt of FDA clearances or approvals, including the need for extensive clinical trials or additional data as a prerequisite to clearance or

approval, could substantially harm Data Criticals business, operating results and financial condition. Sales of medical devices and components outside of the United States are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from
country to country. Data Critical may be unable to obtain further clearance or approvals for its products or components on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in receipt of, loss of, or failure to receive, FDA approvals or clearances could harm Data
Criticals business.

          Because Data Critical is a provider of healthcare-related systems, extensive and frequently changing federal
regulations govern the licensing, conduct of operations, and other aspects of its business. Federal certification and licensing programs establish standards for day-to-day operation of Data Criticals research and manufacturing facilities.
Regulatory agencies verify Data Criticals compliance with these standards through periodic inspections. Although Data Critical has been found to be in compliance with all these standards to date, its facilities may fail future inspections
conducted to ensure compliance with federal or any other applicable licensing or certification laws. Any such failure could harm Data Criticals business.

FDA and FTC regulations on advertising and promotional activities may be burdensome and may harm Data Criticals
ability to provide some applications or services, which could lead to higher-than-anticipated costs or lower-than-anticipated revenue.

          Complying with FDA and FTC regulations may be time consuming, burdensome and expensive and could negatively
affect Data Criticals ability to continue providing some of its Internet systems, or to introduce new Internet systems in a timely manner. This may result in higher-than-anticipated costs or lower-than-anticipated revenues.

          Any current or future regulatory requirements that the FDA or the FTC impose on Data Critical or its
advertisers and sponsors could harm Data Critical by:



making it harder to persuade pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies to advertise or promote their
products on Data Criticals web sites, or to sponsor programs that Data Critical offers to healthcare professionals and the public;



restricting Data Criticals ability to continue to provide some of its services or content, or to introduce new services
or content in a timely manner; or



making it more expensive and time consuming to comply with new requirements.

As a result, Data Critical might lose advertising or sponsorship revenue, spend significant amounts of its limited resources on regulatory experts in the area of FDA or
FTC compliance, or receive adverse publicity that harms its business. In addition to existing FDA and FTC regulation of advertising and promotion by pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies, Data Criticals business faces a
potential risk of increased FDA and FTC regulation of these activities in an online context.

Changes in existing FDA regulatory requirements or policies, or Data Criticals failure to comply with current or
future requirements or adoption of new requirements could increase the cost of doing business and cause Data Criticals revenues to decline.

          Many of Data Criticals products are regulated in the United States as medical devices by the FDA under
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and require pre-market notification clearance or approval by the FDA before they can be sold to the public. Generally, before a new medical device can be introduced into the market in the United States, the
manufacturer or distributor must obtain FDA clearance by filing a 510(k) pre-market notification or by obtaining approval of a PMAa much more expensive, time consuming and uncertain process. To date Data Critical has received clearance on all
of its products under the 510(k) process and has not been required to file a PMA application. It is possible, however, that the FDA requirements for clearance of its products may change. Changes in FDA regulatory requirements requiring Data Critical
to modify its compliance procedures may be costly and time consuming and could interrupt or terminate the sales of certain of Data Criticals products. This could harm Data Criticals business.

            In addition, Data Critical faces potential FDA regulation of software that Data Critical develops for use
with its products. Some computer applications and software are considered medical devices and are subject to regulation by the FDA. To the extent that FDA regulations are applicable to any of Data Criticals software products and services, it
will be time consuming, burdensome and expensive to comply with those regulations and could delay or prevent introduction of new software products or services.

Political, economic and regulatory changes and consolidation in the healthcare industry could force Data Critical to
make costly modifications to how Data Critical prices and sells its systems, which could substantially reduce revenues and harm its business.

          The healthcare industry is highly regulated and is influenced by changing political, economic and regulatory
factors. These factors affect the purchasing practices and operation of healthcare organizations. Changes in current healthcare financing and reimbursement systems could cause Data Critical to make unplanned modifications to its systems or result in
delays or cancellations of orders. Federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the U.S. healthcare system at both the federal and state levels. These programs may contain proposals to increase governmental
involvement in healthcare, lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate. Healthcare industry participants may respond by reducing or postponing investment decisions, including
investments in Data Criticals systems. Data Critical does not know what effect these proposals would have on its business. Many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power.
These providers may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for Data Criticals systems. If Data Critical is forced to reduce its prices, its business may be harmed.

Data Criticals activities may expose it to malpractice and other liabilities inherent in healthcare delivery,
which could substantially harm its business.

          Data Critical may be exposed to malpractice or other liabilities against which it may not be adequately
insured, resulting in substantial harm to its business. Data Criticals systems provide data for use by physicians, consumers and other healthcare participants. This data may be obtained from Data Criticals physician customers, strategic
partners, other third parties or, with patient consent, from the aggregation of patient health records. Claims for injuries relating to the use of this data may be made in the future. Also, patients who file lawsuits against doctors often name as
defendants all persons or companies with any relationship to the doctors. As a result, patients may file lawsuits against Data Critical based on treatment provided by physicians who use Data Criticals systems. In addition, a court or
government agency may take the position that Data Criticals delivery of health information directly, including through licensed physicians, or by delivery of information by a third-party site that a consumer accesses through Data
Criticals web sites, exposes Data Critical to malpractice or other personal injury liability for wrongful delivery of healthcare services or erroneous health information. The amount of insurance Data Critical maintains with insurance carriers
may be insufficient to cover all of the losses Data Critical might incur from these claims and legal actions. In addition, insurance for some risks is difficult, impossible or too costly to obtain and, as a result, Data Critical may be unable to
purchase insurance for some types of risks.

If Data Criticals customers experience system defects, delays in transmission or security breaches with Data
Criticals systems, Data Critical could face damage to its business reputation and potential legal liability.

          Data Criticals customer satisfaction and reputation could be harmed if Data Critical or its customers
experience any system defects, delays, failures or loss of data. Data Critical depends on the efficient operation of wireless networks and the Internet for communication. A major catastrophic event or other event beyond its control, including a
major security breach in the transmission of data on its systems or a well-publicized compromise of Internet security, could cause loss of revenue and market share, damage Data Criticals reputation and result in liability. In addition, Data
Criticals systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses,
programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. Furthermore, patient care could suffer and Data Critical could be liable if its systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner. Data Critical has
experienced defects in its products in the past, including its StatView receivers, which were the subject of a voluntary field action. Data Critical may experience defects in the future. Data Criticals contracts attempt to limit its liability
arising from its errors. These provisions may not be enforceable, however, and even if enforceable, they may not protect Data Critical from future liability. While Data Critical has general liability and product liability insurance, including
coverage for errors and omissions, it may be unable to obtain or continue this insurance on reasonable terms in the future. In addition, Data Criticals insurance may be insufficient to cover large claims, and its insurer could disclaim
coverage on claims. If Data Critical is liable for an uninsured or underinsured claim, or if its premiums increase significantly, its business could be harmed.

Data Critical may face product liability claims, which could harm its business.

          The testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices entails an inherent risk of product liability
claims. Data Critical has experienced defects in its products in the past, including its StatView receivers, which were the subject of a voluntary field action. Data Critical may experience defects in the future. These defects could potentially
result in liability to Data Critical. Potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of Data Criticals insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of the policy. Data Criticals existing insurance may not
be renewable at a cost and level of coverage comparable to that presently in effect, if at all. In the event that Data Critical is held liable for a claim against which it is not indemnified or for damages exceeding the limits of its insurance
coverage, that claim could exceed its total assets and could harm its business.

Significant fluctuations in the market price of Data Criticals common stock could result in securities class
action claims against Data Critical, which could harm its business.

          The trading price of Data Criticals common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. The stock
market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may
decrease the trading price of Data Criticals common stock, regardless of Data Criticals actual operating performance, and may make it difficult for you to resell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased them. Securities
class action claims have been brought against companies in the past where volatility of the market price of that companys securities has taken place. This kind of litigation could be very costly and could divert Data Critical managements
attention and resources. Any negative determination in this litigation could also subject Data Critical to significant liabilities, any or all of which could harm Data Critical.

State laws, Data Criticals certificate of incorporation, its stockholder rights plan and certain provisions in
its important contracts may inhibit potential acquisition bids that could be beneficial for stockholders.

          Delaware law and Washington law may inhibit potential acquisition proposals. Data Critical is restricted by
the antitakeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions. Delaware law prevents Data Critical from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for three years following the
date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder.

          For purposes of Delaware law, a business combination includes a merger or consolidation or the sale of more
than 10% of our assets. In general, Delaware law defines an interested stockholder as any entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or
controlled by the entity or person. Under Delaware law, a Delaware corporation may opt out of the antitakeover provisions. Data Critical does not intend to opt out of these antitakeover provisions of Delaware law. The laws of Washington,
where Data Criticals principal executive offices are located, also impose restrictions on some transactions between foreign corporations and significant
stockholders. Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act prohibits a target corporation, with exceptions, from engaging in significant business transactions with an acquiring person for a period of five years after the acquisition,
unless the transaction or acquisition of the shares is approved by a majority of the members of the target corporations board of directors prior to the time of acquisition. A corporation may not opt out of this statute and,
therefore, Data Critical anticipates this statute will apply to it. Depending on whether Data Critical meets the definition of a target corporation, Chapter 23B.19 of the WBCA may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in
control of Data Critical.

          In addition, Data Critical has adopted provisions in its certificate of incorporation that may discourage
potential acquisition proposals and delay or prevent a change in control of Data Critical. These provisions include the following:



Data Criticals board of directors may issue up to 3 million shares of preferred stock and determine the applicable
powers, preferences and rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the stock, including voting rights, without any vote or further action by stockholders;



Data Criticals directors are elected to staggered three-year terms;



stockholders cannot call special meetings;



the nomination of a Data Critical director or the taking of certain actions requires advance notice; and



Data Critical stockholders cannot take action by written consent.

          In accordance with the above-described provisions, Data Criticals board of directors adopted a
stockholder rights plan on June 14, 2000. Upon any person so acquiring 20% or more of Data Criticals common stock (other than in a transaction approved by the board of directors), the rights would entitle the holders (other than the acquiring
holder) to acquire (by paying the then current Exercise Price) shares of our common stock having a market value equal to twice the then current Exercise Price. If after the rights become exercisable and Data Critical is subsequently acquired by
another company or person, the rights would further entitle the holder to acquire shares of the common stock of the acquiring entity (by payment of the Exercise Price), again having a market value of twice the then current Exercise Price. The
certificate of designations of Data Criticals Series A participating Preferred Stock, which creates the purchase rights, has been filed as an exhibit to Data Criticals registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is a part, and you should refer to that registration statement for the complete terms and conditions of the rights.

          Finally, Data Critical has entered into commercial agreements containing change-of-control provisions that
may inhibit potential acquisitions of Data Critical. A change of control of Data Critical may result in the loss or material modification of some of Data Criticals commercial agreements, including agreements that provide Data Critical with
significant amounts of revenue or access to material technology. The loss of such contracts would make Data Critical less valuable, and thus less attractive to potential acquirors.

Risks related to VitalCom

Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact VitalComs stock price and future business and
operations.

          If the merger is not completed, VitalCom may be subject to a number of risks, including the
following:



if the current market price of VitalCom common stock reflects an assumption by the market that the merger will occur, then
the price of VitalCom common stock may decline;



VitalCom may be required to pay Data Critical a termination fee as described below in Terms of the
MergerExpenses; Termination fees;



various costs related to the merger, such as legal and accounting fees and the expenses and fairness opinion fees of
VitalComs financial advisor, must be paid even if the merger is not completed;



possible uncertainty on the part of its customers, potential customers, and employees concerning VitalComs plans for
the future; and



it might be difficult for VitalCom to enter into a transaction similar to the merger or to make acquisitions for a period of
time.

VitalComs sales of enterprise-wide monitoring systems have been lower than expected, and VitalComs future
success is dependant, in part, on its ability to achieve greater sales of those products.

          Since 1995, VitalComs sales levels for its enterprise-wide monitoring systems have been lower than
expected. VitalCom has also invested in infrastructure and incurred expenses at levels that reflected its expectation of higher sales. As a result, VitalCom has incurred net losses in each year since 1995. If VitalCom does not successfully increase
sales of its enterprise-wide monitoring systems in future periods, its business, operating results and financial condition will continue to be materially adversely affected. In addition, although VitalCom has installed its enterprise-wide monitoring
products in more than 100 hospitals, its products may be rejected by the market, resulting in lower sales.

VitalCom has focused its research and development and new product efforts on products that use bands that the FCC
recently assigned to medical telemetry devices, and VitalComs future success is dependent, in part, on its ability to achieve adequate sales of those products.

          VitalCom joined a task force created in 1998 by the American Hospital Association, or AHA, and the FDA. The
task force was formed to respond to issues of potential interference by HDTV, land mobile users and low-power television with the frequencies of wireless patient-monitoring devices known as telemetry devices. The task forces mission was to
identify protected spectrum candidates for future medical telemetry use, evaluate such use and make recommendations to the FCC. The task force petitioned the FCC to allocate the UHF 608 MHz to 614 MHz band primarily for medical use. In June 2000 the
FCC approved a new rule requiring hospitals and independent healthcare networks to evaluate whether their medical telemetry systems are at risk of interference by other types of devices and to take appropriate measures to reduce that risk. The FCC
recommended that hospitals and healthcare networks use telemetry systems operating in the new wireless medical telemetry service, or WMTS, frequency bands and stated that, as of October 2002, it would no longer certify new equipment designed to
operate in the previously used band. VitalCom has spent considerable amounts of money researching and developing products that operate in the new band, and its business, operating results and financial condition could be substantially harmed if
hospitals and independent healthcare networks decide not to move their wireless telemetry systems to the new band. Developing radio frequency transmitter and receiver products is complicated and expensive and has diverted VitalComs research
and development resources from other projects. VitalComs competitors may gain a competitive advantage over VitalCom if the new frequency does not become widely accepted, and any additional development costs associated with expanding
VitalComs UHF radio frequency product offerings could substantially harm VitalComs business, operating results and financial condition. Future regulatory changes could significantly affect VitalComs operations by diverting its
development efforts, making current products obsolete or increasing the opportunity for additional competition, which could substantially harm VitalComs business, operating results and financial condition.

A substantial portion of VitalComs total sales are made to two customers and the loss of, or a reduction in sales
to, either of these two customers would have a significant adverse effect on VitalComs business.

          VitalComs OEM product sales, which represented approximately 58%, 69% and 52% of its total net
revenues in 1998, 1999 and 2000, have historically been to a small number of OEM customers. In 1998, Quinton Instrument Company and Datascope Corporation accounted for approximately 20% and 23% of VitalComs total revenues. In 1999, Quinton and
Datascope accounted for approximately 24% and 34% of VitalComs total revenues. In 2000, Quinton and Datascope accounted for 14% and 28% of VitalComs total revenues. If VitalCom lost either of these customers, or either of these customers
reduced the amount of
products it purchases from VitalCom, it would substantially harm VitalComs business, operating results and financial condition.

VitalComs quarterly operating results often fluctuate significantly, due in part to fluctuating revenues that are
difficult to predict and VitalComs inability to cut costs significantly when revenues decline.

          VitalComs quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly from
quarter to quarter in the future as a result of a number of factors, including:



the size and timing of orders;



the length of the sales cycle;



VitalComs success in expanding its sales and marketing programs and the effects of changes in sales force
alignment;



the ability of VitalComs customers to obtain budget allocations for the purchase of VitalComs
products;



changes in pricing policies or price reductions by VitalCom or its competitors;



the mix of sales between enterprise-wide monitoring systems and OEM products;



the timing of new product announcements and introductions by VitalCom or its competitors;



deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements;



VitalComs ability to develop, introduce and market new products and product enhancements;



market acceptance of new products or product enhancements;



VitalComs ability to control costs;



the availability of components;



costs of responding to software bugs or errors;



regulatory compliance and timing of regulatory clearances;



changes in government regulations and other regulatory developments; and



general economic factors.

          VitalCom generally ships its products as orders are received and, as a result, has historically operated
with limited backlog. VitalComs sales in any quarter therefore depend on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and are not predictable with any degree of certainty. A large percentage of any quarters shipments have historically been
booked in the last weeks of the quarter, which also contributes to VitalComs inability to predict its quarterly results. A significant portion of VitalComs expenses is relatively fixed, and the amount and timing of increases in expenses
are based in large part on VitalComs expectations of future revenues. If revenues are lower than expected in a quarter, the harm of this shortfall to VitalComs business may be magnified by the fact that VitalCom is unable to maintain
gross margins or to decrease spending to compensate for the revenue shortfall. This dynamic has contributed to VitalComs net losses in the past. In addition, VitalCom has sometimes experienced lower sales in the first quarter than in the
preceding fourth quarter and flat sales in the third quarter. These seasonal variations are due, in part, to customer budget cycles.

The sales cycle for VitalComs enterprise-wide monitoring systems is long, which requires that VitalCom expend
substantial amounts of money pursuing potential sales that may not be completed.

          Because replacement or substantial upgrades to clinical information systems typically involves a major
commitment of capital, healthcare providers generally undergo an extended review and approval process before
making such an expenditure. This review and approval process is becoming more complex, more financially oriented and increasingly subject to overall integration into the hospitals information systems planning. The sales cycle for
VitalComs enterprise-wide monitoring systems has typically been nine to eighteen months from the time VitalCom initially contacts a customer to the time it receives a purchase order. VitalCom expends substantial time, effort and money during
the sales cycle preparing a contract proposal and negotiating a purchase order without any guarantee that the potential customer will ultimately purchase a system. Any significant or ongoing failure to reach definitive agreements with customers has
in the past, and may in the future, substantially harm VitalComs business, operating results and financial condition.

Intense competition in the healthcare industry may limit sales of VitalComs products.

          VitalComs enterprise-wide monitoring systems compete with systems offered by a number of other
companies, including Agilent, SpaceLabs, Inc. and GEMS IT, which all have significantly greater financial, technical, research and development and marketing resources than VitalCom. In addition, many of these competitors have longstanding
relationships with acute-care hospitals and independent healthcare delivery networks, or IHDNs. As a result of these relationships, VitalCom may be unable to sell its products to those hospitals or IHDNs or otherwise compete successfully against
these larger competitors. While VitalCom is not aware of any competing open system multi-parameter enterprise-wide monitoring systems currently available, VitalComs OpenNet applications may face significant competition in the future from
healthcare information systems, or HCIS, providers, patient-monitoring companies, life-support device companies and general-purpose data network providers. Some or all of these potential competitors may elect to enter this market and compete with
VitalCom using significantly greater financial, technical, research and development and marketing resources than are available to VitalCom. In addition, VitalComs success in selling its multi-parameter OpenNet networks to hospitals and IHDNs
will depend to a large extent on OpenNets ability to interface with patient-monitoring and life-support devices of other vendors. Any action on the part of other vendors to make interfacing more difficult or impossible could substantially harm
VitalComs business, operating results and financial condition. The market for VitalComs OEM products is intensely competitive. VitalCom sells its products to a range of patient-monitoring and life-support device companies, many of which
have significantly greater financial, technical, research and development and marketing resources than VitalCom. VitalCom cannot assure you that current OEM customers will not elect to design and manufacture patient-monitoring and system components
to compete with those currently offered by VitalCom or contract with other OEM suppliers. If this occurs, it could substantially harm VitalComs business, operating results and financial condition.

          In addition, VitalCom may in the future elect to incorporate the hardware and software for larger networks
into its OEM products that are intended for use in specialty departments of hospitals. This would enable those OEM products to provide real-time distribution of information to remote viewing stations. This could, however, result in VitalCom facing
competition from its OEM customers to the extent that hospitals purchase the smaller departmental systems of VitalComs OEM customers for facility-wide use instead of VitalComs enterprise-wide monitoring systems. If this occurs,
VitalComs business, operating results and financial condition could be substantially harmed.

If VitalCom fails to develop new products and enhance existing products to keep pace with technological developments,
its sales will be hindered.

          Many aspects of the medical equipment industry are undergoing rapid technological change, changing customer
needs, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards. Historically, VitalCom derived substantially all of its revenue from sales of its enterprise-wide monitoring systems and OEM products. VitalCom believes that, as the market
for these products matures, VitalComs future success will depend on its ability to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements that keep pace with technological developments and that address the increasingly
sophisticated needs of acute-care hospitals and IHDNs. If other companies introduce competing products embodying new technologies or new industry standards emerge, these developments could render VitalComs existing products unmarketable or
obsolete. If
VitalCom is unable to develop and introduce product enhancements and new products in a timely and cost-effective manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, or if VitalComs new products or product enhancements,
such as SiteLink, do not achieve market acceptance, VitalComs business, operating results and financial condition will be substantially harmed.

Uncertainty and consolidation in the healthcare industry could have a negative impact on the sales of VitalComs
products.

          The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences that may affect
healthcare providers procurement practices and operation. Many healthcare providers are consolidating to create larger hospitals and IHDNs, resulting in a smaller number of potential customers with increased bargaining power. This could lead
to reductions in the prices VitalCom can obtain for its products. These larger hospitals and IHDNs may concentrate their purchases on a small number of preferred vendors with which they have had longstanding relationships. VitalCom may be unable to
sell to such hospitals or IHDNs or that it will be able to compete successfully with other vendors. The impact of these developments in the healthcare industry is difficult to predict and could substantially harm VitalComs business, operating
results and financial condition.

Failure or delay in obtaining required government approval of VitalComs future products or product enhancements
could harm its sales.

          The manufacturing, marketing and sales of medical devices, including VitalComs products, are subject
to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities. In the United States, VitalComs products are regulated by the FDA. VitalCom has received FDA clearance to market its current products through the 510(k) pre-market notification
process. VitalCom cannot assure you that a similar 510(k) clearance for any future product or enhancement of an existing product will be granted or that the process will not be lengthy. If VitalCom cannot establish that a product is
substantially equivalent to certain legally marketed devices, or if FDA regulatory changes proposed in 1995 with respect to arrhythmia software are finalized, the 510(k) clearance procedure will be unavailable and VitalCom will be
required to utilize the longer and more expensive PMA process. If VitalCom fails to receive, or experiences delays in receiving, FDA clearances or approvals, or is required to undertake extensive clinical trials or provide additional data as a
prerequisite to clearance or approval, VitalCom may be prohibited from selling its PatientNet system or other products. If this occurs, VitalComs business will be substantially harmed. Sales of medical devices and components outside of the
United States are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country.

          VitalComs radio frequency transmitter devices are subject to regulation by the FCC, and VitalCom must
obtain applicable approvals before those products are shipped. VitalCom believes that all of its products designated for sale in the United States meet applicable FCC regulations, including those governing electromagnetic emissions. The FCC approval
process involves the collection of test data demonstrating that the product meets the requirements stated in the FCCs regulations. This data is then included as part of a report and application for approval that is submitted to the FCC. The
FCC may grant approval, request additional information, or withhold approval. Any failure of VitalComs products to conform to governmental regulations or any delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, required FCC approvals in the future, if
any, could cause the delay or loss of sales of VitalComs products and therefore substantially harm VitalComs business, operating results and financial condition.

VitalComs competitors may be able to duplicate its products, and VitalCom may be subject to claims that its
products violate the proprietary rights of others.

          VitalCom relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality
procedures and contractual provisions to protect its intellectual property. VitalCom seeks to protect its software, circuitry documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws, which afford only limited protection.
VitalCom cannot assure you that its protective measures for proprietary rights will be
adequate. Further, competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology, duplicate its products or otherwise circumvent its intellectual property rights used in its products. VitalCom also cannot assure you that third parties will
not in the future claim infringement by VitalCom with respect to current or future products or proprietary rights. Any such claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, delay or prevent product shipments
or require VitalCom to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements. The impact of any of these developments could substantially harm VitalComs business, operating results and financial condition.

VitalCom may face lawsuits based on claims that its products did not perform properly.

          Some of VitalComs products provide applications that transmit information about patient physiological
status or other clinically critical information. Any failure by VitalComs products to provide accurate and timely information could result in product liability and warranty claims against VitalCom by its customers or their patients. VitalCom
maintains insurance against claims associated with the use of its products, but its insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against it. A successful claim in excess of VitalComs insurance coverage or outside the scope of
its insurance coverage could substantially harm VitalComs business, operating results and financial condition. Even unsuccessful claims could require VitalCom to expend substantial funds for litigation and divert management time and
resources.

VitalCom uses some components in its products that are available from only one or a small number of suppliers, and
VitalComs sales would be hindered if VitalCom experiences difficulty in buying those components.

          Some of VitalComs products utilize components that are currently available only from a single or a
limited number of sources, have been available only on an allocation basis in the past and could be in scarce supply again in the future. If VitalCom is at any time unable to obtain components in the amounts needed at the time it needs them or at
commercially reasonable prices, this could result in delays in product introductions, interruption in product shipments or increases in product costs. VitalComs business, operating results and financial condition could be substantially harmed
until alternative sources could be developed or design and manufacturing changes could be completed. In addition, certain components, subassemblies and systems used by VitalCom are sometimes discontinued by manufacturers, requiring VitalCom to
replace them with an equivalent product or, if no such equivalent can be identified, to modify and re-validate the product design. If VitalCom is at any time unavailable to obtain such components on a timely basis or at commercially reasonable
prices or to redesign the product in a timely manner, it could substantially harm VitalComs business, operating results and financial condition until alternative sources could be developed or design and manufacturing changes could be
completed.

VitalComs business has been negatively impacted in recent years by turnover in its management
team.

          A number of changes in VitalComs management team have occurred in recent years. VitalComs chief
executive officer changed in 1997, its vice president, research and development changed in 1998, its vice president, sales and chief financial officer changed in 1999, and its vice president of sales changed in 2000. These management changes have
caused disruptions in VitalComs day-to-day operations, have interrupted continuity in customer relationships and have created delays in sales cycles and product release schedules. Although VitalCom believes that its existing senior management
will successfully improve VitalComs business, operating results and financial condition, VitalCom cannot assure you that these changes have not substantially harmed, and will not in future periods substantially harm, its business, operating
results and financial condition.

VitalCom may not be able to hire and retain the personnel that are required for the success of its
business.

          VitalComs success depends to a large extent on its ability to attract and retain key personnel. If
VitalCom lost the services, either temporarily or permanently, of any of the members of its senior management team or
other key employees, particularly in sales and marketing and research and development, it could materially adversely affect VitalComs business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, VitalComs future success depends to a
large extent on its ability to attract and retain additional key management, sales and marketing and research and development personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense. VitalCom cannot assure you that it will successfully attract and
retain such personnel, and the failure to do so could substantially harm its business, operating results and financial condition.

Date, time and place of the annual meeting

          Data Critical will hold its annual meeting of stockholders on June 7, 2001 at its principal executive
offices, located at 19820 North Creek Parkway, Suite 100, Bothell, Washington 98011 at 9:00 a.m., local time. Data Critical is sending this joint proxy statement/prospectus to you in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Data Critical
board of directors for use at the annual meeting and any adjournments or postponements of the annual meeting. The approximate date of mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the accompanying proxy is May 9, 2001.

Purposes of the annual meeting

          The purposes of the annual meeting are to consider and vote on the following proposals:

Proposal No. 1

          A proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Data Critical common stock in
connection with the merger of Viper Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Data Critical, with and into VitalCom Inc., a Delaware corporation, whereby, among other things:



each outstanding share of VitalCom common stock (other than shares held by stockholders who have properly exercised their
appraisal rights) will be converted into the right to receive 0.62 shares of Data Critical common stock; and



Data Critical will assume VitalComs 1993 Stock Option Plan and 1996 Stock Option Plan, whereby each outstanding option
to acquire a share of VitalCom common stock will be converted into an option to acquire 0.62 shares of Data Critical common stock for an exercise price equal to the former exercise price of the VitalCom option divided by 0.62.

          At the annual meeting, in addition to the Data Critical merger proposal described above, Data Critical
stockholders will also consider and vote on the following proposals:

Proposal No. 2

          A proposal to amend the Data Critical Corporation 1999 Stock Option Plan to

          For further discussion of Proposals 2, 3 and 4, including the Data Critical boards recommendations
regarding these proposals and the quorum and vote required, see The Annual Meeting of Data Critical StockholdersOther Proposals beginning on page 102.

Recommendation of the Data Critical board of directors regarding the Data Critical merger proposal

          The Data Critical board of directors has concluded that the merger and the issuance of shares of Data
Criticals common stock in connection with the merger is advisable to, and in the best interests of Data Critical and its stockholders and has unanimously approved the merger and the issuance of shares of Data Critical common stock in
connection with the merger. Accordingly, the board of directors unanimously recommends that Data Critical stockholders vote FOR the Data Critical merger proposal.

Record date and voting power

          Only Data Critical stockholders of record at the close of business on the record date of May 4, 2001 are
entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Data Critical annual meeting. As of the record date, there were approximately 11,949,323 shares of Data Critical common stock issued and outstanding and approximately 181 holders of record of Data Critical
common stock. Each stockholder of record of Data Critical common stock is entitled to cast one vote per share on each matter submitted for stockholder approval.

Voting and revocation of proxies

          Votes may be cast in person or by a properly executed proxy on each matter properly submitted for the vote
of Data Critical stockholders at the Data Critical annual meeting. All properly executed proxies that are not revoked will be voted at the annual meeting in accordance with the instructions contained in the proxy.

          A stockholder who has executed and returned a proxy may revoke it at any time before it is voted at the
annual meeting by:



executing and delivering to Data Criticals secretary a proxy for the same shares but bearing a later date;



delivering to Data Criticals secretary a written notice of revocation; or



attending the annual meeting and voting in person.

          Merely attending the annual meeting, however, will not in and of itself revoke a proxyyou must vote
your shares in person in order for your previously-delivered proxy to be revoked.

Quorum; required vote

          The presence, in person or by proxy, at the annual meeting of holders of a majority of the shares of Data
Critical common stock outstanding as of the close of business on the record date is necessary to constitute a quorum at the annual meeting. Abstentions and broker nonvotes will count toward establishing a quorum. Broker nonvotes occur when brokers,
who hold stock in street name for customers who are the beneficial owners of those shares, do not receive instructions from the beneficial owners about how to vote their shares. The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Data Critical
common stock present, in person or by proxy, at the annual meeting is required to approve the Data Critical merger proposal. Broker nonvotes will have no effect on the Data Critical merger proposal because they will not represent votes cast on the
proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against approval of the Data Critical merger proposal.

          If you are a Data Critical stockholder and you sign, date and return your proxy without indicating how you
wish to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote FOR all the proposals submitted at the Data Critical annual meeting, including the Data Critical merger proposal.

          On the record date for the annual meeting, the directors and officers of Data Critical owned approximately
1,272,712 shares, or 10.7% of the outstanding shares of Data Critical common stock entitled to vote at the annual meeting.

Solicitation of proxies

          In addition to soliciting by mail, Data Criticals directors, officers, employees and agents may
solicit proxies from Data Criticals stockholders by personal interview, telephone, telegram or otherwise. Data Critical will bear the costs of soliciting proxies from its stockholders, except that Data Critical and VitalCom will each pay
one-half of the cost of printing this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Arrangements will also be made with brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries who are record holders of Data Critical common stock for forwarding
solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of our common stock. Data Critical will reimburse these brokers, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with forwarding solicitation
materials. Data Critical has engaged Mellon Investor Services LLC to distribute proxy solicitation materials to brokers, banks and other nominees and to assist in soliciting proxies from Data Critical stockholders for a fee of approximately $4,500
plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Other matters

          At the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the Data Critical board of directors does not know of
any business to be presented at the Data Critical annual meeting other than as set forth in the notice accompanying this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Should any other matter be properly brought before the annual meeting by Data Criticals
board of directors, a supplement or amendment to this joint proxy statement/prospectus describing the matter will be sent to all Data Critical stockholders entitled to vote.

The matters to be considered at the Data Critical annual meeting are of great importance to the
stockholders of Data Critical. Accordingly, Data Critical urges Data Critical stockholders to read and carefully consider the information presented in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and to complete, date, sign and promptly return the
enclosed proxy in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.

THE SPECIAL MEETING OF VITALCOM STOCKHOLDERS

Date, time and place of the VitalCom special meeting

          VitalCom will hold a special meeting of stockholders on June 7, 2001 at its principal executive offices,
located at 15222 Del Amo Avenue, Tustin, California, commencing at 9:00 a.m. local time. VitalCom is sending this joint proxy statement/prospectus to its stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the VitalCom board of directors
for use at the VitalCom special meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. The approximate date of mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the accompanying proxy is May 9, 2001.

Purposes of the VitalCom special meeting

          The purposes of the special meeting are to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the merger agreement
and to transact such other business as may properly come before the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting.

Recommendation of the VitalCom board of directors

The VitalCom board of directors has concluded that the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is
advisable and in the best interests of VitalCom and its stockholders and has unanimously approved the merger agreement. Accordingly, the VitalCom board of directors unanimously recommends that VitalCom stockholders vote FOR the adoption
of the merger agreement.

Record date and voting power

          Only holders of record of VitalCom common stock at the close of business on the record date, May 4, 2001,
are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. There were approximately 44 holders of record of VitalCom common stock at the close of business on the record date, with approximately 8,330,933 shares of VitalCom common stock issued
and outstanding. Each share of VitalCom common stock entitles its holder to one vote on each matter submitted for stockholder approval at the special meeting.

Voting and revocation of proxies

          Votes may be made in person or by a properly executed proxy on each matter properly submitted to a vote of
VitalCom stockholders at the special meeting. All properly executed proxies that are not revoked will be voted at the special meeting according to the instructions contained in the proxy.

          If a holder of VitalCom common stock executes and returns a proxy and does not specify otherwise, the shares
represented by the proxy will be voted FOR adopting the merger agreement in accordance with the recommendation of the VitalCom board of directors. A VitalCom stockholder who has executed and returned a proxy may revoke it at any time
before it is voted at the special meeting by



executing and delivering to VitalComs secretary a proxy for the same shares but bearing a later date;



delivering to VitalComs secretary a written notice of revocation; or



attending the special meeting and voting in person. Merely attending the special meeting, however, will not in and of itself
revoke a proxyyou must vote your shares in person in order for your previously-delivered proxy to be revoked.

Quorum; required vote

          The presence, in person or by proxy, at the special meeting of the holders of a majority of the shares of
VitalCom common stock outstanding as of the close of business on the record date is necessary to constitute a quorum at the meeting. For this purpose, abstentions and broker nonvotes will count toward establishment of a
quorum. Broker nonvotes occur when brokers, who hold stock in street name for customers who are the beneficial owners of those shares, do not receive instructions from the beneficial owners about how to vote their shares. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of VitalCom common stock outstanding as of the record date is required to adopt the merger agreement. In determining whether the proposal to adopt the merger agreement has received the requisite number of
affirmative votes, abstentions and broker nonvotes will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

          If you are a VitalCom stockholder and you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you
wish to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote for adopting the merger agreement. If you are a VitalCom stockholder and you fail to return your proxy card, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement.

          On the record date for the special meeting, the directors and executive officers of VitalCom owned
approximately 4,927,698 shares, or 59.1% of the outstanding shares of VitalCom common stock entitled to vote at the meeting. Based on the number of shares of VitalCom common stock outstanding on the record date, the affirmative vote of holders of at
least 4,248,776 shares of VitalCom common stock at the VitalCom special meeting is necessary to adopt the merger agreement.

Voting agreements

          Warburg, Pincus Ventures, L.P., ABS Capital Partners, L.P., Vertical Fund Associates, L.P., Vertical Life
Sciences, L.P., Frank T. Sample, Warren J. Cawley, John R. Graham, Stephen E. Hannah and Cheryl L. Isen have each entered into voting agreements with Data Critical dated as of March 12, 2001. They have agreed in the voting agreements to vote all
shares of VitalCom common stock owned by them as of the record date in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. They also granted representatives of Data Critical irrevocable proxies to vote their shares of VitalCom common stock in favor
of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Approximately 4,921,230 shares of VitalCom common stock, which represents approximately 61% of the outstanding shares of VitalCom common stock as of the record date, are subject to these voting
agreements and irrevocable proxies.

          Consequently, the voting agreements effectively ensure that the required approval by VitalCom stockholders
will be obtained, regardless of whether or how other VitalCom stockholders vote their shares. This is true even if the VitalCom board of directors withdraws or modifies its unanimous recommendation that VitalCom stockholders vote in favor of
adoption of the merger agreement.

Solicitation of proxies

          In addition to soliciting by mail, VitalComs directors, officers, employees and agents may solicit
proxies from VitalCom stockholders by personal interview, telephone, telegram or otherwise. VitalCom will bear the costs of the soliciting of proxies from its stockholders, except that Data Critical and VitalCom will each pay one-half of the cost of
printing this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Arrangements will also be made with brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries who are record holders of VitalCom common stock for forwarding solicitation materials to the
beneficial owners of VitalCom common stock. VitalCom will reimburse these brokers, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses they incur in connection with forwarding solicitation materials.

Appraisal rights

          Under section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation law, a VitalCom stockholder who desires to object to
the merger and to receive cash in the amount of the appraised fair market value of his, her or its shares of VitalCom common stock, instead of shares of Data Critical common stock, must follow the procedure described below. Only those VitalCom
stockholders entitled to vote on the merger are entitled to receive an appraisal of the fair value of their shares. All of the holders of VitalCom common stock as of the record date
for the VitalCom special meeting are entitled to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and all of the holders (except for those who have signed voting agreements as described above) may object to the merger and receive cash in the
amount of the appraised fair value of their shares, instead of shares of Data Critical common stock. 

The following is a summary of appraisal rights under Delaware law. This summary is qualified in its
entirety by reference to section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which is attached as Appendix D of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Failure to strictly follow the procedures set forth in section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law may result in the loss, termination or waiver of your rights to appraisal of your VitalCom shares. A VitalCom stockholder who signs a proxy card approving the adoption of the merger agreement or who returns a blank executed proxy
will not have a right to assert appraisal rights.

          Each VitalCom stockholder who wishes to seek an appraisal must deliver a written demand for appraisal to
VitalCom and must not vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement. The written demand must be received by VitalCom before the stockholder vote on the merger agreement takes place at the special meeting. The written demand must be separate from
any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against adopting the merger agreement. Merely voting against adopting the merger agreement or abstaining from the vote will not preserve a VitalCom stockholders appraisal rights.

          A VitalCom stockholder who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should mail or deliver a written demand to
VitalCom at its executive offices set forth in the section entitled SummaryThe Companies beginning on page 6 in this joint proxy statement/prospectus or, alternatively, should deliver the written demand to VitalCom at
VitalComs special meeting. The written demand should specify the stockholders name and mailing address and the number of shares of VitalCom common stock owned by the stockholder. Each VitalCom stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal
rights is responsible for ensuring that his, her or its written demand is received by VitalCom before the vote occurs at the VitalCom special meeting.

          If the merger is completed, VitalCom must provide notice of the effective date of the merger to all VitalCom
stockholders who have complied with the notice and voting requirements within 10 days of the effective time of the merger.

          A stockholder who wishes to withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal rights must do so within 60 days
after the merger becomes effective. A stockholder may also withdraw a demand for appraisal rights after the 60 days have passed, but only with VitalComs written consent. A stockholder who effectively withdraws his, her or its demand for
appraisal will receive the merger consideration provided for in the merger agreement.

          Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any VitalCom stockholder who has complied with the
notice and voting requirements of section 262 is entitled, after written request to VitalCom, to receive a statement listing the aggregate number of shares of VitalCom common stock with respect to which VitalCom received timely demands for appraisal
and that were not voted in favor of adopting the merger agreement. Also within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, either VitalCom or any holder of VitalCom common stock who has complied with the above requirements for seeking appraisal
may file a petition with the Delaware Court of Chancery. This petition should request that the court determine the value of the shares of VitalCom common stock held by all of the stockholders entitled to appraisal rights. Stockholders who intend to
exercise their appraisal rights should file this petition, as VitalCom has no intention at this time of making the filing. Because VitalCom has no obligation to file the petition, if no stockholder files a petition within 120 days after the
effective time of the merger, all stockholders will lose their appraisal right. If the court receives a qualifying petition from a stockholder, it will send a copy to VitalCom. Within 20 days of receipt of the petition, VitalCom is required to file
a list with the Register of the Chancery setting forth the names and addresses of all stockholders who have made demands for appraisal and with whom VitalCom has not reached an agreement as to the value of their shares.

            If a petition for appraisal is timely filed, the court will determine at a hearing which VitalCom
stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights and will appraise the shares of VitalCom common stock held by those stockholders. The court will determine the fair value of such shares after taking into account all relevant factors, but excluding any
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.

          VitalCom stockholders that are considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their
shares determined under section 262 could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the Data Critical shares they would otherwise receive in the merger. Stockholders should also be aware that the opinion of an investment banking firm that
the merger is fair is not an opinion that the merger consideration is the same as the fair value under section 262.

The provisions of section 262 are technical and complex. Stockholders who fail to comply strictly with
the procedures of section 262 will lose their appraisal rights. VitalCom stockholders who wish to exercise appraisal rights and obtain appraisal of the fair value of their VitalCom common stock should consult an attorney.

          If VitalCom stockholders beneficially holding more than 10% of VitalCom common stock outstanding as of the
VitalCom record date properly exercise their appraisal rights under Delaware law, then Data Critical will not be obligated to complete the merger. However, Data Critical may nevertheless waive its right not to complete the merger if the 10%
threshold is exceeded.

Other matters

          At the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the VitalCom board of directors does not know of any
business to be presented at the VitalCom special meeting other than as set forth in the notice accompanying this joint proxy statement/prospectus. If the VitalCom board of directors should bring any other matter before the special meeting, a
supplement or amendment to this joint proxy statement/prospectus describing the matter will be sent to all VitalCom stockholders entitled to vote.

The matters to be considered at the VitalCom special meeting are of great importance to the stockholders
of VitalCom. Accordingly, we urge VitalCom stockholders to read and carefully consider the information presented in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and to complete, date, sign and promptly return the enclosed proxy in the enclosed
postage-paid envelope.

INFORMATION ABOUT DATA CRITICAL

          This joint proxy statement/prospectus includes Data Criticals Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, which is attached as Appendix E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Please read Appendix E for detailed information concerning Data Critical and its business, properties, regulation, management, operations,
financial condition and recent financial performance as well as other important information.

          Data Critical is a leader in the design, manufacture, marketing and support of wireless health information
communications systems for use by caregivers who seek to manage and access patient-specific vital signs and other diagnostic data. Data Criticals systems transmit complex and time-critical patient data over a wireless network and enable remote
caregiver access through either Data Criticals proprietary interactive device, a personal computer or the Internet. Data Criticals systems are designed with a goal of enhancing the quality, cost effectiveness, efficiency, safety and
outcome of healthcare.

          Data Criticals products extend the power of wireless technology to the healthcare industry by
employing a family of hardware and software systems that transmit complex time-critical patient data over wireless networks or through the Internet. Data Criticals systems can transmit patient data to one or more caregivers rapidly and
simultaneously, and can provide caregivers with remote access to the patient information. Data Critical believes that its wireless alarm notification products:



increase caregiver productivity by enabling caregivers to monitor patients remotely while performing multiple other tasks
throughout the hospital;



improve the quality of patient care by reducing the risk of miscommunication among caregivers;



are easy to use and can be deployed rapidly throughout a hospital with minimum training requirements;



are designed with open architecture that enables easy interface and integration with the patient monitoring products of other
companies; and



ensure the security and confidentiality of sensitive patient information.

          Within the healthcare industry, Data Critical historically has focused on the hospital and physician markets
and has derived substantially all of its revenue from two operating segments, Hospital Systems and Physician Systems. Data Criticals Hospital Systems use a wireless receiver or monitor to provide in-hospital caregivers with remote access and
alarm notification of current patient monitoring information. Hospital Systems accounted for approximately 90% of Data Criticals revenue in 2000 and 100% of revenue in 1999 and 1998. Data Criticals Physician Systems provide physicians
with remote and Internet access to comprehensive patient information through cell phones, pagers and handheld computers. Data Critical had 4,500 licensed users of its Physicians Systems as of December 31, 2000 and its Physician Systems accounted for
approximately 10% of its revenue in 2000.

          On May 2, 2001, Data Critical announced that it would undertake a restructuring of its operations to focus
on its core Hospital Systems business. The restructuring, which is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2001, includes a reduction of approximately 17% of Data Criticals current workforce. Roughly half of the workforce
reductions will come from Data Criticals Physician Systems workforce. Data Critical anticipates that the percentage of its revenue attributable to its Physician Systems will decrease as a result of the restructuring. Additionally, Data
Critical may elect to sell some or all of its Physician Systems business as a result of the restructuring.

INFORMATION ABOUT VITALCOM

          This joint proxy statement/prospectus includes VitalComs Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2000, which is attached as Appendix F to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Please read Appendix F for detailed information concerning VitalCom and its business, properties, regulation, management, operations, financial
condition and recent financial performance as well as other important information.

          VitalCom provides solutions that help large healthcare organizations improve care quality and more
efficiently manage the care process, helping to reduce care-related expenditures. VitalComs solutions include an advanced technical infrastructure based upon three fundamentals: (1) collection of time critical patient information through an
open, wireless network; (2) data analysis using sophisticated software to reduce false alarms, provide a common look/feel and patient history analysis; and (3) real-time data distribution using local area networks, wide area networks, and
Internet-based technologies. In addition to creating the technical infrastructure, VitalCom uses information gathered from a clinical assessment process to recommend care process changes that optimize the value of the technology and help to
standardize monitoring quality across the health system, and improve the flow of critical patient information to care providers. The result is faster access to information critical to making informed care decisions, and an improved ability to manage
patient flow problems including bottlenecks and transfers, which can lead to improved care, satisfaction and reduced costs.

          VitalComs PatientNet system collects patient monitoring or life support data from VitalComs
proprietary ECG monitors and other manufacturers bedside devices and sends the data over a radio frequency network to a central surveillance room. Trained technicians staffing the central surveillance room evaluate information acquired from
ambulatory and point-of-care monitors for 48 to 56 patients each. In case of a patient emergency or other significant event, technicians use an integrated paging system to immediately contact the appropriate caregiver. Because the networks

          Pursuant to the merger agreement:



Viper, a wholly owned subsidiary of Data Critical, will merge with and into VitalCom;

Management and operations following the merger

          Before the merger, the Data Critical board of directors consisted of seven members. After the merger, it
will consist of eight members. Frank T. Sample, president, chief executive officer and chairman of the board of VitalCom, and Elizabeth H. Weatherman, a designee of Warburg, Pincus Ventures, L.P., will join the Data Critical board of directors. One
member of Data Criticals current board of directors, George M. Middlemas, will resign effective upon the closing of the merger. Mr. Sample will become the vice chairman of Data Critical and group president of VitalCom following the merger.
Additional announcements regarding the specific composition of Data Criticals management team will follow.

Background of the transaction

          On January 5, 2000, VitalCom retained Pinnacle Partners, Inc. to be its financial advisor in connection with
any potential mergers, acquisitions, or similar transactions.

          On May 26, 2000, Mr. Michael E. Singer of Data Critical met with Mr. Frank T. Sample of VitalCom to discuss
general business and industry trends and potential business, product distribution, licensing or affiliation opportunities between the two companies.

          Between May 26, 2000 and July 24, 2000, conversations between the two companies continued and evolved into
discussions regarding the possibility of combining the two companies.

          On July 24, 2000, Data Critical and VitalCom entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement. Also on July
24, 2000, Mr. Singer, Mr. Sample and Mr. Jeffrey Brown of Data Critical, together with other members of the management teams of both companies, met at Data Criticals offices in Bothell, Washington. During the July 24 meeting, each company made
a general presentation regarding its business, products and customers.
Following the July 24 meeting, Data Critical hired U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray to be its financial advisor. Data Critical also engaged A.G. Edwards to provide specific financial analysis relating to the transaction.

          Discussions were held during early August regarding potential proposed structures for a combination. On or
about August 16, 2000, Pinnacle Partners prepared and distributed a confidential presentation to the board of directors of VitalCom analyzing the proposed transaction. The board of directors of VitalCom met to consider the proposed transaction, the
analysis provided by Pinnacle Partners and other alternatives. On August 18, 2000, the parties entered into a letter agreement containing non-binding indicative terms for a proposed transaction and a binding 21-day prohibition on negotiations by
VitalCom with third parties. On August 22, 2000, officers of VitalCom participated in a conference call with Data Critical and its financial advisors to discuss and explore the due diligence process. On August 29, 2000, management personnel of each
company, together with each companys financial advisors, met in Orange County, California. During the August 29 meeting, Data Critical conducted initial exploratory due diligence of VitalComs business. The August 29 meeting also included
a mutual presentation of financial information and an analysis of VitalComs sales pipeline and backlog, business plans and results of operation. On September 1, 2000, a meeting took place at Data Criticals offices in Bothell, at which
Data Critical presented information regarding its businesses, prospects and results of operations.

          After the September 1 meeting, the companies continued to exchange business information and to periodically
engage in telephone discussions to formulate a proposal for the combination of the two companies. Each companys management, working with their financial advisors, also independently analyzed the potential for a combination.

          On September 21, 2000, Mr. Singer, Mr. Sample, Mr. Patrick Doherty of A.G. Edwards, Mr. Marc Cabrera of
Pinnacle Partners and a representative of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray took part in a conference call to discuss possible terms of a combination of the two companies. The parties did not agree on terms at that time, and agreed to terminate
discussions.

          On January 23, 2001, VitalComs board of directors met and discussed, among other things, renewing
conversations with Data Critical about a possible combination. On January 25, 2001 and again on January 27, 2001, Mr. Brown and Mr. Sample met and resumed discussion regarding a combination of the companies.

          On February 2, 2001, Data Criticals board met and discussed, among other things, the possibility of a
combination with VitalCom. At a meeting of Data Criticals board of directors on February 9, 2001, Mr. Singer and a representative of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray discussed possible terms of a proposed combination. The Data Critical board of
directors authorized senior management to continue discussions with VitalCom regarding the potential acquisition. Data Critical and VitalCom continued to discuss the terms and conditions of the proposed merger agreement on a regular basis. Data
Criticals board of directors met on February 12, 2000 and February 13, 2000 to receive updates from Data Criticals management and to consider terms of the proposed combination.

          On February 13 and 14, 2001, representatives of the two companies and their attorneys met at VitalComs
headquarters in Tustin, California to continue business due diligence and commence legal due diligence of VitalCom. On February 15 and 16, 2001, representatives of the two companies and their attorneys met at Data Criticals principal offices
in Bothell to continue business and legal due diligence of Data Critical.

          Over the next few weeks, Data Critical, VitalCom and their financial advisors and legal counsel participated
in conferences regarding pricing considerations and the negotiation of terms and conditions of the proposed merger agreement. Both Data Critical and VitalCom continued examinations of each others business. Data Criticals board of
directors met five additional times during this period to receive updates and evaluate the status of the transaction. During this time, VitalComs board of directors also had numerous discussions and exchanged correspondence regarding the
transaction.

            On March 12, 2001, the VitalCom board of directors held a special meeting to review the status of final
negotiations with Data Critical. At this meeting, Mr. Sample and VitalComs legal counsel presented the final terms of the merger agreement. Also at this meeting, Pinnacle Partners rendered its oral opinion to the board, which Pinnacle Partners
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated March 12, 2001, to the effect that, as of March 12, 2001 and based on and subject to the matters stated in its opinion, the exchange ratio in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to
the VitalCom stockholders. After considering the presentations made by Pinnacle Partners and VitalComs attorneys and the factors described in The MergerJoint reasons for the merger and Recommendation of
VitalComs board; VitalComs reasons for the merger, the VitalCom board unanimously approved the proposed transaction and the merger agreement. The VitalCom board authorized the executive officers of VitalCom to negotiate any final
changes necessary to the merger agreement and related ancillary documents on behalf of VitalCom and determined to recommend to VitalComs stockholders that the VitalCom stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.

          On March 12, 2001, the Data Critical board of directors held a special meeting to review the status of final
negotiations with VitalCom. At this meeting, Mr. Singer and Data Criticals legal counsel presented the final terms of the merger agreement. Also at this meeting, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray rendered its oral opinion to the board, which U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated March 12, 2001, to the effect that, as of March 12, 2001 and based on and subject to the matters stated in its opinion, the proposed consideration to be paid to the VitalCom
stockholders was fair, from a financial point of view, to Data Critical. After considering the presentations made by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and Data Criticals attorneys and the factors described in The MergerJoint reasons for
the merger and Recommendation of Data Criticals board; Data Criticals reasons for the merger, the Data Critical board unanimously approved the proposed transaction and the merger agreement. The Data Critical board
authorized the executive officers of Data Critical to negotiate any final changes necessary to the merger agreement and related ancillary documents on behalf of Data Critical and determined to recommend to Data Criticals stockholders that they
vote to approve the issuance of shares of Data Critical common stock in the merger.

          After the close of the stock market on March 12, 2001, Data Critical and VitalCom executed the merger
agreement and the ancillary documents, and issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the merger agreement.

Joint reasons for the merger

          The boards of directors of both Data Critical and VitalCom based their decisions to recommend the proposed
merger on their belief that the merger will jointly benefit Data Critical and VitalCom and their stockholders in a number of ways, including the following:



Benefits of scale.   
 The merger will create a larger, combined company with:



greater technological, financial and business resources;



a more diversified product base;



greater product research and development capabilities;



an expanded distribution and OEM network;



an increased ability to compete effectively for business and sales;



greater brand recognition;



an enhanced ability to negotiate more favorable terms in its commercial dealings; and



greater cost efficiency resulting from the elimination and reduction of redundant corporate overhead.



Benefits of Diversification.   
 The merger will combine two different, but complimentary, product
lines. The combined companys diverse product line will offer a broader and more comprehensive family of
wireless products to the hospital market, as compared to the product lines of competitors or by either Data Critical or VitalCom independently. By leveraging each companys existing customer and strategic relationships, the combined company
could expand its customer base and establish a market leadership position in the market for wireless hospital products.



Synergistic Technology.    
The combination of the two companies technologies and research
and development operations are expected to result in substantial synergies and potential technological superiority over competing products.



Increased Prospects for Profitability.  
  The increased scale, potential synergies, product
diversification and enhanced market position of the combined company are expected to improve the combined companys prospect for near-term profitability.

Recommendations of Data Criticals board; Data Criticals reasons for the merger

          The Data Critical board of directors has unanimously approved the merger and the merger agreement and has
determined that the terms of the merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, Data Critical and its stockholders. Accordingly, the Data Critical board of directors unanimously recommends that Data Criticals stockholders vote
FOR approval of the issuance of shares of common stock in the merger. In addition to the anticipated joint benefits described above, the Data Critical board of directors believes that there are additional reasons the merger will be
beneficial to Data Critical and its stockholders:



New Sales Opportunities.    
The merger will expand Data Criticals product base, will provide
increased sales opportunities with current Data Critical customers and strategic partners and will create opportunities for introduction and cross-selling of Data Critical products to VitalComs customers and strategic partners.



New Technology.   
 The merger will provide Data Critical with new and additional technology that
could not be created independently by Data Critical without significant time and expense.

          In the course of its deliberations, Data Criticals board of directors reviewed and considered a number
of other factors relevant to the merger, including the following:



information regarding historical market prices and other information with respect to VitalCom common stock and Data Critical
common stock, and the financial performance and condition, assets, liabilities, business operations, and prospects of each of VitalCom and Data Critical and their projected future values as separate entities and on a combined basis;



the potential financial impact of the merger on Data Critical, including its stock price, cash balance, revenue and
earnings;



the current and prospective economic and competitive environment facing not only Data Critical, but also the healthcare
information technology sector in general;



the competitive advantages that VitalComs technology offers in respect of compliance with new federal regulations
governing wireless hospital products;



the compatibility of management of the two companies and the prospective management team for the combined company, including
the need to enter into employment agreements with Mr. Frank Sample and Mr. Stephen Hannah of VitalCom and Mr. Michael Singer, Mr. Brad Harlow and Mr. Robert May of Data Critical;



on completion of the merger, Data Criticals board of directors will consist of eight members, six of whom will be from
the existing Data Critical board, but only two of whom will be from the existing VitalCom board;



the tax and accounting treatment of the merger;



VitalComs large number of hospital customers;



the price per share to be paid to VitalCom stockholders represented a 27% discount from the then current market price for
VitalCom common stock based on the exchange ratio, as of the signing of the merger agreement;



the results of the business and legal due diligence investigation of VitalCom conducted by Data Criticals consultants,
employees and counsel;



the presentation to the Data Critical board of directors, and opinion rendered orally by, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray on March
12, 2001 that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in stated in the U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray written opinion, as of March 12, 2001, the merger consideration to be paid by Data
Critical to VitalCom stockholders in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Data Critical (the full text of the U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray opinion is attached as Appendix B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus);



a review with Data Criticals attorneys of the terms of the merger agreement, including the parties mutual
representations and warranties and closing conditions to the merger;



the belief that the terms of the merger agreement are reasonable;



the execution by stockholders representing approximately 61% of outstanding shares of VitalCom common stock of voting
agreements, pursuant to which those VitalCom stockholders agreed:



not to sell their VitalCom shares prior to completion of the merger and in restricted circumstances after the
merger;



to vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement;



to vote against any other proposal for the sale, merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
VitalCom; and



to grant an irrevocable proxy in favor of Data Critical to vote their VitalCom shares in favor of adoption of the merger
agreement;



the VitalCom stockholder voting agreements described above effectively ensure that the required approval of the merger by
VitalCom stockholders would be obtained regardless of whether or how other VitalCom stockholders vote their shares; and



the inclusion in the merger agreement of a breakup fee, pursuant to which either Data Critical or VitalCom could be required
to pay the other a termination fee of $500,000 or, under certain circumstances following a termination at the fault of VitalCom, VitalCom could be required to pay additional fees to Data Critical up to $1,000,000 overall, and that such fees might
discourage third parties from offering to acquire VitalCom.

          Data Criticals board of directors also considered a variety of potentially negative factors in its
deliberations concerning the merger, including the following:



VitalComs longer sales cycle and the size, quality and likelihood of completion of VitalComs sales
pipeline;



VitalComs dependence on a small number of customers for a substantial majority of its revenues, and on one supplier for
the manufacture of a substantial majority of its products;



risks associated with the mergers impact on each companys customers and strategic partners, including the
willingness of those customers and strategic partners to continue to do business with the combined company and any new terms demanded by such customers and strategic partners;



risks associated with the fact that VitalComs products compete with the products of existing Data Critical customers
and strategic partners;



differences in the revenue recognition accounting policies of the two companies;



the dilutive effect of the Data Critical common stock to be issued in the merger;



the risk that the market price of Data Criticals common stock might be adversely affected by consummation of the
merger;



the risk that integration of the two companies management and scientific cultures might not be accomplished quickly or
smoothly;



the potential loss of key Data Critical employees who are important to the ongoing success of Data Critical and to the
integration of VitalComs operations and technology; and



other risks described under the heading Risk Factors beginning on page 14.

          The preceding discussion of the information and factors considered by the Data Critical board of directors
is not intended to be exhaustive, but is believed to include all material factors considered by the Data Critical board of directors. Each member of the Data Critical board of directors may have considered different factors and may have given
different weights to different factors. In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, the Data Critical board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign
relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination.

Recommendations of VitalComs board; VitalComs reasons for the merger

          The VitalCom board of directors has unanimously approved the merger and the merger agreement, and has
determined that the terms of the merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, VitalCom and its stockholders. Accordingly, the VitalCom board of directors unanimously recommends that VitalComs stockholders vote FOR adoption of
the merger agreement. In the course of its deliberations, in addition the joint benefits of the merger discussed above, VitalComs board of directors reviewed and considered a number of other factors relevant to the merger, including the
following:



information regarding historical market prices and other information with respect to Data Critical common stock and VitalCom
common stock, and the financial performance and condition, assets, liabilities, business operations, and prospects of each of Data Critical and VitalCom and their projected future values as separate entities and on a combined basis;



the current and prospective economic and competitive environment facing VitalCom;



the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the amount and nature of the consideration to be received by
VitalComs stockholders;



other transactions in the industry in consideration of the financial and strategic rationale for the transaction;



the VitalCom boards assessment of VitalComs strategic alternatives to the merger, including remaining an
independent company, acquiring other companies, licensing or otherwise transferring its rights to future discoveries, and merging or consolidating with a party other than Data Critical;



taking into account relevant financial, legal, business, marketplace and other considerations, the determination of
VitalComs board that it was unlikely that another transaction with any other corporation could be structured that would offer comparable value to VitalComs stockholders;



the fixed nature of the exchange ratio and the possibility that, if there is an increase in the market price of Data Critical
common stock prior to completion of the merger, the value to be received by VitalComs stockholders would be increased;



the potential impact of the merger on the market price of Data Criticals common stock;



the tax and accounting treatment of the merger;



the products and sales prospects of Data Critical, both within its own product line, as well as with the synergies that may
be created by combination with VitalCom;



the compatibility of management of the two companies and the prospective management team for the combined company, including
the need to enter into employment agreements with Mr. Frank Sample and Mr. Stephen Hannah of VitalCom and Mr. Michael Singer, Mr. Brad Harlow and Mr. Robert May of Data Critical;



a review with VitalComs attorneys of the terms of the merger agreement, including the parties mutual
representations and warranties and closing conditions to the merger;



the results of the business and legal due diligence investigation of Data Critical conducted by VitalComs consultants,
employees and counsel; and



the presentation of, and opinion rendered by, Pinnacle Partners orally to VitalComs board of directors on March 12,
2001, and subsequently in writing, that as of such date, and based upon and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the analysis undertaken, the exchange ratio of 0.62 shares of Data Critical
common stock for each share of VitalCom common stock was fair to VitalComs stockholders from a financial point of view (the full text of the Pinnacle Partners opinion describes the basis for its opinions and is attached as Appendix C to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus).

          VitalComs board of directors also considered a variety of potentially negative factors in its
deliberations concerning the merger, including the following:



the loss of control over the future operations of VitalCom following the merger;



the fixed nature of the exchange ratio and the risk that, should there be a decrease in the market price of Data Critical
common stock prior to completion of the merger, the value to be received by VitalComs stockholders would be reduced;



the price per share to be paid to VitalCom stockholders represented a 27% discount from the then current market price for
VitalCom common stock based on the exchange ratio, as of the signing of the merger agreement;



on completion of the merger, Data Criticals board of directors will consist of eight members, six of whom will be from
the existing Data Critical board, but only two of whom will be from the existing VitalCom board;



risks associated with the mergers impact on each companys customers and strategic partners, including the
willingness of those customers and strategic partners to continue to do business with the combined company and any new terms demanded by such customers and strategic partners;



the fact that the merger agreement provides that Data Critical has the right not to proceed with the transaction under
certain circumstances, including in the event that greater than ten percent (10%) of VitalComs stockholders elect to exercise their appraisal rights;



the fact that VitalCom will be effectively precluded from entering into any potentially superior merger or other acquisition
transaction with a third party because Data Critical demanded that voting agreements be executed by a majority of VitalCom stockholders, thus effectively ensuring that the required approval of the merger by VitalCom stockholders will be obtained
regardless of whether or how other VitalCom stockholders vote their shares;



the provisions of the merger agreement that prohibit VitalCom and it officers, directors, employees and representatives from
soliciting or encouraging any alternate proposals, or, subject to the fiduciary duties of the VitalCom board, from negotiating with any third parties with respect to an alternate proposal;



the inclusion in the merger agreement of a breakup fee, pursuant to which either Data Critical or VitalCom could be required
to pay the other a termination fee of $500,000 or, under certain circumstances following a termination at the fault of VitalCom, VitalCom could be required to pay additional fees to Data Critical up to $1,000,000 overall, and that such fees might
discourage third parties from offering to acquire VitalCom; and



other risks described under the section entitled Risk Factors beginning on page 14.

          The preceding discussion of the information and factors considered by the VitalCom board of directors is not
intended to be exhaustive, but is believed to include all material factors considered by the VitalCom board of directors. Each member of the VitalCom board of directors may have considered different factors and may have given different weights to
different factors. In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, the VitalCom board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the
specific factors considered in reaching its determination.

Opinion of Data Criticals financial advisor

          Data Critical retained U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray to render to the board of directors of Data Critical an
opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be paid by Data Critical in the merger.

          U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray delivered to the board of directors of Data Critical on March 12, 2001, its
opinion, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, factors and limitations set forth in the written opinion and described below, that the consideration proposed to be paid by Data Critical in the proposed merger was fair, from a
financial point of view, to Data Critical. A copy of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrays written opinion is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix B and is incorporated into this joint proxy statement/prospectus by
reference.

          While U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray rendered its opinion and provided certain analyses to the board of
directors, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray was not requested to and did not make any recommendation to the board of directors as to the specific form or amount of the consideration to be paid by Data Critical in the proposed merger. Such consideration
was determined through negotiations between VitalCom and Data Critical. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrays written opinion, which was directed to the Data Critical board of directors, addresses only the fairness to Data Critical, from a financial
point of view, of the proposed consideration to be paid by Data Critical in the proposed merger. The opinion does not address Data Criticals underlying business decision to participate in the merger, and does not constitute a recommendation to
any Data Critical stockholder as to how a stockholder should vote with respect to the merger.

          In arriving it its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrays review included:



a draft dated March 10, 2001 of the merger agreement;



selected financial, operating and business information related to Data Critical and VitalCom;



publicly available market and securities data of Data Critical, VitalCom and of selected public companies deemed comparable
to VitalCom and Data Critical;



to the extent publicly available, financial information relating to selected transactions deemed comparable to the proposed
merger; and



internal financial information of VitalCom and Data Critical prepared for financial planning purposes and furnished by
VitalCom and Data Critical management.

          In addition, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray conducted discussions with members of senior management of VitalCom
concerning the financial condition, current operating results and business outlook of VitalCom. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray also conducted discussions with members of senior management of Data Critical concerning the financial condition, current
operating results and business outlook of Data Critical, VitalCom and the combined company following the merger.

            In delivering its opinion to the board of directors of Data Critical, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray prepared
and delivered to the board of directors written materials containing various analyses and other information material to the opinion. Here is a summary of the analyses contained in the materials:

Implied Consideration

          Giving effect to the exchange ratio, the resulting implied value of Data Critical stock consideration of
$1.705 per share of VitalCom common stock (based on the closing trading price for Data Critical common stock on March 9, 2001 of $2.75) and the outstanding VitalCom common shares and common share equivalents, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray calculated
the aggregate implied value of the stock consideration payable in the transaction for VitalCom common stock to be approximately $13.9 million. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray also calculated that stockholders of VitalCom would be issued an aggregate of
29.1% of the total Data Critical common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding after the merger.

Market Analysis

          U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyzed the exchange ratio for this transaction against the implied
exchange ratio based on historical stock prices for Data Critical. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray examined the exchange ratios implied by the ten, thirty, sixty, ninety, and one hundred and eighty trading day mean and median stock prices for Data
Critical and VitalCom. This analysis produced the following implied historical exchange ratios:

VitalCom.

VitalCom Comparable Company Analysis

          U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray compared financial information and valuation ratios relating to VitalCom to
corresponding data and ratios from four publicly traded companies deemed comparable to VitalCom. This group included Card Guard, Data Critical, DataScope and Spacelabs Medical. This group was selected from companies that operate in the information
technology, electromedical, patient monitoring and diagnostic segments of the healthcare industry and were companies otherwise deemed comparable by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.

          This analysis produced multiples of selected valuation data as follows:

Merger and Acquisition Analysis

          U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed nine merger and acquisition transactions that it deemed comparable to
the merger. It selected these transactions by searching SEC filings, public company disclosures, press releases, industry and popular press reports, databases and other sources and by applying the following criteria:



transactions in which the target company operated in the information technology, electromedical, patient monitoring and
diagnostic segments of the healthcare industry;



transactions with an equity value of greater than $15 million;



transactions in which the target company had revenue greater than $10 million;



transactions in which there was a change in control of the target company; and



transactions announced or completed between January 1, 1998 and March 9, 2001.

          U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray compared the resulting multiples of selected valuation data to multiples for
VitalCom derived from the implied value payable in the merger.

Premiums Paid Analysis

          U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed nine completed merger and acquisition transactions that it deemed
comparable to the merger to determine the implied premiums payable in the mergers over recent trading prices. It selected these transactions by searching SEC filings, public company disclosures, press releases, industry and popular press reports,
databases and other sources and by applying the following criteria:



transactions in which the target company operated in the information technology, electromedical, patient monitoring and
diagnostic segments of the healthcare industry;



transactions in which the target company had revenue greater than $10 million;



transactions in which there was a change in control of the target company; and



transactions completed between January 1, 1999 and March 9, 2001.

          The table below shows a comparison of those premiums to the premium that would be paid to VitalCom
stockholders based on the implied value payable in the merger. The premium calculations for VitalCom stock are based upon an assumed announcement date of March 10, 2001:

VitalCom Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

          U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray performed a discounted cash flow analysis for VitalCom in which it calculated the
present value of the projected future cash flows of VitalCom using internal financial planning data prepared by VitalCom management. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray estimated a range of theoretical values for VitalCom based on the net present value of
its implied annual cash flows and a terminal value for VitalCom in 2003 calculated based upon a multiple of revenue. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray applied a range of discount rates of 20% to 30% and a range of terminal value multiples of 1.0x to 2.0x

Pro Forma Analyses

          U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyzed pro forma effects resulting from the impact of the transaction on the
projected earnings per share and projected cash earnings per share of the combined company at and for the four fiscal quarters in fiscal 2001 and for fiscal year ending December 31, 2001 using management estimates for VitalCom and publicly available
estimates for Data Critical. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray performed this analysis with and without taking into account operational synergies of approximately $1 million that management estimates the combined company may realize following consummation
of the transaction. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray determined that the transaction could be accretive for the full fiscal year ending 2001 to the projected stand-alone earnings per share and the projected cash earnings per share of Data Critical, both
with and without taking into account operational synergies.

          U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyzed the expected contributions of each of VitalCom and Data Critical to
revenue and gross profit of the combined company for the four fiscal quarters in 2001, and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2001 based on the same forward looking information, without synergies and using April 30, 2001 as an assumed effective
date of the merger, described above. The analysis indicated that during these periods VitalCom would contribute to the combined entity revenue of 38.0% and gross profit of 36.2%. VitalCom stockholders will receive an aggregate of approximately 29.1%
of the shares of the combined company.

Analysis of Data Critical Common Stock

          U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed general background information concerning Data Critical, including
recent financial and operating results and outlook.

          U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray compared selected financial data and ratios for Data Critical to the
corresponding data and ratios for the same comparable company group described above. The stock price used in the calculations was Data Criticals closing price of $2.75 on March 9, 2001. This analysis produced multiples of selected valuation

            In reaching its conclusion as to the fairness of the merger consideration and in its presentation to the
board of directors, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray did not rely on any single analysis or factor described above, assign relative weights to the analyses or factors considered by it, or make any conclusion as to how the results of any given analysis,
taken alone, supported its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray believes that its analyses must be considered as a
whole and that selection of portions of its analyses and of the factors considered by it, without considering all of the factors and analyses, would create a misleading view of the processes underlying the opinion.

          The analyses of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by the analyses. Analyses relating to the value of companies do not purport to be appraisals or valuations or necessarily reflect the price at which companies may actually be
sold. No company or transaction used in any analysis for purposes of comparison is identical to VitalCom, Data Critical, or the merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the comparisons is not mathematical; rather, it involves complex
considerations and judgments about differences in the companies to which VitalCom and Data Critical were compared and other factors that could affect the public trading value of the companies.

          For purposes of its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray relied upon and assumed the accuracy, completeness
and fairness of the financial statements and other information provided to it by VitalCom and Data Critical or otherwise made available to it and did not assume responsibility for the independent verification of that information. Information
prepared for financial planning purposes was not prepared with the expectation of public disclosure. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray relied upon the assurances of the management of VitalCom and Data Critical that the information provided to it by
VitalCom and Data Critical was prepared on a reasonable basis, the financial planning data and other business outlook information reflects the best currently available estimates of management, and management was not aware of any information or facts
that would make the information provided to U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray incomplete or misleading. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray also assumed that there have been no material changes in Data Criticals or VitalComs assets, financial condition,
results of operations, business or prospects since the respective dates of their last financial statements made available to U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.

          In arriving at its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray did not perform any appraisals or valuations of any
specific assets or liabilities of VitalCom or Data Critical, and was not furnished with any such appraisals or valuations. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray expressed no opinion as to the liquidation value of any entity. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
expressed no opinion as to the price at which shares of VitalCom or Data Critical common stock have traded or at which the shares of VitalCom, Data Critical or the combined company may trade at any future time. The opinion is based on information
available to U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and the facts and circumstances as they existed and were subject to evaluation on the date of the opinion. Events occurring after that date could materially affect the assumptions used in preparing the
opinion. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray has not undertaken to and is not obligated to affirm or revise its opinion or otherwise comment on any events occurring after the date it was given.

          U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray was not requested to opine as to, and the opinion does not address, the basic
business decision to proceed with or effect the transaction. The opinion does not address the relative merits of the transaction, on the one hand, or any alternative business strategies or alternative transactions that may be available, on the other
hand.

          U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, as a customary part of its investment banking business, evaluates businesses and
their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, underwritings and secondary distributions of securities, private placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. The Data Critical board of directors selected U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray because of its expertise, reputation and familiarity with the healthcare industry. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray provides research coverage on and maintains a market in the common stock of Data Critical. In the ordinary course of
its business, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and its
affiliates may actively trade securities of Data Critical for their own accounts or the accounts of their customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in those securities.

          Under the terms of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrays engagement letter with Data Critical, Data Critical has
agreed to pay U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray a customary fee upon consummation of the transaction for U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrays financial advisory services. Data Critical has agreed to pay U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray a customary fee for rendering
its opinion, which will be credited against payment of the fee for financial advisory services. The contingent nature of the financial advisory fee may have created a potential conflict of interest in that Data Critical would be unlikely to
consummate the transaction unless it had received the opinion of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. Whether or not the transaction is consummated, Data Critical has agreed to pay the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and to
indemnify U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray against liabilities incurred. These liabilities include liabilities under the federal securities laws in connection with the engagement of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray by the board of directors.

Opinion of VitalComs financial advisor

          VitalCom retained Pinnacle Partners, Inc. to act as its financial advisor to evaluate the financial terms of
the merger with Data Critical and to render an opinion as to its fairness. On March 12, 2001, Pinnacle Partners rendered its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the VitalCom board of directors that the exchange ratio is
fair from a financial point of view to the VitalCom stockholders.

          The full text of the Pinnacle Partners written opinion dated March 12, 2001, which sets forth in its
entirety the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations of the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. This summary is
qualified by reference to the full text of such opinion. Holders of VitalCom common stock are urged to read carefully the entire opinion. The engagement of Pinnacle Partners and its opinion are for the benefit of the VitalCom board of directors and
its opinion was delivered to the VitalCom board of directors in connection with its consideration of the merger. The Pinnacle Partners opinion addresses only the fairness of the exchange ratio from a financial point of view to the VitalCom
stockholders; it does not address any other aspect of the merger nor does it constitute a recommendation to any holder of VitalCom common stock as to how to vote with respect to the merger.

          In connection with the Pinnacle Partners opinion, Pinnacle Partners reviewed, among other
things:



an executed copy of the merger agreement, dated as of March 12, 2001;



Annual Reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K for each of VitalCom and Data Critical for the three years
ended December 31, 1999;



certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of VitalCom and Data
Critical;



communications from VitalCom and Data Critical to their respective stockholders;



certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for VitalCom and Data Critical prepared by their respective managements;
and,



certain internal financial analyses and pro forma consolidated forecasts (including certain projected cost savings and
operating synergies) reflecting the combination of VitalCom and Data Critical prepared by their respective managements.

          In addition, Pinnacle Partners:



held discussions with members of the senior managements of VitalCom and Data Critical regarding the strategic rationale for,
and potential benefits of, the merger and the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of VitalCom and Data Critical;



reviewed the reported price and trading activity of the common stock of each of VitalCom and Data Critical;



compared certain financial and stock market information for VitalCom and Data Critical with similar information for other
publicly traded companies;



reviewed the financial terms of certain business combinations in the healthcare monitoring and hospital equipment industries
and in other industries generally; and



performed such other studies and analyses as it considered appropriate.

          In conducting its review and arriving at its opinion, Pinnacle Partners assumed and relied on the accuracy,
completeness and fairness of information given to or reviewed by or discussed with it for the purpose of rendering its opinion, without independently verifying such information. Pinnacle Partners assumed, with VitalComs consent, that the
merger would be in accordance with the terms in the merger agreement, in the form reviewed by Pinnacle Partners and without VitalCom or Data Criticals waiver of any of the conditions to their obligations under the merger agreement. Pinnacle
Partners did not independently evaluate or appraise the assets of VitalCom or Data Critical, nor was it given any such evaluations or appraisals. The Pinnacle Partners opinion is based on the information that it had and the facts and circumstances
as they existed and were evaluated on its date.

          The following is a summary of the material analyses performed and factors considered by Pinnacle Partners in
connection with rendering the Pinnacle Partners opinion.

Analysis of Selected Publicly Traded Companies

          Pinnacle Partners reviewed and compared actual and forecast financial, operating and stock market
information of selected public companies that were engaged in businesses that Pinnacle Partners believed to be generally comparable to the businesses of VitalCom and Data Critical. The companies that Pinnacle Partners evaluated were grouped in three
general sectors: (1) the hospital monitoring and therapy equipment sector, (2) the hospital information systems sector and (3) the hospital consulting and outsourcing services sector. The companies analyzed are shown in below.

          In analyzing the selected publicly traded companies, Pinnacle Partners deemed the businesses of the
companies in the hospital monitoring and therapy equipment sector to be most comparable to the businesses of VitalCom and Data Critical. Pinnacle Partners also deemed the businesses of the companies in the hospital information systems and hospital
consulting and outsourcing services sectors to be relevant in performing the analysis of publicly traded ompanies because certain aspects of the businesses of the companies in these two industry sectors were similar to certain aspects of the
businesses of VitalCom and Data Critical.

          Pinnacle Partners analyzed the respective multiples of the enterprise value, which is defined as the
aggregate market value of a companys publicly traded stock (derived by multiplying a companys total shares and common share equivalents outstanding by the latest closing stock price) plus the book value of total debt
and redeemable preferred stock outstanding less the value of cash and cash equivalents on the companys latest available balance sheet), of these companies to their sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or
EBITDA, and earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, for the latest twelve months, or LTM; and the respective multiples of the equity value which is derived by multiplying a companys total shares and common share equivalents outstanding by
the latest closing stock price, of these companies to their LTM net income and projected net income for each companys next fiscal year. A summary of this analysis is shown below.

          In deriving a mean statistic for a universe of valuation multiples, Pinnacle Partners used a harmonic mean,
which is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of a specified set of numbers, because it normalizes an assumed equal dollar investment in each individual security. Pinnacle Partners believes the harmonic mean is an appropriate
statistic for evaluating the impact of relatively higher multiple securities within a given portfolio of securities.

          Pinnacle Partners then derived a range of imputed equity values per share for each of VitalCom and Data
Critical by applying the multiples derived from the universe of publicly traded analyzed companies to the corresponding data for each of VitalCom and Data Critical. In applying the multiples derived from the universe of publicly traded analyzed
companies to the corresponding data for each of VitalCom and Data Critical, Pinnacle Partners only applied multiples corresponding to sales data for each of VitalCom and Data Critical. Pinnacle Partners did not apply multiples derived from the
analysis of the public companies corresponding to EBITDA, EBIT, net income or projected net income data to the corresponding data for each of VitalCom and Data Critical because:



each of VitalCom and Data Critical had generated operating and net losses throughout the historical periods
reviewed;



VitalComs internally prepared financial forecast showed an operating profit and a net profit for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2001, yet VitalComs ability to actually generate an operating profit in the next fiscal year was uncertain given its historical financial performance and because VitalCom had not achieved its forecast in the previous fiscal year
(primarily related to higher than expected research and development expenditures related to new product introductions); and



Data Criticals internally prepared financial forecasts projected both an operating loss and a net loss. Therefore, any
imputed equity values that would be derived from the analysis based upon EBITDA, EBIT, net income or projected net income for either company would be negative and not meaningful.

            Using the multiples derived from the analysis of the publicly traded hospital monitoring and therapy
equipment companies as applied to VitalComs LTM sales resulted in mean, high and low imputed equity values per share of $2.63, $4.07 and $1.80, respectively, for VitalCom. Pinnacle Partners compared these values to the imputed transaction
price per share of $1.32 (based on the closing price of Data Criticals common stock on March 12, 2001, the last trading day prior to announcing the merger, and the exchange ratio of 0.62x) and noted that the imputed transaction price per share
represented mean, high and low discounts to the imputed equity values of approximately 50%, 68% and 27%, respectively.

          Using the multiples derived from the analysis of all of the analyzed publicly traded companies as applied to
VitalComs LTM sales resulted in mean, high and low imputed equity values per share of $2.27, $6.69 and $1.10, respectively, for VitalCom. Pinnacle Partners compared these values to the imputed transaction price per share of $1.32 and noted
that the imputed transaction values represented mean and high discounts to the imputed equity values of approximately 42% and 80% for the mean and high multiples, respectively, and a premium of approximately 20% for the low multiple.

          Using the multiples derived from the analysis of the publicly traded hospital monitoring and therapy
equipment companies as applied to Data Criticals LTM sales resulted in mean, high and low imputed equity values per share of $2.92, $3.91 and $2.35, respectively, for Data Critical. Pinnacle Partners compared these values to Data
Criticals closing price per share of $2.13 on March 12, 2001 and noted that such price represented mean, high and low discounts to the imputed equity values of approximately 27%, 46% and 9%, respectively.

          Using the multiples derived from the analysis of all of the analyzed public companies as applied to Data
Criticals LTM sales resulted in mean, high and low imputed equity values per share of $2.67, $5.70 and $1.87, respectively, for Data Critical. Pinnacle Partners compared these values to Data Criticals latest closing price per share of
$2.13 as of March 12, 2001 and noted that share price represented mean and high discounts to the imputed equity values of approximately 20% and 63% for the mean and high multiples, respectively, and a premium of approximately 14% for the low
multiple.

Analysis of Selected Precedent Transactions

          Pinnacle Partners reviewed selected publicly available financial and transaction information related to
seven business combination transactions and one attempted business combination transaction that involved target companies that were engaged in businesses that Pinnacle Partners deemed to be comparable to or relevant to the businesses of each of
VitalCom and Data Critical. The eight transactions involved target companies that were engaged primarily in the healthcare monitoring and hospital equipment industries. All of the transactions occurred from 1995 and were valued at less than $2.5
billion. The transactions evaluated are described below.

          Pinnacle Partners then derived a range of imputed purchase price values per share for each of VitalCom and
Data Critical by applying the multiples derived from the analysis of selected precedent transactions to the corresponding data for each of VitalCom and Data Critical. In applying the multiples derived from analyzing selected precedent transactions
to the corresponding data for each of VitalCom and Data Critical, Pinnacle Partners only applied multiples corresponding to sales, total assets and book value data for each of VitalCom and Data Critical. Pinnacle Partners did not apply multiples
derived from analyzing selected precedent transactions corresponding to EBITDA, EBIT and net income data to the corresponding data for each of VitalCom and Data Critical because each of VitalCom and Data Critical had generated operating and net
losses throughout the historical periods reviewed; any imputed purchase price values that would be derived from the analysis based on EBITDA, EBIT or net income data for either company would be negative and not meaningful.

          Using the harmonic mean multiples derived from analyzing selected precedent transactions as applied to
VitalComs LTM sales and latest available quarters total assets and stockholders equity resulted in imputed purchase price values per share of $3.99, $3.84 and $3.88 based on sales, total assets and book value multiples,
respectively, for VitalCom. Pinnacle Partners compared these values to the imputed transaction price per share of $1.32 (based on the closing price of Data Criticals common stock on March 12, 2001, the last trading day prior to announcing the
merger, and the exchange ratio of 0.62x) and noted that the transaction price per share represented discounts to the imputed purchase prices per share of approximately 67%, 66% and 66%, respectively.

          Using the low multiples derived from the analysis of selected precedent transactions as applied to
VitalComs LTM sales and latest available quarters total assets and stockholders equity resulted in imputed purchase price values per share of $2.54, $2.06 and $1.85 based on sales, total assets and book value multiples,
respectively, for VitalCom. Pinnacle Partners compared these values to the imputed transaction price per share of $1.32 and noted that the transaction price per share represented discounts to the imputed purchase prices per share of approximately
48%, 36% and 29%, respectively.

          Using the harmonic mean multiples derived from analyzing selected precedent transactions as applied to Data
Criticals LTM sales and latest available quarters total assets and stockholders equity resulted in imputed purchase price values per share of $3.85, $8.06 and $8.88 based on sales, total assets and book value multiples,
respectively, for Data Critical. Pinnacle Partners compared these values to the closing price per share of Data Criticals common stock of $2.13 on March 12, 2001 and noted that such price represented discounts to the imputed purchase prices
per share of approximately 45%, 74% and 76%, respectively.

          Using the low multiples derived from analyzing selected precedent transactions as applied to Data
Criticals LTM sales and latest available quarters total assets and stockholders equity resulted in imputed equity values per share of $2.86, $4.35 and $4.16 based on sales, total assets and book value multiples,
respectively, for Data Critical. Pinnacle Partners compared these values to the closing price per share of Data Criticals common stock of $2.13 on March 12, 2001 and noted that such price represented discounts to the imputed purchase prices
per share of approximately 26%, 51% and 49%, respectively.

          Pinnacle Partners noted that the imputed discounts of the stock prices in the transaction for each of
VitalCom and Data Critical in the transaction when compared to the imputed purchase price values derived in the analysis were comparable.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

          Pinnacle Partners performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the forecast free cash flows of each of
VitalCom and Data Critical for the years ending December 31, 2001 through December 31, 2005, based on financial projections provided to Pinnacle Partners by the respective senior managements of VitalCom and Data Critical and based on assumptions
made by Pinnacle Partners. A discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to ascribe a present value to an anticipated future stream of cash flows based on assumptions relating to, among other things, (1) prevailing market conditions, (2) costs
of capital and (3) terminal values for a company at the end of the forecast period. As part of its analysis, Pinnacle Partners assumed, among other things, discount rates of 21% to 23% and terminal multiples of sales of 0.70x to 0.90x to determine a
range of terminal values for each of VitalCom and Data Critical. The discount rates used by Pinnacle Partners in the discounted cash flow analysis were based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of each of VitalCom and Data
Critical and incorporated a mean beta value derived from the universe of public traded companies. The tables below present selected information from the analysis.

          Pinnacle Partners noted that for each of VitalCom and Data Critical, the imputed equity values per share
derived in the discounted cash flow analysis were higher than the closing prices of the common stock of each company on March 12, 2001. Based on the closing price of the common stock of Data Critical of $2.13 per share on March 12, 2001, the
exchange ratio of 0.62x and the imputed equity value per share of VitalCom based upon a discount rate of 22% and a terminal sales multiple of 0.80x of $3.29, the imputed value per share as of March 12, 2001 to be received by the VitalCom
stockholders represented a 60% discount to the imputed value per share derived in the discounted cash flow analysis of VitalCom. Based on the closing price of the common stock of Data Critical of $2.13 per share on March 12, 2001 and the imputed
equity value per share of Data Critical based on a discount rate of 22% and a terminal sales multiple of 0.80x of $4.21, the latest closing stock price of Data Critical represented a 50% discount to the imputed value per share derived in the
discounted cash flow analysis of Data Critical. Pinnacle Partners noted that the imputed discounts of the stock prices for each of VitalCom and Data Critical in the transaction when compared to the imputed values derived in the analysis were
comparable. However, Pinnacle Partners did not place significant emphasis on the
discounted cash analysis because such an analysis did not take into account, among other things, (1) the execution risk associated with implementing each companys forecast business plan and (2) limitations on the availability of capital to
each of the companies to support their respective business plans.

Exchange Ratio Analysis

          Pinnacle Partners reviewed the imputed exchange ratios based on the closing market prices of the common
stock of each of VitalCom and Data Critical for the period November 19, 1999 (the first day of trading Data Criticals common stock following its initial public offering) through March 12, 2001. The table below presents a summary of the
analysis.

          Pinnacle Partners noted that the negotiated exchange ratio of 0.62 was lower than the average exchange ratio
(based on closing market stock prices) for the periods analyzed of 180 trading days ended March 12, 2001 or less, and ranged from a discount of approximately 17% (when compared to 0.75x, the highest average exchange ratio of the trading periods
analyzed) to approximately 6% (when compared to 0.66x, the lowest average exchange ratio of the trading periods analyzed). Pinnacle Partners noted that the negotiated exchange ratio of 0.62 was higher than the average exchange ratio for the 327
trading days ended March 12, 2001 by approximately 13%.

Contribution Analysis

          Pinnacle Partners analyzed the financial contribution of each of VitalCom and Data Critical to the pro forma
financial results of a combined company based on selected actual income statement and balance sheet data for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999 and based upon selected estimated and forecast income statement data for the years ending
December 31, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The table below presents a summary of the analysis.

          Pinnacle Partners compared the financial contribution by VitalCom to the pro forma financial results of a
combined company to the pro forma ownership of a combined company by the stockholders of VitalCom based on the exchange ratio of 0.62x. Based on the exchange ratio of 0.62x, the pro forma ownership of a combined company by the stockholders of
VitalCom is approximately 27%. Pinnacle Partners noted that the financial contribution by VitalCom to a combined company was less than 27% for the balance sheet data analyzed and exceeded 27% for the income statement data analyzed.

          In preparing the analyses for its opinion, including the analyses described above, Pinnacle Partners noted
that neither VitalCom nor Data Critical had generated an operating income or net income within the last three fiscal years and that Data Critical was not expected to generate an operating income or net income within the next fiscal year. Pinnacle
Partners also noted that VitalCom and Data Critical had approximately $6.2 million and $19.9 million of cash and cash equivalents on their balance sheets as of December 31, 2000, respectively. Pinnacle Partners also noted that VitalCom had generated
negative sales growth for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999.

          The summary set forth does not purport to be a complete description of all the analyses performed by
Pinnacle Partners. Preparing a fairness opinion is a complex analytic process and is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Pinnacle Partners believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions of its analyses and factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Pinnacle Partners
considered the results of all such analyses and did not assign relative weights to any of the analyses.

            Pinnacle Partners was not requested to, and did not, independently evaluate or appraised the assets or
liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of VitalCom and Data Critical, and was not furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals.

          In its analyses, Pinnacle Partners made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of VitalCom and Data Critical. The estimates contained in these analyses and the valuation ranges resulting from any particular analysis do
not necessarily indicate actual values or predict future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by these analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses are not appraisals and do
not reflect the prices at which such businesses may actually be sold or the prices at which their securities may trade. As a result, the analyses and estimates described above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. No company or
transaction used in the analyses as a comparison to VitalCom or Data Critical is identical to VitalCom or Data Critical or the contemplated transaction.

          Pinnacle Partners opinion and financial analyses were not the only factors considered by the VitalCom
board of directors in evaluating the merger, and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of VitalComs board of directors or senior management.

          Under the terms of Pinnacle Partners letter agreement with VitalCom, VitalCom has agreed to pay
Pinnacle Partners a customary fee for rendering Pinnacle Partners fairness opinion upon the delivery of the written fairness opinion to VitalComs board of directors. If the merger is completed, VitalCom will also pay to Pinnacle Partners
a customary fee. In addition to the fees provided for above, VitalCom agreed to reimburse Pinnacle Partners, upon request, for all of Pinnacle Partners out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with preparing its opinion and in its role as
financial advisor to VitalComs board of directors. VitalCom also agreed to indemnify Pinnacle Partners and its affiliated entities, directors, officers, employees, legal counsel, agents and controlling persons for certain losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, obligations, penalties, judgments, awards, costs, expenses and disbursements related to or arising out of rendering services under its engagement.

          VitalComs board of directors retained Pinnacle Partners to serve as its financial advisor based on
Pinnacle Partners qualifications, reputation, experience and expertise in investment banking and mergers and acquisitions. Pinnacle Partners is a private investment bank and is continually engaged in valuing businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, private placements, leveraged buyouts, and valuations for real estate, corporate and other purposes.

Interests of VitalComs officers and directors in the merger

          In considering the approval of the VitalCom board of directors and its recommendation with respect to
adoption of the merger agreement, VitalCom stockholders should be aware that some members of VitalCom management and the VitalCom board of directors have interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of
VitalCom stockholders generally in connection with adoption of the merger agreement. In addition, both Frank T. Sample and Elizabeth H. Weatherman, who are both currently members of the VitalCom board of directors, will be appointed to the Data
Critical board of directors after completion of the merger. The VitalCom board of directors was aware of these potential interests prior to approving the merger and recommending adoption of the merger agreement and considered them in its
deliberations.

Employment agreements

          On March 12, 2001, Data Critical entered into an employment agreement with Frank T. Sample, president and
chief executive officer of VitalCom. Pursuant to the employment agreement, upon the effective date of the merger, Mr. Sample will become group president of VitalCom and vice chairman of the board of Data Critical and will no longer serve as the
president and chief executive officer of VitalCom. The term of the employment agreement will begin on the effective date of the merger and will end on the earlier of Mr. Samples

termination of employment or December 31, 2002. Data Critical and Mr. Sample each have the right to terminate the employment agreement upon written notice. Under the employment agreement, Data Critical will pay Mr. Sample an annual base salary of
$250,000 and grant him options to purchase 210,000 shares of Data Critical common stock on the effective date of the merger. These options will become fully vested and exercisable five years after the date of grant, except that vesting for some or
all of the options may be accelerated if the VitalCom unit of Data Critical meets certain target direct sales revenues. If Data Critical terminates Mr. Samples employment without cause (as defined in the employment agreement), Data Critical
will pay him a severance payment of $250,000 in equal installments over a one-year period following his termination, and all options granted to Mr. Sample prior to the date of his termination (other than any unvested portion of the 210,000 options
initially granted to him by Data Critical) will become fully vested and immediately exercisable upon his termination. In addition, Mr. Sample will receive full health and insurance benefits, at Data Criticals expense, for one year after his
termination.

          Data Critical also entered into a letter agreement with Stephen E. Hannah, vice president of research and
development and product management of VitalCom. Pursuant to the letter agreement, upon the effective date of the merger, Mr. Hannah will serve as the vice president of engineering of Data Critical, and will no longer serve as vice president of
research and development and product management at VitalCom. The term of the letter agreement will begin upon the effective date of the merger and end on the earlier of Mr. Hannahs termination of employment or March 12, 2002. Data Critical and
Mr. Hannah each have the right to terminate Mr. Hannahs employment at any time, except that Data Critical has agreed that it will not terminate Mr. Hannahs employment for any reason other than cause (as defined in the letter agreement)
at any time prior to January 1, 2002. Under the letter agreement, Data Critical will pay Mr. Hannah an annual base salary of $180,000 and grant him options to purchase 20,000 shares of Data Critical common stock. These options will vest over a
period of four years from the date of grant. Vesting of these options will accelerate upon a change of control of Data Critical. If Data Critical terminates Mr. Hannahs employment without cause at any time before March 12, 2002, Data Critical
will pay him a severance payment of $90,000 in equal installments over a period of six months following his termination.

Proposed payment to VitalCom chief executive officer

          Frank T. Sample, VitalComs president and chief executive officer, entered into a letter agreement with
Warburg, Pincus Ventures L.P., Vertical Fund Associates L.P., Vertical Life Sciences, L.P., and ABS Capital Partners L.P., major stockholders of VitalCom common stock. The letter agreement was entered into as an inducement to Mr. Sample to accept
employment with Data Critical on terms different than those in his current employment agreement with VitalCom. Under the letter agreement, the stockholders will pay $125,000 to Mr. Sample at the closing of the merger. They will not make this
payment, however, if on the closing date Mr. Sample has revoked, rescinded or breached his agreement with Data Critical.

VitalCom stock options

          As of the close of business on March 12, 2001, VitalComs directors and executive officers held stock
options to purchase an aggregate of 1,165,234 shares of VitalCom common stock at exercise prices ranging from $0.60 to $4.00 per share. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all VitalCom options, including those held by directors and executive
officers, outstanding immediately prior to the merger will be assumed by Data Critical and will be converted into options to purchase shares of Data Critical common stock (subject to adjustment of the number of shares and exercise price of these
options by the exchange ratio).

Data Critical stock options

          Under the terms of the Data Critical 1999 Directors Stock Option Plan, Elizabeth H. Weatherman, as
Warburg, Pincus Ventures, L.P.s designee to Data Criticals board of directors, will be granted an option to purchase 15,000 shares of Data Critical common stock upon joining the Data Critical board of directors at the completion of the
merger and to grant Ms. Weatherman additional options to purchase 5,000 shares of Data Critical common stock at each Data Critical annual meeting of stockholders after the 2001 annual meeting,
provided that she has served continuously on the Data Critical Board of directors for six months prior to each such annual meeting.

Indemnification and insurance

          In the merger agreement Data Critical agreed that, after the closing of the merger, it will:



fulfill in all respects the obligations of VitalCom under its current indemnification agreements with its directors and
officers, as well as any indemnification provisions in VitalComs certificate of incorporation or bylaws as in effect on the date of the merger agreement;



indemnify the directors and officers of VitalCom against losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim
that relates to the merger or any transactions related to the merger; and



maintain, for six years after the consummation of the merger, policies of directors and officers liability
insurance comparable to those currently maintained by VitalCom, except that Data Critical is only obligated under the merger agreement to provide that level of insurance it can obtain for a premium of not more than 150% of the current premium paid
by VitalCom.

Material U.S. federal income tax consequences

          No gain or loss will be recognized by Data Critical or its stockholders as a result of the merger. The
following are the U.S. federal income tax consequences to VitalCom and its stockholders as a result of the merger. The following summary assumes that a stockholder holds his, her or its shares of VitalCom common stock as a capital asset. The
following discussion is based on and subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and its legislative history, applicable Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and court decisions currently in effect. All of these
are subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is also subject to other assumptions, limitations, representations and covenants, including those contained in the tax representation letters addressed to Higham,
McConnell & Dunning LLP, counsel to VitalCom, and Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, counsel to Data Critical. This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to each of VitalComs
stockholders in light of their particular circumstances, particularly if they are subject to special rules, such as rules relating to:



stockholders who are not citizens or residents of the United States;



stockholders that are financial institutions;



stockholders that are tax-exempt organizations;



stockholders that are insurance companies;



stockholders that are dealers in securities;



stockholders in whose hands the VitalCom common stock qualifies as qualified small business stock as described in section
1202 of the Code;



stockholders who are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code;



stockholders who acquired their shares of VitalCom common stock by exercising employee stock options or rights or otherwise
as compensation; and



stockholders who hold their shares of VitalCom common stock as part of a hedging, straddle, constructive sale, conversion or
other risk reduction transaction.

          On the date that the merger is completed (a) Higham, McConnell & Dunning LLP will deliver to VitalCom
and (b) Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP will deliver to Data Critical its opinion (subject to the qualifications discussed below) that the merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of section
368(a) of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Provided that the merger qualifies as a reorganization, the following federal income tax consequences will result:



No gain or loss will be recognized by VitalCom as a result of the merger;



No gain or loss will be recognized by VitalComs stockholders when they exchange their VitalCom common stock solely for
Data Critical common stock in the merger, except that gain or loss may be recognized with respect to cash received instead of a fractional share interest in Data Critical common stock;



The aggregate tax basis of the Data Critical common stock a VitalCom stockholder receives in the merger will be the same as
their aggregate tax basis in the VitalCom common stock surrendered in the merger, except that the aggregate tax basis in Data Critical common stock will be reduced by the tax basis allocable to any fractional share interest in Data Critical common
stock received in cash;



A VitalCom stockholder will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the cash received
instead of a fractional share interest in Data Critical common stock, measured by the difference between the amount of cash received and the portion of the tax basis of the shares of VitalCom common stock that is allocable to the fractional share
interest in Data Critical common stock. This gain or loss will be capital gain or loss;



The tax holding period of the Data Critical common stock a VitalCom stockholder receives in the merger will include the
period during which the VitalCom common stock was held before the merger; and



If any VitalCom stockholder successfully exercises their appraisal rights with respect to all of their shares of VitalCom
common stock, they will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes in respect of the cash payments they receive, provided the payment is neither essentially equivalent to a dividend within the meaning of section 302 of the Code nor has
the effect of a distribution of a dividend within the meaning of section 356(a)(2) of the Code. The gain or loss will be measured by the difference between the amount of cash received and the tax basis in the shares of VitalCom common stock. The
gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss for those shares of VitalCom common stock that have been held for more than one year at the time the merger is completed.

          The parties obligations to complete the merger are conditioned on receipt of a tax opinion (1) by Data
Critical from Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP and (2) by VitalCom from Higham, McConnell & Dunning LLP, regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the merger. The tax opinions are subject to certain assumptions and qualifications
and are based on the truth and accuracy of certain representations made by Data Critical and VitalCom, including representations in the certificates delivered to counsel by the management of Data Critical and VitalCom. The tax opinions are not
binding on the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or the courts. Data Critical and VitalCom do not intend to request a ruling from the IRS with respect to the merger. Accordingly, neither Data Critical nor VitalCom can assure you that the IRS will
not challenge the conclusions set forth in the tax opinions or that a court will not sustain such a challenge. Neither Data Critical nor VitalCom currently intends to waive the closing condition of receipt of a tax opinion.

          A successful IRS challenge to the status of the merger as a reorganization would result in VitalCom
stockholders recognizing gain or loss with respect to each share of VitalCom common stock surrendered in the merger. This gain or loss would equal the difference between (i) the fair market value, as of the time of the merger, of the shares of Data
Critical common stock received by a VitalCom stockholder in exchange for their VitalCom shares, including any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Data Critical common stock; and (ii) the stockholders tax basis in that share. In this
event, a VitalCom stockholders aggregate tax basis in the shares of Data Critical common stock received in the exchange would equal the fair market value of the Data Critical stock received, and the stockholders holding period for those
shares would begin the day after the closing date of the merger.

            A VitalCom stockholder that receives cash instead of a fractional share interest in Data Critical common
stock may be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 31% on the cash payments. Backup withholding will not apply, however, if the stockholder is (1) an exempt recipient (such as a corporation or financial institution) or is otherwise exempt from
backup withholding, (2) furnishes its taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding on the substitute Form W-9 included in the transmittal letter, or (3) provides a certificate of foreign status on Form
W-8.

This discussion is not intended to be a complete analysis or description of all potential U.S. federal
income tax consequences or any other consequences of the merger. Except as described herein, this summary does not address transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to or concurrently with the merger, whether or not such transactions are in
connection with the merger. In addition, this discussion does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or are contingent on, a stockholders individual circumstances. These circumstances include, for example, the fact that the
stockholder holds options, warrants and/or other convertible securities issued by VitalCom which are assumed, exercised or converted in connection with the merger. Moreover, this discussion does not address any non-income tax or any foreign, state
or local tax consequences of the merger. Accordingly, you are strongly urged to consult with your tax advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal, state, local or foreign income or other tax consequences to you of the merger.

Accounting treatment

          Data Critical intends to account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Under this method of accounting, Data Critical will allocate the purchase price among assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the completion of the merger. Data
Criticals results of operations will not include the results of VitalCom prior to the completion of the merger. Any excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible assets of VitalCom acquired will be recorded as goodwill and other
intangible assets and will be amortized by charges to operations under generally accepted accounting principles. These allocations will be made based upon valuations and other studies that have not yet been finalized.

Regulatory filings and approvals required to complete the merger

          Neither Data Critical nor VitalCom is aware of any material governmental or regulatory approval required for
completion of the merger, other than the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part and filing the certificate of merger in accordance with applicable corporate law of Delaware.

          It is a condition to the closing of the merger that the shares of Data Critical common stock to be issued in
the merger shall have been approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market, subject only to official notice of issuance. If the merger is completed, VitalCom common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Smallcap Market and will be deregistered
under the Exchange Act.

Resale restrictions

          All shares of Data Critical common stock received by VitalCom stockholders in the merger will be
unrestricted and freely transferable, other than shares of Data Critical common stock received by persons who are deemed to be affiliates (as that term is defined under the Securities Act) of VitalCom or Data Critical. Those stockholders will only
be able to resell their shares in accordance with the resale, volume and other provisions of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act or as otherwise permitted under the Securities Act. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of VitalCom or
Data Critical generally include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with, VitalCom or Data Critical and may include certain officers and directors of VitalCom or Data Critical as well as its principal
stockholders.

Voting agreements

          Certain officers and directors of VitalCom, together with certain entities affiliated with VitalCom
directors, have signed voting agreements in their capacity as VitalCom stockholders covering a total of approximately 61% of the outstanding shares of VitalCom common stock. Pursuant to those voting agreements, these VitalCom stockholders agreed
to:



vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement;



vote against any other proposal for the sale, merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
VitalCom; and



grant an irrevocable proxy in favor of representatives of Data Critical to vote their VitalCom shares in favor of adoption of
the merger agreement.

          The voting agreements effectively ensure that the required approval by VitalCom stockholders will be
obtained, regardless of whether or how other VitalCom stockholders vote their shares. This is true even if the VitalCom board of directors withdraws or modifies its unanimous recommendation that VitalCom stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the
merger agreement.

          Additionally, in most cases, the voting agreements substantially restrict these VitalCom stockholders
ability to dispose of their shares of Data Critical common stock for a period of 90 days following the effective time of the merger. In the case of those VitalCom stockholders who are also VitalCom employees, this restriction will generally end
earlier than 90 days if they do not continue to be employed by Data Critical after the merger.

          In Data Criticals voting agreement with Warburg, Pincus Ventures, L.P., Data Critical has agreed to
ensure that, at the effective time of the merger, one person designated by Warburg, Pincus shall be elected or otherwise appointed to the Data Critical board of directors. Data Critical has also agreed that from and after the effective time of the
merger, and for so long as Warburg, Pincus beneficially owns 10% or more of Data Criticals voting securities, Data Critical will nominate and solicit proxies for the re-election of the Warburg, Pincus director to the Data Critical board. If
Warburg, Pincus percentage ownership of Data Criticals voting securities falls below 10%, then the Warburg, Pincus director will immediately resign from the Data Critical board. Warburg, Pincus has agreed that if its director resigns
from Data Criticals board within six months after the effective time of the merger and, at the time of such resignation, Warburg, Pincus beneficially owns less than 5% of Data Criticals voting securities, then Warburg, Pincus will not
dispose of its shares of Data Critical common stock for a period of 180 days after such resignation.

TERMS OF THE MERGER

          The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the merger agreement. A copy of the merger
agreement is attached as Appendix A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. You are urged to read the merger agreement carefully. Although Data Critical and VitalCom believe that the description covers the
material terms of the merger agreement, this summary may not contain all the information that is important to you. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the merger agreement.

The merger

          Pursuant to the merger agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, at the
effective time of the merger:



Viper Acquisition Corp., or Viper, a wholly owned subsidiary of Data Critical, will merge with and into VitalCom;



Viper will cease to exist as a corporation;



VitalCom will remain as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Data Critical; and



all property, rights, debts and liabilities of VitalCom will remain the property, rights, debts and liabilities of
VitalCom.

Effective time of the merger

          The closing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will take place no later than the third
business day after the date on which all of the conditions to the merger are satisfied or waived, or at such other date as Data Critical and VitalCom agree.

          On the closing date, a certificate of merger will be filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware in
accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware law. The time at which the certificate of merger is filed in Delaware is referred to as the effective time.

Conversion of securities

          As a result of the merger, each share of VitalCom common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger, except for shares held by dissenting stockholders who have properly exercised their appraisal rights and shares held directly or indirectly by VitalCom and Data Critical, will be automatically converted into 0.62
shares of Data Critical common stock. Based on the capitalization of VitalCom on March 12, 2001, approximately 5,125,180 shares of Data Critical common stock will be issued.

          Each holder of a certificate representing shares of VitalCom common stock will, upon completion of the
merger, cease to have any rights with respect to such VitalCom common stock, except the right to receive, without interest, shares of Data Critical common stock and cash for fractional shares. If, prior to the effective time, Data Critical splits or
combines the shares of its common stock, or pays a stock dividend or other stock distribution in, or in exchange of shares of, its common stock, or engages in any similar transaction, then the exchange ratio will be appropriately
adjusted.

Employee plan and benefit arrangements

          Data Critical has agreed that all employees of VitalCom who continue employment with Data Critical after the
effective time will be eligible to participate in Data Criticals health, vacation and other non-equity based benefit plans.

            Data Critical also has agreed that, to the extent permitted by Data Criticals non-equity plans or
otherwise required by law, VitalCom employees who continue employment with Data Critical after the effective time will receive credit for all pre-merger service with VitalCom, but only to the extent that VitalCom credited this service for similar
purposes prior to the merger. In addition, Data Critical will, to the extent permitted under its benefit plans and applicable law, waive any waiting periods and any pre-existing condition limitations and waiting periods, and will provide that any
expenses incurred before the merger by those individuals will be taken into account under those plans for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible or copayment provisions already satisfied under VitalComs current policies.

          VitalCom employees who become employees of Data Critical after the effective time of the merger also will be
able to participate in Data Criticals equity-based benefit plans to the same extent as similarly situated Data Critical employees.

VitalCom stock options

          At the effective time of the merger, all options to purchase VitalCom common stock then outstanding under
VitalComs 1996 Stock Option Plan and 1993 Stock Option Plan will be assumed by Data Critical and will become options to purchase shares of Data Critical common stock. Each assumed option will be exercisable for that number of shares of Data
Critical common stock that is equal to the number of shares of VitalCom common stock that were issuable upon exercise of the option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, multiplied by the exchange ratio of 0.62, rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Data Critical common stock. As a result, Data Critical will be obligated to issue approximately 1,026,934 shares of Data Critical common stock upon exercise, if and when exercised, of all the VitalCom options that
Data Critical will assume in the merger. The exercise price of the assumed options shall be equal to the former exercise price per share of such VitalCom stock option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, divided by the exchange
ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

          The assumed VitalCom stock options will continue to have the same terms and conditions as the VitalCom stock
options immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

          No more than thirty days after the effective time of the merger, Data Critical will file, if necessary, one
or more registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act, or amendments to its own existing registration statements on Form S-8, in order to register the shares of Data Critical common stock issuable upon exercise of the assumed VitalCom
stock options.

Exchange of shares

          Promptly after the effective time of the merger, Data Criticals exchange agent will mail to each
holder of record of VitalCom common stock a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates representing shares of VitalCom common stock in exchange for certificates representing shares of Data Critical
common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares. Upon surrender of VitalCom stock certificates to the exchange agent together with a letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of a certificate will be entitled to receive a certificate
representing the number of whole shares of Data Critical common stock, and a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and any dividends or distributions with a record date after the effective time of the merger,
that such holder has the right to receive with respect to the certificates exchanged pursuant to the merger agreement.

        VitalCom stockholders should not send in their certificates until they receive a letter of transmittal from the
exchange agent instructing them to do so.

          No fractional shares of Data Critical common stock will be issued pursuant to the merger. In lieu of
fractional shares, cash will be paid in an amount, rounded to the nearest whole cent, equal to the product of the fractional share and the average of the last reported sales price of Data Critical common stock for the twenty consecutive trading days
ending on the trading day immediately preceding the effective time of the merger.

            No dividends on shares of Data Critical common stock will be paid to persons entitled to receive
certificates representing shares of Data Critical common stock until those persons surrender their certificates representing shares of VitalCom common stock. Upon such surrender, the person in whose name the certificates representing such shares of
Data Critical common stock will be issued will also receive any dividends that have become payable with respect to such shares of Data Critical common stock between the effective time of the merger and the time of surrender. Any person entitled to
receive dividends will not be entitled to receive interest on the dividends.

          If any certificates for shares of Data Critical common stock are to be issued in a name other than that in
which the certificate representing VitalCom common stock surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, the person requesting such exchange must pay to the exchange agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason thereof, or establish that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

          At the effective time of the merger, the stock transfer books of VitalCom will be closed and no further
transfers of shares of VitalCom common stock will be made.

          Neither the exchange agent nor any party to the merger agreement is liable to a holder of shares of VitalCom
common stock for any shares of Data Critical common stock or dividends thereon or the cash payment for fractional interests delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

          In the event that any certificate representing VitalCom common stock has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed must make an affidavit of that fact. If required by Data Critical in its discretion, such person must also post a bond in such sum as Data Critical may direct as indemnity, or provide
such other form of indemnity as Data Critical may reasonably direct, against any claim that may be made against Data Critical with respect to such certificate. Upon delivery of the affidavit of loss and the provision of indemnity, if any, the
exchange agent will issue in exchange for such certificate the applicable number of whole shares of Data Critical common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of VitalCom common stock represented by such certificate are
converted in the merger, together with any dividends or distributions that have a record date after the effective time and that such holder has the right to receive with respect to such certificate.

Conduct of VitalComs business prior to completion of the merger

          VitalCom has agreed to maintain its business and restrict its activities during the period between signing
the merger agreement and the effective time of the merger. During that period, VitalCom has agreed that,
except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement or consented to in writing by Data Critical in its sole discretion, VitalCom will carry on its business in the usual, regular and ordinary course in substantially the same manner as VitalCom did
before the merger agreement was executed. Additionally, among other things, VitalCom has agreed to:



conduct its business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations;



use its best efforts, consistent with its past practices and policies, to:



preserve intact its present business organization,



keep available the services of its present officers and employees, and



preserve its relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, licensors, licensees, and others with whom it has
business dealings; and



promptly notify Data Critical of any event involving VitalComs business or operations that VitalCom reasonably believes
could have a material adverse effect on VitalCom, either prior to or after the effective time of the merger.

          In addition, VitalCom has also agreed that, except as otherwise permitted under the terms of the merger
agreement or consented to in writing by Data Critical in its sole discretion, VitalCom will conduct its business in compliance with certain specific restrictions relating to the following:

          Before the effective time of the merger, however, VitalCom may continue negotiations and enter into
commercial agreements with specified customers with Data Criticals consent. Data Critical may not
unreasonably withhold its consent if the negotiations or agreements are not manifestly adverse to Data Critical or do not adversely impact Data Criticals commercial relationships. VitalCom may also negotiate and enter into a credit facility
with Silicon Valley Bank. VitalCom has agreed to keep Data Critical actively and consistently apprised of all such negotiations and agreements.

          The agreements related to the conduct of VitalComs business prior to the effective time of the merger
are complicated and not easily summarized. You are urged to carefully read the section of the merger agreement entitled Conduct of Business of Target.

Conduct of Data Criticals business prior to completion of the merger

          Data Critical has agreed to maintain its business and restrict its activities during the period between
signing the merger agreement and the effective time of the merger. During that period, Data Critical has agreed that, except as provided in the merger agreement or consented to in writing by VitalCom, Data Critical will carry on its business in the
usual, regular and ordinary course in substantially the same manner as Data Critical did before the merger agreement was executed. Additionally, Data Critical has agreed:

merger are complicated and not easily summarized. You are urged to carefully read the section of the merger agreement entitled Conduct of Business of Acquiror.

take all action necessary to convene the Data Critical special meeting as promptly as practicable after the registration
statement is declared effective by the SEC;



use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of approval of the issuance of Data
Critical common stock in the merger;



file with Nasdaq a listing notice covering the shares of Data Critical common stock to be issued in connection with the

allocate and reserve severance and/or retention bonuses in a total amount not less than $250,000.

          The additional agreements and covenants made by the parties are complicated and not easily summarized. You
are urged to carefully read the section of the merger agreement entitled Additional Agreements.

No other negotiations involving VitalCom

          Under the terms of the merger agreement, VitalCom agreed that it will not, and it will not permit any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to, directly or indirectly:



solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or induce any VitalCom Acquisition Proposal (as defined below);



participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any VitalCom Acquisition Proposal;



furnish to any person any nonpublic information with respect to any VitalCom Acquisition Proposal;



take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be
expected to lead to any VitalCom Acquisition Proposal;



approve, endorse or recommend any VitalCom Acquisition Proposal; or



enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract, agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise
relating to any VitalCom Acquisition Transaction (as defined below).

            However, before the merger agreement has been adopted by the VitalCom stockholders, VitalCom may furnish
nonpublic information regarding VitalCom to, and may enter into a confidentiality agreement or enter into discussions or negotiations with, any person in response to a VitalCom Superior Offer (as defined below) if:



neither VitalCom nor any VitalCom representative has violated any of the restrictions set forth above with respect to the
solicitation of a VitalCom Acquisition Proposal in a manner that resulted in the making, submission or announcement of the VitalCom Superior Offer;



prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to any person or group who makes a VitalCom Superior Offer, VitalCom gives
Data Critical written notice of the identity of such person or group and of VitalComs intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions with, such person or group; and



contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to the same person or group, VitalCom furnishes the same
nonpublic information to Data Critical (to the extent it has not been previously furnished by VitalCom to Data Critical).

          VitalCom also agreed to:



advise Data Critical, as promptly as practicable, orally and in writing of:



any request for nonpublic information which VitalCom reasonably believes would lead to a VitalCom Acquisition Proposal;
or



any VitalCom Acquisition Proposal; or



any inquiry with respect to or which VitalCom reasonably should believe would lead to any VitalCom Acquisition Proposal;
and



provide Data Critical with at least the same notice as provided to the VitalCom board of directors of any meeting of the
VitalCom board of directors at which the VitalCom board of directors is reasonably expected to:



consider a VitalCom Acquisition Proposal or a VitalCom Superior Offer; or



approve, endorse or recommend a VitalCom Superior Offer to the stockholders of VitalCom.

          VitalCom may enter into negotiations, and may enter into an acquisition agreement, letter of intent or
agreement in principle, for a VitalCom Superior Offer if:



VitalComs board of directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such
action is required in order for VitalComs board of directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations to VitalComs stockholders under applicable law;



prior to entering into such negotiations, acquisition agreement, letter of intent or agreement in principle, VitalCom has
immediately notified Data Critical of receipt of any VitalCom Acquisition Proposal and of VitalComs interest in such proposal;



at least five days before accepting a VitalCom Superior Offer, VitalCom delivers to Data Critical written notice that the
VitalCom board of directors is prepared to accept the VitalCom Superior Offer;



if Data Critical chooses, VitalCom negotiates in good faith with Data Critical for five days in an attempt to modify the Data
Critical-VitalCom merger agreement so as to enable Data Critical to proceed with the merger; and



the acquisition agreement, letter of intent or agreement in principle is subject to the terms of the Data Critical-VitalCom
merger agreement and does not contain any termination, breakup or other punitive fee payable by VitalCom under any circumstances.

            If VitalCom enters into an acquisition agreement for a VitalCom Superior Offer after complying with the
above restrictions and conditions, then the VitalCom board of directors may withdraw its unanimous recommendation that the VitalCom stockholder vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. However, even if this happens, VitalCom must comply
with the terms of the merger agreement, including calling and conducting the VitalCom special meeting.

          A VitalCom Acquisition Proposal is any offer or proposal providing for any VitalCom Acquisition
Transaction, other than an offer or proposal by Data Critical.

          A VitalCom Acquisition Transaction is any transaction or series of related transactions, other
than the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement, involving any of the following:



any acquisition or purchase of more than a 20% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of VitalCom;



any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person or group beneficially owning 20% or more
of the total outstanding voting securities of VitalCom;



any merger or similar transaction pursuant to which the stockholders of VitalCom immediately preceding such transaction hold
less than 80% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity;



any sale, lease outside the ordinary course of business, exchange, transfer or license, acquisition or disposition of more
than 50% of the fair market value of the assets of VitalCom; or



any liquidation or dissolution of VitalCom.

          A VitalCom Superior Offer is any:



tender or exchange offer;



proposal for a merger, consolidation, amalgamation arrangement or other business combination or a recapitalization of,
VitalCom or any of its subsidiaries; or



proposal or offer to acquire in any manner a substantial equity interest in, or a substantial portion of the assets of,
VitalCom or any of its subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

that the VitalCom board of directors determines in good faith to be more favorable to its stockholders than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and
for which financing is committed or for which, in the good faith judgment of the VitalCom board of directors, financing is reasonably capable of being obtained by the party making the proposal or offer.

No other negotiations involving Data Critical

          Under the terms of the merger agreement, Data Critical agreed that it will not, and it will not permit any
of its officers, directors, employees or agents to, directly or indirectly:



solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or induce any Data Critical Acquisition Proposal (as defined below);



participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Data Critical Acquisition Proposal;



furnish to any person any nonpublic information with respect to any Data Critical Acquisition Proposal;



take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be
expected to lead to any Data Critical Acquisition Proposal;



approve, endorse or recommend any Data Critical Acquisition Proposal; or



enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract, agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise
relating to any Data Critical Acquisition Transaction (as defined below).

            However, before approval of the issuance of Data Critical common stock in the merger by the Data Critical
stockholders, Data Critical may furnish nonpublic information regarding Data Critical to, and may enter into a confidentiality agreement or enter into discussions or negotiations with, any person in response to a Data Critical Superior Offer (as
defined below) if:



neither Data Critical nor any Data Critical representative shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth above with
respect to the negotiation and solicitation of a Data Critical Acquisition Proposal;



prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to any person or group who makes a Data Critical Superior Offer, Data
Critical gives VitalCom written notice of the identity of such person or group and of Data Criticals intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions with, such person or group; and



contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to the same person or group, Data Critical furnishes the
same nonpublic information to VitalCom (to the extent it has not been previously furnished by Data Critical to VitalCom).

          Data Critical also agreed to:



advise, as promptly as practicable, VitalCom orally and in writing of:



any request for nonpublic information which Data Critical reasonably believes would lead to a Data Critical Acquisition
Proposal; or



any Data Critical Acquisition Proposal; or



any inquiry with respect to, or which Data Critical reasonably should believe would lead to, any Data Critical Acquisition
Proposal; and



provide VitalCom with at least the same notice as provided to the Data Critical board of directors of any meeting of the Data
Critical board of directors at which the Data Critical board of directors is reasonably expected to:



consider a Data Critical Acquisition Proposal or a Data Critical Superior Offer; or



approve, endorse or recommend a Data Critical Superior Offer to the stockholders of Data Critical.

          The Data Critical board of directors may withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its unanimous recommendation in
favor of the issuance of shares of Data Critical common stock in connection with the merger if:



a Data Critical Superior Offer is made and not withdrawn; and



the Data Critical board of directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such
action is required in order for the Data Critical board of directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations to Data Criticals stockholders under applicable law.

          A Data Critical Acquisition Proposal is any offer or proposal relating to any Data Critical
Acquisition Transaction, other than an offer or proposal by VitalCom.

          A Data Critical Acquisition Transaction is any transaction or series of related transactions,
other than with VitalCom, involving any of the following:



any acquisition or purchase of more than a 50% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of Data
Critical;



any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person or group beneficially owning 50% or more
of the total outstanding voting securities of Data Critical;



any merger or similar transaction pursuant to which the stockholders of Data Critical immediately preceding such transaction
hold less than 50% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity;



any sale, lease outside the ordinary course of business, exchange, transfer, license outside the ordinary course of business,
acquisition or disposition of more than 50% of the assets of Data Critical; or



any liquidation or dissolution of Data Critical.

          A Data Critical Superior Offer is any:



tender or exchange offer;



proposal for a merger, consolidation, amalgamation arrangement or other business combination or a recapitalization of, Data
Critical or any of its subsidiaries; or



proposal or offer to acquire in any manner a substantial equity interest in, or a substantial portion of the assets of, Data
Critical or any of its subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated or permitted by the merger agreement,

that the Data Critical board of directors determines in good faith to be more favorable to its stockholders than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
and for which financing is committed or for which, in the good faith judgment of the Data Critical board of directors, financing is reasonably capable of being obtained by the party making the proposal or offer. Partnerships, joint ventures, virtual
joint ventures and other similar arrangements entered into by Data Critical in the ordinary course of its business are not included in the definition of a Data Critical Superior Offer.

Indemnification

          Data Critical agreed that, after completion of the merger:



it will cause VitalCom to fulfill the obligations of VitalCom under the indemnification agreements between VitalCom and its
directors and officers in existence immediately before the merger and any indemnification provisions in VitalComs certificate of incorporation or bylaws as in effect on March 12, 2001;



the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of VitalCom will contain indemnification provisions at least as favorable as
those in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of VitalCom as in effect on March 12, 2001, and these provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for six years after the merger in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights of individuals who, immediately prior to the effectiveness of the merger, were directors, officers, employees or agents of VitalCom, unless the modification is required by law;



it will indemnify and hold harmless the directors and officers of VitalCom against losses incurred in connection with any
claim that relates to the merger or any transaction that relates to the merger;



it will cause VitalCom to maintain in effect, if available, directors and officers liability insurance for those
persons who were covered by VitalComs directors and officers liability insurance on the date of the merger agreement, on terms comparable to those applicable to such persons and at premiums not to exceed 150% of those currently
paid by VitalCom; and



in the event that Data Critical consolidates with, merges into, or transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, it will make proper provision so that the successors and assigns of Data Critical assume the obligations with respect to directors and officers liability insurance set forth above.

additional conditions, any of which may be waived by Data Critical, including, among others, the following:

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

          The following unaudited pro forma condensed combining financial information gives effect to the merger using
the purchase method of accounting, after giving effect to the pro forma adjustments described in the accompanying notes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combining financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited historical
consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto of Data Critical and Elixis Corporation, which was acquired by Data Critical on April 3, 2000, and Paceart Associates, L.P., which was acquired by Data Critical on September 11, 2000 and
the audited historical consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto of VitalCom. These acquisitions were all accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.



The audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto of Data Critical are included in its annual report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000 which is attached as Appendix E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.



The audited financial statements and notes thereto of Paceart Associates, L.P. are included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.



The audited historical consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto of VitalCom are included in its annual
report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000 which is attached as Appendix F to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

          The unaudited pro forma condensed combining balance sheet data as of December 31, 2000 gives effect to the
merger of Data Critical and VitalCom as if it had occurred on December 31, 2000. The unaudited pro forma condensed combining statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 is presented to give effect to the acquisitions of Elixis and
Paceart by Data Critical and to the acquisition of VitalCom by Data Critical as if all of these transactions had occurred on January 1, 2000.

          The unaudited pro forma condensed combining financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the
results of operations or the financial position which would have occurred had the VitalCom merger and the acquisitions of Elixis and Paceart been completed at those times, nor are they necessarily indicative of future results of operations or
financial position. Management of Data Critical and VitalCom believe that additional synergies and operational improvements not reflected in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combining statements of operations will be realized by the
combined enterprise. These amounts cannot be reasonably quantified and, therefore, are not reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combining statements of operations.

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF

DATA CRITICAL CAPITAL STOCK AND VITALCOM CAPITAL STOCK

          The following discussion summarizes the material differences between the holders of Data Critical common
stock and holders of VitalCom common stock under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Data Critical and of VitalCom, and Data Criticals Preferred Share Rights Agreement. This summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety
by the provisions of each companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the Delaware General Corporation Law and Data Criticals Preferred Share Rights Agreement. Copies of Data Criticals charter documents and Data
Criticals Preferred Share Rights Agreement are filed as exhibits to Data Criticals registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part.

          After completion of the merger, the holders of VitalCom common stock will become stockholders of Data
Critical. Because Data Critical and VitalCom are both Delaware corporations, the rights of former VitalCom stockholders will continue to be governed by Delaware law.

Stockholder action without a meeting.

          Under Delaware law, any action required to be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders may also
be taken without a meeting by written consent signed by all of the stockholders whose vote would be required if a vote were taken on the action at a meeting. A corporation may alter this provision in its certificate of incorporation. VitalComs
certificate of incorporation provides that stockholder action may be taken without a meeting by unanimous written consent. Under Data Criticals certificate of incorporation, no stockholder action may be taken without a meeting.

Right to call a special meeting of stockholders.

          The Delaware General Corporation Law provides that special meetings of stockholders may be called by the
board of directors and by persons specifically authorized in the corporations certificate of incorporation or bylaws. Under VitalComs bylaws, a special meeting of stockholders may be called by holders of at least 50% of VitalComs
outstanding capital stock. Data Criticals bylaws state that a special meeting may be called only by the board, the chairman or the president.

Number and composition of the board of directors.

          The DGCL requires that a corporations board of directors consist of at least one member, and provides
that the specific number of directors be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the bylaws. The VitalCom bylaws provide for a board of four to seven members. At the time of adoption of VitalComs bylaws, the specific number of directors was
four, which can only be changed by an amendment to the bylaws. Data Criticals bylaws set the number of directors at seven, which number can be changed at any time by a resolution of the board or stockholders.

          In addition, the DGCL states that a corporation may divide its directors into one, two or three classes in
its certificate of incorporation or in a bylaw adopted by stockholders. Data Criticals certificate of incorporation, in an amendment adopted by its stockholders on May 17, 1999, divides its board of directors into three classes, as nearly
equal in number as possible. The term of office of the first class of directors designated in that amendment expired at the 2000 annual meeting of stockholders; the term of the second class of directors will expire at the 2001 annual meeting, and
the term of the third class will expire at the 2002 annual meeting. VitalComs board of directors is not divided into classes.

Data Critical series A participating preferred stock.

          Data Critical entered into a Preferred Share Rights Agreement dated June 15, 2000, with ChaseMellon
Shareholder Services, L.L.C. as rights agent. The following description of the rights agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms and conditions of the rights agreement, which should be read carefully.
See Where you can find more information on page 4 for information about obtaining a copy of Data Criticals rights agreement.

          Under Data Criticals rights agreement, Data Criticals board of directors declared a dividend
distribution of one right to purchase 1/1000 of a share of Data Criticals series A preferred stock for each outstanding share of Data Critical common stock. The rights attach to each share that was outstanding at the time of the adoption of
the agreement, and all other common stock issued prior to:



the earlier of the date that occurs:



10 days after a public announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the
outstanding shares of Data Critical common stock; and



10 business days after the commencement of, or announcement of, an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer which
would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Data Critical common stock, which was or becomes outstanding prior to the distribution (the earlier of these dates is referred to as the
Distribution Date);



the expiration of the rights on July 21, 2010; and



the date the rights are redeemed by the board of directors of Data Critical.

          The rights will attach to the Data Critical shares issued to the VitalCom stockholders in connection with
the merger described in this registration statement.

          The rights do not become exercisable until the distribution date of the rights. Under the agreement, the
distribution date will not occur as the result of any transaction that was previously approved by Data Criticals board of directors and stockholders, even if more than 20% of Data Criticals shares become owned by a person or group. As a
result, the merger between Data Critical and VitalCom will not cause the distribution date to occur.

          Upon becoming exercisable, each right will entitle the holder to purchase one-thousandth of a share of Data
Critical Series A participating preferred stock for the exercise price of the right. Additionally, if any person or group of persons actually acquires beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Data Critical common stock, each
holder of a rightother than the rights owned by the acquiring person or groupwill also have the right to purchase that number of common shares of Data Critical having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the right. The
exercise price of the rights is $75.00, subject to the appropriate adjustments.

          In the event of a transaction with a publicly traded company where Data Critical is acquired or consolidated
with that public company or sells or transfers either 50% or more of its assets or assets accounting for 50% of Data Criticals earning power to that public company, the rights will also entitle the holder to purchase for the exercise price
that number of common shares of such public company having a market value equal to two times the exercise price.

          The rights are redeemable prior to the distribution date for $.01 per right. After the closing of any
transaction initially giving rise to the distribution date, the board of directors of Data Critical can elect to exchange each right for one share of Data Critical common stock without payment of the exercise price.

          The Data Critical Series A participating preferred stock which can be purchased by exercise of the
rights:



will not be redeemable;



will be entitled to a minimum preferential quarterly dividend payment of 1000 times the dividend declared per common share,
if any;



in the event of liquidation, will be entitled to a minimum preferential liquidation payment of $1,000 per share or 1,000
times the payment made per share of Data Critical common stock, whichever is greater;



will entitle the holder to vote with the common stock, but each share shall be entitled to 1,000 votes; and



will be entitled to 1,000 times the per share amount of any distribution received in respect of Data Critical common
stock.

          The rights expire on July 21, 2010 unless they are redeemed earlier.

          The rights may have the effect of deterring takeovers. The rights will cause substantial dilution to a
person or group that attempts to acquire Data Critical on terms not approved by the Data Critical board of directors. The rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the Data Critical board of directors
prior to the time that a person or group has acquired 20% beneficial ownership since the rights may be redeemed or amended by Data Critical until such time.

THE ANNUAL MEETING OF DATA CRITICAL STOCKHOLDERS

OTHER PROPOSALS

          Data Critical is providing this information to Data Critical stockholders in connection with the
solicitation of proxies by the Data Critical board of directors for use at the Data Critical annual meeting and any adjournments or postponements of the annual meeting. For information about the Data Critical merger proposal, see the description
above under The annual meeting of Data Critical stockholdersData Critical merger proposal beginning on page 38.

Purpose of the annual meeting

          At the annual meeting, Data Critical stockholders will:



consider and vote on the Data Critical merger proposal as described above in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus;



consider a proposal to amend the Data Critical 1999 Stock Option Plan to increase the total number of shares that can be
issued under the plan (Proposal No. 2);



elect two Class II directors to hold office until the third annual meeting of stockholders following their election or until
their successors are elected and qualified (Proposal No. 3);



be asked to ratify the boards appointment of Arthur Andersen LLP as Data Criticals independent public accountants
for the 2001 fiscal year (Proposal No. 4); and



consider such other business as may properly come before the annual meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the annual
meeting.

Recommendation of the Data Critical board of directors

          The Data Critical board recommends that Data Critical stockholders vote FOR amendment of the
Data Critical 1999 Stock Option Plan, FOR election of each of the nominees for director and FOR the ratification of the boards appointment of Arthur Andersen LLP as Data Criticals independent public
accounts.

Record date and voting power

          Only Data Critical stockholders of record at the close of business on the record date of May 4, 2001 are
entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the annual meeting. As of this record date, there were approximately 11,949,323 shares of Data Critical common stock issued and outstanding and approximately 181 holders of record of Data Critical common stock.
Each stockholder of record of Data Critical common stock is entitled to cast one vote per share on each matter submitted for stockholder approval.

Voting and revocation of proxies

          Votes may be cast in person or by a properly executed proxy on each matter properly submitted for the vote
of the stockholders at the annual meeting. All properly executed proxies that are not revoked will be voted at the annual meeting in accordance with the instructions contained in the proxy.

          A stockholder who has executed and returned a proxy may revoke it at any time before it is voted at the
annual meeting by:



executing and delivering to Data Criticals secretary a proxy for the same shares but bearing a later date;



delivering to Data Criticals secretary a written notice of revocation; or



attending the annual meeting and voting in person. Merely attending the annual meeting, however, will not in and of itself
revoke a proxyyou must vote your shares in person in order for your previously-delivered proxy to be revoked.

Quorum; required vote

          The presence, in person or by proxy, at the annual meeting of holders of a majority of the shares of Data
Critical common stock outstanding as of the close of business on the record date is necessary to constitute a quorum at the annual meeting. Abstentions and broker nonvotes will count toward establishing a quorum.

          Broker nonvotes will have no effect on any of the proposals to be considered at the annual meeting because
they will not represent votes cast on any proposal. An abstention will have no effect on the election of directors, but will have the same effect as a vote against amending the Data Critical 1999 Stock Option Plan and the same effect as a vote
against ratifying the boards appointment of Arthur Andersen LLP as Data Criticals independent public accountants.

          If you are a Data Critical stockholder and you sign, date and return your proxy without indicating how you
wish to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote FOR all the proposals submitted at the Data Critical annual meeting.

          On the record date for the annual meeting, the directors and officers of Data Critical owned approximately
1,272,712 shares, or 10.7% of the outstanding shares of Data Critical common stock entitled to vote at the annual meeting.

Solicitation of proxies

          In addition to soliciting by mail, the directors, Data Criticals officers, employees and agents may
solicit proxies from stockholders by personal interview, telephone, telegram or otherwise. Data Critical will bear the costs of soliciting proxies from its stockholders, except that Data Critical and VitalCom will each pay one-half of the cost of
printing this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Data Critical will also arrange with brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries who are record holders of Data Critical common stock for forwarding solicitation materials to the
beneficial owners of our common stock. Data Critical will reimburse these brokers, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses they incur in connection with forwarding solicitation materials. Data Critical has
engaged Mellon Investor Services L.L.C. to distribute proxy solicitation materials to brokers, banks and other nominees and to assist in soliciting proxies from Data Critical stockholders for a fee of approximately $4,500 plus reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses.

Other matters

          At the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the Data Critical board of directors does not know of
any business to be presented at the annual meeting other than the proposals described in the notice accompanying this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Should any other matter properly be brought before the annual meeting by Data Criticals
board of directors, a supplement or amendment to this joint proxy statement/prospectus describing the matter will be sent to all Data Critical stockholders entitled to vote.

PROPOSAL NO. 2

AMENDMENT OF THE DATA CRITICAL CORPORATION 1999 STOCK OPTION PLAN

          At the annual meeting, Data Criticals stockholders will be asked to approve an amendment of the Data
Critical Corporation 1999 Stock Option Plan, or 1999 Plan, to:



reserve an additional 750,000 shares of common stock for a total of 2,700,937 reserved for issuance, including the previously
approved annual increase for fiscal 2001; and



extend to years 2005 and 2006 the previously approved annual increase in each of the fiscal years beginning in 2000 and
ending in 2004, which increase equals the lesser of (i) 250,000 shares, (ii) 2% of our outstanding stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (iii) a lesser number of shares, as determined by Data Criticals board of
directors.

          The following summary highlights the principal features of the 1999 Plan. This summary does not completely
describe the plan or all of its provisions. A complete copy of the 1999 Plan is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix G.

General

          Data Criticals board of directors adopted the 1999 Plan in May 1999. The board has reserved, subject
to stockholder approval, 750,000 additional shares of common stock for issuance. The board believes that attracting qualified employees, officers and consultants and providing incentives to Data Criticals current employees, officers,
non-employee directors and consultants requires grants of options to purchase Data Critical common stock. Accordingly, the board recommends that you vote FOR amendment of the 1999 Plan.

          Options granted under the 1999 Plan are either incentive stock options, or ISOs, within the meaning of the
Code, or nonstatutory stock options, or NSOs. Information concerning the federal income tax treatment of both ISOs and NSOs is set forth below.

Purpose

          The purpose of the 1999 Plan is to attract and retain the best available personnel to Data Critical, to
provide additional incentives to employees, officers, consultants and non-employee directors and to promote the success of Data Criticals business.

Administration

          Data Criticals board of directors or a committee of directors appointed by the board administers the
1999 Plan. The board may modify the committees composition to satisfy applicable laws if it wishes to qualify options granted under the 1999 Plan as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code or qualify those options for
exemption under Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

          Under the 1999 Plan, the administrator determines:



who among the eligible persons will receive option grants;



the size and type of each grant; and



the terms and conditions of each grant.

          The administrator may delegate its authority to grant options to a Data Critical officer.

Eligibility

          Options may be granted to employees (including officers and directors who are also employees) and
consultants (including non-employee directors) of Data Critical. Only Data Critical employees are eligible to receive ISO grants whereas employees, non-employee directors and consultants may receive NSO grants. The plan administrator selects the
optionees and determines the number of shares and the exercise price of each option. The plan administrator makes this determination by accounting for the optionees duties and
responsibilities, the value of the optionees services, the optionees present and potential contribution to the Data Criticals success and other relevant factors. As of March 31, 2001, approximately 130 employees, officers,
consultants and directors were eligible to participate in the 1999 Plan.

          The 1999 Plan also limits each optionee to an aggregate market value of $100,000 for all shares treated as
ISOs during any calendar year. Any shares in excess of this amount will be deemed NSOs.

Additional information regarding the 1999 Plan

          The SECs proxy rules require Data Critical to provide information regarding future participation in
plans for which stockholder approval is required. Because awards under the 1999 Plan are discretionary, Data Critical cannot currently determine the size of grants, or the recipients of those grants, to be made under the 1999 Plan in 2001. The
following table lists, for purposes of comparison, the options granted in 2000 under the 1999 Plan:

          As of May 4, 2001, the price of Data Critical common stock was $1.76 as reported on the Nasdaq National
Market.

Terms of options

          The plan administrator sets the terms of options granted under the 1999 Plan and the stock option agreement
between Data Critical and the optionee. Each option is subject to the following additional terms and conditions:

Exercise of the Option
.    Options vest and become exercisable during the
optionees service with Data Critical. The plan administrator sets the vesting schedule for each option. To exercise an option, an optionee must provide Data Critical with written notice of exercise that specifies the number of shares to be
purchased. The optionee must also pay the purchase price by a method approved by the plan administrator.

Exercise Price
.    The plan administrator sets the exercise price of options
granted under the 1999 Plan. In the case of ISOs, the exercise price must be at least equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, based upon the closing price of Data Critical common stock on the Nasdaq National Market as of
the date of grant. ISOs granted to stockholders who own more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all
classes of Data Critical capital stock, are subject to the additional restriction that the exercise price on such options must equal at least 110% of the fair market value on the date of the grant. The exercise price of NSOs shall be determined by
the plan administrator, 
provided, that
, NSOs granted to a covered employee under Section 162(m) of the Code are subject to the additional restriction that the exercise price on those options must be at least 100% of the fair
market value on the date of grant if the options are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under the Internal Revenue Code.

Nontransferability of Options
.    An optionee may not transfer an ISO, except in
his or her will or under the laws of descent and distribution. An ISO many be exercised only by the optionee during his or her lifetime or, in the event of death, by a person who acquires the right to exercise the option by bequest or inheritance.
The plan administrator may allow transfers of NSOs at its discretion.

Acceleration of Option
.    Upon a merger, consolidation or sale of all or
substantially all of Data Criticals assets, except a merger or consolidation in which the holders of more than 50% of Data Critical capital stock continue to hold more than 50% of the voting stock in the merged corporation, an event referred
to in the 1999 Plan as a change of control, each outstanding option will accelerate so that 50% of the unvested shares covered by each option, up to a maximum of 50% of all unvested shares covered by all options held by the optionee, shall become
fully vested. 100% of the unvested portion of an option held by a Data Critical executive officer shall accelerate if, within 12 months after a change of control of Data Critical, the executive officers employment is terminated by Data
Critical other than for Cause (as defined in the 1999 Plan) or by the optionee for Good Reason (as defined in the 1999 Plan).

          The plan administrator also may automatically accelerate any outstanding options upon a change of control,
but only if the acceleration does not interfere with pooling of interests accounting treatment of the transaction. The plan administrator shall either substitute or assume options by the successor corporation, give written notice of acceleration of
the optionees right to exercise his or her outstanding options in part or in full at any time within five days of the notice, or terminate each option in its entirety in exchange for cash, securities or other property.

Adjustments upon changes in capitalization

          If a change in Data Criticals capitalization, such as a stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, combination or reclassification, results in an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding shares of common stock of Data Critical without Data Critical receiving any consideration for the additional shares, the exercise price of
each outstanding option, the number of shares subject to each option, the annual limitation on grants to employees, and the number of shares available for issuance under the 1999 Plan shall be appropriately adjusted. Each option will terminate upon
the proposed dissolution or liquidation of Data Critical, unless otherwise provided by the plan administrator.

Amendment and termination

          Data Criticals board of directors may amend the 1999 Plan at any time or may terminate it without
approval of the stockholders except as required by applicable law or rules. However, no action by the board or the stockholders may alter or impair any option previously granted under the 1999 Plan without mutual agreement between the optionee and
the board. The 1999 Plan terminates in May 2009, except that any options outstanding under the plan at that time shall remain outstanding until those options expire by their terms.

Federal income tax consequences

          The following briefly summarizes the U.S. federal income tax consequences of transactions under the 1999
Plan based on federal income tax laws in effect on the date of this registration statement. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and does not address all matters that may be relevant to a particular optionee based on his or her specific
circumstances. The summary addresses only current U.S. federal income tax law and expressly does not discuss the income tax laws of any state, municipality, non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction or gift,
estate or other tax laws other than federal income tax law. Data Critical advises all optionees to consult their own tax advisor concerning the tax implications of option grants and exercises and the disposition of stock acquired upon such
exercises, under the plan.

Incentive Stock Options
.    In general, upon either the grant or the exercise of
an ISO an employee will not realize taxable income nor will Data Critical realize an income tax deduction. In general, however, the excess of the fair market value of the shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of an ISO (determined at the
time of exercise) over the exercise price of the ISO will be considered income for purposes of the alternative minimum tax. If the optionee does not sell the shares received pursuant to the exercise of the ISO before either (i) two years after the
date of the grant of the ISO or (ii) one year after the date of exercise, a subsequent sale of those shares will result in long-term capital gain treatment to the optionee and no tax deduction to Data Critical.

          However, if the optionee disposes of those shares within either of the above mentioned time periods, the
recipient will generally realize as ordinary income an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the fair market value of the common stock on the date of exercise over the exercise price, or (ii) the amount realized upon disposition over the exercise price.
In this case, Data Critical generally will be entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount the optionee must recognize as ordinary income. Any gain in excess of the amount the optionee must realize as ordinary income would be taxed at the
rates applicable to short-term or long-term capital gains (depending on the holding period).

Nonqualified Stock Options
.    Upon grant of a NSO, an optionee generally will
not realize any taxable income nor will Data Critical receive a deduction. Upon exercise of a NSO, the optionee generally will receive ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise
over the exercise price. If the optionee later sells the shares, he or she will recognize a short-term or long-term capital gain or loss depending upon the holding period. Data Critical generally may take a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary
income recognized by the optionee.

All Options
.    The following also applies to both ISOs and NSOs: (i) any
entitlement of Data Critical to a tax deduction is subject to the applicable tax rules (including, without limitation, Section 162(m) of the Code regarding a $1,000,000 limitation on deductible compensation), and (ii) if the exercisability or
vesting of any option accelerates because of a change of control, payments relating to the option (or a portion thereof), either alone or together with certain other payments, may constitute parachute payments under Section 280G of the Code, under
which excess amounts may be subject to excise taxes and a loss of deductibility for Data Critical or the resulting entity.

          In general, Section 162(m) of the Code denies a publicly held corporation a deduction for federal income tax
purposes for compensation of more than $1,000,000 per year paid to its chief executive officer and the other named executive officers whose compensation is disclosed in its proxy statement, subject to specific exceptions. Options generally qualify
under one of these exceptions if they are granted under a plan that states the maximum number of shares that may be granted to any recipient during a specified period, if the plan under which the options are granted is approved by stockholders and
the plan is administered by a compensation committee comprised exclusively of outside directors. Data Critical intends the 1999 Plan to satisfy these requirements.

Required vote

          Approval of the amendment of the 1999 Plan to reserve 750,000 additional shares for issuance requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Data Critical common stock present at the annual meeting in person or by proxy.

Recommendation of Data Criticals board of directors

Data Criticals board of directors recommends that Data Critical stockholders vote FOR
approval of the amendment of the 1999 Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 1999 Plan by 750,000.

PROPOSAL NO. 3

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

Nominees

          Data Criticals bylaws provide that its board of directors shall be composed of seven directors. Data
Criticals board currently consists of seven directors and is divided into three classes so that there is as near an equal number of directors in each class as possible. Every director generally holds office for a three-year term and until the
election and qualification of his or her successor.

          At the annual meeting, Data Criticals stockholders will elect two Class II directors each for a term
of approximately three years ending at the 2004 annual meeting of stockholders or until his successor is elected and qualified. If any nominee becomes unavailable for any reason, the proxy holders intend to cast votes for a substitute nominee
designated by the board or the proxy holders to fill such resulting vacancy, or in the alternative, the size of the board may be reduced in accordance with Data Criticals bylaws. If elected, Mr. Middlemas will serve until Data Criticals
merger with VitalCom becomes effective; he will resign from the board if and on the date that the merger becomes effective. The Data Critical board has no reason to believe that the other nominee named below will be unable to serve if
elected.

          Assuming a quorum is present at the annual meeting, the two nominees who receive the highest number of votes
at the meeting will be elected. If additional persons are nominated for election as directors, the proxy holders intend to vote all proxies received by them in favor of the election of as many of the nominees listed below as possible, and, in such
event, the specific nominees to be voted for will be determined by the proxy holders.

          The board recommends that you vote FOR the election of all nominees for director.

          The names of the nominees, their ages as of March 31, 2001 and certain other information about them and the
other directors are set forth below.

Committees and meetings of the Data Critical board of directors

          Data Critical has established two standing committees of its board of directors, the audit committee and the
compensation committee. Each of these committees reports to the full board, and its activities are therefore subject to board approval. The functions performed by these committees are summarized below.

Audit Committee
.    The audit committee reviews our corporate accounting and
reporting practices, internal accounting controls, audit plans and results, investment policies and financial reports to ensure that our assets are appropriately safeguarded and to ensure the quality and integrity of our financial records. In
addition, the audit committee recommends to Data Criticals board the independent auditors to be retained by Data Critical. As of January 31, 2001, the date of the Audit Committee Report set forth below, the members of the audit committee were
Richard L. Earnest, John V. Atanasoff and George M. Middlemas. From January 5, 2001 until February 26, 2001, the audit committee consisted of John V. Atanasoff, Richard L. Earnest and George M. Middlemas. Each member of the audit committee was,
during the period of his service, independent of management as defined in NASD Market Rule 4200(a)(14). On February 26, 2001, Mr. Earnest became Data Criticals chief executive officer and a result was no longer eligible to serve on the audit
committee. As a result of Mr. Earnests ineligibility, the only remaining member of the board who is not an employee of Data Critical and who meets the qualifications to serve on the audit committee is Jeffrey Brown. Mr. Brown served as
president and chief executive officer of Data Critical until February 26, 2001. Consequently, Mr. Brown does not satisfy the independence NASD requirements for audit committee members. The NASD rules permit a listed company to appoint
one non-independent member to its audit committee under certain circumstances.

          Because of (i) the lack of any other qualified members of the board of directors to serve on the audit
committee, (ii) Mr. Browns familiarity with the companys practices, procedures and auditors, (iii) Mr. Browns financial and business expertise, (iv) the current need for a fully constituted audit committee, and (v) Mr. Browns
willingness to serve, the board of directors of Data Critical determined that it was required and in the best interest of Data Critical and its stockholders to appoint Mr. Brown to the audit committee. On April 13, 2001, the Data Critical board of
directors so appointed Mr. Brown to the audit committee. The current members of the audit committee are Messrs. Atanasoff, Middlemas and Brown.

          The audit committee met four times during 2000. The report of the audit committee is set forth below and its
charter is attached as Appendix H to this proxy statement/prospectus.

Compensation Committee
.    The compensation committee establishes salaries,
incentives and other forms of compensation for Data Criticals directors and executive officers. This committee also administers Data Criticals various incentive compensation and benefit plans, including stock option plans, and recommends
the establishment of policies relating to the incentive compensation and benefit plans. The compensation committee also administers Data Criticals 1994 Stock Option Plan, 1999 Stock Option Plan, 1999 Directors Stock Option Plan and 1999
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, the members of this committee were Ronald H. Kase, Richard L. Earnest and George M. Middlemas. Effective after the annual meeting, the compensation committee will consist
of Messrs. Atanasoff and Middlemas. The compensation committee met eleven times during 2000. The report of the compensation committee included in Data Criticals annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000 which is attached
as Appendix E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

          During the 2000 fiscal year, the Data Critical board of directors met eleven times. No director missed more
than 25% of the aggregate number of meetings of the board and meetings of the committees of the board on which he serves.

            The Data Critical board of directors does not have a nominating committee or a committee performing the
functions of a nominating committee. Data Criticals bylaws allow a nomination for a director to be made by stockholders in accordance with specific provisions contained in the bylaws. In order to nominate a director for election at the 2002
annual meeting of Data Critical stockholders, a stockholder must submit the nomination to the Assistant Secretary of Data Critical at the address of Data Criticals principal executive offices set forth above no less than 60 days or more than
90 days before the 2002 Data Critical stockholders meetingunless less than 60 days advance notice of the meeting is given, in which case the stockholders nomination must be received by Data Critical by the tenth day following the
mailing or announcement of the notice of stockholders meeting. Such nominations also must comply with the provisions set forth in our bylaws regarding director nominations.

PROPOSAL NO. 4

RATIFICATION OF BOARDS APPOINTMENT

INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

          At the annual meeting, Data Criticals stockholders will be asked to ratify the board of
directors appointment of Arthur Andersen LLP as Data Criticals independent public accountants. Arthur Andersen LLP has served as Data Criticals independent public accountants since 1995 and has been appointed by Data
Criticals board of directors to continue as independent public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2001. In the event that ratification of this selection of auditors is not approved by a majority of the shares of common stock
voting at the annual meeting in person or by proxy, the Data Critical board of directors will reconsider its selection of auditors.

          A representative of Arthur Andersen LLP is expected to be present at the annual meeting. This representative
will have an opportunity to make a statement and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

          The board recommends a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of Arthur Andersen LLP as Data
Criticals independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2001.

          The aggregate fees billed by Arthur Andersen LLP in the year 2000 for its audit of Data Criticals
consolidated financial statements for the year 2000 and for its reviews of Data Criticals interim consolidated financial statements was $78,500. Arthur Andersen LLP billed no fees in 2000 for information technology consulting. The aggregate
fees billed by Arthur Andersen LLP in 2000 for professional services other than audit and information technology consulting fees was $86,000. During 2000, none of the hours Arthur Andersen LLP expended on our financial audit were provided by persons
other than Arthur Andersen LLPs full-time permanent employees.

          Data Criticals audit committee has determined that Arthur Andersen LLPs rendering of all other
non-audit services is compatible with maintaining auditor independence.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

          As of the date of this report, the audit committee of the Data Critical board of directors was composed of
three independent directors (Richard L. Earnest, John V. Atanasoff and George M. Middlemas) and operates under a written charter adopted by the board of directors (attached as Appendix H). From January 5, 2001 through the date of this report, the
members of the audit committee were Mr. John V. Atanasoff and Messrs. Earnest and Middlemas.

          Data Criticals management is responsible for Data Criticals internal controls and financial
reporting process. Data Criticals independent auditors, Arthur Andersen LLP, are responsible for performing an independent audit of the companys consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
and to issue a report on its audit. The audit committees responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. In addition, the audit committee recommends to the full board of directors, subject to stockholder ratification, the selection
of Data Criticals independent accountants.

          In this context, the audit committee has met and held discussions with management and the independent
auditors. In addition, the members of the audit committee individually reviewed Data Criticals financial statements before their filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in our periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K. Management
represented to the audit committee that Data Criticals consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the audit committee reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial
statements with management and the independent accountants. The audit committee also discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, Communication with Audit
Committees.

          In addition, the committee has discussed with the independent auditors the auditors independence from
management and the Data Critical including the matters in the written disclosures required by the Independence Standards Boards Standard No. 1 Independence Discussions with Audit Committees, and considered the compatibility of
nonaudit services with the auditors independence.

          Based on the audit committees discussion with management and the independent accountants and its
review of the representation of management and the report of the independent auditors to the audit committee, the audit committee recommended that the board select, subject to stockholder approval, Arthur Andersen LLP as Data Criticals
independent auditors for the year ending December 31, 2001, and that the board include the audited consolidated financial statements in Data Criticals Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000, to be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Partners of Paceart Associates, L.P. :

          We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Paceart Associates, L.P. (a New Jersey limited
partnership) as of December 31, 1999 and the related statements of income, partners capital and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnerships management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

          We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

          In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Paceart Associates, L.P. as of December 31, 1999 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    THE PARTNERSHIP

          Paceart Associates, L.P. (the Partnership) was formed in 1992 for the purpose of developing
advanced computer technology for monitoring pacemaker, defibrillator and arrhythmia patients. The Partnerships technology is currently utilized in clinical, pharmaceutical research and consumer applications throughout the world.

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use of Estimates

          The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Concentration Risks

          The Partnership has cash balances that are held principally at one financial institution and may, at times,
exceed insurable amounts. The Partnership believes it has mitigated its risk by investing in or through major financial institutions. Recoverability is dependent upon the performance of the institution.

          Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the large number of
customers comprising the Partnerships customer base. The Partnership routinely assesses the financial strength of all of its customers.

Revenue Recognition

          Revenue on system sales is recognized under the completed contract method which is based upon training or
installation of the systems rather then shipment date. For systems not requiring installation or training, or sales of upgraded software; revenue is recognize based upon shipment date.

          Other revenue is derived from the sale of equipment consisting of phones, microphones, and various other
equipment.

          Costs incurred prior to revenue recognition are capitalized as work in progress in accordance with the
completed contract method.

Capitalized Software Costs

          In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed, the Partnership is required to capitalize certain computer software costs, which include product enhancements, after technological feasibility has been established. These costs are
amortized using the greater of the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for the product or a maximum of three years using the straight line method beginning when the
products are available for general release to customers. At December 31, 1999 and June 30, 2000, no software costs have been capitalized due to the fact that all costs incurred after technological feasibility of a product have been deemed to be
immaterial by the Partnership.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

          The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses,
and convertible notes payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amounts of outstanding borrowings approximate fair value.

PACEART ASSOCIATES, L.P.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

          The Partnership considers all short-term marketable securities having a maturity of three months or less to
be cash equivalents.

Inventories

          Inventories consist of parts used for system implementation and maintenance service and are stated at the
lower of cost (determined on a first-in, first-out basis) or market.

Furniture and Equipment

          Furniture and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful life of furniture, machinery and equipment is 5 years.

Other Current Assets

          Other current assets consists of costs of uncompleted contracts in excess of related billings.

Patents and Trademarks

          Patents and trademarks are being amortized on the straight-line method over a period of fourteen
years.

Long-Lived Assets

          The Partnership periodically reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Partnership does not believe that any such changes have taken place to date. Impairment of long-lived assets exists if, at a minimum, the future expected cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) from its operations are less than the carrying value of these assets. If such assets were considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying amount
of the assets exceeds the underlying fair value of the assets. Management performed a review of its long-lived assets and determined that no impairment of the respective carrying values had occurred for any periods presented in these financial
statements.

Income Taxes

          The Partnership accounts for income taxes under the liability method. Under the liability method, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amounts expected to be realized.

Comprehensive Income

          During 1999, the Partnership adopted SFAS No. 130 (SFAS 130), Reporting Comprehensive
Income. SFAS 130 establishes standards for reporting and presenting information on comprehensive income and its components (revenues, expenses, gains, losses, and currency translation adjustments) in the financial statements. Although the
adoption of this statement resulted in additional disclosure requirements, it did not have an effect on the Partnerships financial position or results of operations.

Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements

          In April 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 98-5, Reporting on
the Costs of Start-Up Activities. SOP 98-5 requires costs of start-up activities and organization costs be expensed
as incurred. The Partnership has accounted for start-up activities and organization costs in accordance with SOP 98-5.

          In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 133 (SFAS
133), Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
measured at its fair value. SFAS 133 requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. SFAS 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
1999. In July 1999, the FASB approved SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS 133, which amends SFAS 133 to be effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2000. As the Partnership currently does not engage in derivative instruments or hedging activities, adoption of this accounting principle will not have a material impact on the Partnerships financial position or
results of operations.

          In January 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Statement No.
99-17, Accounting of Barter Transactions, involving non-monetary exchanges of advertising. This EITF consensus does not impact the Partnerships operations, as the Partnership is not currently involved in any advertising barter
transactions.
