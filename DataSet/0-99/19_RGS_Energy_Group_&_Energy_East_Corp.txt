[ENERGY EAST LOGO]                                             [RGS ENERGY LOGO]

                  PROPOSED MERGER--YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

    The boards of directors of Energy East Corporation and RGS Energy
Group, Inc. have approved and adopted a merger agreement that contemplates the
merger of RGS Energy with and into Eagle Merger Corp., which will be a wholly
owned subsidiary of Energy East at the effective time of the merger. Eagle
Merger Corp. will be the corporation surviving the merger and, at the effective
time, will change its name to "RGS Energy Group, Inc."

    In exchange for each RGS Energy share, RGS Energy shareholders may elect to
receive $39.50 in cash, a number of Energy East shares valued at $39.50, subject
to restrictions on the maximum and minimum number of Energy East shares to be
issued, or a combination of cash and Energy East shares. The number of Energy
East shares to be exchanged for each RGS Energy share will be between 1.7626 and
2.3838, based on the average closing price of Energy East shares during the
20-trading-day period ending two trading days before the effective time of the
merger. If the average closing price of an Energy East share over such period is
more than $22.41, then the value of the Energy East shares delivered to RGS
Energy shareholders in exchange for each RGS Energy share will be more than
$39.50, and if the average closing price of an Energy East share over such
period is less than $16.57, then the value of the Energy East shares delivered
to RGS Energy shareholders in exchange for each RGS Energy share will be less
than $39.50.

    Under the merger agreement, 55% of the RGS Energy shares must be exchanged
for cash, and 45% must be exchanged for Energy East shares, subject to possible
adjustments for tax reasons. Therefore, if shareholders owning more than 55% of
the RGS Energy shares elect to receive cash, the number of RGS Energy shares
that will be converted into cash will be less than the number elected.
Similarly, if shareholders owning more than 45% of the RGS Energy shares elect
to receive Energy East shares, the number of RGS Energy shares that will be
converted into Energy East shares will be less than the number elected.

    We cannot complete the merger unless we receive the necessary approvals from
our shareholders at our respective annual meetings. At the RGS Energy annual
meeting, RGS Energy shareholders will consider and vote on the merger proposal
and a proposal to elect directors set forth in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. At the Energy East annual meeting, Energy East
shareholders will consider and vote on the proposal to issue Energy East shares
in connection with the merger and a proposal to elect directors set forth in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

    YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT.  APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT
BY THE RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDERS REQUIRES THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF A MAJORITY OF
THE OUTSTANDING RGS ENERGY SHARES. THEREFORE, AN RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDER NOT
VOTING (WHETHER BY ABSTENTION, FAILURE TO VOTE OR BROKER NON-VOTE) HAS THE SAME
EFFECT AS A VOTE AGAINST THE MERGER AGREEMENT. APPROVAL BY ENERGY EAST
SHAREHOLDERS OF THE ISSUANCE OF ENERGY EAST SHARES IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER
REQUIRES THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF A MAJORITY OF VOTES CAST, SO LONG AS THE
HOLDERS OF A MAJORITY OF THE OUTSTANDING ENERGY EAST SHARES HAVE VOTED. AN
ENERGY EAST SHAREHOLDER'S ABSTENTION HAS THE SAME EFFECT AS A VOTE AGAINST THE
ISSUANCE OF ENERGY EAST SHARES IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER. IF YOU ARE AN
ENERGY EAST SHAREHOLDER AND YOU FAIL TO VOTE OR DO NOT INSTRUCT YOUR BROKER ON
HOW TO VOTE, THIS WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE OUTCOME OF THE VOTE TO APPROVE THE
ISSUANCE OF ENERGY EAST SHARES IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, EXCEPT THAT IT
WILL BE COUNTED AS A VOTE NOT CAST FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER THE
HOLDERS OF A MAJORITY OF THE OUTSTANDING ENERGY EAST SHARES HAVE VOTED.

    The dates, times and places of the annual meetings are as follows:

             ENERGY EAST SHAREHOLDERS                                 RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDERS

    This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains answers to frequently asked
questions and a summary description of the merger and other related matters
(beginning on page 1), followed by a more detailed discussion of the merger and
these matters. Because these answers and this summary are not, by their nature,
detailed, we urge you to read this joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully
and in its entirety. WE ESPECIALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ THE SECTION ON "RISK
FACTORS" BEGINNING ON PAGE 18 FOR A DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS RISKS YOU SHOULD
CONSIDER IN EVALUATING THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION. In addition, you may obtain
additional information about the two companies from documents they have filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

    We enthusiastically support this combination of our companies, and we join
with our boards of directors in recommending that you vote FOR the approval and
adoption of the merger agreement, FOR the issuance of Energy East shares in
connection with the merger and FOR the other proposals described in the Notices
of Meetings that follow.

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q.   WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE PROPOSED
     TRANSACTION?

A.   RGS Energy will become a direct, wholly
     owned subsidiary of Energy East by
     merging with and into Eagle Merger
     Corp., which will be a wholly owned
     subsidiary of Energy East at the
     effective time of the merger. Eagle
     Merger Corp. will be the corporation
     surviving the merger and, at the
     effective time, will change its name to
     "RGS Energy Group, Inc."

Q.   WHY HAVE RGS ENERGY AND ENERGY EAST
     DECIDED TO MERGE?

A.   Our companies are proposing the merger,
     which will create the premier electric
     utility in upstate New York, because we
     expect that the complementary
     operations of our companies and their
     common vision for upstate New York will
     lead to attractive returns for our
     shareholders and a stable energy supply
     and excellent service for our
     customers. We expect the merger to
     result in annual cost savings of
     approximately $50 million, and to be
     accretive to Energy East's earnings in
     the first full year after we complete
     the merger, assuming anticipated
     synergies can be obtained and retained.
     Another benefit of the merger will be
     combining the proven management teams
     of each of our companies. We believe
     that the combined company, by
     increasing its scale and scope of
     operations, will be better equipped
     than either company alone to handle the
     challenging times in the energy
     marketplace.

     Please read the more detailed
     description of RGS Energy's reasons for
     the merger on pages 27 to 30 and Energy
     East's reasons for the merger on
     pages 30 to 31.

Q.   WHAT WILL RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDERS
     RECEIVE?

A.   RGS Energy shareholders may elect to
     receive, in exchange for each of their
     RGS Energy shares, $39.50 in cash, a
     number of Energy East shares valued at
     $39.50, subject to limitations on the
     maximum and minimum number of Energy
     East shares to be issued, or a
     combination of cash and Energy East
     shares. The number of Energy East
     shares to be exchanged for each RGS
     Energy share will be between 1.7626 and
     2.3838, based on the average closing
     price of Energy East shares during the
     20-trading-day period ending two
     trading days before the effective time
     of the merger. If the average closing
     price of an Energy East share over such
     period is more than $22.41, then the
     value of the Energy East shares
     delivered to RGS Energy shareholders in
     exchange for each RGS Energy share will
     be more than $39.50, and if the average
     closing price of an Energy East share
     over such period is less than $16.57,
     then the value of the Energy East
     shares delivered to RGS Energy
     shareholders in exchange for each RGS
     Energy share will be less than $39.50.

     Please read the more detailed
     description of the consideration to be
     issued in the merger on page 23.

Q.   WILL EACH RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDER
     RECEIVE THE SPECIFIC AMOUNTS OF CASH
     AND STOCK THAT HE OR SHE ELECTS?

A.   Not necessarily. Due to a requirement
     contained in the merger agreement that
     55% of the RGS Energy shares must be
     converted into cash and 45% must be
     converted into Energy East shares, the
     amounts of cash and stock that an RGS
     shareholder will receive may be
     different from the amounts that such
     RGS Energy shareholder elects. For
     example, if RGS Energy shareholders
     owning more than 55% of RGS Energy
     shares elect to receive cash, then the
     number of RGS Energy shares converted
     into cash will be less than the number
     elected. Similarly, if RGS Energy
     shareholders owning more than 45% of
     RGS Energy shares elect to receive
     Energy East shares, then the number of
     RGS Energy shares converted into Energy
     East shares will be less than the
     number elected.

     For tax reasons that are explained on
     page 54, Energy East may have to
     increase the number of RGS Energy
     shares converted into Energy East
     shares and decrease the number of RGS
     Energy shares converted

     into cash. In the alternative, under
     certain circumstances, RGS Energy may
     elect to have the transaction
     restructured so that it would be fully
     taxable. For a description and
     explanation of RGS Energy's option to
     restructure the merger as a taxable
     transaction, see "The Merger
     Agreement--Conversion of RGS Energy
     Shares--Tax Adjustment" on pages 57 to
     58.

     Energy East will not issue any
     fractional shares in the merger.
     Instead, RGS Energy shareholders will
     receive cash instead of any fractional
     shares that they would otherwise
     receive.

     Please read the more detailed
     description of the allocation
     procedures on page 57.

Q.   HOW AND WHEN DO RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDERS
     MAKE THEIR ELECTION?

A.   Not less than 30 days before the
     effective time of the merger, written
     instructions will be sent to RGS Energy
     shareholders along with a form of
     election for making their elections to
     receive cash or Energy East shares or a
     combination of cash and Energy East
     shares.

Q.   ASSUMING THAT AN RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDER
     RECEIVES ENERGY EAST SHARES IN THE
     MERGER, WILL HIS OR HER RIGHTS AS A
     SHAREHOLDER CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THE
     MERGER?

A.   Yes, they will change, even though both
     of our companies are incorporated in
     New York. For a summary of material
     differences between the rights of RGS
     Energy shareholders and the rights of
     Energy East shareholders, see pages 79
     to 84 of this document.

Q.   WHAT HAPPENS TO MY FUTURE DIVIDENDS?

A.   Prior to the effective time of the
     merger, Energy East and RGS Energy will
     coordinate their respective dividend
     policies so that neither Energy East
     shareholders nor RGS Energy
     shareholders will be adversely affected
     by the timing of record, declaration or
     payment dates of dividends. While
     Energy East and RGS Energy anticipate
     that they will continue to pay
     quarterly cash dividends prior to the
     completion of the merger, the Energy
     East and RGS Energy boards will
     continue to evaluate their respective
     dividend policies in light of business,
     financial and regulatory
     considerations.

     After the completion of the merger,
     Energy East anticipates that it will
     continue to pay quarterly cash
     dividends. The payment of dividends by
     Energy East, however, will be subject
     to approval and declaration by the
     Energy East board of directors, and
     will depend on a variety of factors,
     including business, financial and
     regulatory considerations.

Q.   WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ENERGY EAST SHARES
     IN THE MERGER?

A.   Nothing. Each Energy East share will
     remain outstanding as an Energy East
     share.

Q.   WHEN AND WHERE ARE THE ANNUAL MEETINGS?

A.   The RGS Energy annual meeting will take
     place at   :  .m on [      ], 2001, at
     [            ]. The Energy East annual
     meeting will take place at   :  .m on
     [      ], 2001, at [            ].

Q.   WHAT PROPOSALS ARE RGS ENERGY
     SHAREHOLDERS VOTING ON?

A.   The RGS Energy shareholders are voting
     on two proposals. The first is to
     approve and adopt the merger agreement.
     The second is to elect directors. For a
     more detailed description of the merger
     proposal, see "The Merger--General
     Description of the Merger" on page 23.
     For a more detailed description of the
     proposal relating to the election of
     directors, see "The RGS Energy Annual
     Meeting--Proposal 2--Election of
     Directors" on page 87.

Q.   WHAT PROPOSALS ARE ENERGY EAST
     SHAREHOLDERS VOTING ON?

A.   The Energy East shareholders are voting
     on two proposals. The first is to
     approve the issuance of Energy East
     shares in connection with the merger.
     The second is to elect directors. For a
     more detailed description of the share
     issuance proposal, see "The
     Merger--General Description of the
     Merger" on page 23. For a more detailed
     description of the proposal relating to
     the election of directors, see "The

     Energy East Annual Meeting--Proposal
     2--Election of Directors" on page 103.

Q.   WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A.   As soon as possible after you have
     carefully read this document, please
     complete, sign, date and mail your
     proxy card in the enclosed return
     envelope or follow the instructions on
     the enclosed proxy card if voting by
     telephone or over the Internet. By
     doing so, your shares will be
     represented at the RGS Energy annual
     meeting or the Energy East annual
     meeting. Your proxy card covers both
     certificated shares and plan shares
     unless the registrations are different.
     If you have registrations in different
     names, you will receive a separate
     proxy card for each name registration.
     Accordingly, if you vote by telephone
     or over the Internet, you will need to
     do so for each registration. If you are
     one of our employees, or an employee of
     any of our respective subsidiaries, and
     you participate in one of our savings
     and investment plans, the proxy will
     instruct the trustees of the plan to
     vote the whole shares in your account.
     If a broker holds your shares as
     nominee, you will receive a
     voter-information form from your
     broker.

     THE RGS ENERGY BOARD OF DIRECTORS
     UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS VOTING "FOR"
     APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER
     AGREEMENT, AND THE ENERGY EAST BOARD OF
     DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS VOTING
     "FOR" APPROVAL OF THE ISSUANCE OF
     ENERGY EAST SHARES IN CONNECTION WITH
     THE MERGER.

Q.   AS AN RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDER, SHOULD I
     SEND IN MY SHARE CERTIFICATES NOW?

A.   No. You should continue to hold your
     RGS Energy share certificates until we
     send you a form of election that you
     can use to indicate your preference as
     to the type of payment you would like
     to receive in the merger. At that time,
     you will be given instructions for
     sending in your certificates. If you
     currently hold plan shares, or if a
     broker holds your shares as nominee,
     you do not need to request that
     certificates be issued. After the
     merger is completed, you will receive
     written information on the exchange of
     these shares.

Q.   WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE AND
     ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE
     ISSUANCE OF ENERGY EAST SHARES?

A.   The merger agreement must be approved
     and adopted by the holders of a
     majority of the outstanding RGS Energy
     shares. The issuance of Energy East
     shares in connection with the merger
     must be approved by a majority of votes
     cast by Energy East shareholders, so
     long as the holders of a majority of
     the outstanding Energy East shares have
     voted. YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT.

Q.   WHO ELSE MUST APPROVE THE MERGER AND
     THE ISSUANCE OF ENERGY EAST SHARES IN
     CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER?

A.   In addition to the approvals of RGS
     Energy and Energy East shareholders, we
     must also obtain regulatory approvals
     for the merger. Please read the more
     detailed description of the regulatory
     approvals on pages 44 to 45.

Q.   WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE
     MERGER?

A.   We are working to complete all steps
     necessary to consummate the merger as
     quickly as possible. Currently, we
     expect to complete the merger in the
     first quarter of 2002.

Q.   WHAT HAPPENS IF I DO NOT INSTRUCT A
     BROKER HANDLING MY SHARES ON HOW TO
     VOTE ON THE MERGER OR IF I FAIL TO VOTE
     OR ABSTAIN FROM VOTING?

A.   If you are an RGS Energy or Energy East
     shareholder and a broker holds your RGS
     Energy or Energy East shares as
     nominee, he will not be able to vote
     them with respect to the merger
     agreement (if you are an RGS Energy
     shareholder) or the issuance of Energy
     East shares in connection with the
     merger (if you are an Energy East
     shareholder) without instructions from
     you. Your broker will contact you
     regarding the procedures necessary for
     him or her to vote your shares.

     If you are an RGS Energy shareholder
     and you fail to vote, mark your proxy
     "Abstain" or fail to instruct your
     broker on how to

     vote, this will have the effect of a
     vote against the merger agreement.

     If you are an Energy East shareholder,
     and you mark your proxy "Abstain," this
     will have the effect of a vote against
     the issuance of Energy East shares in
     connection with the merger. If you are
     an Energy East shareholder and you fail
     to vote or fail to instruct your broker
     on how to vote, this will have no
     effect on the outcome of the vote to
     approve the issuance of Energy East
     shares in connection with the merger,
     except that it will be counted as a
     vote not cast for the purposes of
     determining whether the holders of a
     majority of the outstanding Energy East
     shares have voted.

Q.   CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE
     MAILED IN MY SIGNED AND DATED PROXY
     CARD OR VOTED BY TELEPHONE OR OVER THE
     INTERNET?

A.   Yes. If you are an RGS Energy
     shareholder, you may revoke your proxy
     at any time before the RGS Energy
     annual meeting by delivering a written
     revocation or a proxy card with a later
     date to the Secretary of RGS Energy at
     the following address:

             RGS Energy Group, Inc.
                 89 East Avenue
            Rochester, NY 14649-0001
              Attention: Secretary

     In the alternative, you may revoke your
     proxy by telephone or over the
     Internet, or by voting in person at the
     RGS Energy annual meeting. You may
     change your vote by using any one of
     these methods regardless of the method
     used to cast your previous vote.

     If you are an Energy East shareholder,
     you may revoke your proxy at any time
     before the Energy East annual meeting
     by delivering a written revocation or a
     proxy card with a later date to the
     Secretary of Energy East at the
     following address:

             Energy East Corporation
                 P.O. Box 12904
              Albany, NY 12212-2904
              Attention: Secretary

     In the alternative, you may revoke your
     proxy by voting again by telephone or
     over the Internet, or by voting in
     person at the Energy East annual
     meeting. You may change your vote by
     using any one of these methods
     regardless of the method used to cast
     your previous vote.

Q.   DO I HAVE DISSENTERS' OR APPRAISAL
     RIGHTS?

A.   No. Neither the holders of Energy East
     shares nor the holders of RGS Energy
     shares will have dissenters' or
     appraisal rights under New York law as

           CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

    This document contains forward-looking statements about Energy East and RGS
Energy that involve risks and uncertainties. We may make these statements about
the financial condition, results of operations and business of Energy East and
RGS Energy. These statements may be made directly in this document referring to
Energy East or RGS Energy, or may be "incorporated by reference" from other
documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This document may
also include statements relating to the period following the completion of the
merger. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as
"believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates" or similar expressions in this
document or in the documents incorporated by reference.

    These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks
and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially
from those indicated by such forward-looking statements include, among others,
the following:

      a preliminary nature which may be subject to further and continuing review
      and adjustment;

    - the risk of a significant delay in the expected completion of, and
      unexpected consequences resulting from, the merger;

    - the highly competitive nature of the electric, natural gas and energy
      marketing industries, including the speed and degree to which competition
      enters these industries and the risk that other companies will further
      expand into markets in which we operate;

    - the risk that fluctuating wholesale energy prices may affect earnings;

    - the risk that government authorities may impose unfavorable terms as a
      condition of merger;

    - the risk of favorable customer contracts expiring or being renewed on less
      attractive terms;

                                   THE MERGER

REASONS FOR AND BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGES 23 TO 31)

    You should review the factors that the Energy East board of directors and
the RGS Energy board of directors considered when deciding whether to approve
the merger.

RECOMMENDATION TO SHAREHOLDERS (SEE PAGES 27 TO 31)

    The RGS Energy board of directors has determined that the merger is in the
best interests of the RGS Energy shareholders and unanimously recommends that
RGS Energy shareholders vote FOR the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement at the RGS Energy annual meeting.

    The Energy East board of directors has determined that the merger is in the
best interests of the Energy East shareholders and unanimously recommends that
Energy East shareholders vote FOR the issuance of Energy East shares in
connection with the merger at the Energy East annual meeting.

FAIRNESS OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS (SEE PAGES B-1 AND C-1)

    In deciding to approve the merger, the RGS Energy board of directors
considered, among other things, the opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co.
Incorporated, its financial advisor, as to the fairness, from a financial point
of view, of the consideration that RGS Energy shareholders will receive in the
merger. This opinion is attached as Appendix B to this document and is also
discussed on pages 31 to 37. In deciding to approve the merger, the Energy East
board of directors considered, among other things, the opinion of UBS Warburg
LLC, its financial advisor, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view,
to Energy East of the consideration to be paid to RGS shareholders in the
merger. This opinion is attached as Appendix C to this document and is also
discussed on pages 38 to 43. We encourage you to read these opinions in their
entirety.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (SEE PAGE 44)

    The merger will be accounted for as an acquisition of RGS Energy by Energy
East under the purchase method of accounting in

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A portion of the
purchase price will be allocated to non-utility assets and liabilities of RGS
Energy based on their estimated fair market values at the date of acquisition.
The assets and liabilities of the regulated utility will not be revalued. The
difference between the purchase price, representing fair value, and the recorded
amounts will be shown as goodwill on the balance sheet.

REGULATORY APPROVALS (SEE PAGES 44 TO 45)

    In order to complete the merger, we must receive approvals from and/or make
filings with various federal and state regulatory agencies. At the federal
level, these approvals include approvals of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission. In addition, the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act must have expired or been terminated. At the state
level, regulatory approval must be obtained from the New York State Public
Service Commission prior to completion of the merger.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGES 46 TO 51)

    In considering the recommendation of the RGS Energy board of directors to
approve the merger, RGS Energy shareholders should be aware that some members of
the RGS Energy board of directors and RGS Energy management may have interests
in the merger that will be in addition to, or different from, interests of other
RGS Energy shareholders. For example, Mr. Thomas S. Richards, the current
chairman, president and chief executive officer of RGS Energy, has entered into
an employment agreement with Energy East and RGS Energy under which he will
become chairman, president and chief executive officer of the surviving company
(which will be a subsidiary of Energy East) and will hold officer positions in
other Energy East subsidiaries and Energy East. In addition, Mr. Richards and
two non-management directors of RGS Energy will become directors of Energy East.
Further, certain employees, including the executive officers, of RGS Energy and
its subsidiaries will receive cash payments under an employee retention program
permitted to be established by RGS Energy, and may receive cash payments and
other benefits under severance agreements with RGS Energy. Also, RGS Energy's
executive incentive plan will terminate upon completion of the merger and
participants in the plan, including the executive officers of RGS Energy, will
receive a cash payment at that time. The grantor trust maintained in connection
with supplemental retirement plans of RGS Energy will be fully funded in
anticipation of the completion of the merger.

    All unvested options granted under RGS Energy's performance stock option
plan will vest upon completion of the merger, option holders will receive cash
payments in exchange for their outstanding and unexercised options, and option
holders will receive cash payments equal to the aggregate dividend equivalents
held with respect to their options. RGS Energy directors will also receive cash
payments in exchange for stock units they hold. In addition, all transfer
restrictions on RGS Energy shares owned by officers, directors or employees of
RGS Energy will lapse.

    The members of the RGS Energy board of directors knew about these additional
interests and the others discussed in "The Merger--Interests of Certain Persons
in the Merger" on pages 46 to 51 and considered them when they approved the
merger.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGES 51 TO 55)

    The U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to RGS Energy
shareholders will depend on the form of consideration they receive in the
merger. If you are an RGS Energy shareholder who receives solely Energy East
shares for your RGS Energy shares, you will not recognize any gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes (except with respect to cash received instead
of fractional shares). If you are an RGS Energy shareholder who receives part
cash and part Energy East shares, and your adjusted basis in an RGS Energy share
is less than the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value (as of the
date of the merger) of the Energy East shares you receive for the RGS Energy
share, you will recognize a gain.

However, if you realize a loss because your adjusted basis in an RGS Energy
share is greater than the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value,
as of the date of the merger, of the Energy East shares you receive for the RGS
Energy share, the loss will not currently be allowed. If you are an RGS Energy
shareholder who receives solely cash, gain or loss will generally be recognized
by you to the extent of the difference between the amount of cash you receive
and your adjusted basis in your RGS Energy shares.

    The consequences described above assume, as expected, that the merger will
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code. In order to achieve reorganization status, the number of RGS
Energy shares converted into Energy East shares may need to be increased and the
number of RGS Energy shares converted into cash may need to be decreased.
Instead of increasing the number of RGS Energy shares converted into Energy East
shares and decreasing the number of RGS Energy shares converted into cash, RGS
Energy may elect to change the form of the merger. If RGS Energy elects to
change the form of the merger, the transaction will not qualify as a
reorganization and generally will be fully taxable to RGS Energy shareholders.
In that event, gain or loss generally will be recognized by each RGS Energy
shareholder to the extent of the difference between (1) the sum of the amount of
cash and the fair market value (as of the date of the merger) of the Energy East
shares received and (2) the RGS Energy shareholder's adjusted basis in such RGS
Energy shares.

    THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO YOU AS AN RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDER WILL
DEPEND ON YOUR OWN SITUATION. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR FOR A FULL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO YOU.

    DISSENTERS' RIGHTS OF APPRAISAL OF RGS ENERGY OR ENERGY EAST SHAREHOLDERS
(SEE PAGE 46)

    There are no dissenters' rights of appraisal for either RGS Energy
shareholders or Energy East shareholders under New York law.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    The merger agreement is the legal document that governs the merger. The
merger agreement is attached as Appendix A to this document, and we encourage
you to read it carefully.

CONVERSION OF RGS ENERGY SHARES (SEE PAGES 56 TO 59)

    In exchange for each of their RGS Energy shares, RGS Energy shareholders may
elect to receive $39.50 in cash, a number of Energy East shares valued at
$39.50, subject to restrictions on the maximum and minimum number of Energy East
shares to be issued, or a combination of cash and Energy East shares. The number
of Energy East shares to be exchanged for each RGS Energy share will be between
1.7626 and 2.3838, based on the average closing price of Energy East shares
during the 20-trading-day period ending two trading days before the effective
time of the merger. If the average closing price of an Energy East share over
such period is more than $22.41, then the value of the Energy East shares
delivered to RGS Energy shareholders in exchange for each RGS Energy share will
be more than $39.50, and if the average closing price of an Energy East share
over such period is less than $16.57, then the value of the Energy East shares
delivered to RGS Energy shareholders in exchange for each RGS Energy share will
be less than $39.50.

    Under the merger agreement, 55% of the RGS Energy shares must be exchanged
for cash and 45% must be exchanged for Energy East shares, subject to possible
adjustments for tax reasons. Therefore, if RGS Energy shareholders owning more
than 55% of the RGS Energy shares elect to receive cash, the number of RGS
Energy shares that will be converted into cash will be less than the number
elected. Similarly, if RGS Energy shareholders owning more than 45% of the RGS
Energy shares elect to receive Energy East shares, the number of RGS Energy
shares that will be converted into Energy East shares will be less than the
number elected.

CERTAIN COVENANTS (SEE PAGES 60 TO 62)

    RGS Energy has agreed not to solicit or encourage any proposal from any
person to acquire RGS Energy or its assets, but it may

respond, in certain circumstances, to unsolicited proposals that it receives.

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER (SEE PAGES 67 TO 68)

    Completion of the merger depends upon satisfaction of a number of
conditions. In addition to customary conditions relating to each of the parties
complying with the merger agreement, these conditions include the following:

    - approval and adoption of the merger agreement by RGS Energy shareholders;

    - approval of the issuance of Energy East shares in connection with the
      merger by Energy East shareholders;

    - absence of any injunction or other legal restraint blocking the merger, or
      of any applicable federal or state law or regulation prohibiting the
      merger;

    - the SEC declaring effective, and the absence of a suspension by the SEC of
      the effectiveness of, the registration statement with respect to the
      Energy East shares to be issued in the merger;

    - the New York Stock Exchange approving for listing the Energy East shares
      to be issued in the merger;

    - all regulatory approvals being obtained on terms that would not be
      reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on Energy East or
      RGS Energy;

    - the absence of any material adverse event with respect to Energy East or
      RGS Energy; and

    - Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz furnishing to Energy East, and Shearman &
      Sterling furnishing to RGS Energy, opinions to the effect that the merger
      will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
      of the Internal Revenue Code. However, this condition will be waived if
      RGS Energy elects, as it may do under certain circumstances, to have the
      merger restructured so that RGS Energy will be the surviving company (see
      "The Merger Agreement--Conversion of RGS Energy Shares--Tax Adjustment" on
      pages 57 to 58).

    The merger will occur, and if you are an RGS Energy shareholder your RGS
Energy shares will be converted into the right to receive cash, Energy East
shares or a combination of cash and Energy East shares, on the second business
day after all of the conditions in the merger agreement are satisfied or waived.

TERMINATION (SEE PAGES 68 TO 71)

    The merger agreement may be terminated, and the merger abandoned, in the
following circumstances:

    - if we mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement;

    - by either of us, if the merger is not completed by February 16, 2002 (or
      November 16, 2002, if the only condition to closing not satisfied by
      February 16, 2002 is that the requisite regulatory approvals have not been
      obtained);

    - by either of us if either the RGS Energy shareholders do not approve and
      adopt the merger agreement or Energy East shareholders do not approve the
      issuance of Energy East shares in connection with the merger, in either
      case by February 16, 2002;

    - by either of us if any law or regulation prohibits the merger, or if a
      court issues a final, non-appealable order blocking the merger;

    - by RGS Energy, prior to its shareholders' approval of the merger
      agreement, upon three days' notice to Energy East, if RGS Energy receives
      a competing acquisition proposal, in response to which the RGS Energy
      board of directors determines, after consultation with outside counsel,
      that failure to accept the competing acquisition proposal would likely
      result in a breach of its directors' fiduciary duties, and concludes in
      good faith that the person making the competing acquisition proposal has
      obtained or can obtain any necessary financing and that such proposal
      would be financially superior to the merger. However, before RGS Energy
      can terminate the merger agreement, it must consider in good faith any
      proposal

      made by Energy East to enable RGS Energy to proceed with the merger.

    - by either of us, if the other party materially breaches the merger
      agreement and fails to cure the breach;

    - by RGS Energy, if the Energy East board of directors withdraws its
      approval or recommendation of the issuance of Energy East shares in
      connection with the merger; or

    - by Energy East, if the RGS Energy board of directors withdraws its
      approval or recommendation of the merger agreement, fails to reaffirm its
      approval or recommendation of the merger agreement within seven days of
      Energy East's request, approves a competing acquisition proposal or
      resolves to take any of these actions.

    If either Energy East or RGS Energy materially breaches the merger agreement
and the other party consequently terminates the agreement, the breaching party
must pay the other party up to $10 million in expenses and fees. Moreover, if
the merger agreement is terminated for any of the following reasons:

    - the RGS Energy board of directors decides to pursue an alternative
      acquisition proposal;

    - (1) RGS Energy shareholders fail to approve the merger agreement,
      (2) there is an alternative acquisition proposal outstanding at the time
      of the RGS Energy shareholder meeting and (3) RGS Energy enters into a
      definitive agreement to complete or actually does complete a business
      combination within twelve months after the termination of the merger
      agreement; or

    - (1) the RGS Energy board of directors withdraws its approval or
      recommendation of the merger agreement or fails to reaffirm its approval
      or recommendation within seven days of Energy East's request, or approves
      or recommends any alternative acquisition proposal, or resolves to take
      any of the above actions, (2) there is an alternative acquisition proposal
      outstanding at the time of the termination of the merger agreement and
      (3) RGS Energy enters into a definitive agreement to complete or actually
      does complete a business combination within twelve months of the
      termination,

then RGS Energy must pay Energy East $50 million in addition to fees and
expenses of up to $10 million.

    Furthermore, if

    (1) Energy East shareholders fail to approve the issuance of Energy East
    shares in connection with the merger, (2) there is an alternative
    acquisition proposal with respect to Energy East outstanding at the time of
    the Energy East shareholders meeting, (3) the person or persons that made
    the alternative acquisition proposal conditioned it on Energy East
    shareholders failing to approve the issuance of Energy East shares in
    connection with the merger, and (4) Energy East enters into a definitive
    agreement to complete or actually does complete a business combination
    within twelve months of the termination of the merger agreement,

then Energy East must pay RGS Energy $50 million in addition to fees and
expenses of up to $10 million.

    If a breach by either party is willful, the merger agreement does not limit
the amount of damages, expenses and fees a nonbreaching party who terminates the
merger agreement may seek.

    COMPARATIVE RIGHTS OF RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDERS AND ENERGY EAST SHAREHOLDERS
(SEE PAGES 79 TO 84)

    Energy East and RGS Energy are both organized under the laws of the State of
New York. Any differences, therefore, in the rights of holders of RGS Energy
shares and Energy East shares arise exclusively from the differences in their
respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws. If you receive Energy East
shares in the merger, your rights as an Energy East shareholder will be governed
by Energy East's certificate of incorporation and bylaws. These rights differ in
certain respects from the current rights of RGS Energy shareholders, which are
governed by RGS Energy's certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

          COMPARATIVE PER SHARE MARKET PRICE AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION

    Energy East shares are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol "EAS." RGS Energy shares are listed and traded on the New York

    The number of Energy East shares to be exchanged for each RGS Energy share
in the merger will depend on the value of Energy East shares during the
20-trading-day period ending two trading days before the effective time of the
merger. Based on the closing price of Energy East shares on February 16, 2001,
each RGS Energy share convertible into the right to receive Energy East shares
would be converted into the right to receive 2.0637 Energy East shares. Based on
the closing price of Energy East shares on       , 2001, each RGS Energy share
convertible into the right to receive Energy East shares would be converted into
the right to receive       Energy East shares.

    We urge you to obtain current market quotations for Energy East shares and
RGS Energy shares.

    Energy East will file an application with the New York Stock Exchange to
list on that exchange the Energy East shares that RGS Energy shareholders will
receive in the merger.

    On January 12, 2001, the Energy East board of directors declared a quarterly
dividend on Energy East shares of $.23 per share, payable on February 15, 2001
to holders of record on January 22, 2001. Energy East anticipates that it will
continue to pay quarterly cash dividends. The Energy East board of directors,
however, has discretion to decide upon the timing and amount of any future
dividends. Whether or not Energy East will pay dividends, and, if so, how much
these dividends will be, will depend on Energy East's future earnings, financial
condition, capital requirements and other factors.

    On December 20, 2000, the RGS Energy board of directors declared a quarterly
dividend on RGS Energy shares of $.45 per share, payable on January 25, 2001 to
holders of record on January 2, 2001. As part of the merger agreement, RGS
Energy has agreed that it will not make, declare or pay any dividend or
distribution on RGS Energy shares, other than regular quarterly dividends on RGS
Energy shares that do not materially exceed the current regular dividends on RGS
Energy shares and with record and payment dates consistent with past practice.

    Prior to completing the merger, we will coordinate our respective dividend
policies so that neither RGS Energy shareholders nor Energy East shareholders
will be adversely affected because of the timing of record, declaration or
payment dates.

                 UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

    We have summarized below information concerning earnings, cash dividends and
book value per share for:

    - each of Energy East and RGS Energy on a historical basis;

    - the combination of Energy East and RGS Energy on a pro forma basis; and

    - RGS Energy on a per share equivalent pro forma basis based on the
      combination of Energy East and RGS Energy.

    We have derived the pro forma combined earnings per share from the unaudited
pro forma combined financial statements presented elsewhere in this document.
Book value per share for the pro forma combined presentation is based upon
outstanding Energy East shares at December 31, 2000, adjusted to include the
estimated number of Energy East shares to be issued in the merger.

    The pro forma data are based on the assumed conversion of 45% of the RGS
Energy shares into 2.0637 Energy East shares per RGS Energy share and 55% into
$39.50 in cash per RGS Energy share. We calculated the exchange ratio for RGS
Energy shares by dividing $39.50 by $19.14, the closing price of Energy East
shares on February 16, 2001.

    You should read the information set forth below together with the audited
financial statements of Energy East and RGS Energy incorporated by reference in
this document and the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements and
related notes presented elsewhere in this document. See "Where You Can Find More

                         SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

    The following tables present (1) selected consolidated financial information
for each of Energy East (which includes the effect of its merger with
Connecticut Energy as of February 2000 and the effect of its mergers with CMP
Group, CTG Resources and Berkshire Energy as of September 2000), and RGS Energy
on a historical basis; and (2) selected unaudited pro forma financial data for
Energy East reflecting the effect of the mergers completed in 2000 and the
merger with RGS Energy.

    We prepared the selected unaudited pro forma financial data by accounting
for the merger with RGS Energy under the purchase method of accounting. See "The
Merger--Accounting Treatment" on page 44. The selected unaudited pro forma
financial data reflect the merger with RGS Energy based upon preliminary
purchase accounting adjustments. Actual amounts may differ from those reflected
below.

    The selected historical financial data for Energy East and RGS Energy as of
December 31, 2000, 1999, 1998, 1997 and 1996 and for each of the years in the
five-year period ended December 31, 2000, set forth below, have been derived
from Energy East's and RGS Energy's audited financial statements and, in the
opinion of their managements, include all adjustments, consisting of normal
recurring adjustments, necessary for fair presentations of the data of these
periods. You should read the information set forth below in conjunction with the
respective audited financial statements of Energy East and RGS Energy
incorporated by reference in this document and the unaudited pro forma combined
financial statements and related notes presented elsewhere in this document. See
"Where You Can Find More Information" on page 120 and "Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Condensed Financial Statements" on pages 72 to 78.

    The pro forma balance sheet data give effect to the RGS Energy merger as if
this event occurred as of the balance sheet date and the pro forma statement of
income data give effect to the mergers completed in 2000 and the RGS Energy
merger as if those events occurred on January 1, 2000. The pro forma financial
data are not, however, necessarily indicative of the financial position or
operating results that would have occurred had the merger been completed on
those dates, nor is the information necessarily indicative of future financial
position or operating results.

Energy shares for either cash or Energy East shares (or a combination of cash
and Energy East shares), subject to proration, the opportunity to make that
election will not occur at the time of the shareholder vote on the merger.
Instead, it will occur from shortly before to shortly after the effective time
of the merger (as described further in this document), after all necessary
regulatory approvals have been obtained. The cash price per share to be paid for
RGS Energy shares is fixed at $39.50. This cash price will not be adjusted based
on changes in market prices. The value of Energy East shares delivered to RGS
Energy shareholders will equal $39.50 if the average closing price of an Energy
East share over the 20-trading-day period ending two trading days before the
effective time of the merger is between $16.57 and $22.41. However, if the
average closing price of an Energy East share over such period is more than
$22.41, then the value of the Energy East shares delivered to RGS Energy
shareholders in exchange for each RGS Energy share will be more than $39.50, and
if the average closing price of an Energy East share over such period is less
than $16.57, then the value of the Energy East shares delivered to RGS Energy
shareholders in exchange for each RGS Energy share will be less than $39.50.

    There may be a significant time delay between the date when RGS Energy
shareholders vote on the merger transaction at the RGS Energy annual meeting and
the deadline for RGS Energy shareholders to make their elections, which is three
days after the effective time of the merger. The market value of Energy East
shares may fluctuate during that period. As a result, the relative prices of our
respective shares may vary significantly from the date of this document, to the
date of the annual meeting, to the date on which RGS Energy shareholders will
have the opportunity to make their elections. These variations may be caused by
changes in the businesses, operations, results and prospects of both companies,
market expectations of the likelihood that the merger will be completed and the
timing of completion, the effect of any conditions or restrictions imposed on or
proposed with respect to the combined company by regulatory agencies, general
market and economic conditions, or other factors.

    For example, between             , 2000 and             , 2001 the closing
sales price of an Energy East share has ranged from a high of $      to a low of
$      per share, and the closing sales price of an RGS Energy share during the
same period has ranged from a high of $      to a low of $      per share. On
        , 2001, the most recent date for which it was practicable to obtain
market price data, (1) the closing sales price of Energy East shares was $
per share, and (2) the closing sales price of RGS Energy shares was $      per
share, as reported in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL's New York Stock Exchange
Composite Transactions. We urge you to obtain current market quotations for our
shares. In addition, the stock market generally has experienced significant
price and volume fluctuations. These market fluctuations could have a material
adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, our shares.

    It is impossible to predict accurately the market price of Energy East
shares immediately after the effective time of the merger and, therefore,
impossible to predict accurately the value of the stock consideration that RGS
Energy shareholders will receive. The value of the stock consideration may be
significantly higher or lower than the value of the cash consideration. See
"Summary--Unaudited Comparative Per Share Data" and "--Comparative Per Share
Market Price and Dividend Information."

    If shareholders owning more than 45% of the RGS Energy shares elect to
receive Energy East shares, the number of RGS Energy shares that will be
converted into Energy East shares will be less than the number elected.
Similarly, if shareholders owning more than 55% of the RGS Energy shares elect
to receive cash, the number of RGS Energy shares that will be converted into
cash will be less than the number elected. Because the number of Energy East
shares to be exchanged for each RGS Energy share will be between 1.7626 and
2.3838, one possible result of this proration is that RGS Energy shareholders
subject to this proration could receive consideration that is less than the
consideration they would have otherwise received in the absence of such
proration.

REGULATORY AGENCIES COULD DELAY OR REFUSE TO APPROVE THE MERGER OR IMPOSE
  CONDITIONS THAT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT

    To complete the merger, we must obtain approvals or consents from state and
federal regulatory agencies, including the New York State Public Service
Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the SEC and the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission. These state or federal regulatory agencies may impose
conditions that could have an adverse effect on the business or financial
position of either of our companies or the combined company. If these conditions
would cause a material adverse effect on RGS Energy or Energy East, Energy East
could choose to terminate the merger agreement.

    We cannot be certain that any or all of the required regulatory approvals
will be obtained, or that they will be obtained within the time frame
contemplated by the merger agreement, or that they will be obtained without
burdensome conditions. For additional information on the required regulatory
approvals, see "The Merger--Regulatory Approvals."

UNCERTAINTIES IN INTEGRATING OUR COMPANIES

    The merger of our companies will require the integration of two companies
that have previously operated independently. No assurance can be given that
Energy East will be able to integrate successfully the operations of RGS Energy
and its subsidiaries without, among other things, encountering difficulties or
experiencing the loss of key employees, customers or suppliers. Also, the
management of each of our companies will have to dedicate substantial time and
effort to ensure that this integration proceeds successfully, which may result
in distraction from regular business concerns.

COMPETITIVE AND REGULATORY CONDITIONS

    The merger will combine companies that to a large extent share a common
regulatory environment and currently are affected by a number of similar
factors, including deregulation and increased competition. The utility industry
has been undergoing dramatic structural change for several years, resulting in
increasing competitive pressures faced by electric and natural gas utility
companies. Increased competition may create greater risks to the stability of
utility earnings generally and may in the future reduce Energy East's earnings
from retail electric and natural gas sales. In a deregulated environment,
formerly regulated utility companies that are not responsive to a competitive
energy marketplace may suffer erosion in market share, revenues and profits as
competitors gain access to their service territories.

merger.

                              THE ANNUAL MEETINGS

    We will each hold an annual meeting of our shareholders. Each of our boards
of directors has provided you with this document in order to solicit your proxy
for use at our respective annual meetings. For a description of the RGS Energy
annual meeting and the proposals to be voted upon at the RGS Energy annual
meeting, see "The RGS Energy Annual Meeting" on pages 86 to 101. For a
description of the Energy East annual meeting and the proposals to be voted upon
at the Energy East annual meeting, see "The Energy East Annual Meeting" on
pages 102 to 119.

                                   THE MERGER

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MERGER

    The merger agreement provides that RGS Energy will merge with and into Eagle
Merger Corp., which will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy East at the
effective time of the merger. Eagle Merger Corp. will be the surviving company
and will continue to conduct RGS Energy's businesses under the name "RGS Energy
Group, Inc." as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Energy East. In the merger,
each outstanding RGS Energy share (other than those shares that are held by RGS
Energy as treasury stock) will be converted into the right to receive cash or
Energy East shares, or a combination of cash and Energy East shares.

    Each RGS Energy shareholder can elect the form of consideration he or she
would like to receive, but this election is subject to proration as well as an
adjustment driven by tax considerations. See "The Merger Agreement--Conversion
of RGS Energy Shares." Under the merger agreement, 55% of all issued and
outstanding RGS Energy shares must be exchanged for cash, and 45% must be
exchanged for Energy East shares. If RGS Energy shareholders owning more than
55% of RGS Energy shares elect to receive cash, the number of RGS Energy shares
converted into cash will be less than the number elected. Similarly, if RGS
Energy shareholders owning more than of 45% of RGS Energy shares elect to
receive Energy East shares, the number of RGS Energy shares converted into stock
will be less than the number elected.

    For tax reasons that are explained below, the number of RGS Energy shares
converted into Energy East shares may have to be increased and the number of RGS
Energy shares converted into cash may have to be decreased. In the alternative,
RGS Energy may elect under some circumstances to have the merger restructured so
that Eagle Merger Corp. would merge with and into RGS Energy and RGS Energy
would be the surviving company. In that case, the parties would no longer intend
for the merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and the conditions to the merger
requiring each party's counsel to furnish an opinion to that effect would be
waived.

    The per share cash consideration is $39.50, without interest. The per share
stock consideration is a number of Energy East shares that will vary depending
on the "AVERAGE MARKET PRICE," which is the average of the closing prices of
Energy East shares on the New York Stock Exchange during the 20-trading-day
period ending two trading days prior to the effective time of the merger. If the
Average Market Price is between $16.57 per share and $22.41 per share, then each
RGS Energy share converted into stock will be exchanged for $39.50 worth of
Energy East shares. If the Average Market Price is less than or equal to $16.57,
then each RGS Energy share converted into stock will be exchanged for 2.3838
Energy East shares, irrespective of the value of the Energy East shares.
Finally, if the Average Market Price is greater than or equal to $22.41 per
share, then each RGS Energy share will be exchanged for 1.7626 Energy East
shares, again irrespective of the value of the Energy East shares.

    The total value of the consideration that RGS Energy shareholders will
receive in the merger, based on the number of RGS Energy shares outstanding on
February 15, 2001 and assuming that the Average Market Price of Energy East
shares is between $16.57 per share and $22.41 per share, is approximately $1.4
billion.

BACKGROUND

    Prior to entering into merger discussions with Energy East, RGS Energy had
carefully followed the developments in the electric and natural gas industries
in the northeastern United States and, in particular, the deregulation and
restructuring of the electric and natural gas industries in New York State. In
response, RGS Energy's management and board of directors from time to time
consulted with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, RGS Energy's financial
advisor, and reviewed various strategic

alternatives, including remaining an independent public company, the possibility
of acquisitions or mergers with other companies and other transactions.

    In mid-August 2000, Wesley W. von Schack, Energy East's Chairman, President
and Chief Executive Officer, contacted Thomas S. Richards, RGS Energy's
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, by telephone to discuss
informally the merits of a possible transaction between Energy East and RGS
Energy. Mr. von Schack and Mr. Richards broadly discussed the potential value
and strategic benefits that could be recognized by the shareholders of Energy
East and RGS Energy as a result of the combination of the two companies.

    On August 16, 2000, the RGS Energy board met for its annual strategy
meeting. Prior to that meeting, Mr. Richards reviewed with certain members of
the RGS Energy board his discussion with Mr. von Schack.

    Throughout September 2000, additional discussions of a preliminary nature
between Mr. von Schack and Mr. Richards periodically took place by telephone.
Such discussions generally explored the interest of each company in a possible
transaction.

    On September 8, 2000, Energy East and RGS Energy executed a confidentiality
agreement to facilitate the exchange of information. The confidentiality
agreement included a standstill provision that precluded each company from
acquiring any shares of the other or making an offer to acquire the other
company other than pursuant to a negotiated transaction.

    On September 20, 2000, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the RGS Energy
board, Mr. Richards briefed the RGS Energy board on his discussions with
Mr. von Schack. Although the RGS Energy board considered Mr. Richards'
conversations with Mr. von Schack to be at that time very preliminary, it
authorized Mr. Richards to continue exploratory discussions with Energy East.

    On September 25, 2000, Mr. von Schack and Mr. Richards met in Rochester, New
York to discuss in more detail the potential benefits that could be realized as
a result of the combination of Energy East and RGS Energy, including
post-transaction competitive positioning, the possibility of achieving potential
cost savings and the potential regulatory treatment of a business combination.
At that time, Mr. von Schack and Mr. Richards determined that Kenneth M.
Jasinski, Energy East's Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary,
and Michael T. Tomaino, RGS Energy's Senior Vice President and General Counsel,
would coordinate the exchange of confidential financial and other information.

    Throughout October and November 2000, Mr. von Schack and Mr. Richards
communicated from time to time by telephone to discuss issues related to the
electric and gas utilities industries in general and in New York State in
particular, the possibility of a transaction between Energy East and RGS Energy
and various preliminary concerns related to such a transaction. Additionally,
Mr. Jasinski and Mr. Tomaino spoke periodically by telephone to discuss the
types of information that would be required by their respective senior
management teams and financial and legal advisors in order to prepare
operational, financial and legal analyses, the process related to the exchange
of such information and the conduct of full-scale due diligence reviews.

    On October 13, 2000, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Energy East
board, Mr. von Schack reported to the Energy East directors that he was having
discussions with Mr. Richards regarding a possible transaction with RGS Energy.

    On October 18, 2000, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the RGS Energy
board, Mr. Richards updated the RGS Energy directors on the status of his
discussions with Energy East. At that meeting, Morgan Stanley and Shearman &
Sterling, RGS Energy's outside legal counsel, advised the RGS Energy board with
respect to the financial aspects of, and their legal duties regarding, a
possible transaction with Energy East.

    On November 7, 2000, Mr. von Schack and Mr. Richards met in New York City to
continue their discussion related to the mutual benefits that potentially could
be realized as a result of a combination of Energy East and RGS Energy.

    On November 15, 2000, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the executive
committee of the RGS Energy board, Mr. Richards updated the members of the
executive committee on the status of his discussions with Energy East.

    On November 30, 2000, members of the senior management teams of Energy East
and RGS Energy and Morgan Stanley met in New York City to exchange and discuss
the information previously requested through Mr. Jasinski and Mr. Tomaino and to
determine whether a basis existed for proceeding with discussions. Later that
evening, Messrs. von Schack, Richards, Jasinski and Tomaino met in New York City
and, based upon discussions with their respective senior management teams,
agreed to continue discussions with respect to a possible transaction.

    On December 6, 2000, at a special meeting of the Energy East board held for
other purposes, Mr. von Schack updated the Energy East directors on the status
of his discussions with RGS Energy.

    On December 13, 2000, Mr. von Schack and Mr. Richards met in Rochester, New
York to discuss more specifically the terms of a possible transaction, including
the type of consideration, structure of the transaction, organizational issues,
regulatory issues and approvals, historical events and the transaction process.
At that meeting, Mr. von Schack indicated that Energy East would consider
offering a price per share of RGS Energy common stock of $35.00.

    On December 19, 2000, members of the senior management teams of Energy East
and RGS Energy met in New York City with Morgan Stanley to discuss general
regulatory matters, including the regulatory approvals required in connection
with a possible transaction between Energy East and RGS Energy, and,
specifically, to discuss issues related to the New York regulated operations of
Energy East.

    On December 20, 2000, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the RGS Energy
board of directors, the possibility of a transaction between Energy East and RGS
Energy was again presented by Mr. Richards. After discussing the potential
transaction in general terms, the RGS Energy board of directors agreed that it
would be in the best interest of RGS Energy and its shareholders to continue
pursuing discussions with Energy East.

    On December 21, 2000, Mr. Richards telephoned Mr. von Schack to advise him
that the RGS Energy board had approved further discussions with Energy East and
to discuss further the terms of the potential transaction. During that call,
Mr. Richards also stated that the RGS Energy board had indicated that a value of
$35.00 per share of RGS Energy common stock was unsatisfactory.

    On January 6, 2001, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Energy East
board, Mr. von Schack updated the Energy East directors on the status of his
discussions with RGS Energy.

    On January 8, 2001, members of the senior management team of Energy East,
together with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, Energy East's outside legal
counsel, and members of the senior management team of RGS Energy, together with
Morgan Stanley and Shearman & Sterling, met in New York City to discuss further
the terms of the transaction, financial forecasts, the necessary regulatory
approvals, the continued exchange of information and the benefits of engaging a
synergy consultant. Deloitte Consulting L.P. was then retained to assist the
management of each company in evaluating the potential cost savings that could
result from the proposed transaction.

    On January 17, 2001, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the RGS Energy
board of directors, Mr. Richards updated the RGS Energy board of directors on
the status of discussions with Energy East. After discussion, the RGS Energy
board authorized Mr. Richards to continue pursuing discussions with Energy East.

    On January 20, 2001, senior officers of Energy East, including Mr. von
Schack, and senior officers of RGS Energy, including Mr. Richards, and their
legal advisors, together with Morgan Stanley, met in New York City to discuss
the terms of a possible transaction, including post-transaction corporate
governance and management, the location of headquarters and operations, the
consolidation of New York regulated operations, the effect on employees and
other constituencies and other issues. Following that meeting, Mr. von Schack
and Mr. Richards met separately to discuss valuation.

    From January 29 through February 4, 2001, Energy East's senior management,
its financial advisor, UBS Warburg LLC, and its legal advisors conducted legal
and financial due diligence with respect to RGS Energy in Rochester, New York.

    On January 30, 2001, Mr. von Schack and Mr. Richards met in New York City to
discuss the status of the proposed transaction. At that meeting, Mr. von Schack
and Mr. Richards discussed the potential strategic benefits of the proposed
transaction, the related regulatory plan, Energy East's preliminary views of its
due diligence review of RGS Energy and the scheduling of RGS Energy's due
diligence review of Energy East. Mr. von Schack and Mr. Richards also discussed
the timing of the proposed transaction and continued their discussion with
respect to dividend policy, location of headquarters and operations and the
effect on employees and other constituencies.

    On February 7, 2001, at a special meeting of the RGS Energy board of
directors, Mr. Richards updated the RGS Energy board of directors on the status
of discussions with Energy East. Morgan Stanley and Shearman & Sterling made
presentations to the RGS Energy board of directors concerning various financial
and legal aspects of the transaction and the RGS Energy board of directors
discussed the business, financial and legal issues that would be presented by a
transaction with Energy East. After discussion, the RGS Energy board of
directors authorized Mr. Richards to continue discussions with Energy East.

    On February 8, 2001, the senior managements of Energy East and RGS Energy,
together with Morgan Stanley, met with Deloitte Consulting in New York City to
review a preliminary analysis with respect to potential cost savings.

    During the period from February 8 to February 16, 2001, representatives of
Energy East and RGS Energy and their respective legal counsel negotiated the
specific terms of the merger agreement, including the conditions to the offer,
the interim covenants, the circumstances under which termination fees would be
payable, the non-solicitation provisions, the efforts required to obtain
regulatory approvals and the circumstances in which the parties could terminate
the merger agreement.

    On February 9, 2001, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Energy East
board, presentations by Energy East's senior management and its legal and
financial advisors were made concerning various legal and financial aspects of
the transaction.

    During the period from February 9 to February 14, 2001, the senior
management team of RGS Energy, together with its legal, accounting and financial
advisors, conducted legal, accounting and financial due diligence with respect
to Energy East in New York City.

    On February 13, 2001, representatives of Energy East and RGS Energy met in
New York City to discuss financial and operational information about both
companies and to continue their due diligence examination of the business and
operations of both companies. Representatives of UBS Warburg were present at
that meeting. Also on February 13, 2001, the senior management for Energy East
and the senior management of RGS Energy met with Deloitte Consulting in New York
City to discuss a final analysis with respect to potential cost savings.

    On February 14, 2001, representatives of UBS Warburg spoke with
representatives of Morgan Stanley. In that conversation, UBS Warburg, on behalf
of Energy East, made a final proposal of $39.50 per share of RGS Energy common
stock, with the stock portion subject to a 15% collar (based upon the closing
price of Energy East common stock on February 15, 2001).

    On February 16, 2001, Energy East held a special meeting of its board of
directors. After discussion, which included updates regarding the financial and
legal aspects of the proposed transaction from UBS Warburg and Wachtell, Lipton,
UBS Warburg delivered its opinion to the effect that as of that date the
consideration to be paid by Energy East pursuant to the merger agreement was
fair from a financial point of view to Energy East and the Energy East board of
directors unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement.

    Also on February 16, 2001, RGS Energy held a special meeting of its board of
directors. After discussion, which included updates regarding the financial and
legal aspects of the proposed transaction from Morgan Stanley and Shearman &
Sterling, Morgan Stanley delivered its opinion to the effect that as of that
date the consideration to be received by holders of shares of RGS Energy common
stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view
to those holders and the RGS Energy board of directors unanimously approved and
adopted the merger agreement.

    Later that day, Energy East and RGS Energy executed the merger agreement and
Mr. Richards' employment agreement. On February 20, 2001, the companies issued a
joint press release announcing the merger.

RGS ENERGY REASONS FOR THE MERGER; RECOMMENDATION OF THE RGS ENERGY BOARD OF
  DIRECTORS

    At its special meeting on February 16, 2001, after due consideration, the
RGS Energy board unanimously determined that the terms of the merger are fair
to, and in the best interests of, RGS Energy and its shareholders. The RGS
Energy board unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement, the merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Accordingly,
the RGS Energy board of directors unanimously recommends that RGS Energy
shareholders vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

    In reaching its recommendation, the RGS Energy board of directors considered
a number of factors, including the following:

    - TRANSACTION FINANCIAL TERMS/PREMIUM TO MARKET PRICE.  The RGS Energy board
      considered the relationship of the consideration to be paid in the merger
      to recent and historical market prices of RGS Energy shares. The
      consideration of $39.50 per RGS Energy share represents a 19.3% premium
      over the $33.10 closing price of RGS Energy shares on February 16, 2001
      (the last trading day prior to the announcement of the merger agreement),
      a 34.2% premium over the $29.44 closing price of RGS Energy shares on
      January 18, 2001 and a 57.6% premium over the $25.06 average closing price
      of RGS Energy shares for the 12 months ending on February 16, 2001. The
      RGS Energy board believed that $39.50 was the highest per share
      consideration that could be negotiated with Energy East.

      The RGS Energy board also considered the form of consideration to be
      received by the holders of RGS Energy shares in the merger. Since,
      pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, each holder of RGS Energy
      shares has the right to elect to receive either cash and/or Energy East
      shares in the merger (subject to proration), the RGS Energy board
      considered the certainty of the value of the cash component of the
      consideration as well as the ability of holders of RGS Energy shares to
      become holders of Energy East shares and participate in the future
      prospects of the combined businesses of Energy East and RGS Energy.
      Additionally, the RGS Energy board considered the fact that the stock
      component of the consideration is subject to a collar, which, depending
      upon the value of Energy East shares, could be beneficial or detrimental
      to holders of RGS Energy common stock.

      The RGS Energy board also considered that the merger is intended to be
      treated as a reorganization pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code and, if
      the merger were treated as a reorganization, RGS Energy shareholders who
      exchange their RGS Energy shares solely for

      Energy East shares generally would recognize no gain or loss for U.S.
      federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger. The RGS Energy
      Board also considered that RGS Energy may elect, under certain
      circumstances, to have the merger restructured so that RGS Energy, rather
      than Eagle Merger Corp., will be the company surviving the merger. In that
      case, the parties would no longer intend for the merger to be treated as a
      reorganization and the transaction would be fully taxable to RGS Energy
      shareholders.

    - STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES.  The RGS Energy board considered the presentations
      of RGS Energy's management, Morgan Stanley and the RGS Energy board of
      directors' review with respect to trends in the industries in which RGS
      Energy's businesses operate and the strategic alternatives available to
      RGS Energy, including RGS Energy's remaining an independent public
      company, the possibility of acquisitions or mergers with other companies
      in these industries and other transactions, as well as the risks and
      uncertainties associated with the strategic alternatives available to RGS
      Energy. The RGS Energy board of directors considered management's belief
      that RGS Energy and Energy East have similar corporate cultures, the
      complementary nature of the two companies' operations and operating
      regions, and the experience, reputation and financial strength of Energy
      East.

    - COMPETITIVE POSITION AND INCREASED FINANCIAL STRENGTH.  The merger is
      intended to establish a combined company that is able to compete more
      effectively in unregulated markets and serve customers more effectively in
      regulated markets. The combination of the companies' complementary
      expertise and infrastructure, including Energy East's diversified electric
      and natural gas businesses throughout the northeastern United States,
      should provide the combined company with the size and scope to be an
      effective competitor in the emerging and increasingly competitive markets
      for transporting and distributing energy and energy services. The combined
      company will be financially stronger and will have a broader customer base
      than RGS Energy as an independent entity. Also, the combined company will
      be one of the largest, most diversified energy providers in the Northeast,
      serving nearly 3 million customers, including approximately 1.8 million
      electric customers, almost 1 million natural gas customers and
      approximately 200,000 other retail energy customers. The combined company
      will have annual revenues of over $5 billion and approximately
      $10 billion in assets.

    - CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.  The RGS Energy board considered the corporate
      governance aspects of the merger, including that (a) Mr. Richards and two
      non-management directors of RGS Energy will be appointed to the Energy
      East board of directors, (b) pursuant to an employment agreement,
      Mr. Richards will be the chairman, president and chief executive officer
      of the surviving corporation (which will be a subsidiary of Energy East),
      an executive vice president of Energy East and will hold board and officer
      positions in other subsidiaries of Energy East, including RG&E and NYSEG,
      which is expected to become a subsidiary of RGS Energy, and (c) the
      surviving corporation will create an advisory board, whose members will be
      the same individuals who were the directors of RGS Energy immediately
      prior to the merger (other than those members of the RGS Energy board that
      become directors of Energy East).

    - COMMUNITY PRESENCE AND INVOLVEMENT.  The expanded RGS Energy will be
      headquartered in Rochester, New York. RG&E will remain a subsidiary of RGS
      Energy. The communities served by the expanded company will benefit from a
      combined company that is expected to compete more effectively in providing
      regulated and deregulated natural gas and electricity and energy related
      products and services. Additionally, the RGS Energy board considered
      Energy East's commitment to have approximately 40 Energy East Management
      Corporation employees in Rochester as of the effective date of the merger
      as well as to increase the level of charitable contributions to, and
      community involvement with, Rochester, New York to reflect the increase in
      size of the company based there.

    - IMPACT ON RGS ENERGY EMPLOYEES.  The RGS Energy board considered the
      potential benefits to RGS Energy employees from the expanded opportunities
      available as part of a larger organization. Also, no layoffs are planned
      as a result of the merger. Additionally, employees of RGS Energy and its
      subsidiaries will not be disadvantaged with respect to layoffs because
      some Energy East employees have union contracts.

    - TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.  In addition to the financial terms
      discussed above, the RGS Energy board considered the negotiated terms of
      the merger agreement, which the RGS Energy board and RGS Energy management
      viewed as fair to, and in the best interests of, RGS Energy and the RGS
      Energy shareholders, including the following:

       - CONDITIONS TO CONSUMMATION.  The RGS Energy board considered the fact
         that each of Energy East's and RGS Energy's obligation to complete the
         merger is subject to customary terms. The RGS Energy board also
         considered Energy East's and RGS Energy's commitment in the merger
         agreement to use their best efforts to obtain the required regulatory
         approvals for the merger.

       - UNSOLICITED ACQUISITION PROPOSALS.  RGS may terminate the merger
         agreement in response to an unsolicited acquisition proposal under
         certain limited circumstances, which include the payment of a
         $50 million termination fee plus expenses of up to $10 million.
         Further, RGS Energy would be entitled to a termination fee from Energy
         East of $50 million plus expenses of up to $10 million, under certain
         limited circumstances, if the merger agreement were to be terminated as
         a result of the required Energy East shareholder approval not being
         obtained.

    - SYNERGIES OF THE COMBINATION.  It is expected that the combination of the
      businesses of RGS Energy with those of Energy East would lead to potential
      cost savings and other benefits of approximately $50 million on an annual
      basis, largely derived from the joint management of Energy East and RGS
      Energy subsidiaries in areas such as procurement, information systems and
      other administrative and general areas.

    - MORGAN STANLEY ANALYSES.  The RGS Energy board considered presentations
      from and the opinion delivered by Morgan Stanley, dated February 16, 2001,
      as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration
      to be received by holders of shares of RGS Energy common stock pursuant to
      the merger agreement, as more fully described in "Opinion of the Financial
      Advisor to the RGS Energy Board."

    - RGS ENERGY OPERATING AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  The RGS Energy board
      considered the current and historical financial condition and results of
      operations of RGS Energy, as well as the prospects and strategic
      objectives of RGS Energy, including the risk involved in achieving those
      prospects and objectives, and the current and expected conditions in the
      industries in which RGS Energy's businesses operate.

    - ENERGY EAST OPERATING AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  The RGS Energy board
      considered the current and historical financial condition and results of
      operations of Energy East, as well as the prospects and strategic
      objectives of Energy East, including the risks involved in achieving those
      prospects and objectives, and the current and expected conditions in the
      industries in which Energy East's businesses operate.

    - REGULATORY MATTERS AND OTHER CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.  The
      RGS Energy board considered the risks associated with satisfying all
      conditions to completion of the merger, including obtaining the necessary
      regulatory approvals, and the possibility that, as a result of such risks,
      the consummation of the merger may be significantly delayed or,
      notwithstanding shareholder approval, that the merger may not be
      completed.

    - POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.  The interests that certain executive
      officers, directors and employees of RGS Energy may have with respect to
      the merger in addition to their interests as shareholders of RGS Energy,
      as more fully described under "The Merger--Interests of Certain Persons in
      the Merger."

    The RGS Energy board of directors also considered (1) the risk that the
benefits sought in the merger would not be obtained, (2) the effect of the
public announcement of the merger on RGS Energy's sales, customer, supplier and
creditor relationships, operating results and ability to retain employees and
the trading price of RGS Energy shares, (3) the substantial management time and
effort that will be required to complete the merger and integrate the operations
of the two companies, (4) the possibility that various provisions of the merger
agreement might have the effect of discouraging other persons potentially
interested in a combination with RGS Energy from pursuing such an opportunity,
(5) the risk that the value of Energy East shares might decline and (6) other
matters described under "Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements."

    The RGS Energy board of directors believed and continues to believe that any
potential risks and disadvantages of the merger are greatly outweighed by the
potential benefits anticipated to result from the merger.

    The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the
RGS Energy board is not intended to be exhaustive. In view of the variety of
factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger and the
complexity of these matters, the RGS Energy board did not find it practicable
to, and did not, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the
specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation.
The RGS Energy board relied on the experience and expertise of Morgan Stanley,
its financial advisor, for quantitative analysis of the financial terms of the
merger. In addition, the RGS Energy board did not undertake to make any specific
determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any
particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to its ultimate determination,
but rather the RGS Energy board of directors conducted an overall analysis of
the factors described above, including through discussions with and questioning
of RGS Energy's management and legal and financial advisors. In addition,
individual members of the RGS Energy board may have given differing weights to
different factors.

    FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE RGS ENERGY BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS
DETERMINED THAT THE TERMS OF THE MERGER ARE FAIR TO, AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS
OF, THE RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, THE RGS ENERGY BOARD OF DIRECTORS
UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE
MERGER AGREEMENT.

ENERGY EAST REASONS FOR THE MERGER; RECOMMENDATION OF THE ENERGY EAST BOARD OF
  DIRECTORS

    The Energy East board unanimously determined that the terms of the merger
are fair to, and in the best interests of, Energy East and its shareholders.
Accordingly, the Energy East board of directors unanimously recommends that
Energy East shareholders vote for the approval of the issuance of Energy East
shares in connection with the merger.

    In reaching its decision to approve the merger, the Energy East board of
directors consulted with Energy East's legal and financial advisors as well as
with Energy East's management. The Energy East board of directors considered a
number of factors, including, without limitation, the following:

    - ACCRETIVE TO EARNINGS IN THE FIRST FULL YEAR AFTER CLOSING.  The Energy
      East board and Energy East management believe that the merger would be
      accretive to earnings in the first full year after completion of the
      merger if anticipated synergies can be obtained and retained;

    - SYNERGIES.  It is expected that the merger would generate annual cost
      savings of approximately $50 million, resulting from joint management of
      procurement, information technology and other administrative and general
      areas;

    - COMPLEMENTARY OPERATIONS.  Over 200 miles of contiguous territory between
      the NYSEG and RG&E service territories would provide an excellent
      opportunity for operational efficiencies, and peak usage in each territory
      is complementary, with NYSEG peaking in the winter and RG&E peaking in the
      summer;

    - ENHANCEMENT OF MANAGEMENT TEAM.  The Energy East board and Energy East
      management believe that the RGS Energy management team will fortify the
      Energy East management team;

    - OPPORTUNITY TO PROFITABLY GROW DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IN NORTHEAST.  The
      merger would create the premier upstate utility, serving half of upstate
      New York, and, consistent with the strategy Energy East has been pursuing
      over the last several years, would enhance Energy East's position as a
      super-regional energy services and delivery company in the Northeast;

    - SUPPLY WILL BE INCREASED AND STABILIZED.  The merger would increase Energy
      East's generation portfolio, and would further Energy East's goal of
      providing its customers with a reliable supply of electricity;

    - PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR.  The Energy East board considered the
      financial presentation and opinion of UBS Warburg, Energy East's financial
      advisor, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Energy
      East of the consideration to be paid to RGS Energy shareholders in the
      merger, as more fully described in "Opinion of the Financial Advisor to
      the Energy East Board"; and

    - TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE MERGER.  The Energy East board considered the
      terms and conditions of the merger, which the Energy East board and Energy
      East management viewed as fair to, and in the best interests of, Energy
      East and the Energy East shareholders.

    All combinations, including the merger, also include certain risks and
disadvantages. The material potential risks and disadvantages to Energy East
shareholders identified by the Energy East board and management in considering
the merger include the following:

    - the time and resources required to complete the merger, with the
      completion of the merger being subject to various conditions (see "The
      Merger Agreement--Conditions");

    - the difficulties inherent in combining the two companies and the potential
      distraction to management caused by a transaction of this magnitude; and

    - the risk that the benefits sought from the merger, due to the matters
      described under "Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Statement Regarding
      Forward-Looking Statements" and other matters, might not fully be
      achieved.

    The Energy East board of directors believed and continues to believe that
these potential risks and disadvantages are greatly outweighed by the potential
benefits anticipated to result from the merger.

    This discussion of the information and factors considered by the Energy East
board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive. In view of the wide variety
of factors considered, the Energy East board of directors did not find it
practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attempt to assign relative
weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its conclusion. In
addition, individual directors may have given different weights to different
factors.

    FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE ENERGY EAST BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS
DETERMINED THAT THE TERMS OF THE MERGER ARE FAIR TO, AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS
OF, THE ENERGY EAST SHAREHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, THE ENERGY EAST BOARD OF
DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT ENERGY EAST SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE
APPROVAL OF THE ISSUANCE OF ENERGY EAST SHARES IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER.

OPINION OF THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO THE RGS ENERGY BOARD

    RGS Energy retained Morgan Stanley as its exclusive financial advisor in
connection with the merger. The RGS Energy board selected Morgan Stanley to act
as RGS Energy's financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley's qualifications,
expertise and reputation and its knowledge of the business and affairs of RGS
Energy. At the meeting of the RGS Energy board on February 16, 2001, Morgan
Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of
February 16, 2001, and

subject to and based on the considerations in its opinion, the consideration to
be received by the RGS Energy shareholders pursuant to the merger agreement was
fair from a financial point of view to those holders.

    The full text of the Morgan Stanley opinion, dated February 16, 2001, which
sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as
Appendix B to this document. RGS Energy shareholders are urged to read this
opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley's opinion is directed to
the board of directors of RGS Energy, addresses only the fairness from a
financial point of view of the consideration to be received by the RGS Energy
shareholders, and does not address any other aspect of the merger or constitute
a recommendation to any RGS Energy shareholder as to how to vote at the RGS
Energy annual meeting. The summary of the Morgan Stanley opinion set forth in
this document is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of this
opinion.

    In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:

    - reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other
      information of RGS Energy and Energy East;

    - reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and
      operating data concerning RGS Energy and Energy East prepared by the
      management of RGS Energy and Energy East, respectively;

    - reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of RGS
      Energy and Energy East, respectively;

    - discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the
      prospects of RGS Energy and Energy East, including information relating to
      certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the
      merger, with senior executives of RGS Energy and Energy East,
      respectively;

    - reviewed the pro forma impact of the merger on Energy East's earnings per
      share, credit ratios and consolidated capitalization;

    - reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the RGS Energy
      shares and the Energy East shares;

    - compared the financial performance of RGS Energy and Energy East and the
      prices and trading activity of the RGS Energy shares and the Energy East
      shares with that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable
      with RGS Energy and Energy East, respectively, and their securities;

    - reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain
      comparable acquisition transactions;

    - participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of RGS
      Energy and Energy East and their financial and legal advisors;

    - reviewed the merger agreement, and certain related documents; and

    - performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as Morgan
      Stanley deemed appropriate.

    Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon without independent verification the
accuracy and completeness of the information reviewed by it for the purposes of
its opinion. With respect to the financial projections, including information
relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated
from the merger, Morgan Stanley assumed that they were reasonably prepared on
bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
future financial performance of RGS Energy and Energy East. Morgan Stanley
relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment by the management
of RGS Energy and Energy East, respectively, of the future competitive and
regulatory environment for RGS Energy and Energy East and their ability to
achieve the strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the
merger. Morgan Stanley

assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary regulatory
approvals for the merger, no restrictions will be imposed that would have a
material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in
the merger. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the merger will be
consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement,
including, among other things, that the merger is intended to be treated as a
reorganization pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. Morgan Stanley did not
make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of
Energy East, nor was it furnished with any such appraisals. Morgan Stanley's
opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions
as in effect on, and the information made available to Morgan Stanley as of, the
date of its opinion.

    The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by
Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the preparation of its
written opinion. These summaries of financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses
used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses.

    STOCK TRADING HISTORY.  Morgan Stanley reviewed the history of the trading
prices for RGS Energy shares and Energy East shares, both separately and in
relation to a market index for a period ending February 14, 2001. The market
index used was the Standard and Poor's Electric Companies index. Energy East
underperformed the Standard and Poor's Electric Companies index during the
twelve months prior to the transaction, while RGS Energy outperformed the
Standard and Poor's Electric Companies index. Morgan Stanley also reviewed the
implied exchange ratio, defined as the RGS Energy closing price divided by the
Energy East closing price, during the twelve months prior to the transaction.
The implied exchange ratio as defined above over varying time periods was as
follows:

- -   12 months prior to February 14, 2001........................   1.26x
- -   6 months prior to February 14, 2001.........................   1.42x
- -   3 months prior to February 14, 2001.........................   1.58x
- -   1 month prior to February 14, 2001..........................   1.66x

    SELECTED COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANY ANALYSIS.  Using publicly available
information, Morgan Stanley compared selected historical and projected
financial, operating and stock market performance data of RGS Energy and Energy
East to the corresponding data of companies that share similar characteristics
with RGS Energy and Energy East.

    The RGS Energy comparable companies consisted of:

    - FirstEnergy Corporation

    - DTE Energy Company

    - UIL Holdings Corporation

    - CH Energy Group Inc.

    The Energy East comparable companies consisted of:

    - NSTAR

    - Conectiv

    - UIL Holdings Corporation

    - CH Energy Group Inc.

    With respect to RGS Energy and its comparable companies, Morgan Stanley
calculated multiples of total enterprise value (market value, as defined later,
plus preferred stock and debt less cash and cash equivalents) to latest twelve
months ("LTM") earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization
("EBITDA"). Morgan Stanley also calculated multiples of market value (share
price multiplied by shares outstanding) to (1) projected fiscal year 2001 net
income, (2) projected fiscal year 2002 net income, (3) LTM cash flow from
operations and (4) book value of equity. The comparable companies' projected
fiscal year 2001 and 2002 earnings results were based on publicly available
median

earnings per share ("EPS") estimates from I/B/E/S, a data service that monitors
and publishes a compilation of earnings estimates produced by selected research
analysts on companies of interest to investors, and shares outstanding as of a
company's latest 10-Q or 10-K. The RGS Energy comparable companies analysis
resulted in the following ranges of multiples as of February 14, 2001:

                                    ANALYSIS
                                MULTIPLE RANGES

- -   LTM EBITDA..................................................    6.0x to 7.3x
- -   Projected fiscal year 2001 net income.......................  10.2x to 11.5x
- -   Projected fiscal year 2002 net income.......................   9.7x to 11.0x
- -   LTM cash flow from operations...............................    3.7x to 4.2x
- -   Book value of equity........................................  1.35x to 1.45x

    Applying these multiples to RGS Energy resulted in equity values for RGS
Energy of $26.50 to $31.25 per share. The closing price for RGS Energy shares on
February 15, 2001 was $32.85 per share. As of February 15, 2001, the offer price
for each RGS Energy share was $39.50 per share.

    With respect to Energy East and its comparable companies, Morgan Stanley
calculated multiples of total enterprise value to LTM EBITDA. Morgan Stanley
also calculated multiples of market value to (1) projected fiscal year 2001 net
income, (2) projected fiscal year 2002 net income, (3) LTM cash flow from
operations plus dividends and (4) book value of equity. The comparable
companies' projected fiscal year 2001 and 2002 earnings results were based on
publicly available median EPS estimates from I/B/E/S and shares outstanding as
of a company's latest 10-Q or 10-K. The Energy East comparable companies
analysis resulted in the following ranges of multiples as of February 14, 2001:

                                    ANALYSIS
                                MULTIPLE RANGES

- -   LTM EBITDA..................................................    7.0x to 8.0x
- -   Projected fiscal year 2001 net income.......................  11.0x to 12.0x
- -   Projected fiscal year 2002 net income.......................  10.3x to 11.5x
- -   LTM cash flow from operations...............................    4.5x to 7.5x
- -   Book value of equity........................................  1.50x to 1.60x

    Applying these multiples to Energy East resulted in equity values for Energy
East of $18.75 to $23.00 per share. The closing price for Energy East shares on
February 15, 2001 was $19.49 per share.

    No company utilized in the comparable company analysis is identical to RGS
Energy or Energy East. In evaluating the comparable company groups, Morgan
Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance,
general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond the control of RGS Energy or Energy East. These other
matters include the impact of competition on the business of RGS Energy or
Energy East and the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any
adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of RGS Energy
or Energy East or in the industry or financial markets in general. Mathematical
analysis, such as determining the average or median, is not in itself a
meaningful method of using comparable company data.

    SELECTED COMPARABLE MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS ANALYSIS.  Morgan Stanley
reviewed publicly available financial information for selected completed and
pending mergers and acquisitions involving companies in the integrated electric
and gas utility business. The selected mergers and acquisitions included
(target/acquiror):

    - Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc./National Grid Group PLC

    - GPU Inc./FirstEnergy Corp.

    - IPALCO Enterprises Inc./AES Corp.

    - Bangor Hydro-Electric Co./NS Power Holdings

    - LG&E Energy Corp./PowerGen PLC

    - MidAmerican Energy Co./Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

    - Northeast Utilities/Consolidated Edison Inc.

    - Florida Progress Corp./Carolina Power & Light Co.

    - CMP Group Inc./Energy East Corp.

    - Empire District Electric Co./UtiliCorp United Inc.

    - St. Joseph Light & Power Co./UtiliCorp United Inc.

    - New England Electric System/National Grid Group PLC

    - PacifiCorp/ScottishPower PLC

    - Commonwealth Energy System/BEC Energy

    - CILCORP Inc./AES Corp.

    - MidAmerican Energy Co./CalEnergy

    - Orange & Rockland Utilities Inc./Consolidated Edison Inc.

    - Central & South West Corp./American Electric Power Co.

    - KU Energy Corp./LG&E Energy Corp.

    Morgan Stanley reviewed the consideration paid, or market value, (for stock
deals, based on acquiror stock prices on the day prior to the announcement of
the transaction) in the comparable transactions and calculated multiples of
total enterprise value to the targets' LTM (latest twelve months prior to the
announcement of the transaction) EBITDA. Morgan Stanley also calculated
multiples of the consideration paid to the targets' (1) LTM net income, (2) LTM
cash flow from operations, (3) forward year earnings and (4) book value of
equity. The comparable transactions analysis resulted in the following ranges:

                                    ANALYSIS
                                MULTIPLE RANGES

- -   LTM EBITDA..................................................    6.5x to 8.0x
- -   LTM net income..............................................  15.0x to 17.0x
- -   Projected fiscal year 2001 net income.......................  14.0x to 16.0x
- -   LTM cash flow from operations...............................    4.5x to 6.5x
- -   Book value of equity........................................    1.5x to 1.7x

    Applying these multiples to RGS Energy resulted in equity values for RGS
Energy of $34.00 to $42.00 per share. The closing price for RGS Energy shares on
February 15, 2001 was $32.85 per share. As of February 15, 2001, the offer price
for each RGS Energy share was $39.50 per share.

    No transaction utilized as a comparison in the precedent transactions
analysis is identical to the merger. In evaluating the precedent transactions,
Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of RGS Energy. These other
matters include the impact of competition on RGS Energy and the industry
generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the
financial condition and prospects of RGS Energy or in the industry or financial
markets in general. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the average or
median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using precedent transaction
data.

    PREMIUM ANALYSIS.  Morgan Stanley analyzed RGS Energy based on a premium
range to the "unaffected price," defined as the midpoint of the comparable
public company analysis ($28.88). Morgan Stanley applied a 25% to 40% premium to
the unaffected price, which resulted in equity values for RGS Energy of $36.00
to $40.50 per share. The closing price for RGS Energy shares on February 15,
2001 was $32.85 per share. As of February 15, 2001, the offer price for each RGS
Energy share was $39.50 per share.

    DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.  Morgan Stanley analyzed RGS Energy based on
an unleveraged discounted cash flow analysis of the projected financial
performance of RGS Energy. This projected financial performance was based upon a
five-year forecast for RGS Energy provided by RGS Energy management. The
discounted cash flow analysis determined the discounted present value of the
unleveraged after-tax cash flows generated over the five-year period and then
added a terminal value based upon a range of EBITDA multiples of 6.25x to 7.25x.
The unleveraged after-tax cash flows and terminal value were discounted using a
range of discount rates (7.5% to 8.5%) that represented an estimate of the
weighted average cost of capital of RGS Energy. The discounted cash flow
analysis of RGS Energy financials as provided by RGS Energy management resulted
in equity values for RGS Energy of $30.25 to $40.50 per share.

    Morgan Stanley analyzed Energy East based on an unleveraged discounted cash
flow analysis of the projected financial performance of Energy East. This
projected financial performance was based upon a five-year forecast for Energy
East provided by Energy East management. The discounted cash flow analysis
determined the discounted present value of the unleveraged after-tax cash flows
generated over the five-year period and then added a terminal value based upon a
range of EBITDA multiples of 7.00x to 8.00x. The unleveraged after-tax cash
flows and terminal value were discounted using a range of discount rates (7.5%
to 8.5%) that represented an estimate of the weighted average cost of capital of
Energy East. The discounted cash flow analysis of Energy East financials as
provided by Energy East management resulted in equity values for Energy East of
$21.25 to $27.50.

    PRO FORMA MERGER ANALYSIS.  Morgan Stanley performed an analysis of the
potential pro forma effect of the merger on Energy East's EPS for the fiscal
years 2001 through 2005. Morgan Stanley combined the projected operating results
of RGS Energy with the corresponding projected operating results of Energy East,
each provided by each company's respective management, to arrive at the combined
company projected net income. Morgan Stanley divided the combined company
projected net income by the pro forma shares outstanding to arrive at the
combined company projected EPS. Morgan Stanley then compared the combined
company projected EPS to Energy East's projected stand-alone results provided by
Energy East management to determine the projected pro forma impact on Energy
East. This analysis suggested that, without assuming any cost savings due to the
merger, the merger would result in dilution to Energy East's EPS post goodwill
for years 2001-2005 and would result in dilution to Energy East's EPS
pre-goodwill in years 2001 and 2003 and accretion to Energy East's EPS
pre-goodwill in years 2002, 2004 and 2005.

    In connection with the review of the merger by the RGS Energy board, Morgan
Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes
of its opinion given in connection therewith. The preparation of a fairness
opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley
considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute
any particular weight to any particular analysis or factor considered by it.
Furthermore, Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses
or factors considered by it, without considering all analyses and factors as a
whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion. In
addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or
less weight than other assumptions, so that the ranges of valuations resulting
from any particular analysis described above should therefore not be taken to be
Morgan Stanley's view of the actual value of RGS Energy or Energy East.

    In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of RGS Energy or Energy
East. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley's analysis are not necessarily
indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more
or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates. The analyses were
prepared solely as part of Morgan Stanley's analysis of the fairness from a
financial point of view of the common share exchange ratio, pursuant to the
merger agreement, to the holders of RGS Energy common shares and were conducted
in connection with the delivery by Morgan Stanley of its opinion dated
February 16, 2001 to the RGS Energy board of directors. The analyses do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which RGS Energy common
shares or Energy East ordinary shares actually may be valued or the prices at
which their shares may actually trade in the marketplace. Accordingly, such
analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

    In addition, as described above, Morgan Stanley's opinion and presentation
to the RGS Energy board of directors was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the RGS Energy board of directors in making its decision to
approve the merger. Consequently, the Morgan Stanley analyses as described above
should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the RGS Energy board of
directors with respect to the value of RGS Energy or of whether the RGS Energy
board of directors would have been willing to agree to a different exchange
ratio. The common stock exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement and
other terms of the merger agreement were determined through arm's-length
negotiations between RGS Energy and Energy East and were approved by the RGS
Energy board of directors. Morgan Stanley did not recommend any specific
exchange ratio to RGS Energy or that any given exchange ratio constituted the
only appropriate exchange ratio for the merger.

    Morgan Stanley is an internationally recognized investment banking and
advisory firm. Morgan Stanley, as part of its investment banking and financial
advisory business, is continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and
securities in connection with the mergers and acquisitions, negotiated
underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other
purposes. In the ordinary course of Morgan Stanley's trading, brokerage and
financing activities, Morgan Stanley or its affiliates may at any time hold long
or short positions, trade or otherwise effect transactions, for its own account
or for the account of customers in the equity or debt securities or senior loans
of RGS Energy or Energy East.

    Pursuant to an engagement letter between RGS Energy and Morgan Stanley dated
January 18, 2001, Morgan Stanley has earned a fee of $3,058,965 for the
rendering of the Morgan Stanley opinion and the public announcement of the
merger. In addition, Morgan Stanley will receive a fee of $3,058,965, payable
upon the approval of the transaction by RGS Energy's shareholders, and another
$3,058,965 upon completion of the merger. In addition, Morgan Stanley will be
reimbursed for certain of its related expenses. Morgan Stanley will not be
entitled to any additional fees or compensation in the event the merger is not
approved or otherwise completed. RGS Energy also agreed, under separate
agreement, to indemnify Morgan Stanley, its affiliates and each of its
directors, officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, controlling
Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under federal securities laws.

    In the past, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided investment
banking and other financial services to RGS Energy and Energy East and have
received fees for the rendering of these services. Morgan Stanley may provide
financial advisory services to, and may act as underwriter or placement agent
for, the combined company in the future. In the ordinary course of Morgan
Stanley's business, Morgan Stanley may actively trade the securities of RGS
Energy and Energy East for its own account and for the accounts of its customers
and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short positions in such
securities.

OPINION OF THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO THE ENERGY EAST BOARD

    On February 16, 2001, the Energy East board of directors received UBS
Warburg's oral opinion, which was subsequently followed by a written opinion as
of the same date, that, as of that date and subject to the various
considerations, assumptions, limitations and qualifications described in the
opinion, the consideration to be paid by Energy East to shareholders of RGS
Energy is fair, from a financial point of view, to Energy East.

    Each Energy East shareholder is urged to read the actual UBS Warburg
opinion, dated February 16, 2001, which is attached as Appendix C to this
document.

    In arriving at its opinion, UBS Warburg, among other things:

    - reviewed certain publicly available business and historical financial
      information relating to Energy East and RGS Energy;

    - reviewed certain internal financial information and other data relating to
      the business and financial prospects of RGS Energy, including estimates
      and financial forecasts prepared by management of RGS Energy that were
      provided to UBS Warburg by RGS Energy and not publicly available;

    - reviewed certain internal financial information and other data relating to
      the business and financial prospects of Energy East, including estimates
      and financial forecasts prepared by the management of Energy East and not
      publicly available;

    - conducted discussions with members of the senior management of Energy East
      and RGS Energy, respectively, concerning the businesses and financial
      prospects of Energy East and RGS Energy;

    - reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data with respect
      to certain other companies in lines of business UBS Warburg believed to be
      generally comparable to those of RGS Energy;

    - reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data with respect
      to certain other companies in lines of business UBS Warburg believed to be
      generally comparable to those of Energy East;

    - compared the financial terms of the merger with the publicly available
      financial terms of certain other transactions which UBS Warburg believed
      to be generally relevant;

    - considered certain pro forma effects of the merger on Energy East's
      financial statements;

    - reviewed the merger agreement;

    - considered the strategic advantages of the merger; and

    - conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations, and
      considered such other information as UBS Warburg deemed necessary or
      appropriate.

    In connection with their review, UBS Warburg, at Energy East's direction,
did not assume any responsibility for independent verification of any of the
information reviewed by UBS Warburg for the purpose of this opinion, and relied,
with Energy East's consent, on such information being complete and accurate in
all material respects. At Energy East's direction, UBS Warburg has not made any
independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of RGS Energy or Energy East, nor was UBS Warburg
furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. With respect to the financial
forecasts, estimates and pro forma effects referred to above, UBS Warburg
assumed, at Energy East's direction, that they had been reasonably prepared on a
basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
managements of the companies as to the future performance of their respective
companies. In addition, UBS Warburg also assumed, with Energy East's

approval, that the future financial results referred to above would be achieved
at the times and in the amounts projected by management. UBS Warburg also
assumed, with Energy East's consent, that the merger will be accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting and that all governmental, regulatory or other
approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without
any material adverse effect on Energy East and/or RGS Energy. Energy East did
not limit UBS Warburg regarding the procedures to be followed or factors to be
considered in rendering its opinion.

    UBS Warburg's opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market
and other conditions in effect on, and the information made available to UBS
Warburg as of, the date thereof.

    The UBS Warburg opinion did not address Energy East's underlying business
decision to effect the merger or constitute a recommendation to any shareholder
of Energy East as to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the
issuance of shares of Energy East common stock to effect the merger. Other than
as set forth in its opinion, UBS Warburg had not been asked to, nor did UBS
Warburg offer any opinion as to the material terms of the merger agreement or
the form of the merger. UBS Warburg expressed no opinion as to what the value of
Energy East common stock will be when issued pursuant to the merger or the
prices at which it will trade in the future. In rendering its opinion, UBS
Warburg assumed, with Energy East's consent, that Energy East and RGS Energy
will comply with all the material terms of the merger agreement.

    No company, transaction or business used in the analysis described below
under "RGS Energy Comparable Company Trading Analysis," "Energy East Comparable
Company Trading Analysis" and "Comparable Company Acquisition Analysis" is
identical to RGS Energy, Energy East or the proposed merger. Accordingly, the
analysis of the results necessarily involves complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and
other factors.

    In connection with rendering its opinion, UBS Warburg considered a variety
of valuation methods. The following discussion summarizes the material valuation
methods considered by UBS Warburg.

    RGS ENERGY COMPARABLE COMPANY TRADING ANALYSIS.  Using publicly available
information, UBS Warburg compared multiples of certain financial criteria for
RGS Energy to multiples based upon market trading values at the time for certain
other companies which, in UBS Warburg's judgment, were generally comparable to
RGS Energy for the purpose of this analysis. The factors UBS Warburg considered
in selecting companies for comparison included size, geographic location,
financial condition and scope of business operations. The companies used in the
comparison were Alliant Energy Corporation; CH Energy Group, Inc.; Consolidated
Edison, Inc.; UIL Holdings Corporation; Vectren Corporation; Wisconsin Energy
Corporation; and WPS Resources Corporation.

    In evaluating the current market value of RGS Energy common stock, UBS
Warburg determined ranges of multiples for selected measures of financial
performance for the comparable companies, including the market value per share
of outstanding common stock as a multiple of:

    - Net income per share of common stock ("EPS") for the latest 12-month
      period ("LTM"); and

    - Estimated EPS for the current and the following fiscal years as projected
      by I/B/E/S, a data service that monitors and publishes a compilation of
      earnings estimates produced by selected research analysts on companies of
      interest to investors.

    In addition, UBS Warburg determined ranges of multiples for selected
measures of financial performance for the comparable companies, including the
adjusted market value of RGS Energy (defined as the market value of outstanding
common stock plus total debt, preferred and minority interests, less cash and
equivalents) as a multiple of:

    - LTM operating income, or earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT"); and

    - LTM operating cash flow, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
      and amortization ("EBITDA").

    UBS Warburg then compared such multiples to the corresponding data for RGS
Energy and developed an indicative trading range for RGS Energy. This analysis
produced a range of multiples for RGS Energy in the indicative trading value
range. The results are summarized in the following table, which shows the range
of multiples produced for each of the measures of RGS Energy's financial
performance in the indicative trading value range:

                                                            RGS        RGS
                                         COMPARABLE      ENERGY AT  ENERGY AT

- --------------------------------     ------------------  ---------  ---------

LTM EPS............................       12.0x--14.0x     11.2x      13.5x
2001 Estimated EPS.................       11.0x--13.5x     11.5x      13.9x
2002 Estimated EPS.................       11.0x--12.5x     11.0x      13.3x
LTM EBIT...........................       10.0x--12.0x      9.7x      10.7x
LTM EBITDA.........................         7.0x--8.0x      5.9x       6.6x

    As shown above, this analysis produced values of $29.00 to $35.00 per share
for RGS Energy. RGS Energy's closing price of $33.10 on February 16, 2001, was
somewhat above the middle of this range.

    COMPARABLE COMPANY ACQUISITION ANALYSIS.  UBS Warburg reviewed comparable
transactions that have been announced since 1998, excluding mergers of equals,
involving acquisitions of regulated gas and electric companies or holding
companies for regulated gas and electric companies based in the United States.
Fifteen comparable transactions were selected in which the target's equity value
exceeded $500 million.

    The comparable transactions included the following announced and completed
transactions:

    - Potomac Electric Power Company and Conectiv;

    - National Grid Group plc and Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation;

    - The AES Corporation and IPALCO Enterprises, Inc.;

    - PowerGen plc and LG&E Energy Corporation;

    - Sierra Pacific Resources and Portland General Electric Company (Enron
      Corporation);

    - an investor group and MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company;

    - Consolidated Edison, Inc. and Northeast Utilities;

    - Carolina Power & Light Company and Florida Progress Corporation;

    - Energy East Corporation and CMP Group, Inc.;

    - Dynegy, Inc. and Illinova Corporation;

    - an investor group and TNP Enterprises, Inc.;

    - ScottishPower plc and PacifiCorp;

    - The AES Corporation and CILCORP Inc.;

    - CalEnergy Company, Inc. and MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company; and

    - Consolidated Edison, Inc. and Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc.

    UBS Warburg calculated the equity consideration per share to be paid to the
second company's shareholders for each of the comparable transactions as a
multiple of various measures of financial performance for that company
including:

    - LTM EPS as of the date of each respective transaction announcement;

    - Estimated EPS for the then current and the following fiscal years as
      projected by I/B/E/S; and

    - Premium to the closing price per share of common stock for one day and one
      month prior to the date of each respective transaction announcement.

    In addition, UBS Warburg calculated the adjusted acquisition value for each
of the comparable transactions as a multiple of each acquired company's:

    - LTM EBIT as of the date of each respective transaction announcement; and

    - LTM EBITDA as of the date of each respective transaction announcement.

    UBS Warburg then compared such multiples to the corresponding data for RGS
Energy and developed an indicative acquisition value range for RGS Energy. This
analysis produced a range of multiples for RGS Energy in the indicative
acquisition value range. The results are summarized in the following table,
which shows the range of multiples produced in the indicative acquisition value
range for each of the selected measures of RGS Energy financial performance:

                                                            RGS        RGS

2001 Estimated EPS.................       14.0x--18.0x     14.7x      17.9x
2002 Estimated EPS.................       14.0x--18.0x     14.1x      17.1x
LTM EBIT...........................       10.0x--13.5x     11.1x      12.4x
LTM EBITDA.........................         7.0x--8.0x      6.8x       7.6x
One-Day Premium (%)................         20.0--35.0      12.1       36.4
One-Month Premium (%)..............         25.0--40.0      26.8       54.2

    As shown above, this analysis produced values of $37.00 to $45.00 per share
for RGS Energy. The transaction price of $39.50 per share is somewhat below the
midpoint of this range.

    UBS Warburg also performed a discounted cash flow analysis of RGS Energy
based upon projections furnished by RGS Energy that were reviewed by Energy East
management. Utilizing these projections, UBS Warburg discounted to present
value, under assumed discount rates ranging from 7.00% to 8.00%, the unlevered
free cash flows through the year 2005 for RGS Energy. Terminal values were
determined utilizing multiples of EBITDA of 7.0x to 8.0x, based on the EBITDA
multiples of public companies deemed comparable to RGS Energy. These were the
same companies used by UBS Warburg in its comparable company trading analysis of
RGS Energy summarized above. As an alternative measure, the terminal value was
calculated using perpetuity growth rates of 0.5% to 1.0%. The present value of
the discounted cash flow of RGS Energy ranged from $36.00 to $44.00. The
transaction price of $39.50 per share is at approximately the midpoint of this
range.

    The valuation analysis of RGS Energy can be summarized as shown in the
following table:

VALUATION METHODOLOGY                         LOW END OF RANGE   HIGH END OF RANGE

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis...............       $36.00             $44.00

    ENERGY EAST COMPARABLE COMPANY TRADING ANALYSIS.  Using publicly available
information, UBS Warburg compared multiples of certain financial criteria for
Energy East to multiples based upon market trading values at the time for
certain other electric utilities or holding companies for electric utilities
which, in UBS Warburg's judgment, were generally comparable to Energy East for
the purpose of this analysis. The factors UBS Warburg considered in selecting
companies for comparison included size, geographic location, financial condition
and scope of business operations. The companies used in the comparison were
Consolidated Edison, Inc.; NSTAR; Potomac Electric Power Company; Sempra Energy
and UIL Holdings Corporation.

    In evaluating the current market value per share of Energy East common
stock, UBS Warburg determined ranges of multiples for selected measures of
financial performance for the comparable companies including the market value
per share of outstanding common stock as a multiple of:

    - LTM EPS; and

    - Estimated EPS for the current and the following fiscal years as projected
     by I/B/E/S.

    In addition, UBS Warburg determined ranges of multiples for selected
measures of financial performance for the comparable companies, including the
adjusted market value as a multiple of:

    - LTM EBIT; and

    - LTM EBITDA.

    The Energy East comparable company trading analysis resulted in the
following range of multiples:

MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE                    COMPARABLE COMPANY MULTIPLES
- --------------------------------                    ----------------------------

LTM EPS...........................................       10.5x -- 13.0x
2001 Estimated EPS................................       10.0x -- 11.5x
2002 Estimated EPS................................       9.5x -- 11.0x
LTM EBIT..........................................       9.0x -- 10.0x
LTM EBITDA........................................       6.0x --  7.0x

    UBS Warburg then applied such multiples to the corresponding data for Energy
East, resulting in a range of equity values of $18.00 to $21.00 per share.
Energy East's closing price on February 16, 2001, was $19.14. This analysis was
performed by UBS Warburg to determine if the Energy East common stock comprising
45% of the total consideration of the merger was appropriately valued. Based on
this analysis, UBS Warburg determined that Energy East common stock was
appropriately valued.

    ACCRETION/DILUTION ANALYSIS.  UBS Warburg analyzed certain pro forma effects
of the transaction on the estimated earnings per share of Energy East for 2002,
2003 and 2004. This analysis was performed based upon forecasts provided by
Energy East management for Energy East's estimated earnings and upon RGS Energy
forecasts provided by RGS Energy management, with adjustments deemed appropriate
by Energy East management, and did not take into account any synergies that may
be realized as a result of the merger. This resulted in dilution to Energy
East's earnings per share in each of the years analyzed, including the
amortization of goodwill. However, assuming that the estimated synergies could
be obtained and retained, the transaction is accretive to Energy East's earnings
per share in each of the years analyzed, including the amortization of goodwill.

    The preparation of a fairness opinion involves various determinations as to
the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the
application of these methods to particular circumstances. Therefore, the opinion
and analysis are not readily susceptible to summary description. Accordingly,
notwithstanding the separate factors and analyses summarized above, UBS Warburg
believes that its analysis must be considered as a whole and that selecting only
portions of its analysis

and the factors it considered, without considering all factors and analyses,
could create a misleading view of the evaluation process underlying the
opinions. UBS Warburg did not assign any particular weight to any analyses or
factors it considered. Rather, UBS Warburg made qualitative judgments based on
its experience in rendering these opinions and on economic, monetary and market
conditions then present as to the significance and relevance of each analysis
and factor. In its analyses, UBS Warburg assumed relatively stable industry
performance, regulatory environments and general business and economic
conditions, all of which are beyond Energy East's control. Any estimates
contained in UBS Warburg's analyses do not necessarily indicate actual value,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such
estimates. Estimates of the financial value of companies do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect necessarily the prices at which companies or their
securities actually may be sold.

    UBS Warburg is an internationally recognized investment banking firm. As
part of its investment banking business, UBS Warburg is regularly engaged in
evaluating businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. Energy East's board of
directors selected UBS Warburg on the basis of the firm's expertise and
reputation.

    Pursuant to the engagement letter between Energy East and UBS Warburg,
Energy East paid UBS Warburg $2.0 million upon the rendering of UBS Warburg's
fairness opinion. In addition, UBS Warburg will receive a $1.0 million payment
at the time of the Energy East shareholder approval of the issuance of Energy
East shares in connection with the merger. At the completion of the merger, UBS
Warburg will receive a fee of $0.8 million. Energy East has agreed to indemnify
UBS Warburg against certain liabilities, including liabilities under federal
securities laws, relating to or arising out of its engagement. In the past, UBS
Warburg and its predecessors have provided investment banking services to Energy
East and received customary compensation for rendering such services.

    In the ordinary course of business, UBS Warburg, its successors and
affiliates, have traded or may trade securities of Energy East and RGS Energy
for their own accounts and the accounts of their customers and, accordingly, may
at any time hold a long or short position in such securities.

EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER

    The merger will become effective when the parties to the merger agreement
file a certificate of merger with the Department of State of the State of New
York in accordance with the New York Business Corporation Law, or at a later
time that Energy East and RGS Energy may specify in the certificate of merger.

    If the merger agreement is approved at the RGS Energy annual meeting, and
the issuance of Energy East shares in connection with the merger is approved at
the Energy East annual meeting, the effective time will occur two days after
satisfaction or waiver of the remaining conditions to the merger contained in
the merger agreement, including the receipt of all required regulatory
approvals.

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS

    The certificate of incorporation of Eagle Merger Corp., in effect
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, will become the
certificate of incorporation of the surviving company, except that the name of
the surviving company will be "RGS Energy Group, Inc." The bylaws of Eagle
Merger Corp. in effect immediately prior to the effective time will be the
bylaws of the surviving company.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

    The merger will be accounted for as an acquisition of RGS Energy by Energy
East under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A portion of the purchase price will be
allocated to non-utility assets and liabilities of RGS Energy based on their
estimated fair market value at the date of acquisition. The assets and
liabilities of the regulated utility will not be revalued. The difference
between the purchase price, representing fair value, and the recorded amounts
will be shown as goodwill on the balance sheet.

REGULATORY APPROVALS

    We must comply with state and federal regulatory approval requirements
before we can complete the merger and the other transactions described in the
merger agreement. Although there can be no guarantee that we will obtain the
requisite consents or approvals on a satisfactory or timely basis, or at all, we
currently believe that the necessary approvals can be obtained in sufficient
time to allow the merger to be completed in the first quarter of 2002. If any of
the regulatory approvals include conditions or restrictions that would have a
material adverse effect on Energy East or RGS Energy, Energy East would have the
right to terminate the merger.

    NEW YORK STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION.  Under New York law, the New York
State Public Service Commission has jurisdiction over the transfer of the stock
of RG&E. In deciding whether to approve the proposed transfer of stock, the
standard applied by the New York State Public Service Commission is whether the
transfer is in the public interest. Factors which may be considered in
determining whether a merger is in the public interest include, but are not
limited to, ratepayer benefits, service quality and reliability, market power
issues, environmental impacts, affiliate transactions and the financial
integrity of the resulting corporation. We have made the appropriate filings
seeking the consent of the New York State Public Service Commission to the
transfer of stock.

    THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935.  Energy East has registered
with the SEC as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act.
RGS Energy is a holding company that is exempt from most provisions of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act.

    The SEC must approve the merger under the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935, unless it finds that:

    - the merger would tend toward detrimental interlocking relations or
      detrimental concentration of control of public utilities;

    - the consideration to be paid in connection with the merger is not
      reasonable; or

    - the merger would unduly complicate the capital structure or be detrimental
      to the proper functioning of Energy East's holding company system after
      the merger.

    The SEC must also find that the merger complies with applicable state law,
tends toward the development of an integrated public utility system and
otherwise conforms to the Public Utility Holding Company Act's integration and
corporate simplification standards. Under the integration provisions of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act, to approve the merger, the SEC must also
find that the merger would serve the public interest, because it would tend
toward the development of an integrated public utility system (in this case
consisting of the electric properties of the Energy East and RGS Energy
systems). Section 10(c)(1) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act prevents
the SEC from approving an acquisition that "would be detrimental to the carrying
out of the provisions of Section 11." Section 11(b)(1) of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act generally confines the utility properties of a registered
holding company to a "single integrated public-utility system," either gas or
electric. An exception to the requirement of a "single system" is provided in
section 11(b)(1)(A) through (C), the so-called "ABC clauses." Under this
exception, a registered holding company may control one or more additional
integrated public utility systems if the SEC affirmatively finds that

(A) each of these additional systems cannot be operated as an independent system
without the loss of substantial economies; (B) all of these additional systems
are located in one state, adjoining states, or a contiguous foreign country; and
(C) the continued combination of these systems under the control of such holding
company is not so large as to impair the advantages of localized management,
efficient operation, or the effectiveness of regulation.

    Although there can be no assurance, we believe that the combination of our
electric utility systems will constitute an "integrated" electric utility
system. In addition, we believe that the SEC will make affirmative findings
under the ABC clauses that will permit Energy East to retain the gas utility
properties of Energy East and RGS Energy as an additional integrated gas utility
system.

    FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION.  Under Section 203 of the Federal
Power Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has jurisdiction when a
public utility sells or otherwise disposes of facilities that are subject to its
jurisdiction. A disposition is deemed made when there is a change of control of
the public utility that owns the facilities. RG&E's transmission facilities are
subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. For
this reason, prior approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is
required in order to complete the merger. In reviewing a merger, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission generally evaluates the effect of a proposed merger
on competition and on rates and whether the proposed merger will impair the
effectiveness of regulation.

    NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION.  RG&E holds a Nuclear Regulatory Commission
operating license for its Ginna Nuclear Plant, authorizing RG&E to own and
operate the Ginna facility. RG&E also is a co-licensee for its 14% interest in
Nine Mile Point Nuclear Plant Unit No. 2, but has no operating authority under
that license. The Atomic Energy Act provides that a license may not be
transferred or in any manner disposed of, directly or indirectly, through
transfer of control unless the Nuclear Regulatory Commission finds that the
transfer complies with the Atomic Energy Act and consents to the transfer.

    HART-SCOTT-RODINO ANTITRUST IMPROVEMENTS ACT.  The merger is subject to the
requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and the rules
and regulations thereunder, which provide that certain acquisition transactions
may not be completed until specified information has been furnished to the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission
and until certain waiting periods have been terminated or have expired. The
expiration or earlier termination of the Hart-Scott Act waiting period would not
preclude the Antitrust Division or the Federal Trade Commission from later
challenging the merger on antitrust grounds. We do not believe that the merger
will violate federal antitrust laws. If we do not complete the merger within
12 months after the expiration or earlier termination of the initial Hart-Scott
Act waiting period, we would be required to submit new information to the
Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission, and a new waiting period
would have to expire or be earlier terminated before the merger could be
completed.

    OBLIGATIONS TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS.  Under the merger agreement, we
have agreed to cooperate and use our best efforts to obtain all regulatory and
governmental approvals necessary or advisable to complete the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. All of these approvals
must not impose terms or conditions that, individually or in the aggregate,
would have or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
with respect to RGS Energy or Energy East.

    INJUNCTIONS.  Our obligation to complete the merger is subject to the
condition that there be no law, regulation or injunction in effect that would
prohibit the completion of the merger.

NO DISSENTERS' RIGHTS OF APPRAISAL

    Under the laws of the State of New York, where both of our companies are
incorporated, neither Energy East shareholders nor RGS Energy shareholders are
entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

LISTING OF THE ENERGY EAST SHARES ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE

    In the merger agreement, Energy East, Eagle Merger Corp. and RGS Energy have
agreed to use reasonable efforts to cause Energy East shares that are to be
issued in connection with the merger to be listed for trading on the New York
Stock Exchange. Approval for listing is a condition to the obligations of Energy
East, Eagle Merger Corp. and RGS Energy to complete the merger.

RESALE OF THE ENERGY EAST SHARES ISSUED IN THE MERGER; RGS ENERGY AFFILIATES

    Energy East shares to be issued to RGS Energy shareholders in connection
with the merger will be freely transferable under the Securities Act of 1933,
except for Energy East shares issued to any person deemed to be an affiliate of
RGS Energy for purposes of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act at the
time of the annual meeting. Persons deemed affiliates may not sell their Energy
East shares acquired in connection with the merger, except pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering such Energy
East shares, or in compliance with Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act
or another applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. Pursuant to the merger agreement, RGS Energy has delivered to
Energy East a letter identifying all persons who are, and to such person's best
knowledge who will be at the closing, affiliates of RGS Energy. The merger
agreement also requires RGS Energy to use all reasonable efforts to cause
shareholders who are, or are expected to be, affiliates to enter into an
agreement to comply with Rule 145 and certain other restrictions on the resale
of the affiliates' Energy East shares received in connection with the merger.

MERGER FINANCING

    In the merger, Energy East expects to pay RGS Energy shareholders
approximately $750 million in cash consideration. Energy East anticipates
funding the cash consideration with the proceeds from the issuance of long-term
debt and preferred stock.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

    Some of the members of RGS Energy's management and the RGS Energy board of
directors have interests in the merger that are in addition to their interests
as RGS Energy shareholders generally. As described below, Mr. Richards of RGS
Energy entered into an agreement with Energy East that will, effective upon
completion of the merger, provide for his employment with Energy East and for
certain severance benefits. In addition, prior to the effective time of the
merger, RGS Energy is permitted to establish, subject to certain guidelines, a
retention program described in more detail below, pursuant to which certain
employees, including executive officers, will receive cash bonuses equal to a
percentage of their annual base salary. Completion of the merger will constitute
a change in control of RGS Energy for purposes of determining the entitlement of
the executive officers of RGS Energy to certain severance and other benefits
described below. Furthermore, Mr. Richards and two non-management directors of
RGS Energy will join the Energy East board of directors and Energy East will
extend offers to all individuals who are members of the RGS Energy board (other
than Mr. Richards and the two non-management directors of RGS Energy who will
join the Energy East board of directors) to become members of an advisory board
of the surviving company following the merger. The members of the advisory board
will provide advice to the board of directors of the surviving company with
respect to various matters and will receive remuneration for their services
equivalent to remuneration currently provided to non-employee directors of RGS
Energy.

    The RGS Energy board of directors was aware of these interests and
considered them, among many other matters, in approving the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

    MR. RICHARDS' EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WITH ENERGY EAST.  Mr. Richards, chairman
of the board, president and chief executive officer of RGS Energy, has entered
into an agreement relating to his employment with Energy East following
completion of the merger. Mr. Richards' employment agreement will supersede his
existing severance agreement with RGS Energy upon completion of the merger.

    The term of Mr. Richards' agreement will begin upon completion of the
merger, with an initial term ending on the third anniversary of that date, and
automatic extensions of the term by an additional year on each anniversary of
the completion of the merger unless either party provides 90 days' prior written
notice to the other not to extend the term. Under the agreement, Mr. Richards
will serve as (i) chairman, president and chief executive officer of RGS Energy,
(ii) chairman and chief executive officer of RG&E and NYSEG and (iii) a member
of the board of directors and an executive vice president of Energy East. During
the employment term, Mr. Richards will be paid an annual base salary of not less
than $475,000, subject to certain increases, and his salary will be reviewed for
possible further increases at least annually during the employment term. During
the employment term, Mr. Richards will also be eligible to receive an annual
bonus under Energy East's Annual Executive Incentive Plan or any successor bonus
plan, with a threshold bonus opportunity of 70% of his annual base salary and a
maximum bonus opportunity of 140% of his annual base salary.

    Under his employment agreement, on the date the merger is completed, Energy
East will grant Mr. Richards an option to purchase 150,000 Energy East shares
with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date
of grant. The options will vest one-third on the first anniversary of the date
of grant, one-third on the second anniversary of the date of grant, and
one-third on the third anniversary of the date of grant, or if earlier, upon a
change of control of Energy East, as defined in Energy East's 2000 Stock Option
Plan.

    Mr. Richards' agreement also provides that he will be entitled to
participate in the incentive compensation and employee benefit plans that are
made available to executives and key management employees of Energy East, RGS
Energy, RG&E and NYSEG on terms and conditions no less favorable than those
applicable to executives and key management employees. In addition,
Mr. Richards' employee benefits will not be less favorable in the aggregate than
those provided to Mr. Richards by RGS Energy as of February 16, 2001.

    Mr. Richards' agreement further provides that if his employment is
terminated during the employment term by Mr. Richards for "good reason," or by
Energy East or RGS Energy for reasons other than "cause," death, or disability,
Mr. Richards will be entitled to:

    - a lump sum cash payment equal to three times the sum of Mr. Richards' base
      salary and incentive compensation equal to the higher of (1) the annual
      bonus (if any) earned by Mr. Richards under his agreement for the most
      recent fiscal year ended before the date of termination and (2) the
      average of the annual bonuses earned by Mr. Richards for the lesser of the
      number of years that he has been eligible to earn an annual bonus under
      his agreement and the three most recently completed fiscal years that
      ended before the date of termination (except that if the performance
      period for his first annual bonus has not been completed by the date of
      termination, his incentive compensation will equal the target annual
      bonus);

    - any unpaid portion of his base salary through the date of termination at
      the rate in effect immediately before the notice of termination is given;

    - a pro rata target annual bonus for the fiscal year of termination;

    - a lump sum cash payment representing the value of the additional pension
      benefits Mr. Richards would have received, had he remained employed for
      three additional years;

    - continuation of health, life insurance and accidental death and
      dismemberment benefits for three years following the date of termination,
      or, in the event that such participation is not permitted by the terms of
      the plans, substantially equivalent alternative coverage, or in the case
      of health plans only, a cash amount equal, on a net after-tax basis, to
      the premiums charged to persons electing to receive such coverage under
      COBRA;

    - all other compensation and benefits, other than severance compensation and
      benefits, to which Mr. Richards is entitled under the terms of any
      compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by Energy
      East, RGS Energy, RG&E or NYSEG as then in effect; and

    - any unreimbursed business expenses that would ordinarily be reimbursed by
      Energy East or RGS Energy.

    In addition, the options granted to Mr. Richards upon completion of the
merger, as described above, will vest and remain exercisable for one year
following the date of termination.

    If any payments or benefits that Mr. Richards receives are subjected to the
excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, his
agreement provides for an additional payment to him to restore him to the
after-tax position that he would have been in, if the excise tax had not been
imposed.

    The agreement also provides that, during his employment with Energy East and
its subsidiaries and affiliates, and for a period of one year after the
termination of his employment for any reason other than a termination of
employment by Energy East or RGS Energy without "cause" or a resignation by
Mr. Richards for "good reason," Mr. Richards may not compete with Energy East
and its affiliates or subsidiaries in Connecticut, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
and Vermont.

    Under the terms of the employment agreement, Energy East is responsible for
paying all reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by Mr. Richards in any
dispute concerning the interpretation or enforcement of the agreement.

    RETENTION PROGRAM.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, RGS Energy will
be permitted to establish a retention program for employees of RGS Energy and
its subsidiaries prior to completion of the merger, subject to review, comment
and final approval by Energy East. The retention program will provide 21
employees (including each of the executive officers) of RGS Energy with a cash
award equal to 100%, 50%, or 25% of each employee's annual base salary. The
retention award will be payable 50% upon completion of the merger and 50% on the
six-month anniversary thereof. In the event that the merger is abandoned without
being completed, the retention awards will become immediately payable in full.
In the event that the merger is not completed by November 16, 2002, the first
50% of each retention award will be payable on that date.

    Upon termination of a participating employee's employment by Energy East or
RGS Energy without "cause" or upon such employee's resignation for "good
reason," such employee will be entitled to immediate payment of the retention
award. Upon termination of a participating employee's employment by Energy East
or RGS Energy for "cause" or if such employee resigns without "good reason," any
unpaid portion of the retention award will be forfeited.

    If the merger were completed on April 1, 2002, and based on certain
assumptions and currently available information, the executive officers would
receive the following retention bonuses: $416,420 for Mr. Richards; $233,405 for
Mr. Tomaino; $220,646 for Mr. Bovalino; $216,320 for Mr. Wilkens and $913,209
for all remaining employees as a group. The total of all retention bonuses paid
to all employees will not exceed $2 million.

    SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS.  RGS Energy has severance agreements with 21 of its
employees (including each of the executive officers). These severance agreements
provide for certain severance benefits in the event of an involuntary
termination of employment within three years after a change in control of RGS
Energy. The completion of the merger will be a change in control for purposes of
those agreements. Under the severance agreements, an "involuntary termination"
means a resignation by the executive that results from a "change in duties" or a
termination of employment by the surviving company or its subsidiaries except a
termination for "cause," or by reason of death, disability, or normal retirement
under a retirement plan to which the executive was subject before completion of
the merger. The severance benefits under each of these severance agreements,
which are based on three years' pay and benefits for the RGS Energy executive
officers and one or two years' pay and benefits for the other RGS Energy
executives, consist of:

    - a lump sum payment equal to one, two or three times the greater of
      (1) the highest annual base salary paid or payable to the executive with
      respect to any twelve consecutive month period, as selected by the
      executive, during the three years ending with the termination date, and
      (2) his or her base salary as in effect on or before the date of
      termination, without regard to any reduction giving rise to an involuntary
      termination under the agreement;

    - a lump sum payment equal to one, two or three times the greater of
      (i) the executive's bonus earned for the final year of employment and
      (ii) the average of his or her bonuses for the three years before the
      termination date;

    - a pro rata share of his or her unpaid annual bonus for the year of
      termination, based on actual performance for such year and payable at the
      same time as bonuses are generally paid to other executives of RGS Energy;

    - continuation of health, dental, life, accident, and disability insurance
      coverage for one, two or three years after the date of termination;

    - one, two or three years' credit under retirement plans, assuming annual
      compensation increases for purposes of the retirement plans equal to the
      highest base salary increase received by the executive in the three years
      before the date of termination and annual bonus payouts at target; and

    - reimbursement of relocation costs or the cost of outplacement services
      incurred during the two-year period following termination that are not
      reimbursed by another employer.

    In addition, upon an involuntary termination occurring within three years
after completion of the merger, all outstanding options and other equity awards
held by executives who are party to a severance agreement will vest.

    RGS Energy also must pay any legal fees and costs that an executive incurs
in any litigation brought to enforce or interpret any provision of the severance
agreements.

    If the merger were completed on April 1, 2002 and the employment of each
executive officer who is a party to a severance agreement were involuntarily
terminated immediately thereafter, the estimated cash severance that would be
payable under the severance agreements, based on certain assumptions and
currently available information, would be: $896,085 for Mr. Tomaino; $854,818
for Mr. Bovalino; $838,059 for Mr. Wilkens; and $4,169,124 for all remaining
officers as a group. Mr. Richards will not be eligible to receive any severance
benefits under his agreement because it will be superseded by his new employment
agreement with Energy East, described above.

    In addition, if any payments or benefits received by an executive who is a
party to a severance agreement are subjected to the excise tax imposed under
Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the agreements provide for a payment
to the executive to restore such executive to the after-tax position that he or
she would have been in, if the excise tax had not been imposed.

    EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE PLAN.  RGS Energy maintains an Executive Incentive Plan
pursuant to which participating employees are eligible for annual cash awards
based on the achievement of certain performance targets. The merger agreement
provides that upon completion of the merger, the Executive Incentive Plan will
terminate and each participating employee, including the executive officers,
will be paid a pro rata portion of his or her target bonus. If the merger were
completed on April 1, 2002 and based on certain assumptions and currently
available information, the executive officers would receive the following
payments under this provision of the Executive Incentive Plan: $31,232 for
Mr. Richards; $14,588 for Mr. Tomaino; $13,790 for Mr. Bovalino; $13,520 for
Mr. Wilkens; and $84,315 for all remaining officers as a group.

    DEFERRED STOCK UNIT PLAN FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS AND DEFERRED
COMPENSATION PLAN. Any benefits or rights accrued and unpaid to a director,
whether or not retired from the board, and which each director would have
otherwise received for those years of service preceding the completion of the
merger, will be paid at the time and in the manner set out in the relevant
plans. The aggregate amount payable to the directors under these plans is
expected to be approximately $4.5 million.

    SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT PROGRAM AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE
RETIREMENT PROGRAM AND RELATED TRUSTS. RGS Energy maintains both a Supplemental
Retirement Benefit Program and a Supplemental Executive Retirement Program. The
Supplemental Retirement Benefit Program provides monthly defined benefit
payments to participants whose benefits cannot be fully provided by RGS Energy's
defined benefit pension plan because of the limitations imposed under the
Internal Revenue Code. The Supplemental Executive Retirement Program provides
participants with a targeted level of retirement benefits based on years of
service. Upon completion of the merger, the grantor trust maintained in
connection with the Supplemental Retirement Benefit Program and the Supplemental
Executive Retirement Program must be fully and immediately funded. It is
therefore expected that in anticipation of the completion of the merger, an
aggregate of $12 million will be contributed to this trust to fund benefits of
executive officers.

    STOCK-BASED RIGHTS.  All unvested options to purchase shares of RGS Energy
stock then held by executive officers and employees (including certain former
employees) will vest upon completion of the merger. In addition, the merger
agreement provides that all transfer restrictions applicable to any share of RGS
Energy common stock owned by an executive officer or employee of RGS Energy will
lapse upon completion of the merger. The merger agreement also provides that,
upon completion of the merger, each outstanding and unexercised stock option to
acquire shares of RGS Energy common stock granted under the RGS Energy stock
plans will cease to represent the right to acquire shares of RGS Energy common
stock and will be converted into, and become a right, to receive a cash payment
equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of $39.50 over the exercise
price of such option and (ii) the number of shares of RGS Energy subject to such
option. In addition, the merger agreement provides that each holder of a stock
option will be paid upon completion of the merger an amount in cash equal to the
aggregate dividend equivalents credited to the account of such holder. See "The
Merger Agreement--Additional Agreements--RGS Energy's Stock and Other Plans."

    If the merger were completed on April 1, 2002, and the RGS Energy executive
officers and employees (including certain former employees) did not exercise any
of their RGS Energy stock options before completion of the merger, they would
receive the following amounts with respect to their options that will be
exercisable before completion of the merger and with respect to options that
will become exercisable upon completion of the merger: Mr. Richards, $1,291,198
and $1,122,503; Mr. Tomaino, $489,607 and $560,425; Mr. Bovalino, $762,093 and
$405,126; Mr. Wilkens, $430,618 and $468,569; and all remaining officers and
employees (including certain former employees), as a group, $6,142,479 and
$4,338,143. In addition, they would receive a cash payment equal to the
following for all dividend equivalents held with respect to their vested and
unvested options: Mr. Richards, $670,603 and $377,379; Mr. Tomaino, $276,031 and
$161,578; Mr. Bovalino, $368,737 and $87,265; Mr. Wilkens, $226,311 and
$162,023; and all remaining officers and employees (including certain former
employees),

as a group, $3,126,476 and $911,112. In the aggregate, shares held by executive
officers and employees (including certain former employees) that were subject to
restriction before the merger will no longer be subject to restriction as a
result of completion of the merger.

    INDEMNIFICATION.  Pursuant to the merger agreement, from and after the
effective time of the merger, Energy East and the surviving company will, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each individual who is at the effective time of the merger, or was prior to the
effective time of the merger, an officer, director or employee of RGS Energy or
any of its subsidiaries against all losses, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses), claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to
certain restrictions, amounts paid in settlement, arising out of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger that are at
least in part (1) based on the fact that that individual was a director, officer
or employee of such entity or (2) based on the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement.

    In addition, for six years after the effective time, Energy East will either
(1) maintain policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance for the
benefit of those persons who currently are covered by RGS Energy's existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies or (2) provide tail
coverage for those persons, which provides for coverage for a period of six
years for acts prior to the effective time of the merger. In either case, the
terms of the coverage will be at least as favorable as the terms of the current
insurance coverage. Energy East will not, however, be required to expend in any
year more than 200% of the annual aggregate premiums that RGS Energy currently
pays.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

    The following discussion is a summary description of the material U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the merger applicable to RGS Energy
shareholders. This discussion is for general information only and does not
purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be
relevant to an RGS Energy shareholder. For example, this discussion does not
address the effect, if any, of the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act
on non-U.S. persons who hold RGS Energy shares. This discussion is based upon
the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, existing regulations, and
administrative and judicial interpretations of the Internal Revenue Code, all as
in effect as of the date hereof and all of which are subject to change (possibly
with retroactive effect). This discussion applies only to RGS Energy
shareholders who hold their RGS Energy shares as capital assets within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code and does not apply to the
following:

    - shareholders who received their RGS Energy shares pursuant to the exercise
      of employee stock options or similar securities or otherwise as
      compensation;

    - shareholders who hold their RGS Energy shares as part of a "straddle,"
      "hedge," "conversion transaction," "synthetic security" or other
      integrated investment;

    - shareholders (including, without limitation, financial institutions,
      insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, dealers or traders in
      securities and shareholders subject to the alternative minimum tax) who
      may be subject to special rules;

    - shareholders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; or

    - shareholders who, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, are non-resident
      alien individuals, foreign corporations, foreign partnerships, or foreign
      estates or trusts.

    This discussion also does not consider the effect of any foreign, state or
local laws or any U.S. federal laws other than U.S. federal laws pertaining to
the income tax.

    THE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDER MAY AFFECT THE
TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO SUCH RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDER. THE PARTICULAR
FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES OF AN RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDER THAT MAY SO AFFECT THE
CONSEQUENCES ARE NOT DISCUSSED HERE. ACCORDINGLY, YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX
ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE TAX EFFECT TO YOU OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE
APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF FOREIGN, OR U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL OR OTHER TAX
LAWS. NON-U.S. SHAREHOLDERS, IF ANY, WHO HOLD OR HAVE HELD (DIRECTLY,
CONSTRUCTIVELY, OR BY ATTRIBUTION) MORE THAN 5% OF THE OUTSTANDING RGS ENERGY
SHARES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF
THE MERGER UNDER THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN REAL PROPERTY TAX ACT, INCLUDING ANY
TAX FILING REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY APPLY.

    Except as described below under "--Effect of Restructuring the Merger," the
completion of the merger is contingent upon the receipt by:

    - Energy East of an opinion from its attorneys to the effect that the merger
      will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
      of the Internal Revenue Code; and

    - RGS Energy of an opinion from its attorneys to the effect that the merger
      will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
      of the Internal Revenue Code.

    The opinions will be based upon certain customary assumptions and
representations, including representations contained in certificates of officers
of Energy East, RGS Energy and others. No ruling has been or will be sought from
the Internal Revenue Service as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the merger, and the opinions of counsel are not binding upon the Internal
Revenue Service or any court. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that the
Internal Revenue Service will not contest the conclusions expressed in the
opinions or that a court will not sustain such contest.

    Except for the discussion below under "--Effect of Restructuring the
Merger," the following discussion of U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
merger to RGS Energy shareholders assumes that the merger will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code. As discussed below, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger
to an RGS Energy shareholder depend on the form of consideration received by the
shareholder, and may further depend on whether (1) the shareholder is deemed to
constructively own RGS Energy shares under Section 318 of the Internal Revenue
Code (which generally deems a person to own stock that is owned by certain
family members or related entities or that is the subject of an option or
options owned or deemed owned by such person), and (2) the shareholder actually
or constructively owns any Energy East shares.

    SHAREHOLDERS WHO RECEIVE SOLELY ENERGY EAST SHARES. An RGS Energy
shareholder who exchanges RGS Energy shares solely for Energy East shares will
not recognize any gain or loss on that exchange, except to the extent the
shareholder receives cash in lieu of fractional shares of Energy East (as
discussed below). The aggregate adjusted tax basis of Energy East shares
received will equal the RGS Energy shareholder's aggregate adjusted tax basis in
the RGS Energy shares surrendered (reduced by the tax basis allocable to any
fractional shares of Energy East received in the merger). The holding period of
the Energy East shares received pursuant to the merger will include the holding
period of the RGS Energy shares surrendered.

    SHAREHOLDERS WHO RECEIVE CASH AND ENERGY EAST SHARES.  If the consideration
received in the merger by an RGS Energy shareholder consists of part cash and
part Energy East shares and the shareholder's adjusted basis in the RGS Energy
shares surrendered in the transaction is less than the sum of the fair market
value, as of the date of the merger, of the Energy East shares and the amount of
cash received by the shareholder, then the shareholder will recognize a gain.
This recognized gain will equal the lesser of (1) the sum of the amount of cash
and the fair market value, as of the date of the merger, of the Energy East
shares received, minus the adjusted basis of the RGS Energy shares surrendered
in exchange therefor, and (2) the amount of cash received by the shareholder in
the

exchange. However, if an RGS Energy shareholder's adjusted basis in the RGS
Energy shares surrendered in the transaction is greater than the sum of the
amount of cash and the fair market value of the Energy East shares received, the
RGS Energy shareholder's loss will not be currently allowed or recognized for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. The rules set forth above assume that the
basis in each share held by the RGS Energy shareholder is equal. RGS Energy
shareholders who bought shares of RGS Energy at different prices, or otherwise
own shares with unequal bases, must make the above calculations separately for
each RGS Energy share surrendered, taking into account the shareholder's basis
in each share and a pro rata portion of the aggregate consideration received by
the shareholder. A loss realized on one RGS Energy share may not be used to
offset a gain realized on another share.

    In the case of an RGS Energy shareholder who recognizes gain on the
exchange, if the exchange sufficiently reduces the shareholder's proportionate
stock interest (as discussed below), the gain will be characterized as a capital
gain. Such gain will be long-term capital gain if the shareholder's holding
period for the RGS Energy shares surrendered exceeds one year. If the exchange
does not sufficiently reduce the shareholder's proportionate stock interest,
such gain will be taxable as a dividend to the extent of the shareholder's
ratable share of available earnings and profits (and the remainder, if any, of
such recognized gain will be capital gain).

    The determination of whether the exchange sufficiently reduces an RGS Energy
shareholder's proportionate stock interest will be made in accordance with
Section 302 of the Internal Revenue Code, taking into account the stock
ownership attribution rules of Section 318 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under
those rules, for purposes of determining whether the exchange sufficiently
reduces a shareholder's proportionate stock interest, an RGS Energy shareholder
is treated as if (1) all such shareholder's RGS Energy shares were first
exchanged in the merger for Energy East shares and (2) a portion of those Energy
East shares were then redeemed for the cash actually received in the merger. The
RGS Energy shareholder's hypothetical stock interest in Energy East (both actual
and constructive) after hypothetical step (2) is compared to such RGS Energy
shareholder's hypothetical stock interest in Energy East (both actual and
constructive) after hypothetical step (1). Dividend treatment will apply unless
the shareholder's stock interest in Energy East has been completely terminated,
there has been a "substantially disproportionate" reduction in the shareholder's
stock interest in Energy East (I.E., such interest after hypothetical step
(2) is less than 80% of the interest after hypothetical step (1)), or the
exchange is not "essentially equivalent to a dividend." While the determination
is based on an RGS Energy shareholder's particular facts and circumstances, the
Internal Revenue Service has indicated in published rulings that a distribution
is not "essentially equivalent to a dividend" and will therefore result in
capital gain treatment if the distribution results in any actual reduction in
the stock interest of an extremely small minority shareholder in a publicly held
corporation and the shareholder exercises no control with respect to corporate
affairs.

    BECAUSE THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER A PAYMENT WILL BE TREATED AS HAVING THE
EFFECT OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF A DIVIDEND GENERALLY WILL DEPEND UPON THE FACTS
AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDER, RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDERS ARE
STRONGLY ADVISED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE TAX TREATMENT
OF CASH RECEIVED IN THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF THE CONSTRUCTIVE
OWNERSHIP RULES OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE AND THE EFFECT OF ANY TRANSACTIONS
IN ENERGY EAST SHARES OR RGS ENERGY SHARES BY THE RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDER.

    The basis of an RGS Energy shareholder who receives cash and Energy East
shares in the merger in the Energy East shares received will equal such
shareholder's adjusted basis in the shareholder's RGS Energy shares increased by
any gain recognized as a result of the merger and reduced by the amount of cash
received in the merger. The holding period of the Energy East shares received
will include the holding period of the RGS Energy shares surrendered.

    SHAREHOLDERS WHO RECEIVE SOLELY CASH.  The exchange of RGS Energy shares
solely for cash generally will result in recognition of gain or loss by the
shareholder in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash
received and the shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the RGS Energy shares
surrendered. The gain or loss recognized will be long-term capital gain or loss
if the shareholder's holding period for the RGS Energy shares surrendered
exceeds one year. An RGS Energy shareholder who receives only cash in exchange
for all such shareholder's RGS Energy shares and actually or constructively owns
Energy East shares after the merger should, however, consult the shareholder's
tax advisor to determine the amount and character of any income recognized in
connection with the merger. Furthermore, there are limitations on the extent to
which any shareholder may deduct capital losses from ordinary income.

    CASH RECEIVED IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL SHARES. An RGS Energy shareholder who
receives cash in lieu of a fractional Energy East share will be treated as
having first received such fractional Energy East share in the merger and then
as having received cash in exchange for the fractional share interest. Thus,
such an RGS Energy shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss in an
amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash received in lieu of
the fractional Energy East share and the portion of the basis in the RGS Energy
shares allocable to that fractional interest.

    SPECIAL RULES FOR SHAREHOLDERS THAT ARE CORPORATIONS.  To the extent that
cash received in exchange for RGS Energy shares is taxable as a dividend (as
described above) to an RGS Energy shareholder that is a corporation, that
shareholder will be (1) eligible for a dividends received deduction (subject to
applicable limitations) and (2) subject to the "extraordinary dividend"
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Under those provisions, any such cash
that is taxable as a dividend to a corporate shareholder will constitute an
extraordinary dividend. Consequently, the nontaxed portion of any such dividend
will reduce the adjusted tax basis of an RGS Energy shareholder that is a
corporation in the Energy East shares received in the merger, but not below
zero, and will thereafter be taxable as capital gain.

    EFFECT OF RESTRUCTURING THE MERGER.  Energy East may, for tax reasons, have
to increase the number of RGS Energy shares converted into Energy East shares
and decrease the number of RGS Energy shares converted into cash. In that event,
RGS Energy may elect instead to change the form of the merger. If RGS Energy
elects to change the form of the merger, Eagle Merger Corp. will merge into RGS
Energy in a transaction that is fully taxable to RGS Energy shareholders and the
requirement that Energy East and RGS Energy receive the opinions referred to
above regarding reorganization status will not apply. For each RGS Energy share
surrendered, an RGS Energy shareholder will recognize gain equal to the excess,
if any, of (1) the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value (as of
the date of the merger) of the Energy East shares received for the RGS Energy
share surrendered over (2) the shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the RGS
Energy share surrendered. If the RGS Energy shareholder's basis in the RGS
Energy share surrendered exceeds the sum of the amount of cash and the fair
market value (as of the date of the merger) of the Energy East shares received
for the RGS Energy share surrendered, then the RGS Energy shareholder should
recognize a loss equal to such excess. RGS Energy shareholders that will realize
a loss in the merger should consult their own tax advisor regarding allowance of
the loss in their particular circumstances. The gain or loss recognized will be
long-term capital gain or loss if the shareholder's holding period of the RGS
Energy shares surrendered exceeds one year. The tax basis of the Energy East
shares received in the merger will generally be the fair market value of such
shares as of the date of the merger, and the holding period of such shares will
not include the holding period of the RGS Energy shares surrendered.

    MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO ENERGY EAST, RGS ENERGY AND
EAGLE MERGER CORP. Assuming that the merger is treated as a reorganization, none
of Energy East, RGS Energy or Eagle Merger Corp. will recognize gain or loss as
a result of the merger. The same result would apply if the merger were
restructured as described above under "--Effect of Restructuring the Merger."

    BACKUP WITHHOLDING.  Payments in connection with the merger may be subject
to "backup withholding" at a rate of 31%, unless an RGS Energy shareholder
(1) provides a correct taxpayer identification number (which, for an individual
shareholder, is the shareholder's social security number) and any other required
information to the paying agent, or (2) is a corporation or comes within certain
exempt categories and, when required, demonstrates that fact and otherwise
complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. An RGS
Energy shareholder who does not provide a correct taxpayer identification number
may be subject to penalties imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. Any amount
paid as backup withholding does not constitute an additional tax and will be
creditable against the shareholder's U.S. federal income tax liability. Each RGS
Energy shareholder should consult with his or her own tax advisor as to his or
her qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for
obtaining such exemption. RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDERS MAY PREVENT BACKUP WITHHOLDING
BY COMPLETING A SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9 (WHICH WILL BE INCLUDED WITH THEIR LETTER OF
TRANSMITTAL) AND SUBMITTING IT TO THE PAYING AGENT FOR THE MERGER WHEN THEY
SUBMIT THEIR RGS ENERGY SHARE CERTIFICATES.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION OF THE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS
ONLY A SUMMARY AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE ACTUAL
MERGER AGREEMENT, A COPY OF WHICH IS ATTACHED AS APPENDIX A TO THIS DOCUMENT. WE
URGE YOU TO READ CAREFULLY THE MERGER AGREEMENT BECAUSE IT, AND NOT THIS
DOCUMENT, IS THE LEGAL DOCUMENT THAT GOVERNS THE MERGER.

GENERAL

    The merger agreement provides that RGS Energy will merge with and into Eagle
Merger Corp., which will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy East at the
effective time of the merger. Eagle Merger Corp. will survive the merger as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Energy East and will be renamed "RGS Energy
Group, Inc."

    The closing of the merger will occur on the second business day immediately
following the date upon which all conditions to the merger have been satisfied
or waived, or at such other time as the parties agree. At the closing of the
merger, the parties will file a certificate of merger with the Department of
State of the State of New York. The merger will become effective upon the filing
of this certificate or at such later time as may be set forth in the
certificate. We currently expect that the closing of the merger will take place
in the first quarter of 2002.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS

    DIRECTORS.  After the merger becomes effective, the board of directors of
the surviving company will consist of two directors appointed by Energy East and
one director appointed by RGS Energy. Energy East intends to nominate Mr. von
Schack and Mr. Jasinski, while RGS Energy intends to nominate Mr. Richards.
These directors will hold office until their successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified. In addition, pursuant to the merger agreement, Energy
East will add three members to its board of directors. These additional seats
will be filled by Mr. Richards and two current non-management directors of RGS
Energy.

    OFFICERS.  After the merger becomes effective, RGS Energy will nominate one
person who will serve as president and chief executive officer of the surviving
company. RGS Energy intends to nominate Mr. Richards to hold these offices.
Energy East will nominate the other officer of the surviving company, who will
serve as vice president, general counsel and secretary. Energy East intends to
nominate Mr. Jasinski to hold these offices. All officers will hold their
positions until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.
Mr. Richards will also serve as chairman of the surviving company, and will hold
other positions as specified in an employment agreement that he, RGS Energy and
Energy East have executed.

CONVERSION OF RGS ENERGY SHARES

    MERGER CONSIDERATION.  At the effective time of the merger, all outstanding
RGS Energy shares (other than those that are held by RGS Energy as treasury
stock) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.
Each RGS Energy shareholder has a right to make an election as to the form in
which he or she would like to receive the merger consideration, which may be
subject to proration or adjustment based on tax considerations as explained
below. RGS Energy shareholders can elect to receive cash, Energy East shares or
a combination of cash and Energy East shares. The cash consideration is $39.50,
without interest, per RGS Energy share. The stock consideration is a number of
Energy East shares per RGS Energy share that will vary depending on the Average
Market Price. If the Average Market Price is equal to or more than $16.57 per
share and equal to or less than $22.41 per share, then each RGS Energy share
will be exchanged for $39.50 worth of Energy East shares. If the Average Market
Price is less than $16.57, then each RGS Energy share will be exchanged for
2.3838 Energy East shares, irrespective of the value of those shares. Finally,
if the Average Market

Price is greater than $22.41 per share, then each RGS Energy share will be
exchanged for 1.7626 Energy East shares, again irrespective of the value of
those shares. If an RGS Energy shareholder wants a combination of cash and
Energy East shares, he or she must designate how many of his or her RGS Energy
shares he or she would like to convert into the $39.50 in cash and how many he
or she would like to convert into Energy East shares.

    As of the effective time of the merger, no RGS Energy shares will be
outstanding; they will all be automatically canceled and retired. Each RGS
Energy shareholder will cease to have any shareholder rights, except the right
to receive the merger consideration of cash, Energy East shares or a combination
of cash and Energy East shares.

    OVERSUBSCRIPTION OF CASH OR STOCK.  Subject to an adjustment for tax reasons
(as described below), 55% of all outstanding RGS Energy shares will be converted
into cash and 45% will be converted into Energy East shares.

    RGS Energy shareholders, as a group, may submit elections to convert more
than 55% of the outstanding RGS Energy shares into cash or more than 45% into
Energy East shares. If either cash or Energy East shares is oversubscribed, then
an equitable PRO RATA adjustment will be made to ensure that 55% of the
outstanding RGS Energy shares are converted into cash and 45% are converted into
Energy East shares. For example, if cash is oversubscribed, each RGS Energy
share as to which an election was submitted to be converted into $39.50 in cash
will, instead, be converted into an amount of cash that is less than $39.50 and
a number of Energy East shares calculated in accordance with the formula set
forth in section 2.1(e) of the merger agreement. Similarly, if Energy East
shares are oversubscribed, each RGS Energy share as to which an election was
submitted to be converted into Energy East shares will, instead, be converted
into a lower number of Energy East shares and an amount of cash calculated in
accordance with the formula set forth in section 2.1(g) of the merger agreement.

    NO FRACTIONAL SHARES.  No fractional Energy East shares will be issued in
the merger. RGS Energy shareholders will receive a cash payment in lieu of
fractional Energy East shares. This cash will come from an exchange agent's
open-market sales of the aggregate fractional Energy East shares.

    ADJUSTMENT TO PER SHARE ENERGY EAST SHARE AMOUNT.  If, prior to the
effective time of the merger, Energy East pays an extraordinary dividend, enters
into a merger or consolidation, or changes the number of outstanding Energy East
shares through a stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction, then the
calculation of the number of Energy East shares to be received in the merger
will be adjusted to reflect this transaction.

    TAX ADJUSTMENT.  We intend that the merger qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code and, therefore, be tax free for
those RGS Energy shareholders who receive only Energy East shares in the
transaction. Under the Internal Revenue Code, however, the merger might not be a
reorganization if, on the closing date of the merger, the total value of the
Energy East shares that RGS Energy shareholders receive does not represent a
minimum percentage of the value of the total consideration--including Energy
East shares, cash and any other amounts treated as consideration in connection
with the merger for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code--that RGS Energy
shareholders receive in connection with the merger. To prevent this from
happening, if the value of the Energy East shares received would otherwise be
less than 42.5% of the value of the total consideration, the number of RGS
Energy shares that will be converted into Energy East shares will be increased,
and the number of RGS Energy shares converted into cash will be correspondingly
decreased. For the shares subject to this adjustment, RGS Energy shareholders
will receive Energy East shares worth less than the cash they would have
received. In lieu of this adjustment, RGS Energy may elect to have the merger
agreement amended so that Eagle Merger Corp. would merge with and into RGS
Energy, with RGS Energy as the surviving company. If RGS Energy so elects, the
parties would

no longer intend for the merger to qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and the condition on
each party's obligations to complete the merger that relate to its receiving a
legal opinion to that effect would be waived.

    EXCHANGE AGENT.  Promptly after the effective time of the merger, Energy
East will deposit with an exchange agent cash and certificates evidencing the
Energy East shares sufficient to effect the conversion of RGS Energy shares into
cash and Energy East shares pursuant to the merger agreement.

    ELECTION PROCEDURES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.  Copies of the form of
election will be mailed to record holders of RGS Energy shares not less than
30 days prior to the effective time of the merger and made available to persons
who become record holders after this mailing but not later than seven business
days prior to the effective time of the merger. To be effective, a form of
election must be:

    - properly completed, signed and submitted to the exchange agent;

    - accompanied by the RGS Energy share certificates as to which the election
      is being made (or an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such
      certificates as provided in the merger agreement); and

    - received by the exchange agent before the election deadline, which is
      5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third day after the effective time
      of the merger.

    Energy East has the discretion to determine whether an RGS Energy
shareholder has properly completed, signed, and submitted (or revoked) a form of
election and to disregard immaterial defects in the form of election. Energy
East may delegate this right to the exchange agent. Neither Energy East nor the
exchange agent is under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in a
form of election submitted to the exchange agent. The exchange agent will also
make all computations in respect of the conversion of RGS Energy shares into
cash and Energy East shares, and all such computations will be conclusive and
binding on RGS Energy shareholders. Any RGS shareholder may revoke his or her
form of election in writing prior to the deadline for submitting elections.

    An RGS Energy shareholder who submits an untimely or improperly completed
form of election will be deemed not to have made an election. That shareholder's
RGS Energy shares may be treated as shares that the shareholder elected to
exchange for cash or Energy East shares.

    EXCHANGE AND PAYMENT PROCEDURES.  Promptly after the effective time of the
merger, the exchange agent will mail to each record holder of a certificate
representing RGS Energy shares that have been converted into the right to
receive the merger consideration:

    - a letter of transmittal for use in submitting share certificates to the
      exchange agent; and

    - instructions explaining what RGS Energy shareholders must do to effect the
      surrender of the RGS Energy share certificates and receive the merger
      consideration.

    After an RGS Energy shareholder submits his or her RGS Energy share
certificates, a letter of transmittal and other documents that may be required,
the RGS Energy shareholder will be entitled to receive cash, a certificate
representing Energy East shares, or a combination of cash and Energy East
shares. The merger consideration may be delivered to someone who is not listed
in RGS Energy's transfer records if he or she presents an RGS Energy share
certificate to the exchange agent along with all documents required to evidence
that a transfer of the RGS Energy share certificate has been made to him or her
and that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrender,
each RGS Energy share certificate will be deemed at any time after the effective
time of the merger to represent only the right to receive the merger
consideration upon surrender.

    PAYMENTS FOLLOWING SURRENDER.  Until they have surrendered their RGS Energy
share certificates, holders of RGS Energy share certificates who elect to
receive Energy East shares will not receive:

    - dividends and other distributions with respect to Energy East shares that
      they are entitled to pursuant to the merger and that are declared or made
      with a record date after the effective time; or

    - cash instead of fractional Energy East shares payable pursuant to the
      merger agreement.

    At the time of surrender, RGS Energy shareholders will receive the cash
payable in place of fractional Energy East shares to which the RGS Energy
shareholders are entitled under the merger agreement and the dividends or other
distributions that have been paid to Energy East shareholders if such
distributions had a record date after the effective time. These RGS Energy
shareholders will also be paid on the appropriate payment date the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time
(but prior to surrender) and a payment date subsequent to surrender.

    SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD NOT FORWARD CERTIFICATES TO THE EXCHANGE AGENT, ENERGY
EAST OR RGS ENERGY UNTIL THEY HAVE RECEIVED A FORM OF ELECTION. SHAREHOLDERS
SHOULD NOT RETURN CERTIFICATES WITH THE ENCLOSED PROXY. A FORM OF ELECTION AND
COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPERLY MAKING AN ELECTION TO RECEIVE CASH, ENERGY
EAST SHARES OR A COMBINATION OF CASH AND ENERGY EAST SHARES WILL BE MAILED TO
RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDERS UNDER SEPARATE COVER BEFORE THE ANTICIPATED DAY OF THE
CLOSING OF THE MERGER, WHICH IS CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO BE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF
2002.

COVENANTS

    MUTUAL COVENANTS.  Under the merger agreement, we agreed that, during the
period from the date of the merger agreement until the effective time of the
merger, except as otherwise permitted in the merger agreement or by written
consent of the parties, we will each comply with the following covenants:

    - we will coordinate our dividend policies prior to the closing date of the
      merger, so that differences in the timing of record, declaration or
      payment dates will not adversely affect either RGS Energy shareholders or
      Energy East shareholders. Also, neither of us will declare or pay any
      dividends except (1) dividends by a wholly owned subsidiary to its parent
      or to another wholly owned subsidiary of its parent, (2) dividends payable
      by a less than wholly owned subsidiary consistent with past practice,
      (3) regular dividends that do not materially exceed regular dividends in
      effect as of the date of the merger agreement and have usual record and
      payment dates or (4) in the case of Energy East, increases in regular
      quarterly dividends consistent with past practice;

    - we and our subsidiaries will not amend our certificates of incorporation,
      bylaws or other organizational documents, or take or fail to take any
      other action, in such a way that would reasonably be expected to prevent,
      impede or interfere with the merger;

    - we each will confer on a regular and frequent basis with representatives
      of the other party to discuss, subject to applicable law, material
      operational matters and the general status of their ongoing operations;
      promptly notify the other party of any significant changes in their
      business, properties, assets, condition, results of operations or
      prospects; advise the other party of any change or event that have had, or
      would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on us; and
      promptly provide the other party with copies of all filings with
      governmental authorities in connection with the merger agreement;

    - each of us and our subsidiaries will use all commercially reasonable
      efforts to obtain all necessary consents to complete the merger, promptly
      notify the other party of any failure or

      prospective failure to obtain these consents, and, if requested by the
      other party, will provide copies of all the consents that have been
      obtained;

    - we and our subsidiaries will not willfully take any action that is
      reasonably likely to result in a material breach of the merger agreement
      or in any of their representations and warranties being untrue on and as
      of the closing date of the merger;

    - we and our subsidiaries will maintain insurance policies that are
      customary for companies engaged in the electric and gas utility industry
      with financially responsible insurance companies; and

    - each of us will take all necessary steps within our control to exempt the
      merger from, or, if necessary, challenge the validity or applicability of,
      any applicable takeover law.

    COVENANTS OF ENERGY EAST.  Energy East agreed that it would not enter into,
or agree to enter into

    - any transaction that would cause Energy East to become not primarily
      engaged in the gas and electric utilities businesses, or

    - any acquisition or disposition of assets or securities that would delay,
      or would be reasonably expected to delay, the completion of the merger.

    COVENANTS OF RGS ENERGY.  RGS Energy agreed that, until the effective time
of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement, RGS Energy and its
subsidiaries will:

    - carry on their businesses in the ordinary course;

    - preserve intact their business organizations, goodwill and relationships
      with customers, suppliers and others having business dealings with them,
      keep available the services of their present officers and employees as a
      group (subject to prudent management of workforce needs and ongoing
      programs currently in force), maintain properties and assets in good
      repair, and maintain supplies and inventories in quantities consistent
      with past practice;

    - abide by certain customary restrictions on the conduct of their businesses
      regarding: (1) dividends, (2) stock splits and issuances of RGS Energy
      shares, (3) redemptions of RGS Energy shares, (4) substantial equity and
      asset acquisitions, (5) capital expenditures, (6) substantial asset
      dispositions, (7) indebtedness, (8) employee benefit plans and other
      employment arrangements, (9) tax and accounting matters, (10) discharge of
      liabilities and (11) amendment, termination and renewal of material
      contracts;

    - not engage in any activities that would cause a change in their status
      under the Public Utility Holding Company Act;

    - use reasonable efforts to maintain in effect all existing governmental
      permits pursuant to which they operate; and

    - not amend or waive any rights that would materially and adversely affect
      the benefits of the merger to either of us or our ability to complete the
      merger.

    NO SOLICITATION OF ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS.  RGS Energy also agreed to certain
restrictions concerning "ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS," which are defined in the merger
agreement as mergers, consolidations or similar transactions between a third
party and RGS Energy or any of its subsidiaries, or any third-party proposals or
offers to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, a substantial equity
interest in or a

substantial portion of the assets of RGS Energy or any of its subsidiaries.
Specifically, RGS Energy agreed that:

    - neither it nor its subsidiaries will encourage, initiate, solicit or take
      any other action to facilitate knowingly any inquiries, proposals or
      offers that constitute or may reasonably be expected to lead to an
      Alternative Proposal from any person;

    - neither it nor its subsidiaries will engage in any discussion or
      negotiations concerning, or provide any nonpublic information or data to
      make or implement, an Alternative Proposal;

    - it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
      solicitation, initiation, encouragement, activity, discussions or
      negotiations with any parties conducted with a view of formulating an
      Alternative Proposal; and

    - it will notify Energy East of any of these inquiries, offers or proposals
      within 48 hours of receipt and keep Energy East informed of their status,
      and it will give Energy East 48 hours' advance notice of its intent to
      enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement or to provide
      information to any person making the inquiry, offer or proposal.

    Nonetheless, RGS Energy may:

    - at any time before approval of the merger agreement by RGS Energy
      shareholders, RGS Energy may engage in discussions or negotiations with a
      third party that seeks to initiate these discussions or negotiations, and
      may furnish such third party information concerning RGS Energy and its
      business, properties and assets, but only if:

       - the RGS Energy board of directors determines in good faith that the
         third party has made an Alternative Proposal that is financially
         superior to the merger and has demonstrated that any necessary
         financing has been obtained or, in the reasonable judgment of RGS
         Energy's financial advisor, is obtainable, and the RGS Energy board of
         directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
         financial advisor and outside counsel and consideration of other
         relevant matters, that failure to take the above-mentioned actions
         would likely result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
         applicable law; and

       - before RGS Energy provides information to, or enters into discussions
         or negotiations with, the third party, RGS Energy receives from the
         third party an executed confidentiality agreement;

    - comply with Rule 14e-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
      regulating tender or exchange offers; and/or

    - accept an Alternative Proposal from a third party, so long as it first
      terminates the merger agreement with Energy East.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

    In addition to the covenants above, we have also agreed on the following
matters.

    ACCESS TO INFORMATION.  Upon reasonable notice and during normal business
hours until the effective time of the merger, each of us will provide the other
with reasonable access to all of our properties, books, contracts, commitments
and records. In addition, each of us will provide to the other party (1) access
to all reports, schedules and other documents that we or our subsidiaries filed
or received under federal or state securities laws or filed with or sent to the
SEC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, the Federal
Trade Commission, or any other U.S. federal or state regulatory agency or
commission, and (2) access to all information concerning ourselves, our
subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders, and other matters that the
other party may reasonably request in connection with any

filings, applications, or approvals required under the merger agreement. Each of
us will hold in strict confidence all information furnished to us in connection
with the merger. Also, each of us will permit the other party to conduct any
environmental inspections of our properties that the other party may reasonably
require, and will furnish the other party with records, reports and data
concerning the existence of hazardous materials at properties presently or
formerly owned, operated, leased or used by one of us or our subsidiaries and
the compliance with environmental laws.

    JOINT PROXY STATEMENT AND REGISTRATION STATEMENT.  We agreed to prepare and
file this document as soon as reasonably practicable after February 16, 2001 and
to each use reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement with respect
to the Energy East shares to be issued in connection with the merger to be
declared effective as promptly as practicable after the filing of this document.
We agreed to take any actions reasonably required to have these Energy East
shares registered under or exempted from state securities laws, except that
neither of us is required to register or qualify as a foreign corporation or
otherwise subject ourselves to service of process to which we would not
otherwise be subject following the completion of the merger. We will use
reasonable efforts to cause the Energy East shares to be issued in connection
with the merger to be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange.

    FURTHER ASSURANCES; REGULATORY MATTERS.  Each of us and our subsidiaries
will cooperate with one another and use our best efforts

    - to prepare and file promptly all necessary documentation required or
      advisable with respect to the merger or the other transactions
      contemplated by the merger agreement with the appropriate governmental
      authorities,

    - to comply with any request for information or documents from a
      governmental authority relating to, and appropriate in the light of,
      matters within the jurisdiction of the governmental authority, so long as
      each of us uses our best efforts to keep the information provided by us
      confidential, to the extent it is required by the party providing the
      information, and takes appropriate legal action within our discretion to
      avoid providing trade secrets, privileged information or other information
      which reasonably should be treated as confidential,

    - to take all actions necessary or advisable to obtain required governmental
      consents by November 16, 2002, and

    - to oppose vigorously any litigation that would impede or delay the
      completion of the merger, which includes promptly appealing any adverse
      court order.

    Each of us and our subsidiaries will execute all additional documents and
instruments and take all other actions that the other party may reasonably
request in order to complete the merger. Each of us also agreed that, although
it is our intent for the merger to be structured as set out in the merger
agreement, if one or more required regulatory approvals is the only condition to
the completion of the merger that has not been satisfied, and a different
structure for the merger could result in this condition being satisfied or
waived, each of us will use our best efforts to enter into a differently
structured merger. Before an alternative structure is used, however, all
conditions to the completion of the newly restructured merger must be satisfied
or waived.

    Our cooperation in obtaining regulatory approvals includes obtaining the
approval of the New York State Public Service Commission. Mr. Richards will have
primary responsibility for coordinating strategy and communication with the New
York State Public Service Commission.

    SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.  RGS Energy will take all steps necessary to convene
and hold a meeting of RGS Energy shareholders to obtain the necessary majority
vote to approve the merger. Subject to their fiduciary duties, the RGS Energy
board of directors will recommend to the RGS Energy shareholders the approval of
the merger agreement. Energy East will take all steps necessary to convene and
hold a

meeting of Energy East shareholders to obtain the necessary majority vote to
approve the issuance of Energy East shares in connection with the merger.
Subject to their fiduciary duties, the Energy East board of directors will
recommend to the Energy East shareholders the approval of the issuance of Energy
East shares in connection with the merger.

    INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.  To the extent these individuals
are not otherwise indemnified, Energy East and the surviving company have agreed
to indemnify, after the effective time of the merger, each individual who has
ever been an officer, director or employee of RGS Energy or any of its
subsidiaries. This indemnification will cover all losses, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), claims, damages, liabilities or
amounts paid in settlement (if Energy East provided written consent to the
settlement) arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or before the
effective time of the merger that are at least in part (1) based on the fact
that such individual served as a director, officer or employee of RGS Energy or
one of its subsidiaries or (2) based on the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement. Energy East will advance to the indemnified party, upon
request, reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred. Independent
counsel mutually acceptable to Energy East and the indemnified individual will
make all necessary determinations to decide whether an indemnified individual's
conduct complies with the standards for indemnification established by New York
law and the governing certificate of incorporation and bylaws. These rights to
indemnification will continue for at least six years after the effective time of
the merger.

    INSURANCE.  For six years after the effective time of the merger, Energy
East will either maintain liability insurance policies for the benefit of those
directors and officers of RGS Energy and its subsidiaries who are currently
covered or provide tail coverage for those directors and officers. In either
case, the terms of the coverage will be at least as favorable as the terms of
the current insurance coverage. Energy East will not, however, be required to
expend in any year more than 200% of the annual aggregate premiums that RGS
Energy currently pays.

    PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS.  Subject to our legal obligations to disclose
information, we will cooperate with each other in the development and
distribution of all news releases and other public information disclosures about
the merger agreement and the merger. In addition, each of us will not issue any
public announcement or statement without the consent of the other party (the
consent cannot be withheld unreasonably).

    RULE 145 AFFILIATES.  Within 30 days of the date of the merger agreement,
RGS Energy will identify in a letter to Energy East all persons who are, and to
the person's best knowledge who will be at the completion date of the merger,
affiliates of RGS Energy according to Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933.
Also, RGS Energy will use all reasonable efforts to cause its affiliates
(including any who were not named in the letter sent by RGS Energy to Energy
East) to deliver to Energy East by the date of the completion of the merger a
letter in which, among other things, the person recognizes his or her possible
status as an affiliate and agrees to comply with Rule 145 and certain
restrictions on selling his or her Energy East shares that the person will
receive in connection with the merger.

    EMPLOYEE AGREEMENTS.  Except as provided below, Energy East and its
subsidiaries will honor all existing contracts, agreements and commitments of
RGS Energy that were entered into before February 16, 2001, and apply to current
or former employees and directors of RGS Energy.

    We intend to continue our present strategy of achieving workforce reductions
through attrition, instead of through involuntary layoffs. If any reductions in
workforce of the surviving company become necessary in the future, they will be
made in consultation with the chairman of the surviving company and on a fair
and equitable basis, giving consideration to previous work history, job
experience, qualifications, and business needs without regard to whether
employment before the merger was with RGS Energy or its subsidiaries or Energy
East or its subsidiaries. In addition, each employee of RG&E will be protected
from any involuntary workforce reduction to the same extent a similarly situated

NYSEG employee is so protected due to a NYSEG collective bargaining agreement.
Any employees whose employment is terminated or whose jobs are eliminated will
have a right to participate, on a fair and equitable basis, in the job
opportunity and employment placement programs offered by Energy East, the
surviving company or any of its subsidiaries. Any workforce reductions carried
out after the effective time of the merger will be done in accordance with all
relevant laws and regulations, including the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act and any similar state or local law.

    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.  For at least 18 months after the merger becomes
effective, Energy East and the surviving company must provide all employees of
RGS Energy and its subsidiaries who are covered by benefit plans with benefits
that are at least as favorable as the benefits they receive immediately before
the merger, except to the extent that changes are required by applicable law.
Also, to the extent that service is relevant for determining eligibility or
participation in any Energy East or surviving company benefit plans, Energy East
and the surviving company will credit service of former RGS Energy employees for
their employment with RGS Energy prior to the effective time of the merger, so
long as this credit does not result in an unintended windfall to these
employees. Further, the surviving company will provide each RGS Energy employee
with credit for co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the effective time of
the merger, in satisfying any deductible or out-of-pocket payment requirements
under any welfare plans that these employees are eligible to participate in
after the effective time.

    RGS ENERGY'S STOCK AND OTHER PLANS.  At the effective time of the merger,
each outstanding option to purchase RGS Energy shares granted under RGS Energy's
1996 Performance Stock Option Plan will be cancelled, whether or not the option
has vested, in exchange for a cash payment equal to (a) the excess, if any, of
$39.50 over the exercise price of the option, multiplied by (b) the number of
shares covered by the option, less applicable tax and withholding. Each option
holder will also receive an amount in cash equal to the aggregate dividend
equivalents credited to the account of the option holder, less applicable tax
and withholding. Also at the effective time of the merger, RGS Energy's
Executive Incentive Plan will terminate and each participant will be entitled to
the product of (a) the target award set out in the plan and (b) the number of
days from the start of the calendar year to the effective time of the merger
divided by 365. Prior to the effective time of the merger, RGS Energy may
establish an employee retention plan, as described above in "The
Merger--Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger," but all of the terms and
conditions of this plan are subject to the review and comment and final approval
of Energy East. In addition, each stock unit received by RGS Energy directors
under RGS Energy benefit plans will be exchanged for a cash payment of $39.50,
payable at the appropriate time and in the manner set out in the plans, and the
transfer restrictions on RGS Energy shares owned by any officer, director or
employee of RGS Energy will lapse. RGS Energy will use its best efforts to cause
each RGS Energy employee who has a severance agreement with RGS Energy to enter
into a related letter agreement with Energy East. With respect to RGS Energy's
stock and other plans, see "The Merger--Interests of Certain Persons in the
Merger."

    MR. RICHARDS' EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT.  We and Mr. Richards have entered into
an employment agreement that will become effective when the merger is completed.

    EXPENSES.  Except for those expenses incurred in connection with the
printing and filing of this document (which expenses are being shared equally by
us) and except as described under "--Termination, Amendment and Waiver," both
parties will pay their own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
merger.

    CORPORATE OFFICES.  At and subsequent to the effective time of the merger,
the corporate headquarters of the surviving company, RG&E, NYSEG and Energy East
Management Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy East, will be
located in Rochester, New York. Energy East Management will have approximately
forty employees in Rochester as of the effective time of the merger. The
operating headquarters of NYSEG will remain in Binghamton, New York.

    ENERGY EAST BOARD.  The size of Energy East's board will increase by three
members at the effective time of the merger. These three new members will be
Mr. Richards and two non-management directors of RGS Energy.

    COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT.  After the effective time of the merger, Energy East
or the surviving company will increase its level of charitable giving and
community involvement in Rochester to reflect the increased size of the
surviving company based in Rochester.

    ADVISORY BOARD.  The surviving company will set up an advisory board
comprised of those individuals who were directors of RGS Energy immediately
before the effective time of the merger, excluding Mr. Richards and the two
non-management directors who will be added to the Energy East board of directors
at the effective time of the merger. The advisory board will meet at least
quarterly and will provide advice to the surviving company's board of directors
as requested. The members of the advisory board, who will serve at the
discretion of the surviving company, will receive remuneration for their
services equivalent to that currently provided to non-employee directors of RGS
Energy.

    TAX FREE STATUS.  Each of us and our subsidiaries will not take any action
that would be reasonably likely to affect adversely the status of the merger as
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code, and each of us will use all reasonable efforts to obtain this status.

    TRANSITION MANAGEMENT.  The parties will create a special task force,
jointly chaired by Mr. Richards and Mr. Jasinski, with an equal number of
members appointed by RGS Energy and Energy East. This task force will assist in
transition management of the surviving company and its subsidiaries.

    ROCHESTER GAS AND ELECTRIC.  Following the completion of the merger, there
will be four members of the board of directors of RG&E. Each of Energy East and
RGS Energy will appoint two members. Energy East intends to appoint Mr. von
Schack and Mr. Jasinski, and RGS Energy intends to appoint Mr. Richards and one
other person. The officers of RG&E will be those in office immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger, plus new officers recommended by the
transition management task force. Each of the officers and directors will
continue to serve until his or her successor is duly appointed or elected.

    NYSEG.  Following the completion of the merger, there will be four members
of the board of directors of NYSEG. Energy East will appoint three members and
RGS Energy will appoint one member. Energy East intends to appoint Mr. von
Schack, Mr. Jasinski and Mr. Ralph R. Tedesco, and RGS Energy intends to appoint
Mr. Richards. The officers of NYSEG will be those in office immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger, Mr. Richards and new officers recommended by
the transition management task force. Each of the officers and directors will
continue to serve until his or her successor is duly appointed or elected.

    SHARE CONTRIBUTION.  Energy East will contribute its shares of NYSEG to the
surviving company within five days of the effective time of the merger, and
NYSEG will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the surviving company, unless
Energy East believes this contribution would materially impede or delay the
completion of the merger, in which case Energy East may choose not to contribute
these shares. Whether or not Energy East contributes the NYSEG shares to the
surviving company, Mr. Richards will serve as chairman of the board and chief
executive officer of NYSEG following the effective time of the merger.

CONDITIONS

    MUTUAL CONDITIONS.  Our obligations to complete the merger are subject to
satisfaction of the following conditions:

    - RGS Energy shareholders must have approved the merger agreement and the
      merger, and Energy East shareholders must have approved the issuance of
      Energy East shares in connection with the merger;

    - no U.S. federal or state court has issued a temporary restraining order or
      preliminary or permanent injunction that prevents completion of the
      merger, and there is no U.S. federal or state law or regulation
      prohibiting the merger;

    - the SEC must have declared effective the registration statement pertaining
      to the Energy East shares to be issued in connection with the merger;

    - the New York Stock Exchange must have approved for listing the Energy East
      shares to be issued in connection with the merger; and

    - we must have obtained the requisite governmental approvals by the
      effective time of the merger and all applicable waiting periods must have
      expired.

    CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF ENERGY EAST.  The obligations of Energy East to
complete the merger are contingent on the satisfaction of, or waiver by Energy
East of, the following conditions:

    - RGS Energy must have performed in all material respects the agreements and
      covenants required by the merger agreement;

    - the representations and warranties of RGS Energy contained in the merger
      agreement must be materially accurate on the date of the merger agreement
      and on the closing date of the merger (except for representations and
      warranties made as of a specified date, the accuracy of which will be
      determined as of the specified date);

    - RGS Energy must have provided Energy East with a certificate, dated the
      closing date of the merger, signed by RGS Energy's senior vice president
      and general counsel regarding satisfaction of the two preceding
      conditions;

      must not be any fact or circumstance, unless it was disclosed in RGS
      Energy's public documents prior to February 16, 2001, that would be
      reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on RGS Energy. An
      adverse change in economic, financial or industry conditions, generally
      accepted accounting principles or generally applicable laws and
      regulations that does not specifically relate to either of our companies
      and that does not affect either of our companies in a materially
      disproportionate manner relative to each other, to the extent
      disproportionate, is not a material adverse effect for the purposes of
      this condition;

    - RGS Energy must have obtained the requisite third-party consents, unless
      the failure to obtain those consents would not have a material adverse
      effect on RGS Energy;

    - each affiliate of RGS Energy must have signed an agreement stating that
      the affiliate will not sell the Energy East shares that he or she receives
      in the merger, except in accordance with Rule 145 promulgated under the
      Securities Act of 1933;

    - attorneys for Energy East must have furnished to Energy East an opinion to
      the effect that the merger will be treated as a reorganization within the
      meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. This condition
      will be waived if RGS Energy elects, as it may do under certain
      circumstances, to have the merger agreement amended so that RGS Energy
      will be the surviving company (see "--Conversion of RGS Energy Shares--Tax
      Adjustment"); and

    - The governmental approvals obtained by the parties must not impose terms
      that, individually or in the aggregate, would have or would reasonably be
      expected to have a material adverse effect on either of our companies. We
      have agreed that a requirement that Energy East divest its ownership of
      any of the gas or electric utility operations of Energy East or RGS Energy
      would have a material adverse effect.

    CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF RGS ENERGY.  The obligations of RGS Energy to
complete the merger agreement and the merger are contingent on the satisfaction
of, or waiver by RGS Energy of, the following conditions:

    - Energy East must have performed in all material respects the agreements
      and covenants required by the merger agreement;

    - the representations and warranties of Energy East contained in the merger
      agreement must be materially accurate on the date of the merger agreement
      and on the closing date of the merger (except for representations and
      warranties made as of a specified date, the accuracy of which will be
      determined as of the specified date);

    - Energy East must have provided RGS Energy with a certificate, dated the
      closing date of the merger, signed by Energy East's executive vice
      president, general counsel and secretary regarding satisfaction of the two
      preceding conditions;

    - Energy East must not have suffered a material adverse effect, and there
      must not be any fact or circumstance, unless it was disclosed in Energy
      East's public documents prior to February 16, 2001, that would be
      reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Energy East. An
      adverse change in economic, financial or industry conditions, generally
      accepted accounting principles or generally applicable laws and
      regulations that does not specifically relate to either of our companies
      and that does not affect either of our companies in a materially
      disproportionate manner relative to each other to the extent
      disproportionate is not a material adverse effect for the purposes of this
      condition;

    - Energy East must have obtained the requisite third-party consents, unless
      the failure to obtain those consents would not have a material adverse
      effect on Energy East; and

    - attorneys for RGS Energy must have furnished to RGS Energy an opinion to
      the effect that the merger will be treated as a reorganization within the
      meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. This condition
      will be waived if RGS Energy elects, as it may do under certain
      circumstances, to have the merger agreement amended so that RGS Energy
      will be the surviving company (see "--Conversion of RGS Energy Shares--Tax
      Adjustment").

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

    TERMINATION.  The merger agreement may be terminated at any time before the
effective time of the merger:

    - by mutual written consent of both of our boards of directors;

    - by either of us if the merger has not been completed by February 16, 2002
      (or November 16, 2002, if the only condition to the closing of the merger
      not satisfied is the inability to obtain the requisite governmental
      approvals), so long as the delay has not been caused by a failure of the
      party seeking termination to fulfill its obligations under the merger
      agreement;

    - by either of us if either the RGS Energy shareholders do not approve and
      adopt the merger agreement or Energy East shareholders do not approve the
      issuance of Energy East shares in connection with the merger, in either
      case by February 16, 2002;

    - by either of us if any state or federal law prohibits the merger (and this
      determination is supported by the written opinion of outside counsel) or
      if any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction issues a final and
      nonappealable decision that permanently enjoins the merger;

    - by RGS Energy, before its shareholders approve the merger agreement, if
      RGS Energy is not in breach of the merger agreement and, as a result of an
      Alternative Proposal, the RGS Energy board of directors determines in good
      faith that:

       - the Alternative Proposal is financially superior to the merger and the
         third party making the Alternative Proposal has obtained or, in the
         reasonable judgment of RGS Energy's financial advisor, can obtain the
         necessary financing; and

       - after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel and
         consideration of other relevant matters, that failure to do so would
         likely result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law;
         however, before RGS Energy may terminate the merger agreement:

           (1) RGS Energy must give Energy East three days' prior notice of its
               intent to accept the alternative acquisition proposal; and

           (2) RGS Energy and its financial and legal advisors must consider in
               good faith any proposal made by Energy East;

    - by RGS Energy if:

       - Energy East has breached any of its representations or warranties in
         the merger agreement, the breach would be reasonably likely to result
         in a material adverse effect on Energy East, and Energy East does not
         cure the breach within 20 days of receiving written notice of the
         breach from RGS Energy;

       - Energy East (or its appropriate subsidiaries) has materially breached
         any of its covenants or agreements under the merger agreement, and
         Energy East does not cure the breach within 20 days of receiving
         written notice of the breach from RGS Energy; or

       - Energy East's board of directors or a committee of the board of the
         directors has withdrawn or modified to RGS Energy's detriment, or
         resolved to do either, its recommendation of the issuance of Energy
         East shares in connection with the merger; or

    - by Energy East if:

       - RGS Energy has breached any of its representations or warranties in the
         merger agreement, the breach would be reasonably likely to result in a
         material adverse effect on RGS Energy, and RGS Energy does not cure the
         breach within 20 days of receiving written notice of the breach from
         Energy East;

       - RGS Energy (or its appropriate subsidiaries) has breached in any
         respect its covenants and agreements with respect to dividends and
         share issuance, or has materially breached any of its other covenants
         or agreements under the merger agreement, and RGS Energy does not cure
         the breach within 20 days of receiving written notice of the breach
         from Energy East; or

       - the RGS Energy board of directors or any committee thereof
         (1) withdraws or modifies in any manner adverse to Energy East its
         approval or recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger,
         (2) fails to reaffirm its approval or recommendation upon Energy East's
         request within seven days of that request, (3) approves or recommends
         any acquisition of RGS Energy or a material portion of its assets or
         any tender offer for the

         shares of capital stock of RGS Energy by someone other than Energy East
         or any of its affiliates, or (4) resolves to take any of these actions.

    EFFECT OF TERMINATION.  RGS Energy and Energy East have agreed that, if
either of them terminates the merger agreement for any reason outlined above,
the merger agreement--except for the provisions concerning expenses, termination
fees, confidentiality of information subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement, waiver of a jury trial and certain damages and enforcement of the
agreement--will become void and have no effect, without any liability on the
part of any party, their officers or their directors. Nonetheless, if either
party materially breaches any provision of the merger agreement and the other
party consequently terminates the agreement, then the breaching party will have
to pay to the other party an amount in cash equal to all documented
out-of-pocket expenses and fees incurred by the other party not in excess of
$10 million. However, if the breach is willful, the merger agreement does not
limit the amount of damages that the nonbreaching party may seek.

    RGS Energy must pay Energy East a termination fee of $50 million plus fees
and expenses up to $10 million if the merger agreement is terminated for any of
the following reasons:

    - the RGS Energy board of directors decides to pursue an Alternative
      Proposal;

    - RGS Energy shareholders fail to approve the merger by February 16, 2002,
      but only if there was an Alternative Proposal outstanding at the time of
      the RGS Energy annual meeting and if, within twelve months of such
      termination, RGS Energy enters into a definitive agreement to complete or
      actually does complete a "BUSINESS COMBINATION," which is (1) a merger,
      consolidation, share exchange, business combination or other similar
      transaction involving either party that results in its shareholders prior
      to the transaction owning in the aggregate less than 70% of the voting
      securities of the company surviving the transaction or of the parent of
      the surviving company, (2) a sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other
      disposition of more than 30% of the assets of a party and its
      subsidiaries, taken together, in a single transaction or series of related
      transactions, or (3) the acquisition, through any means, by a third party
      of beneficial ownership (as that term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of more than 30% of the common stock of a
      party; or

    - the RGS Energy board of directors withdraws, modifies to Energy East's
      detriment, or fails to reaffirm, within seven days of Energy East's
      request, its approval or recommendation of the merger to RGS Energy
      shareholders, or the RGS Energy board of directors approves or recommends
      any acquisition of RGS Energy or a material portion of its assets or a
      tender offer for RGS Energy's capital stock by any third party, but only
      if there was an Alternative Proposal outstanding at the time of the
      termination and if, within twelve months of such termination, RGS Energy
      enters into a definitive agreement to complete or actually does complete a
      Business Combination.

    Energy East must pay RGS Energy a termination fee of $50 million plus fees
and expenses up to $10 million if the merger agreement is terminated for the
following reason:

    - Energy East shareholders fail to approve the issuance of Energy East
      shares in connection with the merger by February 16, 2002, but only if
      there was an Alternative Proposal outstanding at the time of the annual
      meeting, the person or persons that made the Alternative Proposal
      conditioned it on Energy East shareholders failing to approve the issuance
      of Energy East shares in connection with the merger, and if, within twelve
      months of the termination, Energy East enters into a definitive agreement
      to complete or actually does complete a Business Combination.

    AMENDMENT.  The parties' boards of directors may amend the merger agreement
at any time before the effective time of the merger, whether or not the RGS
Energy shareholders have already approved the agreement. After RGS Energy
shareholder approval, however, no such amendment can

(1) alter the merger consideration or the mechanics of the share exchange or
(2) change any of the terms and conditions of the merger agreement if any of the
changes would materially adversely affect the rights of RGS Energy shareholders
(except for changes that could otherwise be adopted by the RGS Energy board of
directors without the further approval of the RGS Energy shareholders).

    WAIVER.  At any time before the effective time of the merger, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, the parties may extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts required by the merger agreement, waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in the merger
agreement, and waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in the merger agreement. To be valid, a waiver or extension by a party
must take the form of a written instrument signed by the waiving party.

                        SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT

    For the security ownership of management of Energy East, see "The Energy
East Annual Meeting--Security Ownership of Management," on page 107. For the
security ownership of management of RGS Energy, see "The RGS Energy Annual
Meeting--Security Ownership of Management," on page 89.

                              UNAUDITED PRO FORMA
                    COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

    The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
have been prepared to reflect the mergers of Energy East with Connecticut
Energy, CMP Group, CTG Resources and Berkshire Energy, all of which were
completed in 2000, and the merger of Energy East with RGS Energy. The RGS Energy
merger will be accounted for as a purchase. The non-utility assets and
liabilities of RGS Energy will be recorded in Energy East's consolidated
financial statements at their estimated fair values at the closing date. The
assets and liabilities of the regulated utility will not be revalued. See "The
Merger--Accounting Treatment."

    The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements reflect
preliminary purchase accounting adjustments in compliance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Estimates relating to the fair value of some
assets and liabilities and other events, such as the proposed sales of Energy
East's 18% interest and RGS Energy's 14% interest in the Nine Mile Point 2
nuclear generating station that have not been reflected in the financial
statements, have been more fully described in the notes to the financial
statements. Actual adjustments will be made on the basis of actual assets,
liabilities and other items as of the closing date of the merger on the basis of
appraisals and evaluations. Also, goodwill related to the mergers with
Connecticut Energy, CMP Group, CTG Resources and Berkshire Energy that were
completed in 2000 may be adjusted as actual amounts for estimated liabilities
become known. Therefore, actual amounts may differ from those reflected in the
pro forma financial statements.

    The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet assumes that the
RGS Energy merger occurred on December 31, 2000. The unaudited pro forma
combined condensed statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2000,
assumes that the mergers completed in 2000 and the RGS Energy merger were
completed on January 1, 2000.

    The accompanying pro forma financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated historical financial statements and the
related notes of Energy East and RGS Energy, which are incorporated by
reference. See "Where You Can Find More Information."

    The accompanying pro forma financial statements are for illustrative
purposes only. They are not necessarily indicative of the financial position or
operating results that would have occurred had the mergers been completed on
January 1, 2000, as assumed above; nor is the information necessarily indicative
of future financial position, operating results or operating synergies.

    55% of the RGS Energy shares outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive $39.50 per share
in cash, and 45% will be converted into, on a per share basis, a number of
Energy East shares valued at $39.50, subject to restrictions on the maximum and
minimum number of Energy East shares to be issued, discussed under "The Merger
Agreement--Conversion of RGS Energy Shares" on pages 56 to 59. The number of
Energy East shares to be exchanged for each RGS Energy share will be between
1.7626 and 2.3838, based on the closing price of Energy East shares on the New
York Stock Exchange during the 20-trading-day average ending two trading days
before the effective time of the merger.

    Energy East expects to issue long-term debt and preferred stock, the
proceeds of which will be used to fund the cash portion of the consideration in
the merger. For illustrative purposes, the unaudited pro forma financial
statements reflect the issuance of the long-term debt and the use of all of the
proceeds to fund the consideration paid to RGS Energy shareholders.

      NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                     GIVING EFFECT TO THE RGS ENERGY MERGER

NOTE 1. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

    The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of income for the year
ended December 31, 2000, gives effect to the mergers completed in 2000 and the
RGS Energy merger as if these events occurred on January 1, 2000. The unaudited
pro forma combined condensed balance sheet gives effect to the RGS Energy merger
as if it occurred December 31, 2000.

    The 2000 Mergers Pro Forma Adjustments include: (1) amounts for the period
from January 1, 2000, to the respective companies' acquisition dates to reflect
income statement activity; (2) additional goodwill of $11.7 million, and
additional interest expense of $37.8 million on the debt issued to finance a
portion of the mergers; (3) the elimination of merger related costs of
$19.5 million included in other operating expenses and a decrease in interest
income of $26.2 million; and (4) a decrease in income taxes of $16.9 million due
to items 2 and 3 previously mentioned.

    The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements presented have not
been adjusted to give effect to the proposed sales of Energy East's 18% interest
and RGS Energy's 14% interest in the Nine Mile Point 2 nuclear generating
station to Constellation Energy, which is expected to be completed in 2001. A
detailed discussion of the sales is presented in each company's Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2000, incorporated by reference in this document.
Certain effects of the sales are presented in the following table, assuming the
sales are completed by July 1, 2001:

                                                              ENERGY EAST   RGS ENERGY

Deferred gain (loss)(1).....................................    $ 71,368     $(326,647)
Investment tax credit benefit...............................    $     --     $  13,124

- ------------------------

(1)  The amounts of the deferred gain and the deferred loss will be amortized
     subject to approval by the New York State Public Service Commission.

NOTE 2. ACCOUNTING METHOD.

    The RGS Energy merger will be accounted for as an acquisition of RGS Energy
by Energy East under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. The amount of goodwill recorded will
reflect the excess of the purchase price over the estimated net fair value of
assets and liabilities of RGS Energy's utility and non-utility businesses at the
time of closing, plus Energy East's estimated transaction costs related to the
merger. The assets and liabilities of RGS Energy's non-utility businesses will
be revalued to fair value, including an allocation to goodwill, if appropriate.

NOTE 3. RGS ENERGY MERGER.

    The historical consolidated financial statements of Energy East and RGS
Energy for the year ended December 31, 2000, have been adjusted to give effect
to the merger.

NOTE 4. EARNINGS PER SHARE AND AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING.

    The pro forma earnings per share and number of average shares outstanding
have been restated to reflect the average number of shares that would have been
outstanding if the merger occurred at the beginning of the periods presented
assuming a conversion of 45% of the RGS Energy shares into 2.0637 Energy East
shares per RGS Energy share. The exchange ratio of 2.0637 is based on a value of
$39.50 per RGS Energy share and a market price of $19.14 per Energy East share.
If the Average Market Price is between $16.57 per share and $22.41 per share,
then each RGS Energy share converted

NOTE 4. EARNINGS PER SHARE AND AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING. (CONTINUED)
into stock will be exchanged for $39.50 worth of Energy East shares. If the
Average Market Price is less than or equal to $16.57, then each RGS Energy share
converted into stock will be exchanged for 2.3838 Energy East shares,
irrespective of the value of the Energy East shares. Finally, if the Average
Market Price is greater than or equal to $22.41 per share, then each RGS Energy
share will be exchanged for 1.7626 Energy East shares, again irrespective of the
value of Energy East shares. The following table presents the range of shares
that could be issued based on various potential conversion ratios provided under
the merger agreement:

Conversion ratio....................................   1.7626     2.0637     2.3838
Number of shares (thousands)........................   27,426     32,111     37,092

NOTE 5. CASH CONSIDERATION.

    This amount reflects the cash consideration paid to RGS Energy shareholders
based on a purchase price per share of $39.50 for 55% of the shares outstanding
as of December 31, 2000, and the cash received from the issuance of the
long-term debt.

NOTE 6. REGULATORY ASSET AND RELATED LIABILITY.

    This amount reflects the recognition of a regulatory asset and a liability
for the estimated difference between RGS Energy's net other postretirement
benefit obligation and the previously recognized liability.

NOTE 7. OTHER ASSET AND RELATED REGULATORY LIABILITY.

    This amount reflects the recognition of an other asset and a regulatory
liability for the estimated difference between RGS Energy's net pension benefit
and the previously recognized liability.

NOTE 8. GOODWILL.

    This amount reflects the recognition of goodwill equal to the excess of the
estimated purchase price of $1,365.8 million over the estimated net fair value
of the assets and liabilities of RGS Energy acquired of $767.1 million, plus
estimated transaction costs of $9.5 million related to the merger. For every one
dollar increase in the Average Market Price above $22.41 per share, the purchase
price will increase by approximately $27 million. For every one dollar decrease
in the Average Market Price below $16.57, the purchase price will decrease by
approximately $37 million.

NOTE 9. MERGER-RELATED COSTS.

    Energy East and RGS Energy will incur direct expenses related to the merger,
including financial advisor, legal and accounting fees. The pro forma
adjustments include an estimate for Energy East's merger-related costs of
$9.5 million, which is included in goodwill. RGS Energy expects to incur
approximately $12.5 million of merger-related costs, which it will expense as
incurred. The actual amount of merger-related costs may differ from the amounts
reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements.

NOTE 10. LONG-TERM DEBT.

    This amount reflects the issuance of $750 million principal amount of notes
payable with an assumed fixed interest rate of 7.5%, the proceeds of which will
be used to fund the consideration paid to RGS Energy shareholders. A 1/8 of 1%
change in interest rate will increase or decrease interest expense by $0.9
million.

               GIVING EFFECT TO THE RGS ENERGY MERGER (CONTINUED)

NOTE 11. COMMON STOCK.

    This amount reflects the Energy East shares to be issued to RGS Energy
shareholders in exchange for 45% of their RGS Energy shares, assuming a
conversion ratio of 2.0637 Energy East shares per RGS Energy share, and the
exchange of 55% of their RGS Energy shares for cash.

NOTE 12. AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL.

    This amount represents the amortization of goodwill for financial accounting
purposes over a 40-year period. The goodwill is not amortizable for tax
purposes.

NOTE 13. INCOME TAXES.

    Income taxes on the pro forma combined condensed income statement have been
based on the statutory rate and adjusted for goodwill, which is not tax
deductible.

NOTE 14. ENERGY EAST SHARES ISSUED.

    This amount reflects the number of Energy East shares to be issued in the
merger assuming a conversion of 45% of the RGS Energy shares into 2.0637 Energy
East shares per RGS Energy share.

                        COMPARATIVE RIGHTS OF RGS ENERGY
                   SHAREHOLDERS AND ENERGY EAST SHAREHOLDERS

    As a result of the merger, some or all of the RGS Energy shareholders will
become Energy East shareholders. The rights of both Energy East shareholders and
RGS Energy shareholders are presently governed by the New York Business
Corporation Law. Any differences, therefore, in the rights of Energy East
shareholders and RGS Energy shareholders arise exclusively from the differences
in their respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws. The following is a
summary comparison of the material differences between the rights of RGS Energy
shareholders and the rights of Energy East shareholders.

    This summary does not purport to be a complete discussion of, and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to, the New York Business Corporation Law
and the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of the two companies, copies of
which are on file with the SEC.

in its certificate of incorporation. Moreover, the
net assets of Energy East remaining after a

    This document is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by
the board of directors of RGS Energy for its 2001 Annual Meeting of Shareholders
to be held               , 2001. The mailing address of RGS Energy's principal

read this document carefully before voting your shares.

ANNUAL REPORT

    An Annual Report to shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2000,
including consolidated financial statements, has been mailed to all shareholders
of record. The Annual Report is not part of this document.

OUTSTANDING VOTING SECURITIES AND VOTING RIGHTS

    GENERAL.  The close of business on             , 2001 has been fixed as the
record date for determining the holders of RGS Energy common stock entitled to
vote at the 2001 annual meeting. As of          , 2001, RGS Energy had
outstanding          shares of common stock. Shareholders of record are entitled
to one vote per share.

    In voting on the merger and other transactions contained in the merger
agreement holders of RGS Energy common stock may vote for, against or abstain
from voting their shares. The affirmative vote of a majority of outstanding RGS
Energy shares is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement.
Accordingly, an abstention, a failure to vote or a broker non-vote has the
effect of a vote against the merger proposal. In voting in the election of
directors, holders of RGS Energy common stock may vote for all of the nominees
or may withhold their votes as to all or specific nominees. The three nominees
who receive the highest number of affirmative votes, in person or by proxy, will
be elected. As a result, in accordance with New York law, abstentions will have
no effect on the election of directors.

    In connection with the annual meeting, holders of RGS Energy common stock
have three ways to vote by proxy: (a) by mail, (b) by telephone and (c) over the
Internet. To vote electronically, by telephone or over the Internet, holders of
RGS Energy common stock should follow the instructions on the enclosed proxy
form. To vote by mail, holders of RGS Energy common stock should complete and
return the enclosed proxy form in the envelope provided.

    If a holder of RGS Energy common stock completes and returns a proxy by
mail, telephone or Internet, the proxies will vote such holder's shares in
accordance with the instructions in the proxy. If a holder signs and returns the
proxy form without checking any boxes, the proxies will vote such holder's
shares for the merger agreement and for the election of all of the nominees for
director.

    HOLDERS OF RGS ENERGY COMMON STOCK MAY REVOKE THEIR PROXY AT ANY TIME BEFORE
ITS EXERCISE AT THE ANNUAL MEETING, REGARDLESS OF HOW IT IS SUBMITTED.
THEREFORE, VOTING BY PROXY NOW WILL NOT AFFECT SUCH HOLDERS' RIGHT TO VOTE IN
PERSON AT THE MEETING.

    RGS ENERGY EMPLOYEE SHAREHOLDERS.  In the case of an employee of RGS Energy
or any of its subsidiaries, the proxy is for shares of RGS Energy common stock
registered in such employee's name as well as any shares held for such employee
shareholder under the RGS Energy Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock
Purchase Plan, the RG&E Savings Plus Plan and/or the RGS Energy Employee Stock
Ownership Plan.

    If a participant in the RG&E Savings Plus Plan does not return the proxy
form or otherwise vote by telephone or over the Internet, the trustee of the
RG&E Savings Plus Plan may nonetheless instruct the proxies to vote any Savings
Plus Plan shares held by such participant (but not such participant's other
shares) in the same proportion as shares voted by other participants in such
plan.

    NON-EMPLOYEE RGS ENERGY SHAREHOLDERS.  In the case of holders of RGS Energy
common stock who are not employees of RGS Energy or any of its subsidiaries, the
proxy is for shares of RGS Energy common stock registered in such holder's name
as well as any shares held for such holder under the RGS Energy Automatic
Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan.

    SHARES HELD IN STREET NAME.  Whether or not a holder of RGS Energy common
stock is an employee of RGS Energy or any of its subsidiaries, if such holder
beneficially owns shares which a broker holds in street name on such holder's
behalf, such holder will be provided with a form of proxy instructing the broker
how to vote the shares. If a holder does not provide voting instructions to a
broker, the broker may, in accordance with the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange, vote such shares in the broker's discretion with respect to
"discretionary" matters. However, Proposal 1, the merger proposal, is considered
a "non-discretionary item," and the broker may not vote shares for which no
voting instructions have been received on Proposal 1. As a result, if you do not
instruct your broker on how to vote your shares, this will have the effect of a
vote against the merger proposal.

                        PROPOSAL 1--THE MERGER PROPOSAL

    Proposal 1 is a proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. For
summary and detailed information regarding the proposed merger with Energy East,
see "The Merger--General Description of the Merger" on page 23.

their successors are elected and qualify:

    - Jay T. Holmes.

    Unless holders of RGS Energy common stock specify otherwise on their proxy,
the proxies will vote shares represented by proxies for the election of the

qualify or accept office, if one or more should be unable to do so, the proxies
reserve the right to vote for any substitute nominee or nominees designated by

member. For executive officers, the target level is three times base salary for
the Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and two and
one-half times base salary for the other executive officers, exclusive of
exercisable stock options but including common stock equivalent units accrued

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

    Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires RGS Energy's
directors and executive officers, as well as persons holding 10% or more of RGS
Energy's equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in
ownership with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. These reporting persons
are also required to provide RGS Energy with copies of all such Section 16(a)
forms they file. Based solely on RGS Energy's review of the copies of the
reports received by RGS Energy, and on the written representations of certain
reporting persons, RGS Energy believes that during 2000 all filing requirements
were timely satisfied by the directors and executive officers of RGS Energy.

(1) Under the Executive Incentive Plan, the amount of annual awards depends upon
    the level of achievement of one-year goals. If performance is below a
    minimal level, no award is earned. Actual amounts of annual awards earned
    under the Plan are shown.

(2) Options granted between 1998-2000.

(3) Under the Long Term Incentive Plan, the amount of annual awards depends upon
    the total shareholder return over a three-year period ending in December of
    such year, as compared to the companies which comprise the EEI Index of
    investor-owned electric utilities. The Plan also includes a financial
    performance measurement which compares RGS Energy's cash flow return on net
    assets against a pre-established target goal identified in RGS Energy's
    corporate business plan. The table reports actual amounts earned at the end
    of each performance cycle, grossed up to cover federal and state income
    taxes. Awards granted under the Plan are paid in cash. Participants are
    required to invest the after-tax proceeds in shares of RGS Energy's common
    stock and to retain the shares for a period of at least three years.

(4) Amounts represent contributions to the RG&E Savings Plus Plan (401(k) Plan)
    and the 401(k) Restoration Plan.

(1) The options shown in this table were granted in January 2000 under the 1996
    Performance Stock Option Plan. All options are vested as of the date of
    grant; however, they may not be exercised for a minimum of three years.
    Options carry dividend rights which provide for a cash payment upon exercise
    of an option in an amount equal to the quarterly dividend payments per share
    of RGS Energy common stock paid to RGS Energy's shareholders from the date
    the option was granted until the date of exercise.

(2) The grant date valuation was calculated using the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model assuming stock price volatility of 18.0%, a risk-free rate of
    return of 6.86% and an annual dividend yield of 8.78%. The weighted average
    fair value of an option as of the grant date is $5.96.

RETIREMENT PLANS

    RGS Energy has a non-contributory, tax qualified, defined benefit pension
plan known as the RG&E Retirement Plan. RGS Energy also has an unfunded,
non-qualified plan known as the RG&E Unfunded Retirement Income Plan. All
employees of RGS Energy and certain of its subsidiaries, including executive
officers, are eligible to participate in these plans. The benefit provided by
the RG&E Retirement Plan and the RG&E Unfunded Retirement Income Plan is based
upon one of the two following formulas depending on age and service on
December 31, 1999:

    - a pension equity plan formula; or

    - final average pay (highest 36 month average of the last 120 months prior
      to retirement).

    The pension equity plan formula was introduced effective July 1, 1999.
Employees whose age and service equaled 75 or who were age 55 with 10 years of
service on December 31, 1999 receive the most valuable of these two formulas.
All other employees' benefits will be based on the pension equity plan formula
only. The pension equity plan provides a lump sum payment option as well as
monthly annuity options.

    RGS Energy also has an unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan,
known as the RG&E Unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, in which
executive officers participate. The annual pension benefit under these plans,
taken together, is determined by the employee's years of service and annual
compensation (salary and bonus). Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the
annual benefit payable by the funded plan was limited to $135,000 for 2000. The
unfunded plans will provide those benefits which cannot be fully provided by the
funded plan. The table below may be used to calculate the approximate annual
benefits payable as a straight-life annuity to executive officers at normal
retirement age (65) under these plans in specified remuneration and
years-of-service classifications.

(1) Average annual salary includes base pay (three highest consecutive years)
    and annual bonus (three highest years) during the last ten years before
    retirement. The amounts shown in the salary and bonus columns in the Summary
    Compensation Table constitute qualifying compensation under the plans.

(2) Messrs. Richards, Stokes, Tomaino, Bovalino and Wilkens have been credited
    with 17, 5, 11, 4 and 27 years of service, respectively, under the plans.

SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS

    RGS Energy has entered into severance agreements for an indefinite term with
Messrs. Richards, Stokes, Tomaino, Bovalino and Wilkens. The agreements provide
that each of the officers that is a party to the agreements is obligated, in the
event of an attempted change of control (as defined in the agreements), not to
leave RGS Energy and to render certain services to RGS Energy for a designated
period. The agreements also provide that the officer is entitled to specified
compensation and benefits if, within three years after a change in control, the
officer's employment is involuntarily terminated, other than for cause (as
defined in the agreements) or by reason of death, disability or normal
retirement. Involuntary termination also includes the officer's resignation
following a change in duties (as defined in the agreements). If an involuntary
termination occurs within the three-year covered period, the officer will
receive a lump sum payment equal to three times his annual salary (as defined in
the agreements) and certain other benefits including health and death benefits
and outplacement and relocation expense reimbursement. The agreements also
provide for a gross-up for any excise taxes that may apply under Section 4999 of
the Internal Revenue Code.

DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION

    RGS Energy pays its directors an annual retainer of $22,000, $11,000 in cash
and $11,000 to be applied to the purchase of shares of RGS Energy common stock.
RGS Energy pays committee chairmen an additional annual cash retainer of $3,000.
Directors receive $900 for each Board or committee meeting attended and $600 for
each additional Board or committee meeting attended the same day.

    RGS Energy does not pay its officers any fees for their services as
directors. The total amount of compensation RGS Energy pays to its directors is
comparable to the total compensation paid to directors of similar sized
combination electric and gas utility companies.

    RGS Energy has deferral plans under which a director's fees and the cash
portion of his or her retainer may either be deferred with interest in a cash
account or deferred and converted to common stock equivalent units which earn
dividends equal to dividends declared on RGS Energy common stock. In either
case, deferred amounts are paid in cash, in a lump sum or over a period of up to
ten years commencing no later than the director's 70th birthday.

    RGS Energy has a Deferred Stock Unit Plan for Non-Employee Directors which
also serves to align the directors' financial interests with those of the
shareholders. Each director's deferred stock account is based on the amount of
the annual retainer, the number of years of Board service, and the price of RGS
Energy's common stock. Under the Plan, each non-employee director is credited
annually with deferred stock units equal to 75% of his or her annual retainer.
Benefits under the Plan become partially vested after five years of service and
are fully vested after ten years. Upon cessation of membership on the Board,
deferred amounts will be payable in cash in a lump sum or in up to ten annual
installments as determined by each director.

MEETINGS AND STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    The RGS Energy board of directors met eleven times during 2000. All of the
directors attended 75% or more of the total number of meetings of the board of
directors and the Committees of the Board on which they served, which Committees
are described below.

    EXECUTIVE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE.  The RGS Energy Executive and Finance
Committee, with certain exceptions, possesses all of the authority of the board
of directors. During 2000, the Committee met four times. Messrs. Dugan, Holmes,
Kober, Murphy (Chairman), Plosser and Richards are currently members of the
Committee.

    COMMITTEE ON MANAGEMENT.  The RGS Energy Committee on Management reviews RGS
Energy's executive compensation and benefits program, including awards under RGS
Energy's annual Executive Incentive Plan, Long Term Incentive Plan and
Performance Stock Option Plan. The Committee sets the compensation of the Chief
Executive Officer and reviews the compensation levels of members of management
proposed by the Chief Executive Officer. The Committee oversees RGS Energy's
organizational structure, corporate goals and objectives and management
development, including management succession. During 2000, the Committee met
four times. Messrs. Dugan (Chairman), Grier, Hubbard, Murphy and Plosser are
currently members of the Committee.

    COMMITTEE ON DIRECTORS.  The RGS Energy Committee on Directors is
responsible for evaluation of director performance, director compensation,
director succession, committee membership and corporate governance issues. The
Committee recommends to the board of directors candidates to be nominated for
election as directors. During 2000, the Committee met two times.
Messrs. Chiarella, Holmes (Chairman) and Killingsworth, Ms. Holliday and
Ms. Howard are currently members of the Committee.

    RGS Energy shareholders wishing to recommend candidates for nomination to
the Board should submit in writing to the Secretary of RGS Energy the name of
the nominee, a statement of the

nominee's qualifications and the written consent of the person so named.
Suggestions received prior to October 1, 2001, will be considered by the
Committee when recommending nominees for election at the RGS Energy 2002 annual
meeting of shareholders.

    AUDIT COMMITTEE.  (See Report of the Audit Committee which follows this
section.)

REPORT OF AUDIT COMMITTEE

    The RGS Energy Audit Committee is composed of independent directors and
operates under a written charter adopted by the Committee and the Board. A copy
of the Committee's charter is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus
as Appendix E.

    During 2000, the Committee met four times. The members of the Committee are
identified at the end of this report.

    RGS Energy management has the primary responsibility for RGS Energy's
financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal
controls. RGS Energy's independent accountants are responsible for performing an
independent audit of RGS Energy's consolidated financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and to issue a report
thereon. The Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these
processes.

    In this context, the Committee has met and held discussions with management
and the independent accountants. Management represented to the Committee that
RGS Energy's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and the Committee has reviewed and
discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the
independent accountants. The Committee discussed with the independent
accountants the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing
Standards No. 61 (Communication With Audit Committees).

    The independent accountants provided to the Committee the written
disclosures and the letter required by Independence Standards Board Standard
No. 1 (Independence Discussion With Audit Committees). The Committee discussed
with the independent accountants their independence. All audit and non-audit
services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are reviewed by the Committee,
which has considered whether the provision of non-audit services is compatible
with maintaining the independent accountants' independence.

    The Committee discussed with RGS Energy's internal auditors and independent
accountants the scope and plans for their respective audits. The Committee met
with the internal auditors and independent accountants, with and without
management present, and discussed the results of their examinations, their
evaluations of RGS Energy's internal controls, and the quality of RGS Energy's
financial reporting.

    In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Committee
recommended to the board of directors, and the Board has approved, that the
audited financial statements be included in RGS Energy's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000, for filing with the SEC.

                                          Audit Committee

REPORT OF THE RGS ENERGY COMMITTEE ON MANAGEMENT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

    The RGS Energy Committee on Management is appointed by the board of
directors of RGS Energy. The Committee's objective is to assure that executive
compensation is fair and reasonable to customers, shareholders and employees by
providing competitive compensation linked to the achievement of RGS Energy's
goals. The Committee provides to the Board a detailed review of all aspects of
compensation for the senior officer positions.

    The Committee has used the services of a compensation consulting firm to
advise it on the reasonableness of compensation paid to senior officers as
compared to other companies, including both utility companies and general
industry companies. The Committee has commissioned several consultant studies on
executive compensation in recent years. The studies indicated that RGS Energy's
executive compensation levels were below the average for comparable utility and
general industry companies, and based on these results, the Committee has
adjusted RGS Energy's compensation objectives to the targets discussed below.
The studies also provided competitive benchmarks for establishment of short and
long-term incentive programs.

    COMPONENTS OF COMPENSATION.  The executive compensation program consists of
three components: base salary, annual incentive compensation and long-term
incentive compensation.

    BASE SALARY.  The first component of executive compensation is base salary,
which is predicated on competitive market conditions, level of responsibility
and individual performance. RGS Energy's target base salary objective for its
top five executive positions is to be competitive with utility companies in the
Edison Electric Institute (EEI) revenue class of $1 billion to $3 billion (30
companies) at the median of this class. The average base pay for RGS Energy's
five highest paid executives in 2000 was 36.3% below the median base pay of
those companies.

    EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE PLAN.  The second component of executive compensation is
annual incentive compensation. A substantial portion of the annual compensation
of each officer relates to, and is contingent upon, the performance of RGS
Energy, as well as the individual contribution of each officer. As a result, a
portion of each officer's total potential compensation is variable.

    RGS Energy has an Executive Incentive Plan which provides for annual
performance bonus awards for key employees that are paid upon meeting corporate
performance objectives established annually by the Committee on Management and
approved by the board of directors and individual performance objectives
established annually by the key employees and approved by Senior Management.
Awards range from 0% to 60% of a participant's annual base salary. The
individual portion of the total eligible award ranges up to 20% for the CEO, 40%
for senior officers and 50% for Vice President-level participants. The annual
award will be paid in cash in the year following the year in which it was
earned.

    The Executive Incentive Plan corporate annual performance objectives for
2000 consisted of three categories: (1) shareholder satisfaction, (2) customer
satisfaction, and (3) employee satisfaction. The weighting of importance and
value for each of these categories was 50%, 30% and 20% respectively. The
Committee monitored RGS Energy's performance regarding the Plan's objectives
throughout the year. Based upon 2000 performance results, the Board granted an
Executive Incentive Plan payout for achieving the following measures of the
categories discussed above: (1) cash flow return on net assets, (2) customer
satisfaction measurements in the business segment areas of Deliver Energy,
Supply Wholesale Electric Power and Establish and Maintain Regulated Retail
Customer Relationships, and (3) employee satisfaction index. Members of the
executive management team (5 employees) and selected leadership team members (15
employees) participated in the 2000 Plan. The bonus awards for 2000, as reported
below in the Summary Compensation Table, reflect the achievement of
Mr. Richards' earning 39.8% of his 2000 annualized salary and the other
executive officers earning between 27.7%

and 31.5% of their annualized salary, as determined by the Committee and as
approved by the board of directors.

    LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN.  The third component of executive compensation is
long-term incentive compensation, which is designed to ensure the continuing
success of RGS Energy and is directly tied to RGS Energy's common stock
performance.

    The sixth and last Long Term Incentive Plan performance cycle concluded in
December 2000. The total shareholder return during the three-year performance
cycle, as compared to the EEI Index, placed RGS Energy in the 44th position out
of 89 companies. During the previous three-year performance cycle concluded in
December 1999, RGS Energy ranked 30th out of 96 companies. Based upon RGS
Energy's relative performance compared to the EEI Index, and cash flow return on
net assets of 9.78%, which was above the target goal established in the
corporate business plan, the board of directors approved a 125.77% payout for
2000 for performance shares granted in January 1998. These awards were grossed
up to cover federal and state income taxes, as reported above in the Summary
Compensation Table. Awards granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan are paid
in cash. Participants are required to invest the after-tax proceeds in shares of
RGS Energy common stock and to retain the shares for a period of at least three
years.

    The previous Long Term Incentive Plan grants, based upon a three-year
performance cycle, were made in January of 1998. The 1998 performance cycle
(1998-2000) concludes this Plan. Effective January 1999, performance shares
previously granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan were replaced with annual
stock options as approved by the Committee on Management and the Board effective
January 1, 1999.

    PERFORMANCE STOCK OPTION PLAN.  The Performance Stock Option Plan was
established and approved by the shareholders of RG&E in 1996 and was assumed by
RGS Energy in connection with its formation. The Performance Stock Option Plan
is designed to motivate management to increase shareholder value over the long
term. Under the Plan, officers and other key executives may be awarded stock
options over a ten-year period. The stock options are intended to more closely
align the interests of management with those of shareholders by giving
management a greater interest in significant stock price appreciation. The full
benefit of the compensation package of each executive cannot be realized unless
stock price appreciation occurs over a number of years. Option grants include
dividend equivalent rights from the date of grant. Annually, the Committee may
recommend to the board of directors the granting of options based upon a
participant's positional responsibilities. The number of options is determined
by RGS Energy's performance as compared to an industry performance measure (EEI
Index), which can increase or decrease the number of options granted in any
given year. Options granted are vested immediately, but cannot be exercised for
a minimum of three years. Quarterly dividends granted will be paid at the time
of exercise.

    Under the annual stock option program, the granting of options is based upon
RGS Energy's three-year total shareholder return performance as compared to the
performance of the EEI Index. Top third, middle third and bottom third
performance by RGS Energy will result in a varying number of stock option
grants. As RGS Energy's total shareholder return performance for the period
1997-1999 was in the top third of the comparative group, annual options were
granted on January 19, 2000 at an exercise price of $20.50 per share as follows:
Mr. Richards, 42,683 options; Mr. Stokes, 20,290 options; Mr. Tomaino, 19,231
options; Mr. Bovalino, 17,713 options; and Mr. Wilkens, 16,038 options. These
options cannot be exercised for three years from the date of grant and include
dividend equivalent rights from the date the option was granted to the date of
exercise.

    Under the provisions of the Stock Option Plan, the Committee may grant
additional options in the future.

    RGS Energy's total compensation objective for its top five executive
positions is to be fully competitive with a utility industry comparison group.
Total compensation is defined as the combination of base salary and short and
long-term incentives.

    CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION.  The Board, upon recommendation of the
Committee, increased Mr. Richards' base salary to $385,008 effective March 1,
2000 and awarded short and long term incentives based on performance against
established metrics and the subjective judgment of the Board. The Committee
benchmarked Mr. Richards' total compensation against CEO compensation in similar
sized energy utilities. Mr. Richards' total compensation is slightly below the
25th percentile of similar benchmarked positions. The Committee determined that
Mr. Richards' total compensation is consistent with Mr. Richards' performance,
RGS Energy's relative performance to similar companies, and Mr. Richards' tenure
as CEO. The Committee was favorably impressed with Mr. Richards' leadership
which has resulted in excellent operating performance, expense control and
improved earnings. He continues to effectively manage the transition of the
regulated business in the competitive deregulated environment while overseeing
the successful expansion of the unregulated business through RGS Energy's
subsidiary, Energetix, Inc.

    With the above increase in salary level, Mr. Richards' base pay for 2000 was
49.3% below the median of the EEI salary comparison group. As a result of the
awards paid to Mr. Richards for the positive performance achieved under the
Executive Incentive Plan and Long Term Incentive Plan for 2000, his total direct
compensation is 63.4% below the median of the EEI salary comparison group.

    Mr. Richards was granted 4,000 performance shares in January 1998 under the
Long Term Incentive Plan. The performance cycle for these shares ended on
December 31, 2000 and Mr. Richards received $363,025 in compensation from these
performance shares in January 2001.

    Mr. Richards was granted an additional 42,683 performance stock options on
January 19, 2000 at an exercise price of $20.50 per share. These options will
vest immediately, but cannot be exercised for a minimum of three years.

    Performance shares under the Long Term Incentive Plan and the Performance
Stock Option Plan link executive compensation directly with shareholder
interests since both the targets and the payouts are measured in terms of
shareholder value.

INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

    RGS Energy has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, a firm of independent
certified public accountants, to continue as its auditors for the year 2001. RGS
Energy expects representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers to be present at the
RGS Energy annual meeting and available to answer appropriate questions from RGS
Energy shareholders. The representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers will also
have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. From time to
time, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP performs certain management advisory services
for RGS Energy.

    AUDIT FEES

    RGS Energy paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers audit fees of $267,000 for
professional services rendered for the audit of RGS Energy's annual financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2000 and the reviews of the financial
statements included in RGS Energy's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for such
year.

    FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION FEES

    RGS Energy did not engage PricewaterhouseCoopers to provide advice regarding
its financial information systems design and implementation during the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2000.

    OTHER NON-AUDIT FEES

    Fees billed to RGS Energy by PricewaterhouseCoopers during RGS Energy's 2000
fiscal year for all other non-audit services rendered to RGS Energy, including
tax related services, totaled $250,000.

DEADLINE FOR SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

    The deadline for submitting shareholder proposals for inclusion in RGS
Energy's proxy statement for its year 2002 annual meeting is          , 2001.
These proposals must be received by the Secretary of RGS Energy at 89 East
Avenue, Rochester, New York 14649 no later than          , 2001 in order to be
eligible for inclusion in RGS Energy's proxy materials relating to the 2002
meeting.

    Rule 14a-4(c) of the SEC's proxy rules allows RGS Energy to use
discretionary voting authority to vote on a matter coming before an annual
meeting of shareholders which is not included in its proxy statement if RGS
Energy does not have notice of the matter at least 90 days before the date of
the annual meeting. In addition, discretionary voting authority may generally
also be used if RGS Energy receives timely notice of such matter (as described
in the preceding sentence) and if RGS Energy describes the nature of such matter
in its proxy statement. Accordingly, for RGS Energy's year 2002 annual meeting
of shareholders, any such notice must be received by RGS Energy's Secretary at
89 East Avenue, Rochester, New York 14649, on or before          , 2002.

    RGS Energy's bylaws provide that any shareholder who wishes to submit a
proposal must notify RGS Energy 90 days in advance of a meeting and must submit
the following: (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought
before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting the business at that
meeting, (b) the shareholder's name and address as they appear on RGS Energy's
books, (c) the class and number of shares of RGS Energy that are owned by the
shareholder, and (d) any material interest of such shareholder in such business.

OTHER MATTERS

    The RGS Energy board of directors does not know of any other business
matters to be presented for action at the RGS Energy 2001 annual meeting.
However, the enclosed proxy will confer discretionary authority for the
transacting of any such business properly brought before the RGS Energy annual
meeting or any adjournment thereof. If any such business is so brought before
the meeting, the persons named in the enclosed proxy form, or their substitutes,
will vote according to their discretion.

    New York State law requires RGS Energy to inform its shareholders of the
initiation or renewal of insurance indemnifying itself and its officers and
directors. This insurance, which is carried with Associated Electric and Gas
Insurance Services Limited, has been renewed for a one-year term, effective
January 1, 2001. The policy insures RGS Energy against any obligations it may
incur as a result of the indemnification of its directors and officers. The
effective cost of the insurance will be zero for 2001 as RGS Energy received a
member's continuity credit which fully offset the premium for the policy. In
addition, RGS Energy has a policy with Energy Insurance Mutual Limited that
provides excess coverage for such insurance for a three-year term, effective
January 1, 2001. RGS Energy also expects that the effective cost of this policy
will be zero for 2001 as it anticipates receiving a dividend from the insurance
carrier in 2001. RGS Energy also renewed a fiduciary liability insurance policy
carried with Associated Electric and Gas Insurance Services Limited, effective
May 1, 2000. The premium cost for this policy was $41,428 for a one-year term.

COST OF SOLICITATION

    The accompanying proxy is being solicited by the board of directors of RGS
Energy. RGS Energy will pay the costs of this solicitation, including
reimbursing brokerage firms and others for their expenses in forwarding proxy
material to beneficial owners of stock. However, RGS Energy and Energy East will
share equally the cost of printing this document. Directors, officers and
employees of RGS Energy and its subsidiaries may solicit proxies by telephone,
other electronic means or in person without additional compensation. In
addition, RGS Energy has retained Morrow & Co. to assist in soliciting proxies
at an anticipated fee of approximately $17,500, plus out-of-pocket expenses.

                         THE ENERGY EAST ANNUAL MEETING

    This document is being furnished in connection with the solicitation of
proxies on behalf of the board of directors of Energy East for use at the Energy
East Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on             , 2001, at
            . This document is also a prospectus for the Energy East shares to
be issued in the merger. The mailing address of Energy East's principal
executive office is P.O. Box 12904, Albany, New York 12212-2904. You should read
this document carefully before voting your shares.

ANNUAL REPORT

    An Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2000,
including consolidated financial statements, has been mailed to all shareholders
of record. The Annual Report is not a part of this document.

OUTSTANDING VOTING SECURITIES AND VOTING RIGHTS

    The close of business on       , 2001 has been fixed as the record date for
determining the Energy East shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting. As of
the record date, Energy East had outstanding             shares of common stock.
Energy East shareholders have cumulative voting rights for the election of
directors and one vote per share for all other purposes. Cumulative voting means
that the total number of votes which you may cast for the election of directors
of a given class shall equal the number of directors in such class to be elected
multiplied by the number of shares held, and you may cast all of such votes for
a single nominee for director or you may distribute them among all or several
nominees in such class, as you see fit.

    The proxy represents the number of shares registered in your name as well as
the number of whole shares credited to your account under Energy East's Dividend
Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. If you are an employee of Energy East or
any subsidiary and participate in the Tax Deferred Savings Plans of NYSEG, The
Southern Connecticut Gas Company Target Plan, the Central Maine Power Company
Savings and Investment Plans, the Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation Savings
Plans or the Berkshire Energy Resources Retirement Savings Plans, the proxy
constitutes an instruction for the trustees of such plans to vote the whole
shares in your account in such plans in the manner specified on the proxy.

    In voting for Proposal 1 (the issuance of Energy East shares in connection
with the merger), you may vote in favor of, or against, or may abstain from
voting on such proposal. The vote required to approve Proposal 1 is the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of Energy East
shares entitled to vote, so long as a majority of the outstanding Energy East
shares has cast a vote. Abstentions will be counted as votes cast and will
therefore have the same effect as a vote against the issuance of Energy East
shares in connection with the merger. Under the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange, member brokerage firms that hold shares in street name for beneficial
owners may, to the extent that such beneficial owners do not furnish voting
instructions with respect to any or all proposals submitted for stockholder
action, vote in their discretion upon proposals which are considered
"discretionary" proposals under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Member
brokerage firms that have received no instructions from their clients as to
"non-discretionary" proposals do not have discretion to vote on these proposals.
Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, Proposal 1 is considered to be a
"non-discretionary item" whereby brokerage firms may not vote in their
discretion on behalf of their clients if such clients have not furnished voting
instructions. Therefore, broker non-votes will be voted neither "for" nor
"against" and will have no effect on the vote in connection with Proposal 1,
except that they will be counted as votes not cast for the purposes of
determining whether a majority of outstanding Energy East shares voted on
Proposal 1.

    In voting for Proposal 2 (the election of directors), you may vote in favor
of all nominees or withhold your votes as to all, or as to specific, nominees.
The       nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes cast, in
person or by proxy, by holders of Energy East shares entitled to vote shall be
elected to serve as directors. As a result, votes that are withheld will not be
counted and will have no effect on the vote in connection with the election of
directors.

    In determining whether a quorum is present, all duly executed proxies
(including those marked "abstain" or "withhold") will be counted. Broker
non-votes will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is
present.

                        PROPOSAL 1--THE MERGER PROPOSAL

    Proposal 1 is a proposal to approve the issuance of Energy East shares in
connection with the merger. For summary and detailed information regarding the
proposed merger with RGS Energy, see "The Merger--General Description of the
Merger" on page 23.

                       PROPOSAL 2--ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

    Your board of directors currently consists of thirteen directors divided
into three classes. One class of directors is elected at each annual meeting of
shareholders for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of
shareholders. In addition to electing       directors to serve in Class III,
      directors will be elected to serve in Class I.

    The nominees for election at this Annual Meeting to serve as directors in
Class III for a term expiring at the 2004 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and
thereafter until their successors shall be elected and shall qualify are:
                  . Messrs.                   were elected to Class III for a
term expiring at the 2001 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The nominees for
election at this Annual Meeting to serve as directors in Class I for a term
expiring at the 2002 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and thereafter until their
successors shall be elected and shall qualify are:                   .
Messrs.                  were elected directors of Energy East effective
September 1, 2000 to serve until the 2001 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

    Unless otherwise specified on the proxy, shares represented by proxies in
the accompanying form received on behalf of the board of directors will be voted
for the election of                 . Proxy holders reserve the right to
exercise cumulative voting rights and to cast the votes at the meeting in such
manner, and for such lesser number of said nominees, as they may deem best, in
order, so far as possible, to secure the election of said nominees. While it is
not anticipated that any of the nominees will be unable to qualify or accept
office, if one or more should be unable to do so, the proxy holders reserve the
right to vote for any substitute nominee or nominees designated by the board of
directors.

    During 2000, there were nine meetings of the board of directors. All of the
directors attended 75% or more of the total number of meetings of the board of
directors and the committees of the board on which they served, except for
Mr. Tomasso who attended two of the three board meetings held in 2000 since he
became a member of the board of directors.

    The following sets forth information for each nominee for election at this
annual meeting and for each director continuing in office.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

    Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires Energy East's
directors and executive officers, and persons holding ten percent or more of
Energy East's equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in
ownership with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. Such reporting persons
are also required to provide Energy East with copies of all Section 16(a) forms
they file. Specific due dates for these reports have been established by SEC
regulations. Based solely on its review of the copies of the reports received by
it and certain written representations from certain reporting persons, Energy
East believes that during 2000 all filing requirements were satisfied by its
directors and executive officers.

- ------------------------

(1) Pursuant to the Long-Term Executive Incentive Share Plan, participants,
    including executive officers of Energy East, were granted a certain number
    of performance shares in 2000 depending upon their position. Performance
    shares granted earn dividend equivalents in the form of additional
    performance shares. Payments representing the cash value of a certain
    percentage of the performance shares are made at the end of each three-year
    performance cycle and are based on Energy East's ranking with respect to its
    three-year average total shareholder return as compared to the top 100
    utilities by revenue. A new performance cycle begins on January 1 of each
    year. Achievement of a ranking of 65th will result in the payment of the
    cash value of 25% (threshold amount) of the performance shares. Achievement
    of a ranking of 50th will result in the payment of the cash value of 100%
    (target amount) of the performance shares. Achievement of a ranking of 20th
    will result in the payment of the cash value of 150% (maximum amount) of the
    performance shares. There will be no payments, however, if Energy East's
    ranking is below 65th. The value of the performance shares will be measured
    by reference to the average of the daily closing prices of an Energy East

- ------------------------

(1) Pursuant to the 1997 Stock Option Plan, participants were granted options to
    purchase a specified number of Energy East shares at specified exercise
    prices. These options were granted in tandem with stock appreciation rights
    and are for a term of ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price
    of an option or tandem stock appreciation right may not be less than 100% of
    the closing price of an Energy East share determined on the last trading
    date before such option and tandem stock appreciation right are granted. The
    exercise of an option or a tandem stock appreciation right will result in a
    corresponding cancellation of the related stock appreciation right or option
    to the extent of the number of Energy East shares as to which the option or
    the stock appreciation right was exercised. Replacement options are granted
    to participants at the time of an exercise of an option to the extent that
    all or any portion of the option exercise price or taxes incurred in
    connection with the exercise of the option are paid for by using other
    Energy East shares or by the

    withholding of Energy East shares. The replacement option is granted for the
    number of shares the participant tenders to pay the exercise price or taxes
    incurred. Replacement options will first be exercisable no earlier than six
    months from the date of their grant and will have an expiration date equal
    to the expiration date of the original option. The options are transferable
    to family members and certain entities under certain circumstances. The
    options and tandem stock appreciation rights were granted on February 11,
    2000 and are exercisable in three installments regarding the original number
    of options granted as follows: (a) in aggregate as to no more than 33 1/3%
    on their grant date, February 11, 2000; (b) in aggregate as to no more than
    66 2/3% on January 1, 2001; and (c) on January 1, 2002 as to 100% of all
    options which have not been previously exercised.

(2) There is no assurance the value realized will be at or near the value
    estimated by the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The current value is
    zero. The actual value, if any, will depend on the excess of the stock price
    over the exercise price on the date the option is exercised. In determining
    the "Grant Date Present Value," the following common assumptions were used:
    stock price volatility, 25.33%; risk-free interest rate, 6.81%; and an
    expected term before exercise of 10 years. Should Energy East's shares
    double in value over the ten-year option term (from $23.0625 per share to
    $46.1250 per share), shareholder value would increase an estimated
    $2,713,450,679, while the value of grants to individuals listed in the
    Option/SAR Grants table would increase an estimated $11,992,500 or 0.44% of
    the total gain realized by all shareholders.

*   Average of the salaries (not including amounts listed under "Bonus,"
    "Long-Term Compensation Awards, Options/SARs," "Long-Term Compensation
    Payouts, Long-Term Incentive Plan," and "All Other Compensation" in the
    Summary Compensation Table) for the five highest paid consecutive years
    during the last ten years of employment service. The average of the highest
    three years of salary within the last ten years of employment for the SERP
    was assumed to be 5% higher than each salary shown.

**  Maximum years of employment service for Retirement Benefit Plan and
    Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan purposes.

    The Retirement Benefit Plan provides retirement benefits for hourly and
salaried employees, including executive officers of Energy East and certain
subsidiaries, based on length of service and the average for the five highest
paid consecutive years during the last ten years of employment service. The
Retirement Benefit Plan is non-contributory and is funded under a trust
arrangement and an insurance contract. Amounts paid into the Retirement Benefit
Plan are computed on an actuarial basis. The Retirement Benefit Plan provides
for normal or early retirement benefits.

    The Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan provides that all salaried
employees, including executive officers of Energy East and certain subsidiaries,
shall receive the full benefits of the Retirement Benefit Plan without regard to
any limitations imposed by the federal tax law and by including certain amounts
deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Salaried Employees. In
addition, it provides that officers and certain other key employees of Energy
East and certain subsidiaries, who have at least ten years of service, who have
served in key capacities for at least five years and who retire at age 60 or
later, shall receive a total retirement benefit (including benefits under the
Retirement Benefit Plan and Social Security), based on years of service, of up
to 75% of the average of their highest three years of salary within the last ten
years of employment.

    Messrs. von Schack, Jasinski and German each have an agreement with Energy
East which provides that, for purposes of the Retirement Benefit Plan and the
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, they each will be credited with three
years of service for each year actually worked, so long as they each are
employed by Energy East or NYSEG for at least five years. If, however, they
retire from Energy East after their sixtieth birthday, they will be credited
with the maximum years of employment service for Retirement Benefit Plan and
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan purposes. Mr. von Schack was employed
commencing September 9, 1996, Mr. Jasinski was employed commencing April 29,
1998 and Mr. German was employed commencing December 5, 1994.

    Messrs. von Schack, Jasinski, German, Kump and Rude have 4, 3, 18, 14, and
24 credited years of service, respectively, under the Retirement Benefit Plan
and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.

EMPLOYMENT, CHANGE IN CONTROL AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS

    Energy East has entered into employment agreements with Messrs. von Schack,
Jasinski and German, each for a term ending May 18, 2004. Mr. von Schack's
agreement provides for his employment as Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer of Energy East, Mr. Jasinski's agreement provides for his employment as
Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Energy East and Mr. German's
agreement provides for his employment as Senior Vice President of Energy East.
Each agreement provides for automatic one-year extensions unless either party to
an agreement gives notice that such agreement is not to be extended. Each
agreement was unanimously approved by the board of directors and provides for,
among other things, a base salary of $700,000 for Mr. von Schack, $425,000 for
Mr. Jasinski and $425,000 for Mr. German, subject to increase by the board of
directors, and in the case of Mr. von Schack, the payment of the annual premium
on a life insurance policy (the "Life Insurance Policy") on his life and a
special bonus of $700,000 payable in 2001. The agreements also provide for
eligibility for participation in Energy East's or NYSEG's other compensation and
benefit plans and for certain payments in the event of the termination of
employment due to disability.

    The agreements provide that, if the officer's employment is terminated
either by Energy East without cause or by the officer for good reason, he will
receive a lump-sum payment equal to three times the sum of (i) his then-annual
base salary and (ii) the average of the three most recent awards earned under
the Annual Executive Incentive Plan. In the event of such termination, the
officer's life (other than the Life Insurance Policy), disability, accident and
health insurance benefits will continue for a period of thirty-six months, and,
in the case of Mr. von Schack, Energy East will make a lump-sum premium payment
so that no future premiums are due on the Life Insurance Policy. In addition,
the executive will receive an amount equal to all earned but unpaid awards under
the Annual Executive Incentive Plan and a pro rata portion of any award under
the Annual Executive Incentive Plan with respect to the year in which the
termination occurs, provided, however, that payments made pursuant to the
agreements will be reduced by any payments made under the Annual Executive
Incentive Plan in the event a change in control occurs during such year. Also,
in the event of such termination, the officer will be given additional age
credit and maximum service credit under the Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan and the present value of any Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
benefits will be paid in a lump sum to the officer, unless the officer elects to
receive such Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan benefits in the manner
provided in the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. In the event that any
payments made under the agreement or otherwise would subject the officer to
federal excise tax or interest or penalties with respect to such federal excise
tax, he will be entitled to be made whole for the payment of any such taxes,
interest or penalties.

    Messrs. Kump and Rude each have a severance agreement in order to provide
for certain payments if, generally, within two years following a change in
control of Energy East, the individual's employment is terminated either by his
employer without cause or by the individual for good reason. The severance
agreements have terms ending on December 31, 2002 with automatic one-year

extensions unless either party to an agreement gives notice that the agreement
is not to be extended. The benefits consist of a lump-sum severance payment
equal to two times the sum of (i) the individual's then-annual base salary, and
(ii) any award under the Annual Executive Incentive Plan with respect to the
year immediately preceding the year in which the termination occurs. In the
event of such termination, the individual's life, disability, accident and
health insurance benefits will continue for a period of twenty-four months and
the individual will receive an amount equal to all earned but unpaid awards
under the Annual Executive Incentive Plan and a pro rata portion of any award
under the Annual Executive Incentive Plan with respect to the year in which the
termination occurs, provided, however, that there shall be no duplication of
payments made pursuant to his agreement and the Annual Executive Incentive Plan.
Also, in the event of such termination, the individual will be given additional
age and service credit under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. In the
event that any payments made on account of a change in control of Energy East,
whether under the agreement or otherwise, would subject the individual to
federal excise tax or interest or penalties with respect to such federal excise
tax, the individual will be entitled to be made whole for the payment of any
such taxes, interest or penalties. Messrs. Kump and Rude also have entered into
Employee Invention and Confidentiality Agreements. The agreements provide for,
among other things, payments (up to one year's salary) and certain health
insurance premiums in the event that their employment is terminated whether
voluntarily or involuntarily, and the noncompetition and nonsolicitation
provisions of the agreement prevent them from obtaining other appropriate
employment, so long as they are not entitled to receive payments under their
severance agreements.

    In the event of a change in control of Energy East, participants in the
Annual Executive Incentive Plan will be paid an amount which includes all earned
but unpaid awards, a pro rata portion of any award with respect to the year in
which such change in control occurs and an additional payment at the end of the
year in which such change in control occurs, to the extent that the award earned
under the normal terms of the Annual Executive Incentive Plan exceeds the amount
paid upon such change in control. In addition, participants in the Long Term
Executive Incentive Share Plan will be paid an amount which includes (i) the
payment of awards for all cycles in progress at the time of such change in
control, computed and paid out in full (rather than pro rata) and based on the
assumption that Energy East's performance was at the 50th percentile; and
(ii) any amounts earned under the normal terms of the Long Term Executive
Incentive Share Plan through the end of each performance cycle, to the extent
those amounts exceed the amounts paid at the time of such change in control. All
change in control payments under the Long Term Executive Incentive Share Plan
are to be valued based on the change in control price of Energy East's common
stock. After a change in control of Energy East, officers and certain key
employees of Energy East and certain subsidiaries who qualify, and whose
employment is terminated at age 55 or later, other than for cause, shall receive
a total retirement benefit as determined under the Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan.

    The Executive Compensation and Succession Committee of the board of
directors in its discretion may take certain actions in order to preserve, in
the event of a change in control of Energy East, a participant's rights under an
award issued pursuant to the 1997 Stock Option Plan, the 2000 Stock Option Plan
or the Restricted Stock Plan.

    Grantor trusts have been established to provide for the payment of certain
employee and director benefits, including severance benefits that might become
payable after a change in control of Energy East.

DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION

    Directors of Energy East, other than officers of Energy East or officers of
any subsidiary of Energy East, receive an annual retainer of $22,000, plus
$1,000 for each directors' and committee meeting attended. The chairperson of
each standing committee receives additional compensation of $2,500 for serving
as chairperson of such committee. Under the terms of the Deferred Compensation
Plan for

Directors, directors can elect to defer a portion or all of their compensation.
Such deferred compensation, together with interest thereon, is payable in a lump
sum or over a period of years following retirement as a director.

    Pursuant to the Director Share Plan for Directors, persons who are
non-employee directors are eligible for certain benefits to be paid upon their
ceasing to serve as directors of Energy East. On each January 1, April 1,
July 1, and October 1, all non-employee directors receive 400 phantom shares
pursuant to the Director Share Plan. Phantom shares granted earn dividend
equivalents in the form of additional Phantom shares. Upon a director ceasing to
serve as a director of Energy East, cash payments representing the value of the
phantom shares held by the director are to be made to the director. The value of
the phantom shares is to be determined by multiplying the number of phantom
shares by the average of the daily closing prices of Energy East shares for the
five trading days preceding the date the director ceases to serve as a director.
Under the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan for the Director Share Plan, a
director may defer a portion or all of the cash payment to be made under the
Director Share Plan over a period of years following the director's ceasing to
serve as a director.

COMMITTEES

    Energy East's board of directors has an Audit Committee, a Nominating
Committee and an Executive Compensation and Succession Committee.

    The Nominating Committee, which consists of Richard Aurelio, Chairman, Lois
B. DeFleur and John M. Keeler, had six meetings in 2000. The Nominating
Committee is responsible for recommending to the board the slate of persons to
be nominated to the board, appointment of directors as members of committees of
the board and candidates to fill vacancies on the board of directors. The
committee makes recommendations to the board of directors regarding criteria for
nomination as a candidate to the board of directors. Shareholders wishing to
recommend candidates for consideration by the Nominating Committee should submit
to the Secretary of Energy East the name, a statement of qualifications and the
written consent of any candidate. Recommendations will be brought to the
attention of the Nominating Committee.

    The Executive Compensation and Succession Committee, which consists of
Joseph J. Castiglia, Chairman, Richard Aurelio and Ben E. Lynch, had three
meetings in 2000. That committee, among other things, recommends compensation
for officers, awards under the Annual Executive Incentive Plan and the Long-Term
Executive Incentive Share Plan, and candidates for election as officers.

REPORT OF AUDIT COMMITTEE

    The Audit Committee, which consists of Ben E. Lynch, Chairman, Lois B
