Prospectus/Proxy Statement

Proxy Statement

    The
boards of directors of First Virtual Communications, Inc. and CUseeMe Networks, Inc. have each unanimously approved a merger agreement which provides for the merger
of First Virtual Communications with CUseeMe, whereby CUseeMe will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Virtual Communications. 

    If
the merger is completed, each outstanding share of CUseeMe common stock will be converted into the right to receive approximately 1.254 shares of First Virtual Communications
common stock; 
provided, however,
 if First Virtual Communications would be required to issue more than 16,081,759 shares of its common stock, the
exchange ratio will be adjusted to equal the number obtained by dividing 16,081,759 by the number of shares of CUseeMe common stock outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the merger. 

    First
Virtual Communications expects to issue an aggregate of up to approximately 16,081,759 shares of First Virtual Communications common stock (and reserve approximately 3,757,198
shares to be issued upon exercise of CUseeMe outstanding options and a warrant that will be assumed by First Virtual Communications in the merger), based upon the number of shares of First Virtual
Communications common stock and CUseeMe common stock outstanding and issuable on March 31, 2001. Immediately after the merger, the former holders of CUseeMe common stock will hold
approximately 48% of the outstanding common stock and, on an as-if converted to common stock basis, 43.5% of the outstanding voting capital stock of First Virtual Communications. The current holders
of First Virtual Communications capital stock will hold approximately 52% of the outstanding common stock and, on an as-if converted to common stock basis, approximately 56.5% of the outstanding
voting capital stock of First Virtual Communications after the merger. 

    First
Virtual Communications common stock is listed on The Nasdaq National Market under the symbol FVCX. 

    This
document is both the prospectus of First Virtual Communications for the shares of First Virtual Communications common stock to be issued to CUseeMe stockholders and the joint
proxy statement of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe for their respective special meetings. 

    This
prospectus/joint proxy statement provides you with detailed information about the merger. THE PROPOSED MERGER IS A COMPLEX TRANSACTION AND YOU ARE STRONGLY
ENCOURAGED TO READ THE ENTIRE DOCUMENT CAREFULLY, INCLUDING "RISK FACTORS" COMMENCING ON PAGE 23. 

THE SHARES OF FIRST VIRTUAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN THE MERGER HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION OR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION NOR HAS THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS/JOINT PROXY STATEMENT. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE
CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER    

Q:

What is the proposed transaction?

A:

First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe will combine their operations pursuant to a merger.

Q:

As a holder of CUseeMe common stock, what will I receive in the merger?

A:

You will receive approximately 1.254 shares of First Virtual Communications common stock in exchange for each share of CUseeMe common stock that you own, subject to adjustment. No fractional shares will be issued. You will receive cash for any
fractional shares you would otherwise receive. For example, if you own 100 shares of CUseeMe common stock, you will receive 125 shares of First Virtual Communications common stock in exchange for your shares plus cash for the remaining fractional
amount.

Q:

Can the exchange ratio of 1.254 change?

A:

Yes. If First Virtual Communications would be required to issue more than 16,081,759 shares of its common stock at the closing of the merger, then the exchange ratio will be adjusted to equal the number obtained by dividing 16,081,759 by the number
of shares of CUseeMe common stock outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the merger.

Q:

As a First Virtual Communications stockholder, will I receive additional shares of First Virtual Communications common stock in the merger?

A:

No. You will continue to hold the same number of shares of First Virtual Communications common stock after the merger.

Q:

What are the tax consequences of the merger?

A:

The merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization for federal income tax purposes. Generally, CUseeMe stockholders will not recognize taxable gain or loss on the exchange of their stock, except that CUseeMe stockholders may be taxed on cash
received for a fractional share. First Virtual Communications stockholders will not recognize any taxable gain or loss in connection with the merger. Tax matters, however, are complicated and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on
the facts of your particular situation. First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe encourage you to contact your tax advisors to determine the tax consequences of the merger to you.

Q:

Will my rights as a CUseeMe stockholder change as a result of the merger?

A:

Yes. Although Delaware law governs First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe, CUseeMe stockholder rights are governed by the CUseeMe certificate of incorporation and bylaws. First Virtual Communications stockholder rights are governed by the First
Virtual Communications certificate of incorporation and bylaws. After the merger, CUseeMe stockholders who receive First Virtual Communications stock in the merger will become stockholders of First Virtual Communications and, therefore, their rights
will be governed by Delaware law and the First Virtual Communications certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

Q:

If I am not going to attend the stockholder meeting, should I return my proxy card?

A:

Yes. Please fill out and sign your proxy card and mail it to us in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible. Returning your proxy card ensures that your shares will be represented at the special meeting.

Q:

What do I do if I want to change my vote after I have mailed by proxy card?

A:

Send in a later-dated, signed proxy card to your company's corporate secretary before the special meeting or attend the special meeting in person and vote.

Q:

What do I need to do now?

A:

After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this document and completing and signing your proxy card, mail your signed proxy card in the enclosed envelope as soon as possible so that your shares may be represented at your
meeting. In order to assure that your vote is obtained, please give your proxy as instructed on your proxy card even if you currently plan to attend the meeting in person. The board of directors of each of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe
recommends that its stockholders vote in favor of the merger and related transactions.

Q:

If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote my shares for me?

A:

If you do not provide your broker with instructions on how to vote your "street name" shares, your broker will not be permitted to vote them on the merger, the merger agreement, the issuance of shares or the amendment to First Virtual Communications'
certificate of incorporation, as applicable. You should therefore be sure to provide your broker with instructions on how to vote your shares. If you do not give voting instructions to your broker, you will not be counted as voting for purposes of
the merger, the merger agreement, the issuance of shares or the amendment to First Virtual Communications' certificate of incorporation, as applicable, unless you appear in person and vote at your meeting.

Q:

Should I send in my stock certificates now?

A:

No. After the merger is completed, First Virtual Communications will send CUseeMe stockholders written instructions for exchanging their stock certificates. First Virtual Communications stockholders will keep their current certificates.

Q:

When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A:

We are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. Assuming that both First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe satisfy or waive all of the conditions to closing contained in the merger agreement, First Virtual Communications and
CUseeMe anticipate that the merger will occur as soon as practicable after approval of the merger and related transactions at the special meetings.

Q:

Whom should stockholders call with additional questions?

A:

First Virtual Communications stockholders who have questions about the merger should call Randy Acres, Vice President, Finance and  Chief Financial Officer of First Virtual Communications, at (408) 567-7200. CUseeMe stockholders who have
questions about the merger should call Raychel Marcotte, Investor Relations, at CUseeMe, at (603) 886-9050.

the
combined company's ability to provide a complete end-to-end software rich media communications solution with flexible
web-based user interface and seamless delivery of services over any network technology as a result of operational efficiencies and the combination of each company's complementary products
and technologies; 

the
highly competitive nature of the market for rich media and broadband services, making it more difficult for First Virtual Communications to succeed as
an independent company;

concerning the business, financial condition, operations, competitive position and prospects of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe, both
individually and on a combined basis;

the
possibility, as an alternative to the merger, of seeking to acquire another company. 

CUseeMe's Reasons for the Merger

relatively small independent company;

broader, more integrated product offerings; 

operational
efficiencies and compatibility of CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications, based on complementary technologies, business philosophies and
strategies;

potential for the combined company to deliver a broader and more integrated total solution product offering;

COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA    

    The following table provides historical per share data of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe and combined per share data on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to the merger as a purchase of CUseeMe by First Virtual Communications, assuming the merger had been completed as of the beginning of the periods indicated. This data should be read in
conjunction with the selected financial data, the unaudited pro forma combined financial information and the separate historical financial statements of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe, and
notes, included elsewhere in this prospectus/joint proxy statement. The pro forma combined financial data is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have been achieved had the
merger been completed as of the beginning of the periods indicated nor is this data necessarily indicative of future financial condition or results of operations. 

    An
exchange ratio of 1.254 shares of First Virtual Communications common stock for each share of CUseeMe common stock is used in computing the pro forma combined and equivalent pro
forma combined per share data. 

    The
combined pro forma information in the following table was prepared using a number of assumptions. The value of First Virtual Communications shares to be issued for outstanding
CUseeMe shares was assumed to be $18.4 million, based on 12.4 million CUseeMe shares outstanding and the conversion value of a CUseeMe share at the time of execution of the merger
agreement on March 22, 2001. The value was increased by approximately $0.5 million for the value of all outstanding CUseeMe options and a warrant and estimated transaction costs of
$3.65 million, giving a total purchase price of $22.6 million.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

    The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information combines First Virtual Communications' historical results for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2000 with CUseeMe's historical results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000, giving effect to the merger as if it had occurred as of January 1, 2000
for statement of operations purposes and as of December 31, 2000 for balance sheet purposes. This unaudited pro forma combined condensed information, while helpful in illustrating the financial
characteristics of the combined company under one set of assumptions, does not attempt to predict or suggest future results. It also does not necessarily reflect what the historical results of the
combined company would have been had First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe actually been combined during the periods presented, or results that may be achieved in the future. The unaudited pro
forma combined condensed financial statements, including the notes thereto, are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated
financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2000 of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe included elsewhere in this prospectus/joint proxy statement. 

    The
allocation of the purchase price will be finalized following consummation of the merger and finalization of independent appraisals to determine the fair value of tangible and
identifiable intangible assets, including in-process research and development. Based on an analysis of fair market value, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets on
CUseeMe's balance sheet will then be allocated to identifiable intangible assets and the remaining balance to goodwill. First Virtual Communications is currently gathering the data necessary for
determining the fair market value of identifiable intangible assets, including in-process research and development. For both in-process and developed technology, First Virtual
Communications' data gathering efforts are focused on determining CUseeMe's forecasted revenues and costs as well as their stage of completion or remaining product life by individual project or
product. 

    The
total estimated amount of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets is $2.4 million with an average useful life of approximately three years. Because the valuation
analysis has not been completed, the actual amount of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, and the related average useful life, could vary from these assumptions.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

NOTE 1THE TRANSACTION  

    On March 22, 2001, First Virtual Communications signed a definitive agreement to acquire CUseeMe in a purchase transaction. Under the merger agreement,
First Virtual Communications will issue approximately 15.5 million shares of its common stock and 3.8 million shares of its common stock upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants
in exchange for the outstanding common shares, options and warrant of CUseeMe. This data is based upon CUseeMe outstanding shares on the date the merger agreement was signed. The exact number of
shares to be issued and the number of options and
warrants to be assumed by First Virtual Communications for the purchase of CUseeMe will depend upon the number of shares, options and warrants of CUseeMe outstanding at the close of the merger.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, First Virtual Communications will issue a maximum of 16,081,759 shares of First Virtual Communications common stock for the outstanding shares of CUseeMe
common stock on the closing of the merger. Therefore, the final purchase price will be different from the amounts presented in these unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements. 

    The
purchase price of the CUseeMe acquisition is estimated to be approximately $22.6 million, which has been determined as follows (in thousands):

18,447

Total purchase price

$

22,645

    Common
stock has been valued using an average price of First Virtual Communications common stock for three days before and after the announcement of the merger. The fair value of
options assumed was determined using the Black-Scholes method. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 44 ("FIN 44"), "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensationan Interpretation of APB 25," the intrinsic value of unvested options of CUseeMe has been allocated to deferred stock compensation. Deferred stock compensation will be
amortized over the estimated vesting period of the related options using an accelerated method. For purposes of preparing the pro forma financial statements, First Virtual Communications estimated the
intrinsic value of the unvested options using the average stock price used for valuing the common stock and this amount was not material. Upon consummation of the merger, First Virtual Communications
will determine the final amount of deferred compensation based on the closing price of its common stock on the date of consummation of the merger, and, therefore, the final amount of deferred stock
will be different from the amounts presented in these unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements. 

    The
purchase price for pro forma purposes has been allocated to tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the fair value of CUseeMe's assets and liabilities. First
Virtual Communications' management has engaged an independent appraiser to value the intangible assets, including amounts allocable to CUseeMe's in-process research and development. The
in-process research and development will be expensed immediately. For the purposes of the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet,
the acquired in-process research and development has been assigned a value of approximately $500,000, based on management estimates. The in-process research and development charge of
$500,000 is not reflected in the unaudited proforma combined condensed statement of operations. The exact amount of the in-process research and development charge will be determined upon
completion of the independent appraisal and may be different from the amount presented in these unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements. The in-process research and
development charge relates to CUseeMe's products in development for which technological feasibility has not been established. 

    The allocation of the purchase price is estimated as follows (in thousands):

    The

operations reflect the acquisition of CUseeMe as if such acquisition had occurred at January 1, 2000. 

NOTE 2UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED BALANCE SHEET  

    The following adjustments were applied to the historical balance sheets of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe at December 31, 2000 to arrive at
the unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet: 

(a)
To
record estimated value of intangible assets, including goodwill. 
(b)
To
record the estimated transaction costs of $3.65 million. Estimated transaction costs include all costs directly incurred as a result of the transaction including, but not limited
to, fees for the financial advisors, accountants, and attorneys and other related costs. 
(c)
To
reflect the estimated one time charge for acquired in-process research and development of approximately $500,000 and to eliminate the historical accumulated deficit,
common stock, additional paid-in capital and accumulated other comprehensive loss of CUseeMe as a result of the purchase transaction. 
(d)
To
record the increase in stockholders' equity of First Virtual Communications as a result of the issuance of common stock and fair value of the First Virtual Communications options
and a warrant issued in exchange for options and a warrant held by CUseeMe option and warrant holders. 
(e)
To
adjust deferred revenue to its estimated fair value. 

NOTE 3UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS  

    The
following adjustments were applied to the historical statements of operations for First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe for the year ended December 31, 2000 to arrive at
the unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations as though the acquisition took place on January 1, 2000: 

(a)
Adjustment
to recognize amortization of identified intangibles arising from the merger over their average estimated useful lives of three years. 

NOTE 4UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED NET LOSS PER SHARE  

    Shares used in the pro forma per share calculation reflect the addition of approximately 15.5 million shares of First Virtual Communications voting
common stock estimated to be issued to stockholders of CUseeMe as if they were outstanding from January 1, 2000. Pro forma basic and diluted weighted-average shares exclude convertible
preferred stock, unvested restricted common stock, employee stock options and warrants outstanding in each period because they are anti-dilutive. 

RISK FACTORS    

The merger involves a high degree of risk. Also, by voting in favor of the merger, CUseeMe's stockholders will be choosing to invest in
First Virtual Communications common stock. An investment in First Virtual Communications common stock involves a high degree of risk. First Virtual Communications' and CUseeMe's stockholders should
carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating whether to approve the proposals. You should consider these factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this
prospectus/joint proxy statement and the appendices and exhibits to this prospectus/joint proxy statement. If any of the following risks actually occur, the business, financial condition and results
of operations of either or both of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe may be seriously harmed. In this case, the trading price of First Virtual Communications common stock may decline, and
CUseeMe stockholders may lose all or part of their investment. Please bear in mind that those risks applicable to First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe, as separate companies, will be risks of the
combined company.

Risks Related to the Merger  

Integration of the operations of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe may be difficult, expensive and lead to adverse effects.  

    The realization of the anticipated benefits of the merger will depend in part on whether First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe can integrate their
operations in an efficient and effective manner. Integrating First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe will be a complex, time consuming and expensive process. Successful integration will require
combining the companies' respective: 


products
and services;


sales
and marketing groups;


information
and software systems;


hiring
and training practices;


strategic
goals;


management
and other employees;


boards
of directors;


business
development efforts; and


geographically
separate facilities. 

    First
Virtual Communications and CUseeMe may not accomplish this integration smoothly or successfully and the business synergies may not develop as quickly or to the extent currently
expected. The diversion of the attention of management to the integration effort and any difficulties encountered in combining operations could cause the interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the
activities of either or both of the companies' businesses. Furthermore, employee morale may suffer, and the combined company may have difficulties retaining key employees. If the combined company is
unable to address any of the foregoing risks, it could materially harm the combined company's business and impair the value of First Virtual Communications common stock after the merger. 

The combined company could face many difficulties in managing a larger company.  

    In deciding whether to authorize the proposed merger, you should bear in mind that the larger, combined company will create new challenges for existing
management. If the combined company fails to meet those challenges, the post-merger market price of shares of First Virtual Communications common stock may decline. After the merger, the
combined company will have a work force larger than the work force of each of the two companies prior to the merger, and a greater international 

presence. This growth could strain management control systems and resources, including decision support, accounting and management information systems. The combined company will need to improve
financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures to effectively manage employees and facilities. 

The value of the merger consideration will fluctuate because the exchange ratio is subject to adjustment and because of fluctuations in the price of First Virtual
Communications common stock.  

    At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of CUseeMe common stock will be exchanged for approximately 1.254 shares of First Virtual
Communications common stock, up to a maximum of 16,081,759 shares. This exchange ratio is subject to change. If First Virtual Communications would be required to issue more than 16,081,759 shares of
common stock in the merger, then the exchange ratio will be the number obtained by dividing 16,081,759 by the number of shares of CUseeMe common stock outstanding immediately prior to the closing of
the merger. Neither First Virtual Communications nor CUseeMe intends to obtain an updated fairness opinion from its financial advisor prior to the completion of the merger. The market prices of First
Virtual Communications common stock and CUseeMe common stock cannot be guaranteed or predicted. Market prices for First Virtual Communications common stock have fluctuated since the merger agreement
was signed on March 22, 2001. Stock price variations could be the result of changes in the business, operations or prospects of First Virtual Communications, CUseeMe or the combined company,
market assessments of the likelihood that the merger will be consummated within the anticipated time, general market and economic conditions and other factors both within and beyond the control of
First Virtual Communications or CUseeMe. First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe expect further fluctuations through the closing date. Recent market prices of First Virtual Communications common
stock and CUseeMe common stock are set forth on pages 10 and 11. First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe encourage CUseeMe stockholders to obtain current market quotations for First Virtual
Communications common stock and CUseeMe common stock. Due to the market fluctuations and the possibility that the exchange ratio will be adjusted, CUseeMe stockholders will not know the actual market
value of First Virtual Communications common stock to be received in connection with the merger when they vote upon the merger proposal. 

If the costs associated with the merger exceed the benefits realized, the combined company may experience adverse financial results, including increased losses.  

    First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe will incur significant transaction costs as a result of the merger, including investment banking, legal and accounting
fees, that may exceed the parties' current estimates. In addition, First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe expect that the combined company will incur consolidation and integration expenses which
First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe
cannot accurately estimate at this time. First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe expect that the combined company will charge consolidation and integration expenses to operations in fiscal 2001.
Actual transaction costs may substantially exceed the combined company's estimates and may affect its financial condition and operating results negatively. 

    If
the benefits of the merger do not exceed the costs associated with the merger, including any dilution to First Virtual Communications' stockholders resulting from the issuance of
shares in connection with the merger, the combined company's financial results could be adversely affected. 

Sales of substantial amounts of First Virtual Communications common stock in the public market after the proposed merger could materially adversely affect the market price of
First Virtual Communications common stock.  

    Based on the number of shares of CUseeMe common stock outstanding on the date of this prospectus/joint proxy statement, at the closing of the merger First
Virtual Communications will issue 

up to approximately 16,081,759 shares of First Virtual Communications common stock to CUseeMe stockholders in the merger. An additional approximately 3,757,198 shares will be issuable upon the
exercise of options and a warrant held by CUseeMe's option holders and warrant holders prior to the closing of the merger. All of these shares to be issued in the merger will be freely tradable
immediately following the merger, subject to certain vesting schedules and restrictions on affiliates of CUseeMe. The sale of substantial amounts of these shares (including shares issued upon exercise
of outstanding options) may cause substantial fluctuations in the price of the First Virtual Communications common stock. In addition, sales of a substantial number of shares of the First Virtual
Communications common stock within a short period of time could cause the First Virtual Communications stock price to fall. The sale of these shares also could impair the combined company's ability to
raise capital through the sale of additional stock. 

Several officers and directors of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe have conflicts of interest or commitments that may have influenced them to support or approve the
merger agreement and the merger.  

    Killko Caballero, the chairman, chief executive officer and president of CUseeMe, has entered into an employment agreement with First Virtual Communications to
serve as chief executive officer and president of the combined company effective upon completion of the merger. Under the terms of the employment agreement, Mr. Caballero is entitled to a
salary increase and other benefits, including
severance and a guaranteed bonus. Other officers of CUseeMe also have entered into employment agreements with First Virtual Communications that will become effective upon completion of the merger.
Ralph Ungermann, the chairman, chief executive officer and president of First Virtual Communications, will remain chairman of the board of directors of the combined company. A number of directors of
First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe will remain or be named directors of the combined company. As a result of these interests, these directors and officers of First Virtual Communications and
CUseeMe may have been more influenced to support or recommend the merger than if they did not have these interests. You should consider these circumstances and read more about these interests under
"
THE MERGER
Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger" on page 55. 

The merger may result in a loss of customers, suppliers and employees.  

    Some customers of First Virtual Communications or CUseeMe may seek alternative sources of products or services after the merger due to, among other reasons, a
desire not to do business with the combined company. First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe anticipate that the combined company could experience some customer attrition after the merger.
Difficulties in combining operations can also result in the loss of key employees or suppliers. Steps by management to counter potential customer, supplier and employee attrition may not be effective.
Failure by management to control attrition may adversely affect the combined company's future growth and profitability. 

Risks Related to Both First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe  

First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe each have a history of operating losses and the combined company will incur losses in the future. The combined company may never
generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability.

    Each
of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe has incurred operating losses in each quarter since it commenced operations. The combined company expects to devote substantial
resources to expand its research and development and sales and marketing activities. As a result, the combined company expects that it will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable
future. 

    First
Virtual Communications' revenues decreased from $45.7 million in 1999 to $40.0 million in 2000, while its net loss increased from $14.3 million for 1999 to
$18.8 million for 2000. At 

December 31, 2000, First Virtual Communications had an accumulated deficit of $55.7 million. Revenues for First Virtual Communications for the first quarter ended March 31, 2001
were $4.4 million, compared with revenues of $10.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2000. The net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 was $8.3 million,
compared with a loss of $4 million in the first quarter of 2000. CUseeMe's total revenues increased only slightly, from $12.0 million for 1999 to $12.1 million for 2000, while
CUseeMe's net loss increased from $4.8 million for 1999 to $10.2 million for 2000. At December 31, 2000, CUseeMe had an accumulated deficit of $43.9 million. 

The combined company's quarterly results are expected to fluctuate and may cause the price of the combined company's common stock to fall.  

    First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe have experienced in the past, and the combined company is likely to experience, fluctuations in revenues, gross
margins and operating results. Various factors could contribute to the fluctuations in revenues, gross margins and operating results, including the combined company's: 


success
in developing its rich media business and the CUseeMe Conference Server and in developing, introducing and shipping new products and product
enhancements;


success
in accurately forecasting demand for new orders, which may have short lead-times before required shipment, product mix, percentage of
revenues derived from original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, versus distributors or resellers;


new
product introductions and price reductions by its competitors;


use
of OEMs, distributors, resellers, and other third parties;


ability
to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel;


research
and development efforts and success; and


selling,
general and administrative expenditures. 

    Additionally,
the combined company's quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors outside of its control. Further, a significant portion of the
combined company's expenses will be fixed. The combined company expects that operating expenses will increase in the future to fund expanded operations. To the extent these increased expenses are not
accompanied by an increase in revenues or gross margin, the combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. Due to all the foregoing
factors, it is likely that in some future quarter, as in past quarters, the combined company's results of operations will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, resulting
in a negative impact on First Virtual Communications' common stock price. 

The combined company's success depends in part on the market's acceptance of rich media, broadband video services and the CUseeMe Conference Server.  

    The combined company's success depends in part on the market's acceptance of rich media, broadband video services and the CUseeMe Conference Server. Potential
end-users must accept video applications as a viable alternative to face-to-face meetings and conventional classroom based learning. New applications, such as the
use of video in marketing, selling and manufacturing, are still in the development stage. First Virtual Communications has only recently entered into its first contracts with telecommunications
service providers to provide broadband video services and does not expect any material revenues from these services to be generated until the second half of 2001. If rich media and broadband video
services fail to achieve broad commercial acceptance or if such acceptance is delayed, the combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely
affected. The combined company anticipates that revenue and growth in the foreseeable future will come from the sale of the CUseeMe Conference Server and related products and services. 

Broad market acceptance of the CUseeMe Conference Server, therefore, is important to the combined company's operating success. 

The combined company's reliance on third party manufacturers and suppliers could adversely affect the combined company's business.  

    First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe each currently outsources the manufacturing of their respective products and purchase critical components for their
respective products from single suppliers. The combined company will rely on several vendors to manufacture certain of its products. If one or more of these manufacturers experiences quality control
or other problems, product shipments by the combined company may be delayed. Neither First Virtual Communications nor CUseeMe has long-term agreements with suppliers, and their respective
current suppliers are not obligated to provide components to First Virtual Communications, CUseeMe or the combined company for any specific period, in any specific quantity or at any specific price,
except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. Qualifying additional suppliers is a time consuming and expensive process, and there is a greater likelihood of problems arising during a
transition period to a new supplier. If the combined company is required to find replacements for its manufacturers or suppliers, this could result in short-term cost increases and delays
in delivery, which could have a material adverse effect on the combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations. The combined company may not be able to continue to negotiate
arrangements with First Virtual Communications' or CUseeMe's existing, or any future, manufacturers or suppliers on terms favorable to the combined company. Existing manufacturers and suppliers may
not continue to meet the combined company's requirements for products and components. 

The combined company's success depends on the performance of participants in the combined company's distribution channels.  

    Each of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe currently sells its products through OEMs, distributors and resellers. The combined company's future
performance will depend in large part on sales of its products through these distribution relationships, such as SBC Communications, Verizon and other key partners. Past performance by First Virtual
Communications and CUseeMe should not be considered a reliable indicator of the future performance. Agreements with distribution partners generally provide for discounts based on First Virtual
Communications' or CUseeMe's list prices, and do not require minimum purchases or restrict development or distribution of competitive products. Therefore, entities that distribute First Virtual
Communications' or CUseeMe's products may compete with either First Virtual Communications, CUseeMe or the combined company. In addition, OEMs, distributors and resellers may not dedicate sufficient
resources or give sufficient priority to selling the combined company's products. Each of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe additionally depends on its respective distribution relationships for
most customer support, and expends significant resources to train its respective OEMs, distributors and resellers to support customers. These entities can generally terminate the distribution
relationship upon 30 days notice for a material breach. The loss of a distribution relationship or a decline in the efforts of a material distributor, or loss in business or cancellation of
orders from, significant changes in scheduled deliveries to, or decreases in the prices of products sold to, any of these distribution relationships, could have a material adverse effect on the
combined company's results of operations. 

The combined company expects to rely on a limited number of large projects for its revenues in the future. Losing one or more of these customers may adversely affect the
combined company's future revenue growth.  

    First Virtual Communications depends on a limited number of large end-user projects for a majority of its revenues, which has resulted in, and may
in the future result in, significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues. The combined company expects that revenues from the sale of products to large 

end-users will continue to account for a significant percentage of its revenues in any particular quarter for the foreseeable future. Additionally, a significant portion of First Virtual
Communications' sales of video networking products has historically been to government-related agencies, such as military and educational institutions, or third parties using First Virtual
Communications' products on behalf of government agencies. Such government-related customers are often subject to budgetary pressures and may from time to time reduce their expenditures and/or cancel
orders. The loss of any major customer, or any reduction or delay in orders by such customer, or the failure of the combined company or its distribution partners to market the combined company's
products successfully to new customers could have a material adverse effect on the combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Because sales of the combined company's products require a lengthy sales effort and implementation cycle, revenues may be unpredictable and the combined company's business may
be harmed.  

    Sales of First Virtual Communications' and CUseeMe's products has required and will continue to require an extended sales effort. First Virtual Communications
and CUseeMe must first train the entities with which it has distribution relationships to market their products. The period from an initial sales call to an end-user agreement typically
ranges from six to twelve months, and can be longer. Therefore, the timing of revenues may be unpredictable. A lengthy delay in recognizing revenue could have a material adverse effect on the combined
company's business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Rapid technological change and evolving industry standards and regulations may impair the combined company's ability to develop and market its services.  

    Rapid technological change and evolving industry standards characterize the market for First Virtual Communications' and CUseeMe's respective products. The
combined company's success will depend, in part, on its ability to maintain technological leadership and enhance and expand First Virtual Communications' and CUseeMe's existing product and services
offerings. The combined company's success also will depend in part upon its ability and the ability of its strategic partners to comply with evolving industry standards. First Virtual Communications'
and CUseeMe's products must meet a significant number of domestic and international video, voice and data communications regulations and standards, some of which are evolving as new technologies are
deployed. First Virtual Communications' and CUseeMe's products are currently in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. However, as standards evolve, the combined company will be required
to modify its products, or develop and support new versions of its products. In addition, telecommunications service providers require that equipment connected to their networks comply with their own
standards, which may vary from industry standards. 

    The
combined company's ability to compete successfully also is dependent upon the continued compatibility and interoperability of its products with products and architectures offered
by various vendors. The combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected if it were unable in a timely manner to comply with evolving
industry standards or to address compatibility issues. In addition, from time to time, the combined company may announce new products, capabilities or technologies that have the potential to replace
or shorten the life cycle of First Virtual Communications' and CUseeMe's existing product offerings. The announcement of product enhancements or new product or service offerings could cause customers
to defer purchasing the combined company's products. In addition, First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe have each experienced delays in the introduction of new products in the past and the combined
company may experience such delays in the future. The failure of the combined company to introduce successfully new products, product enhancements or services, or customer delays in purchasing
products in anticipation of new product introductions or because of changes in industry 

standards, could have a material adverse effect on the combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The combined company will face potential volatility in its common stock price.  

    The market price of each of First Virtual Communications common stock and CUseeMe common stock has been extremely volatile in the past and the First Virtual
Communications common stock price after
the merger, like that of other technology companies, may be subject to significant volatility, depending upon many factors, including: 


fluctuations
in the combined company's financial results;


announcements
regarding the acquisition of technologies, products or companies, including the merger;


technological
innovations or new commercial products developed by the combined company or its competitors;


regulatory
changes and developments that affect the combined company's business;


developments
or disputes concerning patent and proprietary rights and other legal matters;


establishment
of additional corporate partnerships or licensing arrangements;


issuance
of new or changed stock market analyst reports and/or recommendations; and


economic
and other external factors. 

    One
or more of these factors could significantly harm the combined company's business and decrease the price of its common stock in the public market. Past financial performance of
First Virtual Communications or CUseeMe should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future
periods. 

If the combined company's common stock price continues to trade below $1.00 per share, the combined company will face potential delisting from The Nasdaq National
Market. If delisting occurs, the market price and market liquidity of the combined company's common stock may be adversely affected.  

    First Virtual Communications' common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq National Market, and the combined company's common stock will continue to be
traded on The Nasdaq National Market after the merger. Pursuant to Nasdaq rules, Nasdaq may commence procedures to delist any shares trading below a $1.00 per share on The Nasdaq National
Market for a period of 30 trading days. First Virtual Communications' common stock and CUseeMe's common stock are each currently trading below $1.00 per share. If the combined company's common
stock price trades below a $1.00 per share, the combined company will face potential delisting from The Nasdaq National Market. 

    If
delisting occurs, the trading of the combined company's common stock is likely to be conducted on the OTC Bulletin Board which may have an adverse affect on the market price of the
common stock and on the ability of stockholders and investors to buy and sell the common stock. 

The combined company will face intense competition from other industry participants and may not be able to compete effectively.  

    The market for multimedia group communications and networking products and services is extremely competitive. Because the barriers to entry in the market are
relatively low and the potential market is large, the combined company expects continued growth in the industry and the entrance of new competitors in the future. Many of First Virtual Communications'
and CUseeMe's current and potential competitors, particularly Microsoft, PictureTel and Ezenia!, have significantly longer operating histories and significantly greater managerial, financial,
marketing, technical and other competitive resources, as well as greater name recognition, than the combined company will have. As a result, these 

companies may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their
conferencing products and services. In addition, to the extent that competitors choose to bundle competing multimedia conferencing applications with other products, the demand for the combined
company's products and services might be substantially reduced. 

    As
a result, the combined company may not be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors in the multimedia group communications products and services market. Each of
First
Virtual Communications and CUseeMe believes that the combined company's ability to compete successfully in this market will depend on a number of factors both within and outside its control,
including: 


the
timing of the introduction of new software products and services by the combined company and its competitors;


the
pricing policies of the combined company's competitors and suppliers;


the
combined company's ability to hire and retain highly qualified employees;


continued
investment in research and development;


continued
investment in sales and marketing; and


the
adoption and evolution of industry standards. 

The combined company's business may be harmed if it is unable to protect its proprietary rights.  

    The combined company's success and ability to compete in the video networking industry depends, in part, upon its ability to protect its proprietary
technology. The combined company may be unable to deter misappropriation of its proprietary technology, detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce its intellectual property rights.
In addition, the combined company's competitors could, without violating its proprietary rights, develop technologies that are as good or better than its technology. The development of alternative
technologies by third parties could adversely affect the competitiveness of the combined company's products. 

    First
Virtual Communications does not rely on patent protection for, and does not hold, any patents relating to its products, although it has filed one patent application related to
its recently developed video services technology. CUseeMe has filed three patent applications related to its videoconferencing technology none of these applications may issue, however, and even if
issued by the United States
Patent and Trademark Office, they may not give the combined company an advantage over competitors. The combined company's adherence to industry-wide technical standards and specifications
may limit its opportunities to provide proprietary product features. Each of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe currently licenses certain technology from third parties, and plan that the
combined company will continue to do so in the future. The commercial success of the combined company will depend, in part, on its ability to continue to obtain licenses to third-party technology for
use in its products. 

    First
Virtual Communications and CUseeMe each relies upon a combination of trade secret, copyright and trademark laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary
rights in their respective products. Each also enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with its employees and enters into non-disclosure agreements with its
suppliers, distributors and customers to limit access to and disclosure of its proprietary information. Each of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe plan that the combined company will continue to
enter into these agreements. 

    However,
these statutory and contractual arrangements may not be sufficient to deter misappropriation of the combined company's proprietary technologies. In addition, independent
third parties may develop similar or superior technologies to those of the combined company. Furthermore, 

the laws of some foreign countries do not provide the same degree of protection of the combined company's proprietary information as do the laws of the United States. CUseeMe has delivered technical
data and information relating to CUseeMe Pro and CUseeMe Conference Server to the United States government, and as a result, the United States government may have unlimited rights to use the technical
data and information or to authorize others to use the technical data and information. 

Claims by third parties that the combined company infringes their proprietary technology could prevent the combined company from offering its products or otherwise hurt its
business and financial condition.  

    The commercial success of the combined company also will depend, in part, on the combined company not breaching the combined company's current and future
licenses of third-party technology used in certain of its products. The combined company is, however, subject to the risk of litigation alleging infringement of third party intellectual property
rights from the combined company's licensed and proprietary technology. A number of companies have developed technologies or received patents on technologies that may be related to or be competitive
with the combined company's technologies. Neither First Virtual Communications nor CUseeMe has conducted a patent search relating to the technology used in its respective products. In addition, since
patent applications in the United States are not publicly disclosed until the patent issues, applications may have been filed which, if issued as patents, would relate to the combined company's
products. The combined company's lack of patents
may inhibit the combined company's ability to negotiate or obtain licenses from or oppose patents of third parties, if necessary. 

    Given
the rapid development of technology in the video networking industry, it is possible that the combined company's existing or future products may in the future infringe upon the
existing or future proprietary rights of others. The combined company is subject to the risk of litigation alleging infringement of third party intellectual property rights by the combined company.
The combined company could incur substantial costs in defending itself and its customers against any such claims, regardless of the merits of such claims. The combined company may also be required by
contract or by statutory implied warranties to indemnify its distribution partners and end-users against third-party infringement claims. Parties making infringement claims against the
combined company may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block the combined company's ability to sell its products in the United States and abroad, and could
result in an award of substantial damages. In the event of a successful claim of infringement, the combined company, its customers and end-users may be required to obtain one or more
licenses from third parties. The combined company, or its customers, may not be able to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost, or at all. The defense of any lawsuit could
result in time-consuming and expensive litigation, damages, license fees, royalty payments and restrictions on the combined company's ability to sell its products, any of which could have
a material adverse effect on the combined company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

The combined company will be dependent on key personnel and must hire and retain skilled personnel.  

    The combined company's success is significantly dependent on the contributions of a number of its key personnel. The combined company's success depends to a
significant degree on the services of Ralph Ungermann, who will serve as chairman of the board of directors, and Killko Caballero, who will serve as chief executive officer and president. The loss of
the services of either of these individuals or any of the combined company's key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the combined company. In addition, the integration of the separate
businesses of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe and the combined company's potential growth and expansion are expected to place increased demands on the combined company's management skills and
resources. 

    Each of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe believes that the combined company's future success also will depend upon its ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled
technical, managerial, manufacturing, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense. The combined company may not be able to anticipate accurately, or to obtain, the
personnel that it may require in the future. 

The combined company's executive officers, directors and its affiliates will own a significant percentage of First Virtual Communications common stock after the merger.  

    After the merger, the combined company's executive officers, directors and their affiliates will beneficially own approximately 8,583,896 shares, or 23.2%, of
the outstanding shares of First Virtual Communications common stock. As a result, these stockholders may have the ability to effectively control the combined company and direct its affairs and
business, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change
in control of the combined company, and making certain transactions more difficult or impossible absent the support of these stockholders, including proxy contests, mergers involving the combined
company, tender offers, open-market purchase programs or other purchases of common stock that could give stockholders of the combined company the opportunity to realize a premium over the
then prevailing market price for shares of First Virtual Communications common stock. 

The combined company's inability to secure additional funding could adversely effect its business.  

    In order to meet the combined company's anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements, the combined company may need to raise additional
funds through the issuance of equity securities in the future. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of the stockholders of the combined
company will be reduced, stockholders may experience additional dilution, or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of the combined
company's common stock. Additional financing may not be available when needed or on terms favorable to the combined company, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on
acceptable terms, the combined company may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of its development programs for its products or services, and may be unable to take advantage of future
opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, which could have a material adverse effect on the combined company's business, financial condition or operating results. 

The combined company faces additional risks from its international operations.  

    The combined company's international business will involve a number of risks that could hurt its operating results or contribute to fluctuations in those
results. First Virtual Communications' revenue from international sales represented 12% of its total revenue in 2000 and 14% of its total revenue in 1999. Although previous international sales by
CUseeMe may not be indicative of future sales, CUseeMe's revenue from international sales represented 41% of its total revenue in 2000, of which
10% was due to a single larger order, and 24% of its total revenue in 1999. The combined company intends to seek opportunities to expand its product and service offerings into additional international
markets, although the combined company may not succeed in developing localized versions of its products for new international markets or in marketing or distributing products and services in those
markets. 

    The
majority of First Virtual Communications' and CUseeMe's international sales are currently denominated in U.S. dollars. However, it is possible that a significantly higher level of
future sales of the combined company may be denominated in foreign currencies. To the extent that the combined company's sales are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, fluctuations in
exchange rates may render the combined company's products less competitive relative to local product offerings or 

result in foreign exchange losses. Neither First Virtual Communications nor CUseeMe has experience in implementing hedging techniques that might minimize the combined company's risks from exchange
rate fluctuations. 

    The
combined company's international business also will involve a number of other difficulties and risks, including risks associated with: 


changing
economic conditions in foreign countries;


export
restrictions and export controls relating to the combined company's technology;


compliance
with existing and changing regulatory requirements;


tariffs
and other trade barriers;


difficulties
in staffing and managing international operations;


longer
payment cycles and problems in collecting accounts receivable;


software
piracy;


political
instability;


seasonal
reductions in business activity in Europe and certain other parts of the world during the summer months; and


potentially
adverse tax consequences. 

The combined company's software products may contain potential undetected defects.  

    Software developed by the combined company or developed by others and incorporated by the combined company into its products may contain significant undetected
errors when first released or as new versions are released. Although the combined company's software products will be tested before commercial release, errors in the products may be found after
customers begin to use the software. Any defects in the combined company's current or future products may result in significant decreases in revenue or increases in expenses because of adverse
publicity, reduced orders, product returns, uncollectible accounts receivable, delays in collecting accounts receivable, and additional and unexpected costs of further product development to correct
the defects. 

If the combined company issues additional shares of stock in the future, it may have a dilutive effect on the combined company's stockholders existing at the time of issuance.  

    First Virtual Communications' board of directors has approved and its stockholders are being asked to approve an amendment to the First Virtual Communications
certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 35,000,000 to 100,000,000. This increase in authorized shares will provide the combined company with the
flexibility to issue First Virtual Communications common stock for proper corporate purposes, which may include making acquisitions through the use of stock, adopting additional equity incentive plans
and raising equity capital. Any subsequent issuance of First Virtual Communications common stock may result in immediate dilution of then current First Virtual Communications stockholders. 

Risks Specific to Either First Virtual Communications or CUseeMe  

First Virtual Communications stockholders face immediate dilution as a result of the merger.  

    First
Virtual Communications' stockholders will experience immediate and substantial dilution as a result of the shares of First Virtual Communications common stock issued to CUseeMe
stockholders in the merger. Additional dilution may also occur upon exercise of any of the outstanding options or warrant to purchase CUseeMe common stock that will be assumed by First Virtual
Communications in the merger. 

THE FIRST VIRTUAL COMMUNICATIONS SPECIAL MEETING    

    At the First Virtual Communications special meeting, First Virtual Communications' stockholders will consider and vote upon the approval of the issuance of
First Virtual Communications common stock in the merger and the amendment to First Virtual Communications' certificate of incorporation and other matters as may properly come before the First Virtual
Communications special meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the meeting. 

The First Virtual Communications board of directors has unanimously approved the issuance of shares of First Virtual Communications common stock to the
CUseeMe's stockholders and the amendment to First Virtual Communications' certificate of incorporation and unanimously recommends that First Virtual Communications stockholders vote for each of these
proposals.

Record Date  

    The First Virtual Communications board has fixed the close of business on            , 2001 as the First Virtual Communications record date for
determining holders entitled to notice of and to vote at the First Virtual Communications special meeting. 

Quorum  

    The presence in person or by properly executed proxy of holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of First Virtual Communications common stock
is necessary to constitute a quorum at the First Virtual Communications special meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will each be included in determining whether a quorum is present. 

Required Votes  

    Approval of the issuance of the shares of First Virtual Communications common stock to the stockholders of CUseeMe in the merger requires the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of First Virtual Communications common stock and Series A preferred stock, calculated on an as-if converted to common stock
basis, voting together as a single class, present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the meeting. Abstentions are equivalent to negative votes for purposes of approving the
issuance of the First Virtual Communications common stock. Broker non-votes will not be counted in determining whether the issuance of the First Virtual Communications common stock has
been approved. Approval of the amendment to the First Virtual Communications certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of First Virtual
Communications common stock and Series A preferred stock, calculated on an as-if converted to common stock basis, voting together as a single class. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be
counted towards the tabulation of votes cast on the proposal to amend the certificate of incorporation and will have the same effect as a negative vote. Stockholder approval of the proposal to amend
the certificate of incorporation is required for the merger to occur. If this proposal is not approved, then the merger will not be completed. 

Voting Rights; Proxies  

    As of the First Virtual Communications record date, there were issued and outstanding            shares of First Virtual Communications common stock
and 27,437 shares of First Virtual Communications Series A preferred stock, convertible into 3,429,625 shares of common stock. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share
held. Each holder of Series A preferred stock will be entitled to one vote for each share of common stock into which the holder's shares of Series A preferred stock are convertible. All
shares of First Virtual Communications common stock and Series A preferred stock represented by properly executed proxies will, unless such proxies have been previously revoked, be voted in
accordance with the instructions indicated in such proxies. 

If no instructions are indicated, the shares of First Virtual Communications common stock will be voted in favor of the approval of the issuance of shares of
First Virtual Communications common stock to the CUseeMe stockholders in the merger and the amendment to First Virtual Communications' certificate of incorporation.  

    First Virtual Communications does not know of any matters other than as described in the accompanying notice of the First Virtual Communications special
meeting that are to come before the
special meeting. If any other matter or matters are properly presented for action at the First Virtual Communications special meeting, the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy and acting
thereunder will have the discretion to vote on the matters in accordance with their best judgment, unless authorization is withheld. A First Virtual Communications stockholder giving a proxy under
this proxy solicitation may revoke it at any time before it is exercised by giving a subsequent proxy, delivering to the assistant secretary of First Virtual Communications at the address of First
Virtual Communications provided elsewhere in this prospectus/joint proxy statement a written notice of revocation prior to the voting of the proxy at the First Virtual Communications special meeting,
or attending the First Virtual Communications special meeting and informing the assistant secretary of First Virtual Communications in writing that the stockholder wishes to vote his or her shares in
person. However, attending the First Virtual Communications special meeting will not in and of itself have the effect of revoking the proxy. If a broker indicates on the proxy that it does not have
discretionary authority as to some shares to vote on a particular matter, those shares will be treated as present for purposes of determining whether or not a quorum is present, but will not be
considered as present and entitled to vote with respect to that matter. Ralph Ungermann, Edward Harris, Pier Carlo Falotti, Allwyn Sequeira, Robert Wilmot, David Norman, Randy Acres and Ruth Cox, each
a director and/or an executive officer of First Virtual Communications, and Vulcan Ventures Incorporated, a stockholder of First Virtual Communications, beneficially hold approximately 33.8% of the
outstanding shares of voting stock of First Virtual Communications outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement, and have agreed to vote in favor of the issuance of shares of First Virtual
Communications common stock to CUseeMe's stockholders and the amendment to First Virtual Communications' certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock. 

    Votes
cast by proxy or in person at the First Virtual Communications special meeting will be tabulated by the inspector of election appointed for the meeting and the inspector will
determine whether or not a quorum is present. 

Solicitation of Proxies  

    The expenses of the solicitations of proxies for the First Virtual Communications special meeting will be borne by First Virtual Communications. In addition to
solicitation by mail, proxies may be solicited by directors, officers and employees of First Virtual Communications in person or by telephone, telegram or other means of communication. These persons
will receive no additional compensation for solicitation of proxies, but may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the solicitation.
Arrangements will also be made by First Virtual Communications with custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for forwarding of proxy solicitation materials to beneficial owners of shares held of record by
such custodians, nominees and fiduciaries, and First Virtual Communications will reimburse such custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses incurred in connection therewith. First
Virtual Communications has no present plans to hire special employees or paid solicitors to assist in obtaining proxies, but reserves the option of doing so if it should appear that a quorum otherwise
might not be obtained. 

THE MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE FIRST VIRTUAL COMMUNICATIONS SPECIAL MEETING ARE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THE FIRST VIRTUAL COMMUNICATIONS STOCKHOLDERS.
ACCORDINGLY, FIRST VIRTUAL COMMUNICATIONS STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ AND CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THIS PROSPECTUS/JOINT PROXY STATEMENT, AND TO COMPLETE, DATE, SIGN AND
PROMPTLY RETURN THE ENCLOSED PROXY IN THE ENCLOSED POSTAGE PRE-PAID ENVELOPE.

THE CUSEEME SPECIAL MEETING    

    At the CUseeMe special meeting, the CUseeMe stockholders will consider and vote upon the approval of the merger agreement and the merger. 

The CUseeMe board has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger and unanimously recommends that CUseeMe stockholders vote for the approval and
adoption of the merger agreement and the merger.

Record Date  

    The CUseeMe board has fixed the close of business on            , 2001 as the CUseeMe record date for determining holders entitled to notice of and to
vote at the CUseeMe special meeting. 

Quorum  

    The presence in person or by properly executed proxies of holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of CUseeMe common stock is necessary to
constitute a quorum at the CUseeMe special meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be included in determining whether a quorum is present. 

Required Votes  

    Approval of the merger agreement and the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of CUseeMe common stock. Accordingly,
abstentions and broker non-votes are equivalent to negative votes for purposes of approving the merger proposal. 

Voting Rights; Proxies  

    As of the CUseeMe record date, there were            shares of CUseeMe common stock issued and outstanding, each of which entitles its holder to one
vote. All shares of CUseeMe common stock represented by properly executed proxies will, unless such proxies have been previously revoked, be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated in the
proxies. 

If no instructions are indicated, the shares of CUseeMe common stock will be voted in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and the
merger.

    CUseeMe
does not know of any matters other than as described in the accompanying notice of the CUseeMe special meeting that are to come before the CUseeMe special meeting. If any
other matter or matters are properly presented for action at the CUseeMe special meeting, the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy and acting thereunder will have the discretion to vote on the
matters in accordance with their best judgment, unless authorization is withheld. A CUseeMe stockholder giving a proxy under this proxy solicitation may revoke it at any time before it is exercised by
giving a subsequent proxy, delivering to the secretary of CUseeMe at the address of CUseeMe provided elsewhere in this prospectus/joint proxy statement a written notice of revocation prior to the
voting of the proxy at the CUseeMe special meeting, or attending the CUseeMe special meeting and voting his or her shares in person. However, attending the CUseeMe special meeting will not in and of
itself have the effect of revoking the proxy. David Bundy, Killko Caballero, Joseph Esposito, Jonathan Morgan, Robert Scott, and Adam Stettner, who together beneficially hold approximately 6.3% of the
outstanding shares of CUseeMe common stock, have agreed to vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and the merger. 

    Votes
cast by proxy or in person at the CUseeMe special meeting will be tabulated by the inspector of election appointed for the meeting and such inspector will determine whether or
not a quorum is present. 

Solicitation of Proxies  

    The expenses of the solicitation of proxies for use at the CUseeMe special meeting will be borne by CUseeMe. In addition to solicitation by mail, proxies may
be solicited by directors, officers or other

    From 1998 until the end of 1999, Ralph Ungermann, chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer of First Virtual Communications,
and Killko Caballero, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer of CUseeMe, had general discussions regarding their companies' respective products, potential product collaborations
and a potential vendor relationship. In December 1999, the companies entered into an agreement under which CUseeMe agreed to manufacture its multipoint control unit product for First Virtual
Communications, and First Virtual Communications agreed to manufacture its gateway products, V-Gate 4000 and 5000, for CUseeMe. 

    On

    Commencing in October 2000, First Virtual Communications' executive management held numerous discussions regarding strategic transactions that would enable First Virtual
Communications to expand its product offerings and increase revenues and presence in the rich media communications market. During these discussions, First Virtual Communications' executive management

First Virtual Communications' Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the First Virtual Communications Board of Directors  

    In the course of reaching its decision to approve the merger, the First Virtual Communications board of directors consulted with its management, as well as its
legal counsel, accountants and financial advisors, and gave significant consideration to a number of factors bearing on its decision. The post-merger ownership between First Virtual
Communications stockholders and CUseeMe stockholders was determined in arm's-length negotiations. During the course of its deliberations concerning the merger, including the ownership allocation,
First Virtual Communications' board of directors reviewed a number of factors associated with CUseeMe's business and the opportunities presented by combining the two companies, including: 


the
combined company's ability to provide a complete end-to-end software rich media communications solution with flexible
web-based user interface and seamless delivery of services over any network technology as a result of operational efficiencies and the combination of each company's complementary products
and technologies;


the
highly competitive nature of the market for rich media and broadband services, making it more difficult for First Virtual Communications to succeed as
an independent company; 


information
concerning the business, financial condition, operations, competitive position and prospects of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe, both
individually and on a combined basis;


CUseeMe's
core competence and expertise in IP-and software-based video collaboration technology and its focus on applications for enterprises
and consumers;


the
potential for the combined company to deliver a broader and more integrated total solution product offering;


the
combined company's access to a broader client base and global distribution channels;


the
maturity and consumer market acceptance of CUseeMe's products;


CUseeMe's
sizeable and strong technical employee base, adding engineers to First Virtual Communications' engineer base; and


the
possibility, as an alternative to the merger, of seeking to acquire another company. 

    The
First Virtual Communications board of directors also considered a number of risks and potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger, including the risk
factors described elsewhere in this prospectus/joint proxy statement, and in particular: 


the
risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized, including that the combined company might not achieve the expected operating
synergies;


the
challenge of integrating the businesses and operations of the two companies and the management effort and costs required to complete the integration
following the merger;


the
risk of management and employee disruption associated with the merger, including the risk that despite efforts of the combined company, key technical
and management personnel may decide not to continue employment with the combined company;


the
adverse effects of one-time charges expected to be incurred in connection with the costs of the merger and the subsequent integration of
the companies, including write-offs for in-process research and development expenses of CUseeMe;


the
risk that sales of substantial amounts of First Virtual Communications common stock in the public market after the proposed merger could materially
adversely affect the market price of First Virtual Communications common stock;


the
potential adverse effects on the combined company's results of operations of amortizing the goodwill and other intangible assets that would be recorded
in connection with the merger; and


the
risk that revenue might decline if any significant customers reduce or terminate their purchase of First Virtual Communications' products because of
uncertainties concerning the merger. 

    In
analyzing the proposed merger, none of the factors listed above was viewed by the First Virtual Communications board of directors as determinative, and the First Virtual
Communications board of directors did not find it practical or feasible to quantify or otherwise attempt to assign any relative or specific values to any of the foregoing factors. Rather, the First
Virtual Communications board of directors made its determination based upon the total mix of information available to it. Moreover, the individual members of the board may have accorded different
values to different factors. 

    After
carefully considering the potentially negative factors described above, among others, the First Virtual Communications board of directors concluded that the potential benefits
of the merger outweighed the negative factors and determined that the merger is fair to and in the best interest of First Virtual Communications and its stockholders. 

CUseeMe Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the CUseeMe Board of Directors  

    In the course of reaching its decision to approve the merger, the CUseeMe board of directors consulted with its management, as well as its legal counsel,
accountants and financial advisors, and gave significant consideration to a number of factors bearing on its decision. The post-merger ownership between First Virtual Communications
stockholders and CUseeMe stockholders was determined in arm's-length negotiations. During the course of its deliberations concerning the merger, including the ownership allocation, CUseeMe's board of
directors reviewed a number of factors associated with First Virtual Communications' business and the opportunities presented by combining the two companies, including: 


the
highly competitive nature of the market for multimedia group communications products and services, making it more difficult for CUseeMe to succeed as a
relatively small independent company; 

the
importance of growing and gaining critical mass in order to compete more effectively against larger companies with substantially greater resources and
broader, more integrated product offerings; 

operational
efficiencies and compatibility of CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications, based on their complementary technologies, business philosophies
and strategies; 

the
potential for the combined company to deliver a broader and more integrated total solution product offering; 

the
potential for the combined company to attract additional strategic relationships; 

the
ability of CUseeMe to enjoy the benefits of First Virtual Communications' extensive distribution network and sales expertise; 

the
opportunity for CUseeMe stockholders to participate in the potential for growth of the combined company after the merger; and 

the
treatment of the merger as a reorganization for tax purposes. 

    The
CUseeMe board of directors also considered a number of risks and potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger, including the risk factors described
elsewhere in this prospectus/joint proxy statement, and in particular: 


the
risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized, including that the combined company might not achieve the expected operating
synergies; 

the
challenge of integrating the businesses and operations of the two companies and the management effort and costs required to complete the integration
following the merger; 

the
risk that because the exchange ratio is subject to adjustment, the value of the merger consideration will fluctuate; 

the
risk of management and employee disruption associated with the merger, including the risk that key technical and management personnel may decide not to
continue employment with the combined company; and 

the
risk that revenue might decline if any significant customers reduce or terminate their purchase of CUseeMe's products because of uncertainties
concerning the merger. 

    In
analyzing the proposed merger, none of the factors listed above was viewed by the CUseeMe board of directors as determinative, and the board did not find it practical or feasible
to quantify or otherwise attempt to assign any relative or specific values to any of the foregoing factors. Rather, the CUseeMe board of directors made its determination based upon the total mix of
information available to it. Moreover, the individual members of the board may have accorded different values to different factors. 

    After
carefully considering the potentially negative factors described above, among others, the CUseeMe board of directors concluded that the potential benefits of the merger
outweighed the 

negative factors and determined that the merger is fair to and in the best interest of CUseeMe and its stockholders. 

Opinion of Financial Advisor to First Virtual Communications  

    First Virtual Communications engaged Greenbridge to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger and to render an opinion as to the fairness of
the exchange ratio, from a financial point of view, to First Virtual Communications and its stockholders. On March 21, 2001, Greenbridge delivered its oral opinion to the First Virtual
Communications board of directors, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications described in the
opinion, the exchange ratio under the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to First Virtual Communications and its stockholders. 

The full text of the Greenbridge opinion dated March 21, 2001, is attached as Appendix C. The summary of the Greenbridge opinion set forth in
this prospectus/joint proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Greenbridge opinion. First Virtual Communications stockholders are urged to read the Greenbridge
opinion carefully and in its entirety for the procedures followed, assumptions made, other matters considered and the limits of the review by Greenbridge in connection with its
opinion.

    The
Greenbridge opinion speaks only as of its date, and Greenbridge is under no obligation to confirm its opinion as of any later date. Greenbridge expressly disclaims any obligation
to advise any person of any change in any matter effecting the opinion which may come or be brought to Greenbridge's attention after the date of the opinion. 

    In
reading the following discussion of the Greenbridge fairness opinion, you should be aware that the opinion: 


did
not constitute a recommendation to First Virtual Communications' board of directors in connection with its consideration of the merger; 

did
not address the merits of the underlying decision by First Virtual Communications to engage in the merger, the merits of the merger over any
alternative business transaction or strategies that might exist for First Virtual Communications or the effect of any other transaction in which First Virtual Communications might engage; 

did
not address the price or range of prices at which shares of First Virtual Communications common stock may trade subsequent to the announcement or
consummation of the merger; and 

did
not constitute a recommendation to any holder of First Virtual Communications common stock as to how such stockholder should vote on the merger or any
related matter. 

    In
arriving at its opinion, Greenbridge, among other things: 


reviewed
certain publicly available business and financial information relating to CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications that Greenbridge deemed to be
relevant, including (a) the annual reports on forms 10-K and 10-KSB and related audited financial statements for the two years ended December 31, 1999 and
(b) quarterly reports on form 10-Q and related unaudited financial statements for the first three quarterly periods during fiscal 2000; 

reviewed
certain information, including financial forecasts, relating to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of First
Virtual Communications and CUseeMe, as well as the amount of the cost savings and related expenses and synergies expected to result from the merger furnished to Greenbridge by First Virtual
Communications and CUseeMe; 

conducted
discussions with members of senior management and representatives of CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications concerning the matters described in
the preceding two points, as well as their respective businesses and prospects before and after giving effect to the merger; 


participated
in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications and their respective financial and
legal advisers; 

reviewed
the market prices and valuation multiples for CUseeMe shares of common stock and First Virtual Communications shares of common stock and compared
them with those of certain publicly traded companies that Greenbridge deemed to be relevant; 

reviewed
the results of operations of CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications and compared them with those of certain publicly traded companies that
Greenbridge deemed to be relevant; 

compared
the proposed financial terms of the merger with the financial terms of certain other transactions that Greenbridge deemed to be relevant; 

reviewed
the potential pro forma impact of the merger on First Virtual Communications; 

reviewed
a draft dated March 20, 2001 of the merger agreement; and 

reviewed
such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other matters as Greenbridge deemed necessary, including Greenbridge's
assessment of general economic, market and monetary conditions, as well as Greenbridge's experience in connection with similar transactions and securities valuation generally. 

    In
preparing its opinion, Greenbridge assumed and relied on the accuracy and completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made available to Greenbridge, discussed with or
reviewed by or for Greenbridge, or publicly available, and Greenbridge did not assume any responsibility for independently verifying such information and did not undertake an independent evaluation or
appraisal of any of CUseeMe's or First Virtual Communications' assets or liabilities, contingent or otherwise, nor was Greenbridge furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition,
Greenbridge did not assume any obligation to conduct any physical inspection of CUseeMe's or First Virtual Communications' properties or facilities. With respect to the financial forecast information
and the expected synergies furnished to or discussed with Greenbridge by CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications, Greenbridge assumed that it had been reasonably prepared and reflected the best
available estimates and judgment of CUseeMe's and First Virtual Communications' management as to the expected future financial performance of CUseeMe or First Virtual Communications, as the case may
be, and the expected synergies. 

    Greenbridge
has conducted no independent investigation of any legal matters and accounting advice given to First Virtual Communications or CUseeMe and their respective boards of
directors, including, without limitation, advice as to the accounting and tax consequences of the merger. Greenbridge has assumed, with First Virtual Communications' consent, that the merger will be
treated as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes. Greenbridge has relied on the representations and warranties as set forth in the merger agreement. 

    Greenbridge's
fairness opinion is necessarily based on market, economic and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on, and on the information made available to
Greenbridge as of, the date of the opinion. Existing conditions are subject to rapid and unpredictable change. Greenbridge assumed that in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or other
consents or approvals, contractual or otherwise, for the transaction, no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, will be imposed that will have a material
adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the merger. 

    In
preparing its opinion to First Virtual Communications' board of directors, Greenbridge performed financial and comparative analyses, including those described below. The summary of
analyses set forth in this prospectus/joint proxy statement does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses underlying Greenbridge's fairness opinion or the presentation made by
Greenbridge to First Virtual Communications' board of directors. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytic process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and
relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstance, and therefore, a 

fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. No company, business or transaction used in the analyses as a comparison is identical to CUseeMe or First
Virtual Communications, nor is an evaluation of the results of the analyses entirely mathematical; rather it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, business segments or transactions being analyzed. 

    In
arriving at its opinion, Greenbridge did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the
significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, Greenbridge believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses, without
considering all analyses, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion. 

    In
performing its analyses, numerous assumptions were made with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of
which are
beyond the control of Greenbridge, CUseeMe or First Virtual Communications. The estimates contained in the analyses performed by Greenbridge and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular
analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by the analyses.
Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which these businesses or securities might actually be sold. Accordingly,
the analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, as described above, Greenbridge's fairness opinion was among several factors taken into consideration by
First Virtual Communications' board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger. Consequently, the Greenbridge analyses described below should not be viewed as determinative of the
decision of First Virtual Communications' board of directors or First Virtual Communications' management with respect to the fairness of the merger. 

    The
following is a summary of the material financial and comparative analyses performed by Greenbridge in arriving at its opinion and presented to First Virtual Communications' board
of directors. The Greenbridge opinion is based upon Greenbridge's consideration of the collective results of all such analyses, together with the other factors referred to in its opinion letter. 

    Comparable Publicly Traded Companies Analysis.
  Greenbridge analyzed selected historical and projected operating
information and stock market data for certain publicly traded videoconferencing companies that Greenbridge deemed to be comparable to CUseeMe. These comparable videoconferencing companies included
Avistar Communications Corporation, Ezenia! Inc., PictureTel Corporation, Polycom, Inc., RADVision, Ltd., Vialog Corporation, VTEL Corporation, and Wire One Technologies, Inc. Greenbridge compared the
aggregate value of each of the comparable videoconferencing companies as of March 19, 2001 to certain selected financial data for each of these companies. Greenbridge defined aggregate value as
fully diluted equity value plus total debt, preferred stock and minority interest, less cash and cash equivalents. In examining these comparable videoconferencing companies. Greenbridge analyzed the
aggregate value of the companies as a multiple of each company's respective calendar year 2000 revenue, projected 2001 revenue, calendar year 2000 gross profit and projected 2001 gross profit.
Calendar year 2000 revenue and gross profit and projected 2001 revenue and gross profit for CUseeMe was provided by the management of CUseeMe. The financial information for the comparable
videoconferencing companies was based on publicly available information for calendar year 2000 and Wall Street research projections for 2001. In each case, Greenbridge compared the multiples of the
comparable videoconferencing companies to the implied purchase multiple for CUseeMe based on the exchange ratio of 1.254 and FVC's share price as of March 19, 2001. Greenbridge's analysis of
the comparable videoconferencing companies yielded the following information: 


aggregate
value as a multiple of calendar year 2000 revenues ranged from 0.2x to 5.0x for the comparable videoconferencing companies with an average of
1.7x and a median of 1.1x, compared to a value of 0.4x for CUseeMe; 

aggregate
value as a multiple of projected 2001 revenues ranged from 0.1x to 3.1x for the comparable videoconferencing companies with an average of 1.0x
and a median of 0.6x, compared to a value of 0.3x for CUseeMe; 

aggregate
value as a multiple of calendar year 2000 gross profit ranged from 0.3x to 9.1x for the comparable videoconferencing companies with an average of
3.5x and a median of 3.3x, compared to a value of 0.6x for CUseeMe; and 

aggregate
value as a multiple of projected 2001 gross profit ranged from 1.0x to 5.7x for the comparable videoconferencing companies with an average of
2.7x and a median of 2.0x, compared to a value of 0.4x for CUseeMe. 

    As
Greenbridge informed the First Virtual Communications board, none of the selected companies is directly comparable to CUseeMe because of the inherent differences in product
pipelines, product portfolios and financial and operating characteristics between CUseeMe and the selected companies. These differences could affect the value of CUseeMe as compared to the selected
companies. 

    Contribution Analysis.
  Greenbridge compared First Virtual Communications' contribution to the combined company
resulting from the merger with the pro forma ownership of First Virtual Communications stockholders in the combined company following the merger. Greenbridge reviewed specific financial and market
information, including, among other things, revenues, gross profit, shareholders equity, and market value of equity utilizing First Virtual Communications' results for the last twelve month period
ended December 31, 2000 and First Virtual Communications' financial projections for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2001 and 2002 provided by First Virtual Communications' senior
management, and CUseeMe's results for the last twelve month period ended December 31, 2000 and CUseeMe's financial projections for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2001 and 2002
provided by CUseeMe's senior management, outstanding common share information as reported in each company's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending September 30, 2000, and
reported closing share prices of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe as of March 16 2001. The analysis showed that compared to the approximate 57.5% pro forma ownership of the combined
company, including the Series A preferred stock, First Virtual Communications would contribute approximately: 


53.0%
of market value of equity (excluding Series A preferred Stock); 

76.8%
of last twelve month revenues; 

75.9%
of 2001 projected revenues; 

70.3%
of 2002 projected revenues; 

67.7%
of last twelve month gross profit; 

64.8%
of 2001 projected gross profit; 

57.3%
of 2002 projected gross profit; and 

66.1%
of stockholders' equity. 

    Premium Analysis.
  This analysis compared the recent and historical reported share prices of the common stock of CUseeMe
with the per share premium implied by the exchange ratio in the merger. This stock performance review indicated that for the 52-week period ended March 16, 2001, the reported intraday low and
high trading prices were $0.69 and $42.88. Based on the calculation of the exchange ratio as of March 19, 2001 and the reported closing price of the common stock of First Virtual Communications
of $1.13, the 1.254 shares of common stock of First Virtual Communications to be issued for each share of CUseeMe common stock implied a per share premium of 12.1% over CUseeMe's ten trading-day
average closing share price and a 14.7% discount to CUseeMe's 30 trading 

day average closing share price. Additionally, Greenbridge noted that the exchange ratio calculated as of March 19, 2001 implied a 104% per share premium to the above-mentioned 52-week reported
intraday low of the common stock of CUseeMe of $0.69, and a 97% discount to the above-mentioned 52-week intraday day high of the common stock of CUseeMe of $42.88. 

    Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis.
  Greenbridge reviewed reported historical trading prices for shares of First Virtual
Communications and CUseeMe common stock to calculate exchange ratios based on the trading price relationship between First Virtual Communications common stock and CUseeMe common stock. In examining
the average reported closing prices of the common stock of First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe for the periods consisting of ten trading days, 20 trading days, 30 trading days, 50 trading days,
three months, six months, nine months and one year ending March 19, 2001, and based on the exchange ratio as calculated on March 19, 2001, this calculated exchange ratio review indicated
that on such dates the low CUseeMe/First Virtual Communications exchange ratio was 0.964 and the high CUseeMe/First Virtual Communications exchange ratio was 1.525. 

    Selected Merger and Acquisition Transaction Analysis.
  This analysis utilized publicly available information concerning
selected merger and acquisition transactions involving two publicly traded video conferencing companies and a group of five communications software companies. The purpose of this analysis was to
establish that the proposed purchase multiple and premium being considered for CUseeMe was in the range of similar public merger and acquisition multiples and respective premiums. With respect to the
following selected transactions, Greenbridge analyzed (1) the proposed purchase prices to be paid relative to the acquired companies' last twelve month revenue for the most recent period,
(2) the proposed purchase prices to be paid relative to the acquired companies' last twelve month gross profit for the most recent period, (3) the implied per share price premiums to be
paid relative to the acquired companies' reported closing common stock price one day, one week and one month prior to the announcement of the transactions:

    Greenbridge
compared the median premiums of the above-mentioned per share analyses to the implied per share premium to the common stock of CUseeMe calculated using the exchange ratio
as of 

March 19, 2001 and the CUseeMe closing share prices one day, one week and one month prior to the announcement, as follows:

    Greenbridge informed the First Virtual Communications board of directors that no company or transaction used in the above analysis is identical
to CUseeMe, First Virtual Communications or the merger, respectively, given, among other things, the inherent differences in product pipelines, product portfolios and financial and operating
characteristics between CUseeMe and the companies involved in the selected transactions. These differences could affect the value of CUseeMe as compared to the acquired companies in the selected
transactions. Greenbridge did not attempt to prepare any further quantitative valuation analyses based on these selected transactions because Greenbridge believed that differences in the technologies
of each company and market conditions at the time these transactions were announced would make these analyses meaningless. 

    The
actual operating or financial results achieved by the pro forma combined company may vary from projected results and such variations may be material as a result of, among other
factors, market acceptance of planned future products, business and operational risks, and integration costs associated with the merger. 

    The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set
forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Greenbridge's opinion. Several analytical methods were utilized and no single
method should be regarded as critical to the overall conclusion by Greenbridge. Each analytical method has inherent strengths and weaknesses and the nature of the available information may further
effect the value of particular methods. The conclusions reached by Greenbridge are based on all analyses and factors taken as a whole and also on application of Greenbridge's own experience and
judgement. The conclusions may involve significant elements of subjective judgement and qualitative analysis. Greenbridge, therefore, gives no opinion as to the value or the merits standing alone of
any one or more parts of the analyses it performed. The analyses were prepared solely for purposes of Greenbridge providing its opinion to the First Virtual Communications board of directors as to the
fairness to First Virtual Communications and its stockholders, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at
which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Greenbridge expressed no opinion as to what the value of First Virtual Communications common stock actually will be subsequent to the merger.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because
these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, actual future results may differ
materially from those forecasted. As described above, Greenbridge's opinion to the First Virtual Communications board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the First Virtual
Communications board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. This summary is not a complete 

description of the analysis performed by Greenbridge and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Greenbridge included as Appendix C. 

    Greenbridge
is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions and valuations for corporate and other purposes.
Pursuant to an engagement letter dated January 25, 2001, First Virtual Communications agreed to pay Greenbridge fees totalling up to $1,025,000 for services as a financial advisor to the First
Virtual Communications board and for rendering a fairness opinion in connection with the closing of the merger. First Virtual Communications has also agreed to reimburse Greenbridge for its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses, including fees of its counsel, and to indemnify Greenbridge and specific related persons against specific potential liabilities arising out of
Greenbridge's rendering of services under the engagement letter. 

Opinion of Financial Advisor to CUseeMe  

    Pursuant to an engagement letter dated February 1, 2000, CUseeMe retained Chase Securities Inc. as its financial advisor in connection with the
proposed merger. 

    At
the meeting of the board of directors of CUseeMe on March 22, 2001, JPMorgan H&Q, a division of Chase Securities Inc., rendered its oral opinion to the board of
directors of CUseeMe that, as of such date, the exchange ratio in the proposed merger was fair from a financial point of view to CUseeMe's common stockholders. JPMorgan H&Q confirmed its
March 22, 2001, oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the board of directors of CUseeMe, dated March 26, 2001, that, as of such date, the exchange ratio in the proposed
merger was fair from a financial point of view to CUseeMe's common stockholders. No limitations were imposed by CUseeMe's board of directors upon JPMorgan H&Q with respect to the investigations made
or procedures followed by it in rendering its opinions. 

    The
full text of the written opinion of JPMorgan H&Q, dated March 26, 2001, which sets forth the assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is
attached as Appendix D to this prospectus/joint proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. CUseeMe's stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. JPMorgan H&Q's
written opinion is addressed to the board of directors of CUseeMe, is directed only to the exchange ratio in the proposed merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of CUseeMe
as to how a stockholder should vote at the CUseeMe special meeting. The summary of the opinion of JPMorgan H&Q set forth in this prospectus/joint proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of such opinion. 

    In
arriving at its opinion, JPMorgan H&Q reviewed, among other things, the merger agreement; the audited financial statements of CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 and the unaudited financial statements of CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000; current and historical
market prices of the common stock of CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications; certain publicly available information concerning the business of CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications and of certain
other companies engaged in businesses, and the reported market prices for certain other companies' securities deemed relevant; publicly available terms of certain transactions involving companies
deemed relevant by JPMorgan H&Q and the consideration paid for such companies; certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications and their
respective managements, including the estimated amount and timing of the cost savings and related expenses and synergies expected to result from the merger; certain agreements with respect to
outstanding indebtedness or obligations of CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications; and the terms of other business combinations that JPMorgan H&Q deemed relevant. JPMorgan H&Q also held discussions
with certain members of the management of CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications with respect to certain aspects of the merger, and the past and current business operations of CUseeMe and First
Virtual Communications, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications, the effects of the merger on the financial condition and future
prospects 

and operations of CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications, and certain other matters believed necessary or appropriate to JPMorgan H&Q's inquiry. 

    JPMorgan
H&Q relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or that was furnished to it by
CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications or otherwise reviewed by JPMorgan H&Q, and JPMorgan H&Q has not assumed any responsibility or liability for that information. JPMorgan H&Q has not conducted
any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor have any valuations or appraisals been provided to JPMorgan H&Q. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to JPMorgan H&Q,
including the estimated amount and timing of the cost savings and related expenses and synergies expected to result from the merger, JPMorgan H&Q has assumed that they have been reasonably prepared
based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of CUseeMe and First Virtual
Communications to which the analyses or forecasts relate. JPMorgan H&Q has also assumed that the merger will have the tax consequences described in this prospectus/joint proxy statement, and in
discussions with, and materials furnished to JPMorgan H&Q by, representatives of CUseeMe, and that the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be consummated as described in the
merger agreement and this prospectus/joint proxy statement. JPMorgan H&Q has relied as to all legal matters relevant to rendering its opinion upon the advice of counsel. JPMorgan H&Q has further
assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on CUseeMe or First Virtual
Communications or on the contemplated benefits of the merger. 

    The
projections furnished to JPMorgan H&Q regarding CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications were prepared by the respective managements of these companies. Neither CUseeMe nor First
Virtual Communications publicly discloses internal management projections of the type provided to JPMorgan H&Q in connection with its analysis of the merger, and the projections were not prepared with
a view toward public disclosure. These projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of management, including, without
limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in the projections. 

    JPMorgan
H&Q's opinion is based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to JPMorgan H&Q as of, the date of its opinion. Subsequent
developments may affect the written opinion dated March 26, 2001, and JPMorgan H&Q does not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm its opinion. JPMorgan H&Q has expressed no opinion
as to the price at which the common stock of CUseeMe or First Virtual Communications will trade at any future time. 

    In
accordance with customary investment banking practice, JPMorgan H&Q employed generally accepted valuation methods in reaching its opinion. The following is a summary of the
material financial analyses utilized by JPMorgan H&Q in connection with providing its opinion. 

    Public Trading Multiples.
  Using publicly available information, JPMorgan H&Q compared selected financial data of
CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which JPMorgan H&Q judged to be relevant. The companies selected by JPMorgan H&Q
were: 


Evoke
Communications; 

Ezenia!
Inc.; 

PictureTel
Corp.; 

Polycom Inc.;
and 

RADVision Ltd. 

    The analysis indicated that the ratio of total enterprise value, meaning the market value of equity plus total debt, minority interest and preferred stock minus cash, to revenue for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2000, ranged from approximately 0.4x to 4.6x, with a mean of approximately 2.3x and a median of approximately 2.2x. 

    Based
upon the range of multiples derived from the analysis conducted for the set of companies listed above, JPMorgan H&Q also calculated the following implied exchange ratios,
rounded to the nearest hundredth, in each case compared to the proposed exchange ratio of 1.254x:

    Selected Transaction Analysis.
  Using publicly available information, JPMorgan H&Q examined 26 selected transactions in
which targets were acquired at values which were both less than $100 million and between 40% and 60% of the combined market value of equity for the acquiror and the target. 

    The
analysis indicated that: 


the
offer value as a percentage premium to the closing prices of the target company's stock the day prior to the announcement of the transaction had a mean
of approximately 15% and a median of approximately 9%; 

the
percentage premium to the closing prices of the target company's stock one week prior to announcement had a mean of approximately 14% and a median of
approximately 12%; and 

the
percentage premium to the closing prices of the target company's stock four weeks prior to announcement had a mean of approximately 17% and a median of
approximately 5%. 

    Based
upon the range of premiums derived from the analysis conducted for the set of transactions described above, JPMorgan H&Q also calculated the following implied exchange ratios,
rounded to the nearest hundredth, in each case compared to the proposed exchange ratio of 1.254x:

    Trading Ratio Analysis.
  JPMorgan H&Q reviewed the per share daily closing market price movements of CUseeMe common
stock and First Virtual Communications common stock for the one-year period ending March 16, 2001, and calculated the historical exchange ratios during this period implied by
dividing the daily closing prices per share of CUseeMe common stock by those of First Virtual Communications common stock and the average of those historical trading ratios for the
one-week, one-month, three-month, and six-month periods ending March 16, 2001. The analysis resulted in the following average historical trading ratios for
the periods indicated, rounded to the nearest hundredth, compared to the proposed exchange ratio of 1.254x:

    Contribution Analysis.
  JPMorgan H&Q estimated the contribution of each of CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications to
the pro forma combined company with respect to revenue, enterprise revenue and gross profit for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, stand-alone revenue, enterprise revenue and gross profit without synergies.
The analysis showed that CUseeMe would contribute approximately: 


23%
of 2000 actual revenue; 

80%
of 2000 actual enterprise revenue; 

32%
of 2000 actual gross profit; 

24%
of 2001 estimated revenue; 

48%
of 2001 estimated enterprise revenue; and 

34%
of 2001 estimated gross profit; 

compared
to the approximately 42.5% pro forma ownership of the combined company by CUseeMe stockholders. 

    In connection with its opinion dated March 26, 2001, JPMorgan H&Q reviewed the analyses used to render its March 22, 2001 oral opinion to the board of directors of
CUseeMe by performing procedures to update certain of the analyses and by reviewing the assumptions upon which the analyses were based and the factors considered in connection therewith. 

    The
summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by JPMorgan H&Q. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process
and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. JPMorgan H&Q believes that the summary set forth above and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting
only portions, without considering all of its analyses, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and opinion. JPMorgan H&Q based its analyses on assumptions that it
deemed reasonable, including assumptions concerning general business and economic conditions and industry-specific factors. The other principal assumptions upon which JPMorgan H&Q based its analyses
are set forth above under the description of each analysis. JPMorgan H&Q's analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results that might be achieved, which values may be
higher or lower than those indicated. Moreover, JPMorgan H&Q's analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be bought
or sold. 

    As
a part of its investment banking business, JPMorgan H&Q and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers
and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for estate,
corporate and other purposes. JPMorgan H&Q was selected to advise CUseeMe with respect to the merger on the basis of its experience and its familiarity with CUseeMe. 

    For
services rendered in connection with the merger, CUseeMe has agreed to pay JPMorgan H&Q a fee of $1,000,000. In addition, CUseeMe has agreed to reimburse JPMorgan H&Q for its
expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of its counsel, and will indemnify JPMorgan H&Q against certain liabilities, including liabilities arising under
the Federal securities laws. 

    JPMorgan
H&Q and its affiliates maintain banking and other business relationships with CUseeMe and its affiliates, for which they receive customary fees. In the ordinary course of
their businesses, JPMorgan H&Q and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities of the CUseeMe or First Virtual Communications for their own accounts or for the accounts of
customers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in these securities. 

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger  

    Some members of the First Virtual Communications board of directors and the CUseeMe board of directors and some executive officers of CUseeMe have interests in
the merger that are in addition to the interests of the First Virtual Communications stockholders and CUseeMe stockholders generally. 

    Board of Directors.
  As required under the merger agreement, Ralph Ungermann, chairman of the board of directors of
First Virtual Communications and its chief executive officer and president, will remain the chairman of the board of directors of First Virtual Communications after the merger. Killko Caballero, the
chairman of the board of directors of CUseeMe and its chief executive officer and president, will become a director and the chief executive officer and president of First Virtual Communications after
the merger. In addition, two of the four non-employee directors currently serving on First Virtual Communications' board of directors will continue to serve on the board of directors of
First Virtual Communications after the merger. Two of the three non-employee directors currently serving on CUseeMe's board of directors will serve on the board of directors of First
Virtual Communications after the merger. In addition, Edward Harris, the designee of Vulcan Ventures Incorporated currently serving on the First Virtual Communications board of directors, will
continue to serve on the board of directors of First Virtual Communications after the merger. 

    Caballero Employment Agreement.
  In connection with the merger, First Virtual Communications and Killko Caballero
entered into an employment and non-competition agreement pursuant to which Mr. Caballero will serve as chief executive officer and president of First Virtual Communications upon
completion of the merger. The employment agreement provides for an initial term of two years, subject to written extension by the parties prior to the termination date. 

    The
agreement provides that Mr. Caballero will receive an annual base salary of $300,000, pro-rated for any partial year of service. Mr. Caballero will also
be eligible to receive an annual target bonus as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors, provided, however, that the target bonus will be no less than one-third
of Mr. Caballero's annual base salary. For the year 2001, Mr. Caballero is guaranteed payment of at least 50% of the target bonus. In addition, First Virtual Communications will
reimburse Mr. Caballero for relocation costs, including travel expenses, rental expenses, closing costs incurred in purchasing a new home and any losses, up to $50,000, incurred on the sale of
his present home, in connection with his relocation to Santa Clara, California. 

    If
the employment agreement is terminated by First Virtual without cause or by Mr. Caballero for good reason, First Virtual Communications will pay severance benefits including
(1) salary continuation
payments for twelve months after the date of termination equal to his base salary in effect at the date of termination, (2) each of his outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards
shall have their vesting and exercisability schedules accelerated by one year as of the date of termination, (3) bonus continuation payments for twelve months after the date of termination
equal to 50% of his target bonus in effect at the date of termination; and (4) group health continuation coverage paid by First Virtual Communications. Under the employment agreement,
Mr. Caballero agreed that during his employment with First Virtual Communications and for a period of one year after his termination, he will not engage in a business competitive with the
business of First Virtual Communications. 

    Bundy and Krampf Agreements.
  In connection with the merger, First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe entered into
agreements with each of David Bundy, CUseeMe's chief technology officer, and Jeff Krampf, CUseeMe's vice president of engineering, pursuant to which CUseeMe agreed to grant each officer an option to
purchase 150,000 shares of its common stock immediately prior to the merger, at a purchase price equal to the fair market value of the CUseeMe common stock on the date the parties signed the merger
agreement. Under the agreement, First Virtual Communications entered into an agreement with each officer concerning his employment with First Virtual Communications to be effective upon completion of
the merger. Pursuant to the agreements, each of Mr. Bundy and Mr. Krampf agreed to terminate his executive retention and severance agreement with CUseeMe, immediately prior to the
completion of the merger, except as set forth below. 

    Under
the agreement that First Virtual Communications entered into with each of these officers, if First Virtual Communications terminates the officer without cause it will pay
severance benefits including: (1) salary continuation payments for six months after the date of termination equal to the officer's base salary in effect at the date of termination,
(2) bonus continuation payments for six months after the date of termination equal to the officer's pro-rata share of his target bonus in effect at the date of termination, and
(3) medical coverage until six months after the date of termination. If the officer is terminated within twelve months after the merger without cause, (1) all unvested options to purchase
common stock of CUseeMe that were held by the officer prior to execution of the merger agreement and assumed by First Virtual Communications, will become exercisable and continue to be exercisable for
a period of six months thereafter and (2) First Virtual Communications is required to make a cash severance payment to the executive as set forth in the officer's executive retention agreement with
CUseeMe, as described below. 

    Cavanagh and Scott Agreements.
  In connection with the merger, First Virtual Communications and CUseeMe entered into
agreements with each of Raymond Cavanagh, CUseeMe's vice president of sales, and Robert Scott, CUseeMe's chief operating officer, pursuant to which CUseeMe has agreed to grant Mr. Cavanagh
options to purchase 70,000 shares, and grant Mr. Scott options to purchase 

200,000 shares, of its common stock immediately prior to the merger at a purchase price equal to the fair market value of the CUseeMe common stock on the date the parties signed the merger
agreement.
Under the agreement, First Virtual Communications has entered into an agreement with each of these officers concerning the officer's employment with First Virtual Communications upon completion of the
merger. Pursuant to the agreements, each of Mr. Cavanagh and Mr. Scott agreed to terminate their respective executive retention and severance agreements and any rights thereto, as
described below, with CUseeMe immediately prior to the completion of the merger, except as set forth below. 

    Under
the agreement that First Virtual Communications has entered into with each of these officers, if First Virtual Communications terminates the officer within six months after the
merger, without cause, then First Virtual Communications is required to make a cash severance payment to the officer as set forth in the officer's executive retention agreement with CUseeMe, as
described below. 

    CUseeMe Executive Retention Agreements.
  On December 1, 2000, CUseeMe entered into executive retention agreement
with each of Messrs. Bundy, Caballero, Krampf and Scott. On March 5, 2001, CUseeMe entered into an executive retention agreement with Raymond Cavanagh. The agreements provide that each
officer who is employed at the time of a change of control of CUseeMe is eligible to receive specified benefits under the agreements. The merger will be a change of control under the agreements. The
agreements generally provide that, immediately upon a change of control, each unvested option held by the executive will vest and become exercisable by the executive and, if the executive is
terminated, the option will be exercisable for a period of six months after the termination date. If the executive is terminated within twelve months after a change of control, without cause, as
defined in the executive retention agreement, or by the executive with good reason, as defined in the executive retention agreement, then the executive is entitled to a cash severance payment to the
executive equal to the executive's highest annual base salary in the five-year period prior to the date of the change of control, plus any accrued salary, bonus, deferred compensation and
vacation. If the executive is terminated within twelve months after a change of control, with cause or by the executive without good reason, an acquiror is required to make a cash severance payment to
the executive in a lesser amount as set forth in the agreement. 

    Each
of Messrs. Caballero, Scott, Bundy, Krampf and Cavanagh agreed to terminate his executive retention agreement and any severance agreement with CUseeMe, and any rights
pursuant thereto, immediately prior to the completion of the merger in consideration for entering into the agreements discussed above. 

Material Federal Income Tax Consequences  

    The following discussion summarizes the material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger generally applicable to CUseeMe stockholders. The
discussion is based on current law, as of the date of this prospectus/joint proxy statement, which includes the Internal Revenue Code, existing
Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and court decisions. Changes in the law could affect the federal income tax consequences of the merger to CUseeMe stockholders. First Virtual
Communications and CUseeMe have not sought, and will not seek, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service in connection with the merger. This discussion does not address the consequences of the merger
under state, local or foreign law, nor does the discussion address all aspects of federal income taxation that may be important to a CUseeMe stockholder in light of his or her particular circumstances
or tax issues that may be significant to CUseeMe stockholders subject to special rules, such as: 


persons
who do not hold their CUseeMe common stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code; 

financial
institutions; 

insurance
companies; 


mutual
funds; 

foreign
individuals and entities; 

tax-exempt
entities; 

dealers
in securities; 

persons
who are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code; 

persons
who acquired CUseeMe common stock pursuant to the exercise of an employee option (or otherwise as compensation); 

persons
who acquired CUseeMe common stock as part of an integrated investment, such as a "hedge," "straddle" or other risk reduction transaction, composed
of CUseeMe common stock and one or more other positions; or 

persons
whose shares of CUseeMe common stock are qualified small business stock for purposes of Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code. 

    In
addition, the following discussion does not address (1) the tax consequences of transactions effectuated before, after or at the same time as the merger, whether or not they
are in connection with the merger, including, without limitation, transactions in which CUseeMe shares are acquired or First Virtual Communications shares are disposed of, or (2) the tax
consequences of the receipt of First Virtual Communications shares other than in exchange for CUseeMe shares. 

    Furthermore,
this discussion does not address the tax consequences of an exchange or conversion of CUseeMe stock options or warrants into stock options or warrants to acquire First
Virtual Communications common stock. 

    Accordingly,
CUseeMe stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences of the merger, including the applicable federal, state, local and
foreign tax consequences to them of the merger. 

    First
Virtual Communications has received an opinion dated the date hereof from its counsel, Cooley Godward 
LLP
, a copy of which is
filed as Exhibit 8.1 to the registration statement of which this prospectus/joint proxy statement is a part, to the effect that, based upon and subject to the facts, representations, covenants and
assumptions set forth therein, the merger constitutes a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. CUseeMe Networks has received an opinion dated the date hereof
from its counsel, Hale and Dorr 
LLP
, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 8.2 to the registration statement of which this prospectus/joint proxy
statement is a part, to the effect that, based upon and subject to the facts, representations, covenants and assumptions set forth therein, the merger constitutes a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The above opinions are based on facts existing at the date hereof and the date of the closing of the merger. In addition, it is a condition to the
obligation of First Virtual Communications to effect the merger that First Virtual Communications receive an opinion dated the date of closing of the merger from Cooley Godward 

LLP
, and it is a condition to
the obligation of CUseeMe Networks to effect the merger that CUseeMe Networks receive an opinion dated the date of the
closing of the merger from Hale and Dorr 
LLP
, in each case to the effect that the merger constitutes a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The opinions issued at the closing
will be based on facts existing at the date thereof. These opinions neither bind the IRS or the courts nor preclude the IRS or a court from adopting a contrary position. 

    Subject
to the limitations and qualifications referred to above, as a result of the merger qualifying as a reorganization, there are the following federal income tax consequences: 


Exchange of CUseeMe Capital Stock for First Virtual Communications Capital Stock.
 No gain or loss will be
recognized for federal income tax purposes by CUseeMe stockholders who exchange their CUseeMe common stock solely for First Virtual Communications common stock in 

connection
with the merger, except with respect to cash, if any, received in lieu of fractional shares of First Virtual Communications common stock. Each CUseeMe stockholder's aggregate tax basis in
the First Virtual Communications common stock he or she receives in the merger will be the same as his or her aggregate tax basis in the CUseeMe common stock surrendered in the merger, reduced by any
tax basis allocable to fractional shares exchanged for cash. In addition, the holding period of the First Virtual Communications common stock received will include the holding period of the CUseeMe
common stock surrendered in the merger. 


Cash Received Instead of Fractional Shares.
 The payment of cash to a CUseeMe stockholder instead of a
fractional share of First Virtual Communications common stock generally should result in the recognition of capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the amount of cash received and the
portion of the tax basis of the CUseeMe common stock allocable to that fractional share interest. In the case of an individual, capital gain is generally subject to United States federal income tax at
a maximum rate of 20% if the individual has held his or her CUseeMe common stock for more than one year at the time of the merger, and at ordinary income rates (as a short-term capital
gain) if the individual has held his or her CUseeMe common stock for one year or less at the time of the completion of the merger. The deductibility of capital losses may be limited. 

Tax Consequences to the Companies.
 Neither First Virtual Communications, CUseeMe nor FVC Acquisition Corp.
will recognize gain or loss solely as a result of the merger. 

    There
are other tax-related issues that you should be aware of such as: 


Reporting Requirements.
 Each CUseeMe stockholder that receives First Virtual Communications common stock in
the merger will be required to file a statement with his or her federal income tax return for the year of the merger providing his or her basis in the CUseeMe common stock surrendered and the
fair market value of the First Virtual Communications common stock and cash received in the merger, and to retain permanent records of these facts relating to the merger. 

Backup
Withholding.
 The exchange agent is required to withhold, and will withhold, 31% of any cash payments
to a non-corporate CUseeMe stockholder in the merger unless the stockholder provides the appropriate form as described below or an exemption applies under applicable law and regulations. Backup
withholding will not apply to a CUseeMe stockholder who (1) completes and signs the Substitute Form W-9 included as part of the letter of transmittal to be sent to each CUseeMe
stockholder, so as to provide the information, including the stockholder's taxpayer identification number, and certification necessary to avoid backup withholding, (2) provides a certification
of foreign status on Form W-8BEN or successor form, or (3) is otherwise exempt from backup withholding and the exemption is proved in a manner satisfactory to First Virtual Communications and its
exchange agent. 

Consequences of IRS Challenge.
 A successful IRS challenge to the reorganization status of the merger would
result in significant tax consequences. CUseeMe stockholders would recognize gain or loss with respect to each share of CUseeMe common stock surrendered in the merger. This gain or loss would be equal
to the difference between the stockholder's tax basis in the CUseeMe common stock surrendered in the merger and the sum of the fair market value, as of the effective time, of the First Virtual
Communications common stock received in the merger and any cash received instead of a fractional share of First Virtual Communications common stock. In that event, a stockholder's aggregate basis in
the First Virtual Communications common stock so received would equal its fair market value as of the effective time and the stockholder's holding period for the stock would begin the day after the
merger is consummated. 

Other Consideration.
 Even if the merger qualifies as a reorganization, a recipient of First Virtual
Communications common stock would recognize income to the extent that, for example, any of the shares were determined to have been received in exchange for services, to satisfy obligations 

or
in consideration for anything other than the CUseeMe common stock surrendered. Generally, this income is taxable as ordinary income upon receipt. In addition, to the extent that CUseeMe
stockholders were treated as receiving, directly or indirectly, consideration other than First Virtual Communications common stock in exchange for the stockholder's CUseeMe common stock, gain or loss
would have to be recognized. 

    The
preceding discussion is not meant to be a complete analysis or discussion of all potential tax effects relevant to the merger. Thus, CUseeMe stockholders are urged to consult
their own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the merger, including tax return reporting requirements, federal, state, local and other applicable tax laws and the effect of any
proposed changes in the tax laws. 

Accounting Treatment  

    For accounting purposes, the merger will be treated as a purchase of CUseeMe by First Virtual Communications. 

Effect on First Virtual Communications Options and Warrants  

    No adjustments to any outstanding First Virtual Communications stock options or warrants will occur as a result of the merger. 

Regulatory Matters  

    The consummation of the merger is not subject to the expiration or termination of any waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976. 

Federal Securities Law Consequences  

    All of the First Virtual Communications common stock issued in connection with the merger will be freely transferable, except that any First Virtual
Communications common stock received by persons who are deemed to be affiliates, as defined under the Securities Act, of CUseeMe or First Virtual Communications immediately prior to the merger may be
sold by them only in transactions permitted by the resale provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, with respect to affiliates of CUseeMe, or Rule 144 under the Securities Act,
with respect to persons who are or become affiliates of First Virtual Communications, or as otherwise permitted under the Securities Act. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of CUseeMe or First
Virtual Communications generally include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with, the corporation and may include some officers and directors of such
corporation, as well as principal stockholders of the corporation. 

    Affiliates
of CUseeMe may not sell their shares of First Virtual Communications common stock acquired in connection with the merger, except under an effective registration under the
Securities Act covering the shares or in compliance with Rule 145, or Rule 144 under the Securities Act in the case of persons who are or become affiliates of First Virtual
Communications, or another applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. In general, under Rule 145, for one year following the merger, an affiliate, together
with certain related persons, would be entitled to sell shares of the combined company's common stock acquired in connection with the merger only through unsolicited brokers transactions or in
transactions directly with a market maker. Additionally, the number of shares to be sold by an affiliate within any three-month period for purposes of Rule 145 may not exceed the greater of 1%
of the outstanding shares of First Virtual Communication common stock or the average weekly trading volume of the stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the sale. Rule 145 will only
remain available, however, to affiliates if First Virtual Communication remains current with its informational filings under the Exchange Act. One year after the merger, an affiliate would be able to
sell First Virtual Communications common stock without the manner of sale or volume limitations, provided that First Virtual Communication was current with its Exchange Act informational filings and
the affiliate was not then an affiliate of the combined company. Two years after the merger, an affiliate would be able to sell the shares of First Virtual Communication common stock without any
restrictions, so long as the affiliate had not been an affiliate of First Virtual Communication for at least three months prior to that date. 

Appraisal and Dissenters' Rights  

    Under applicable Delaware law, neither the holders of common stock of First Virtual Communications nor the holders of common stock of CUseeMe are not entitled
to dissenters' or appraisal rights in connection with the merger. 

THE MERGER AGREEMENT    

The description of the merger agreement provided below does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this prospectus/joint proxy statement as Appendix A and incorporated herein by reference. All stockholders are urged to read the merger
agreement carefully and in its entirety.

Terms of the Merger  

    At the closing and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the Delaware General Corporation Law, FVC Acquisition Corp. will be
merged with and into CUseeMe, the separate corporate existence of FVC Acquisition Corp. will cease and CUseeMe will continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Virtual
Communications. In the merger, each share of CUseeMe common stock will be converted into the right to receive approximately 1.254 shares of First Virtual Communications common stock; 

provided, however,

that if First Virtual Communications is required to issue more than 16,081,759 shares of its common stock, the exchange ratio will be
adjusted to equal the number obtained by dividing 16,081,759 by the number of outstanding shares of CUseeMe common stock at the effective time of the merger. Each outstanding option and warrant to
purchase CUseeMe common stock will be assumed by First Virtual Communications in accordance with its terms. Appropriate adjustments will be made to the assumed options and warrant to reflect the
exchange ratio. 

    First
Virtual Communications expects to issue approximately 16,081,759 shares of its common stock to CUseeMe stockholders in the merger. Immediately after the merger, the former
holders of CUseeMe common stock will hold approximately 48% of the outstanding common stock and, on an as-if converted basis, 43.5% of the outstanding capital voting stock of First Virtual
Communications. The current holders of First Virtual Communications capital stock will hold approximately 52% of the outstanding common stock and, on an as-if converted basis, approximately 56.5% of
the outstanding voting capital stock of First Virtual Communications after the merger. The First Virtual Communications common stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq National Market under the
symbol FVCX. 

    The
merger agreement provides that the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of CUseeMe as in effect prior to the effective time of the merger will be the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation. 

    No
fractional shares or certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of First Virtual Communications common stock will be issued in connection with the merger. In lieu of any
fractional share, each holder of a certificate or certificates representing First Virtual Communications common stock upon surrender of the certificate for exchange will be paid in cash the dollar
amount determined by multiplying the fraction by the closing price of a share of First Virtual Communications common stock as reported on The Nasdaq National Market on the date the merger becomes
effective. 

Exchange of Certificates  

    First Virtual Communications will supply the exchange agent for First Virtual Communications common stock with certificates evidencing shares of First Virtual
Communications common stock to be issued in exchange for outstanding CUseeMe common stock in accordance with the merger agreement. 

    As
soon as reasonably practicable after the effectiveness of the merger, the exchange agent will mail to record holders of CUseeMe stock a transmittal letter and instructions for
effecting the surrender of CUseeMe stock certificates in exchange for First Virtual Communications stock certificates. To exchange the certificates, the holders of CUseeMe common stock must then
surrender their certificates representing CUseeMe common stock to receive certificates evidencing First Virtual Communications common stock.

at

options to purchase shares of First Virtual Communications common stock granted to Mssrs. Ungermann, Acres and Griffin and options to purchase shares of CUseeMe
common stock granted to Mssrs. Caballero, Scott, Bundy and Krampf. The shares of CUseeMe common stock represent shares prior to the merger, without giving effect to the exchange ratio of
approximately 1.254. Generally, with regard to First Virtual Communications, 12.5% of the options become exercisable six months after the grant date and 2.38% become exercisable each month thereafter
for 42 months. Generally, with regard to CUseeMe, 12.5% of the options become exercisable every six months for four years. The term of each option granted is generally the earlier of
(a) ten years or (b) 30 days after termination of the employment of the holder. 
(2)
Based
on an aggregate of 5,083,100 options granted to employees, consultants and directors, including the named executive officers, of First Virtual Communications or 1,170,996
options granted to employees, consultants and directors, including the named executive officers, of CUseeMe during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000. 
(3)
The
exercise price per share of each option is equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. 
(4)
The
potential realizable value is calculated based on the term of the option at its time of grant. It is calculated by assuming that the stock price on the date of grant appreciates
at the indicated annual rate, compounded annually for the entire term of the option and that the option is exercised and sold on the last day of its term at the appreciated stock price. All
calculations are based on rounding the number of years remaining on the term of the option to the nearest whole number. No gain to the option holder is possible unless the stock price increases over
the option term. The 5% and 10% assumed rates of appreciation are derived from the rules of the SEC and do not represent First Virtual Communications' estimate or projection of the future common stock
price. 

Aggregated Option Exercises in Last Fiscal Year and
  Fiscal Year-End Option Values

committee of the board of directors will additionally be granted an option to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock on election to the committee and/or each anniversary of the director's election to
the committee so long as the director continuously serves on the committee. Options granted under the directors' plan are granted at the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant.
Options granted to non-employee directors under the directors' plan have a ten-year term and vest over 

a period of five years, with ten percent of the shares vesting six months after the grant date and the remaining shares vesting ratably on a daily basis thereafter. 

Limitation of Liability and Indemnification Matters  

    First Virtual Communications has entered into indemnification agreements with its current directors and executive officers and intends to enter into
indemnification agreements with the directors and executive officers of First Virtual Communications after completion of the merger. The indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that
First Virtual Communications will indemnify the officers or directors, under the circumstances and to the extent provided therein, for expenses, damages, judgments, fines and settlements an executive
officer, or director, may be required to pay in actions or proceedings that the officer or director is or may be required to pay in actions or proceedings that the officer or director is or may be
made a party by reason of his or her position as a director, officer or other agent of First Virtual Communications, and otherwise to the full extent permitted under Delaware law and First Virtual
Communications bylaws. 

    First
Virtual Communications adopted a non-employee directors' change of control plan to provide non-employee directors of First Virtual Communications with
the protection of certain benefits in case of a termination of his or her status as a director of First Virtual Communications in connection with a change of control of First Virtual Communications.
The non-employee directors' change of control plan provides, as of the date of a change of control of First Virtual Communications, as defined in the plan, that, subject to certain tax
circumstances, each of First Virtual Communications' then non-employee director's outstanding stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock purchases will vest and be
exercisable in full.

    CUseeMe
has entered into executive retention agreements with Messrs. Bundy, Caballero, Krampf and Scott. See page 57 for a summary of the terms of these executive retention
agreements. 

    Executive Officers' Change Of Control Plan.
  In February 1999, the board of directors of First Virtual
Communications adopted the executive officers' change of control plan to provide certain executive officers of First Virtual Communications with protection of certain benefits in case of a termination
of his or her employment with First Virtual Communications in connection with a change of control of First Virtual Communications, as defined in the executive plan. Messrs. Ungermann, Griffin
and Acres and Ms. Cox are currently covered by the executive plan. Pursuant to the terms of the executive plan and merger, each of Messrs. Killko, Bundy, Scott, Krampf and Cavanagh also will be
covered by the executive plan immediately after the consummation of the merger. Additionally, each person who, in the future, is confirmed as a Section 16 officer of First Virtual
Communications by action of the board of directors will also be covered by the executive plan. "Section 16 officer" means an officer of First Virtual Communications, as defined in
Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, provided the officer is designated as such by action of the board of directors. 

    If
within 18 months following the date of a change of control of First Virtual Communications the executive's employment with First Virtual Communications terminates
involuntarily other than for cause, as defined in the plan, death or disability, or if within the 18 month period, the executive officer terminates his or her employment with First Virtual
Communications voluntarily with good reason, as defined below, then, subject to certain tax circumstances and limitations and conditions on benefits: (1) the executive officer will be entitled
to receive base salary continuation payments at the executive officer's base salary rate in effect on the date of termination, paid on a monthly basis, for 12 months after the date of
termination, in addition to any accrued but unpaid base salary, bonus payments, and/or accrued and unused vacation; (2) each of the executive officer's outstanding stock options, restricted
stock awards and restricted stock purchases will have their vesting and exercisability schedules accelerated by 18 months as of the date of termination; (3) the executive officer will be
entitled to receive bonus continuation payments totaling the executive officer's target bonus for the current fiscal year in effect on the date of termination, paid on a monthly basis for
12 months after the date of termination; and (4) if at the time of termination, the executive officer is covered by First Virtual Communications' group health plan, First Virtual
Communications will provide to the executive officer, subject to the executive officer and his or her eligible spouse and/or dependents electing continuation coverage under COBRA, one hundred percent
(100%) company-paid group health coverage at the same level of coverage as was provided to the executive officer immediately prior to the date of termination. If such coverage included the
executive officer's spouse and/or dependents immediately prior to the date of termination, such spouse and/or dependents will also be covered at First Virtual Communications' expense. The coverage
will continue until the earlier of 12 months from the date of termination, or the date that the executive officer and his or her spouse and/or dependents become covered under another employer's
group health plan that provides the executive officer and his or her spouse and/or dependents with comparable benefits and levels of coverage. In no event will the executive officer be obligated to
seek other employment or take any other action to mitigate the amounts payable to the executive officer under the executive plan. 

    "Good
reason" means: (1) any material reduction of the executive officer's duties, authority or responsibilities relative to the executive officer's duties, authority, or
responsibilities as in effect immediately before such reduction, unless agreed to in writing by the executive officer; (2) a reduction by First Virtual Communications in the base salary or
target bonus opportunity of the executive officer as in effect immediately before the reduction; (3) the relocation of the executive officer to a facility or a location more than 35 miles from
the executive officer's then present location, without the executive officer's written consent; or (4) any failure of First Virtual Communications to obtain the assumption of the executive plan
by any successor or assign of First Virtual Communications. 

    The
board of directors will administer the executive plan unless and until the board of directors delegates administration to a committee of the board of directors. 

    Prior to a change of control of First Virtual Communications, the right to receive benefits under the executive plan will automatically terminate on the date upon which the executive
officer ceases to be a Section 16 officer of the company, for any reason or no reason, as evidenced by the written resignation of such executive officer, by action of the board of directors
removing such executive officer as a Section 16 officer or otherwise. 

    The
board of directors at any time, and from time to time, may amend or terminate the executive plan; provided, however, that any such termination must occur prior to the occurrence
of a change of control of First Virtual Communications. 

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
  OF FIRST VIRTUAL COMMUNICATIONS

companies worldwide. 

    First
Virtual Communications is leveraging its leadership position in broadband video networking to capitalize on the rapidly emerging opportunity in rich media communications. First
Virtual Communications addresses this opportunity by providing a full range of products and integration services aimed at delivering a centralized and simplified management platform, that will address
video and audio telephony, data collaboration, and streaming over various network topologies. These platforms are targeted at service providers as well as the corporate enterprise. 

    First
Virtual Communications' management team brings significant networking and technology industry experience to First Virtual Communications and was substantially strengthened
during 2000. During the past year, Ralph Ungermann (founder and chairman of the board) assumed the additional responsibility of chief executive officer. First Virtual Communications added a new chief
marketing officer, Ruth Cox, a new chief financial officer, Randy Acres, and a new executive vice president of operations, James Griffin. 

Industry Background  

    In recent years, Internet infrastructure has evolved to meet the requirements of new and emerging Internet applications, such as the integration of voice and
data. Until recently, however, the technologies employed in the Internet infrastructure were unable to differentiate between data transmission bursts and video streams. Therefore, the Internet was
unable to support high quality video networking applications. These hindrances have historically limited an end user's ability to deploy and utilize interactive applications that simultaneously
involve data and high quality video applications. Over the past year, however, the acceleration of the following four key market drivers has significantly enhanced the opportunity for First Virtual
Communications' products and services. 


Proliferation of Rich Media Communications.
  Defined as communications that include more
than one media type, such as video or audio telephony, streaming or data collaboration, rich media is a burgeoning field that combines the attributes of the Internet, television, and radio into one
medium. According to First Albany, a financial analysis firm, the rich media market is expected to grow to $34 billion by 2004, for a compound annual growth rate of 53%. Rich media is being
deployed in a wide variety of scenarios and improves the effectiveness of collaboration, 

training,
advertising, sales and marketing functions, online services and self help applications. Companies using rich media communications should achieve cost reductions in the form of improved
productivity, reduced expenses, reduced customer contact and support requirements, and reduced customer response errors. 


Decline in Price of Broadband Access.
  Companies are now able to purchase broadband access
to the Internet at a fraction of the cost compared to one year ago. Since rich media communications generally require higher bandwidth, the cost of the bandwidth is now less of a barrier. As a result,
more companies are embracing rich media communications.


Proliferation of Broadband Networks.
  According to Ryan, Hankin & Kent, a market
research and consulting firm, Internet and other traffic requirements will increase by over 4000% between 1999 and 2003. In response to these needs, network companies have increased network capacity.
Because of this great increase in network capacity, telecommunications carriers are moving rapidly to exploit the plentiful and inexpensive bandwidth of their networks by adding video services to
existing voice and data offerings. In addition to increased quality, video transmission over broadband networks costs a fraction of transmission over traditional ISDN networks. According to First
Virtual Communications' estimates, telecommunications carriers realize transmission cost savings of up to 70% to 80%, based on the lower cost of using a broadband network compared to the higher costs
of using ISDN connections. As a result, carriers now have greater ability to offer customers bandwidth-intensive applications such as videoconferencing, video broadcast and video on demand.


Decline in Cost of Desktop Video Endpoints.
  Over the past year, a number of companies
introduced consumer-grade desktop video cameras for less than $100 each, and some companies have introduced professional grade desktop video cameras for less than $1000 each. As with other
communications productssuch as cellular phones, which were prohibitively expensive at the time of their introduction, but which dropped in price and increased in functionality over
timethe reduction in price and increase in functionality in desktop video endpoints also is driving demand for video applications. 

First Virtual Communications' Products and Technology  

    First Virtual Communications is a leading worldwide provider of simple, integrated rich media communications solutions for enterprises and service providers.
First Virtual Communications offers a broad range of internally developed products (hardware and software) and integrates them with a wide variety of third party products to deliver a comprehensive
rich media solution to our customers.

    On the leading edge of advanced Internet technologies, First Virtual Communications applies a high level of professionalism to project design, implementation
and support. First Virtual Communications' Professional Services Organization plays an important role, offering project management, project coordination, implementation design and engineering, quality
control and training groups. 

First Virtual Communications' Strategy  

Provide the Applications That Facilitate Integration of Multiple Rich Media Communication Products and Networks  

    Since its inception, First Virtual Communications has developed a leadership position in broadband video networking, especially over ATM. First Virtual
Communications' solutions include multi-point videoconferencing and streaming. First Virtual Communications is focused on bringing products to market that cover all broadband network types,
particularly IP, ISDN, ATM, and DSL. First Virtual Communications is leveraging its video networking expertise to create products that seamlessly integrate across network standards, alleviating the
burden of integration from the customer. 

    First
Virtual Communications is extending its expertise into rich media communications so that multiple products can be launched and controlled from the same web-based
browser that controls the application. Integrated products include video telephony, audio telephony, video and audio streaming, and data collaboration. 

Make Products Simple to Deploy, Support and Use  

    Historically, the interfaces used to place a videoconferencing call have been proprietary and difficult to use, requiring the user to manually input a variety
of complex and indiscernible information about the call, including such variables as network type, transmission speed and connection bandwidth. The development of web-based user interfaces
allows for the point and click simplicity of a typical 

web-based browser. This simplifies the process and allows rich media communications to be initiated with a single click on a directory name, similar to the simple user experience of
sending an email. 

Integrate Best of Breed Products Through Open Systems and Standards  

    A complete rich media communications solution could consist of the integration of many different products. While it is not the intention of First Virtual
Communications to develop and manufacture all of these products, First Virtual Communications' strategy is to partner with the industry leaders who deliver the best of breed products. First Virtual
Communications has an open platform, providing support for integration into other solutions. First Virtual Communications thus adds value through the development of its own products, as well as
through integration with existing third-party products. 

Exploit Large Under-Served Market Opportunity  

    Massive infrastructure upgrades by carriers and corporations are being driven by the growing need for bigger pipes to carry data applications, and, in
particular, Internet access. Established telecommunications and networking companies have yet to develop a high level of expertise in broadband video networking to service the corporate market. First
Virtual Communications believes that rich media applications will benefit from the build-out of broadband data networks and that these applications are likely to become a strategic revenue
source for carriers, as voice and data increasingly become commodity services. Due to its extensive experience with broadband video networking, First Virtual Communications believes that it is well
positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. 

Expand Deployment of IP-Based Video Networking Products  

    In order to capitalize on the overall growth in the networking market and the trend towards the deployment of end-to-end IP networks,
First Virtual Communications has expanded its product development focus into the IP environment. In 1998, First Virtual Communications introduced one of the first IP to ISDN to ATM gateways and an
IP-based product for video streaming and video-on-demand. First Virtual Communications' current and future product development plans reflect an increased emphasis
on IP-based products. Click to Meet is an IP-centric rich media communications platform. 

Marketing, Sales and Customer Support  

    First Virtual Communications believes that two significant growth areas for its rich media products and services are service providers and enterprises. First
Virtual Communications' products take advantage of broadband networks being implemented in these environments to achieve high quality video transmission and provide a simple, integrated rich media
communications portal. 

    First
Virtual Communications markets its products to business customers, government users and educational providers through its internal sales force and indirect sales channels. First
Virtual Communications' internal sales force uses the company's video technology to directly qualify and stimulate end-user demand, as well as to manage First Virtual Communications'
strategic relationships with value added resellers, or VARs, and systems integrators. A significant portion of First Virtual Communications' sales to date have been fulfilled through its original
equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, including Nortel Networks. Sales through Nortel Networks, including Bay Networks, represented approximately 6% of First Virtual Communications' total sales in 2000,
29% in 1999 and 39% in 1998. OEM's either sell and install First Virtual Communications' products directly or work with leading system integrators to sell and install First Virtual Communications'
products. Systems integrators qualified to sell and install First Virtual Communications' products include Verizon, BT, EDS, France Telecom, Global Telemedics, IBM, SBC Communications, Clover, and
Telindus, among others. 

    First Virtual Communications has international offices in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy. First Virtual Communications also has authorized resellers in Finland, Hong
Kong, The People's Republic of China, Saudi Arabia, and the Netherlands. For the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, approximately 12%, 14% and 21%, respectively, of First Virtual
Communications' sales were generated from customers outside of the United States. 

Research and Development  

    Since its inception, First Virtual Communications has recognized that a strong technical base is essential to its long-term success and has made a
substantial investment in research and development. To date, First Virtual Communications has aggressively brought a wide range of products into the marketplace. First Virtual Communications intends
to continue to make substantial investments in product development and to participate in the development of industry standards. First Virtual Communications monitors changing customer needs and works
closely with its OEM partners, end-user
customers and market research organizations to track changes in the marketplace, including emerging industry standards in both networking and video. First Virtual Communications intends to maintain
its product development focus on products for the two-way video broadband networking market. 

    First
Virtual Communications' research and development expenditures totaled $12.5 million, $10.2 million, and $9.5 million for the years ended December 31,
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. First Virtual Communications performs its research and product development activities primarily at its headquarters in Santa Clara. During the past year, First
Virtual Communications also opened a research and development center in India, which the company believes will improve the time-to-market of new products. 

Competition  

    The rich media communications industry is extremely competitive. There are multiple companies that have separate offerings for video telephony, audio
telephony, data collaboration, and streaming. While there is no one competitor that currently offers all aspects of a rich media solution in an integrated platform, First Virtual Communications
believes that several companies are developing such products. These competitors include PictureTel/1414c, Polycom/Accord, WireOne, RADVision, and Genesys. 

    First
Virtual Communications faces competition from companies that have products in related areas. First Virtual Communications could encounter new competition if companies that
distribute First Virtual Communications' products, or whose interactive video equipment is used together with First Virtual Communications' products, develop or acquire video networking technologies
or products. 

    In
order to compete effectively, First Virtual Communications must offer an end-to-end solution, provide high-performance products and services
that comply with applicable standards and are easy to use, and expand its product distribution channels domestically and internationally. In addition, First Virtual Communications expects price
competition to escalate in the rich media communications industry which may force First Virtual Communications in the future to lower product prices on a regular basis and add new products and
features without increasing prices. First Virtual Communications may not be able to compete successfully in such a price competitive environment. 

Manufacturing  

    First Virtual Communications uses third-party manufacturers to perform materials planning, production scheduling, mechanical assembly, board testing, system
integration, burn-in, final system testing and distribution of its products to customers. First Virtual Communications' operations staff develops manufacturing strategies and qualifies
manufacturing processes and suppliers. First Virtual Communications and its contract manufacturers work together to reduce manufacturing costs and to 

resolve quality control issues. First Virtual Communications' manufacturing strategy enables it to leverage the manufacturing capabilities of its third-party manufacturers, while allowing First
Virtual Communications to focus on its core competencies of rapid product development and deployment. If one or more of First Virtual Communications' manufacturers experiences quality or other
problems, product shipments by First Virtual Communications may be delayed. If First Virtual Communications is required to replace its manufacturers, this could result in short-term cost
increases and delays in delivery that could have a material adverse effect on First Virtual Communications' business, financial condition and results of operations. First Virtual Communications'
supply chain, including reserve inventory buffer stock of critical components, may not be sufficient to meet increases in demand occurring simultaneously with delayed deliveries from manufacturers.
First Virtual Communications may not be able to negotiate acceptable arrangements with its existing or future manufacturers, or negotiate arrangements that will be on terms favorable to First Virtual
Communications. 

Employees  

    As of March 31, 2001, First Virtual Communications employed 152 individuals full-time. In addition, First Virtual Communications employs a
number of temporary, contract employees. First Virtual Communications' employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement and First Virtual Communications believes its relationships
with its employees are good. 

Properties  

    First Virtual Communications is headquartered in Santa Clara, California, where it leases approximately 48,000 square feet of space that houses administrative,
sales and marketing, customer service, operations and product development activities. The space is occupied pursuant to an operating lease that expires in 2009. Additionally, First Virtual
Communications has rental agreements for small sales offices in the United States, Europe and Asia. Rental expense under these facility leases for the
year ended December 31, 2000 was approximately $1.2 million. First Virtual Communications believes that its existing facilities are adequate to meet current needs. 

Legal Proceedings  

    On or about April 9, 1999, several purported class action suits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California
alleging violations of the federal securities laws against First Virtual Communications and certain of its officers and directors in connection with First Virtual Communications' reporting of its
financial results for the period ended December 31, 1998. The court dismissed these actions without leave to amend on February 14, 2000. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the
Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on March 29, 2000. The appeal has been fully briefed by all parties and no date for oral argument has yet been set. 

    On
April 23, 2001, First Virtual Communications received notice of a shareholder's derivative action filed in California Superior Court in the County of Santa Clara, entitled 

Emma L. Flayer, Derivatively, On Behalf of First
Virtual Communications, Inc., Plaintiff, vs. Ralph Ungermann, et. al, Defendants, And First Virtual Communications, Inc.,
Nominal Defendant.
 The Plaintiff alleges that, among other things, certain directors and officers of First Virtual Communications sold shares of First Virtual Communications
stock between January 21, 1999 and April 6, 1999, while in possession of material non-public information pertaining to First Virtual Communications. The Plaintiff alleges that First
Virtual Communications is entitled to recover damages from the defendants by reason of their alleged acts and that the plaintiff is entitled to recover her attorney fees. First Virtual Communications
currently is reviewing the action. 

FIRST VIRTUAL COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

    The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of First Virtual Communications should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this prospectus/joint proxy statement. The discussion in this prospectus/joint proxy statement contains forward-looking statements
that involve risks and uncertainties. First Virtual Communications' actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or
contribute to the differences include, without limitation, those discussed in this section and the sections entitled "Risk Factors," and "Business of First Virtual Communications," as well as those
discussed elsewhere in this prospectus/joint proxy statement. First Virtual Communications assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statements contained herein. 

Overview  

    First Virtual Communications provides equipment and services that enable the delivery of video applications over broadband communications networks. First
Virtual Communications was incorporated in California in October 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in December 1997. First Virtual Communications first shipped its video networking
products in 1995 and announced its video services product offering in September 1999. 

    First
Virtual Communications' revenues in 2000 resulted from the sale of video networking systems and services to enterprise customers and to telecommunications service providers.
First Virtual Communications' internal sales force qualifies and stimulates end-user demand, and manages First Virtual Communications' strategic relationships with its distribution
partners, including OEMs, VARs and systems integrators. In 2000, more than 43% of First Virtual Communications' revenue was derived through its distribution partners, including EDS, Verizon, Avaya,
Williams Communications, Dataserv, AT&T, Clover Technologies and Total Systems Integration. In 1999, more than 75% of First Virtual Communications' revenue was derived through its distribution
partners, including Ameritech (a subsidiary of SBC Communications, Inc.), Bell Atlantic, BT, Cisco, EDS, France Telecom, Ingram Micro, IBM, Nortel, Qwest and Telstra. In 2000, First Virtual
Communications recorded $40.0 million in net revenues, a decrease of 12% compared to the previous year. 

    First
Virtual Communications maintains sales offices in the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy, and distributes its products under the FVC.COM name in both Europe and Asia
through resellers and distributors in more than 25 countries. For the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, approximately 12%, 14% and 21%, respectively, of First Virtual
Communications' sales were generated from customers outside of the United States. First Virtual Communications expects that sales from shipments to customers outside of the United States will continue
to represent a significant portion of its future revenues. In addition, First Virtual Communications believes that a small portion of its sales through OEM's, resellers and integrators are ultimately
sold to international end-users. Revenues from First Virtual Communications' international operations are subject to various risks. To date, First Virtual Communications has not engaged in
any foreign currency hedging activity. 

    Revenues
are recognized upon shipment of products to customers, provided no significant obligations remain, collectibility is probable and returns are estimable. Revenues from sales
to certain of First Virtual Communications' resellers are subject to agreements allowing rights of return and price protection. In these cases, First Virtual Communications provides reserves for
estimated future returns and allowances upon revenue recognition. These reserves are estimated based upon historical rates of returns and allowances, reseller inventory levels, First Virtual
Communications' estimates of sell through by resellers and other related factors. Actual results could differ from these estimates. In the event of the inability to estimate returns from any reseller,
First Virtual Communications defers revenue recognition until the reseller has sold the products to the end-user. 

    Advance payments received from customers and gross margin deferred with respect to sales to resellers wherein First Virtual Communications does not have the ability to estimate
returns are recorded as deferred revenue. At December 31, 2000, deferred revenue was $1.1 million, primarily from contracts for support and maintenance. 

Results of Operations  

    The following table sets forth certain items from First Virtual Communications' consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the
periods indicated. The data set forth below should be read in conjunction with First Virtual Communications' consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

    Revenues.
  Revenues decreased by $5.7 million, or 12%, to $40.0 million in 2000, from
$45.7 million in 1999. Revenue from enterprise customers during the year ended December 31, 2000 declined by $6.3 million, to $31.1 million, principally due to lower sales
of First Virtual Communications' legacy ATM products. This decline was partially offset by an increase in revenue from service providers to $8.9 million, compared to $8.3 million in
1999. This increase was the result of action taken by First Virtual Communications to establish service providers as a meaningful channel for sales of First Virtual
Communications' products. In 1999, revenue increased by $8.4 million, compared to $37.3 million in 1998, primarily as a result of strong demand for First Virtual Communications' products
and the establishment of the service provider channel. 

    Gross Profit.
  Gross profit consists of revenues less the cost of revenues, which includes the costs associated with the
manufacture of First Virtual Communications' products by outside manufacturers and related costs of freight, inventory obsolescence, royalty and warranty. These manufacturers procure the majority of
materials, except for certain key components that First Virtual Communications purchases from third-party vendors. 

    For
the year ending December 31, 2000, gross profit increased by $0.3 million to $17.2 million, or 43% of net revenue, compared to $16.8 million, or 37% of
net revenue, in the previous year. In 2000, First Virtual Communications recorded charges to cost of revenues totaling $2.4 million related to inventory valuation adjustments for certain
products. Excluding this charge from the 2000 results, gross profit increased by $2.7 million. 

    In
1999, gross profit decreased by $1.2 million to $16.8 million, or 37% of net revenue, from $18.0 million, or 48% of net revenue, in 1998. In 1999, First
Virtual Communications recorded charges totaling $5.0 million to cost of revenues inventory valuation adjustment for certain products and product returns reserves related to certain
international resellers. Excluding the charge recorded in 1999, gross margins increased by $3.8 million to $21.9 million or 48% of revenue, compared to the gross profit rate recorded in
1998. 

    Research and Development.
  Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, cost of contractors
and outside consultants, supplies and material expenses, equipment depreciation and overhead costs. Research and development expenses increased to $12.5 million in 2000, an increase of 23% over
the $10.2 million recorded in 1999 and an increase of 32%, or $3.1 million, compared to 1998. As a percentage of total revenues, research and development expenses increased to 31.3% in
2000, from 22.3% in 1999 and 25.4% in 1998. The increases in absolute dollars were principally due to the hiring of additional engineers and consultants for product development, including the start up
of a new software development organization in Hyderabad, India in the third quarter of 2000, and activities associated with First Virtual Communications' Click to MeetTM product introduced
in February 2000. The increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to relatively lower sales compared to research and development expenses. First Virtual
Communications believes that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. However, these expenses will fluctuate depending on various
factors, including the number and types of development projects. 

    Selling, General and Administrative.
  Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) include personnel and related
overhead costs for sales, marketing, finance, human resources and general management. These expenses also include costs of outside contractors, advertising, trade shows and other marketing and
promotional expenses. SG&A increased 13.3% in 2000, to $24.5 million, from $21.6 million in 1999 and $11.9 million in 1998. As a percentage of total revenues, SG&A was 61.2% in
2000, compared to 47.3% in 1999 and 31.9% in 1998. The increase in absolute dollars in 2000 over 1999 and 1999 over 1998 was the result of the expansion of First Virtual Communications' sales and
marketing infrastructure, as well as higher marketing costs associated with advertising and promotional activities, and higher selling costs in 2000 and 1999. The increase in 1999 compared to 1998
also included a charge of $1.2 million to increase the provision for bad debts, related to certain international customers. SG&A also includes non-cash compensation charges relating
to First Virtual Communications' employee stock plans of $267,000 in 2000, $493,000 in 1999, and $589,000 in 1998. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of revenues in 2000 compared to 1999 and 1999
compared to 1998 reflected expense increases that exceeded the rate of revenue growth, including increased spending in administrative functions and spending associated with activities in international
markets. 

    Acquired In-Process Research and Development.
  In August 1998, First Virtual Communications acquired
ICAST Corporation, a developer of software designed for Internet and intranet broadcasting of real-time video, audio and data. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair market values at the date of acquisition as determined by an independent appraisal. The acquired in-process research and development
represents the estimated fair market value, using a risk-adjusted income approach, of specifically identified technologies which had not reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative future uses. The purchase price, including liabilities assumed of $1.8 million, aggregated approximately $7.6 million, of which $4.7 million was allocated to acquired
in-process research and development. 

    At
the time of the acquisition, ICAST was a privately held, development stage company involved in research and development of a low-bit rate software product designed for
Internet and intranet broadcasting of real-time video, audio and data. The value assigned to in-process research and development was based on this research project for which
technological feasibility had not been established. The value was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from this project once commercially viable, discounting the net cash flows back to
their present value and then applying a percentage of completion. 

    The
percentage of completion for this project was determined by comparing both effort expended and research and development costs incurred as of August 1998, to the remaining
effort to be expended and research and development costs to be incurred, based on management's estimates, to bring the project to technological feasibility. Based on these comparisons, management
estimated the project to be approximately 83% complete as of the date of acquisition. The project was substantially 

completed in December 1998. The effort and costs required to complete the project approximated the estimates made by management at the date of acquisition. 

    Other Income (Expense), Net.
  Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest expense relating to First
Virtual Communications' credit facilities and long-term debt, offset in part by interest income earned on short term investments and cash balances. Other income, net totaled
$1.2 million in 2000 and $0.6 million in 1999 and other net (expense) was $42,000 in 1998. 

    The
increase in other income, net in 2000 from 1999 was primarily the result of interest income from the higher average cash balances in 2000 compared to 1999. The change from 1999 to
1998 was primarily due to reduced interest expense on short-term borrowings. 

    Income Taxes.
  As of December 31, 2000, First Virtual Communications had net operating loss carry-forwards for
federal tax purposes of approximately $45.9 million. These carry-forwards, if not utilized to offset future taxable income, will expire at various dates beginning in 2013. In addition, under
the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amount of the benefit that can be carried forward may be limited in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of more
than 50% over a three year period, as defined. No benefit has been recorded for income taxes for any of the periods presented as First Virtual Communications believes that, based on the history of
such losses and other factors, the weight of available evidence indicates that it will not be able to realize the benefit of these net operating losses. Thus, a full valuation reserve has been
recorded. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

    Since inception through the completion of its initial public offering in May 1998, First Virtual Communications financed its operations primarily
through private placements of equity securities and to a lesser extent through credit facilities and long-term debt. 

    On
June 8, 2000, First Virtual Communications issued 27,437 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock in a private placement to Vulcan Ventures Incorporated for an
aggregate purchase price of $27,437,000. The preferred stock is convertible into 3,429,625 shares of common stock of First Virtual Communications. First Virtual Communications also issued a
five-year warrant to Vulcan to purchase 850,000 shares of common stock at $7.00 per share. On the date of issuance, the warrant had an approximate fair market value of $3.7 million
determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The warrant provides anti-dilution protection to Vulcan, including protection in the event First Virtual
Communications issues additional shares of common stock at a price less than $7.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. After fees and expenses, the net proceeds of this issuance of preferred
stock was $24.2 million. 

    As
of December 31, 2000, First Virtual Communications had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $23.9 million and working capital of
$31.7 million. 

    First
Virtual Communications has used cash in its operating activities primarily to fund losses incurred through December 31, 2000 and to finance its working capital needs. 

    Cash
used in operating activities totaled $10.6 million in 2000, reflecting the net loss of $18.8 million and an increase in accounts payable of $1.8 million,
offset in part by reductions of $1.2 million in inventory, $2.3 million in other current assets, and $3.6 million in accounts receivable. Cash used in operating activities totaled
$16.5 million in 1999, reflecting the net loss of $14.3 million and net increases in both inventory and accounts receivable associated with the increase in business activity level in
1999 compared to 1998. 

    Cash
used in investment activities totaled $17.0 million in 2000, primarily due to purchases of short-term investments of $15.9 million and the acquisition
of property and equipment of $1.3 million. Capital expenditures declined from $2.0 million in 1999 to $1.3 million in 2000, and consisted of purchases of computers and related
equipment, furniture and fixtures necessary to support First Virtual Communications' growth. To date, First Virtual Communications has not made significant outlays for capital expenditures because of
its strategy to outsource manufacturing and certain other functions. 

Cash provided by investment activities totaled $6.0 million in 1999, primarily the proceeds from the sale of short-term investments of $8.6 million partially offset by the
acquisition of property and equipment of $2.0 million. Capital expenditures in 1999 were at the same level as 1998, and consisted of purchases of computers and related equipment, furniture and
fixtures necessary to support First Virtual Communications' growth. 

    Cash
provided by financing activities was $27.0 million in 2000, and consisted principally of $24.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and
$3.0 million from the issuance of Common Stock. Cash provided by financing activities was $1.1 million in 1999, and consisted principally of $2.6 million in proceeds from the sale
of common stock through First Virtual Communications' stock option and stock purchase plans, offset in part by the repayment of $1.3 million in notes payable that were assumed by First Virtual
Communications in the acquisition of ICAST in August 1998. 

    First
Virtual Communications believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $23.9 million at December 31, 2000, together with existing sources of
liquidity, will provide adequate cash to fund its current operations for the next 12 months. 

    However,
in order to aggressively pursue business opportunities in the rich media communications business and to have increased flexibility to take advantage of other business
opportunities that are not yet known, First Virtual Communications may be required to seek equity investments from strategic partners and potential strategic partners in the future. Should First
Virtual Communications sell additional equity, the sale may result in dilution to First Virtual Communications' stockholders. Should First Virtual Communications be unsuccessful in its efforts to
raise equity from strategic partners, it may seek additional capital from the public and/or private equity markets that will likely result in dilution of First Virtual Communications' stockholders. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk  

    As of December 31, 2000, First Virtual Communications held a total of $23.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments. These securities, which consist primarily of U.S. government securities, municipal notes and corporate bonds, are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market
interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by ten percent from levels as of December 31, 2000, the decline in fair value of the portfolio would
not be material. 

    First
Virtual Communications transacts substantially all of its operations in United States dollars and therefore is not subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
Accordingly, First Virtual Communications currently does not use derivative financial instruments. First Virtual Communications has no fixed rate obligations except for capitalized leases of
approximately $119,000. As such, First Virtual Communications is not subject to an adverse material impact from changes in interest rates. 

New Accounting Pronouncements  

    In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," or SFAS No. 133. The new standard requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value.
Under SFAS No. 133, gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of derivatives are to be reported in the statement of operations or as a deferred item, depending
on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting. The key criterion for hedge accounting is that the derivative must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in
fair value or cash flows of the hedged items during the term of the hedge. In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137, "Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement Number 133," to
defer for one year the effective date of implementation of SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 137, is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2000, with earlier application encouraged. To date, First Virtual Communications has not engaged in any foreign currency hedging activity and does not expect the adoption of this new standard in the
first quarter of 2001 to have a significant impact on First Virtual Communications.

BUSINESS OF CUSEEME    

Overview  

    CUseeMe develops and markets software products that enable voice and video communications over the Internet and networks based on the Internet Protocol, or IP.
CUseeMe provides integrated software solutions for large-scale deployments of voice and video communications to computer desktops. These solutions facilitate standards-based communications and
collaboration, both between individual participants and among groups of participants, over the Internet, corporate intranets and virtual private networks. 

    CUseeMe's
products include: CUseeMe Conference Server, a software-based multipoint control unit, or MCU, that supports IP-based conferences among multiple participants;
and CUseeMe Pro, an IP-based desktop videoconferencing client software. In late March 2001, CUseeMe introduced CUseeMe Videoware, which provides a rich media communications
environment for desktop conferencing that can be integrated with an enterprise's existing messaging and collaboration environments such as Microsoft Exchange and Outlook. CUseeMe's CUseeMe Web
software developer's toolkit, which is also
an integrated component of CUseeMe Videoware, enables web developers to embed interactive voice, video, collaboration and conference control features into web pages or Internet-based applications. 

    CUseeMe's
customers include enterprisessuch as businesses, including service providers and portals, educational institutions and government organizationsas
well as individual consumers. CUseeMe sells its software products to these customers and to original equipment manufacturers that bundle CUseeMe's software with other products. CUseeMe works with
system integrators, value-added resellers and other partners to deploy its solutions worldwide. 

    CUseeMe
was incorporated under Delaware law in April 1992 under the name Visual International Inc. CUseeMe changed its name to White Pine Software, Inc. in
December 1993 and to CUseeMe Networks, Inc. in May 2000. 

Industry Background  

    Over the past decade, many large businesses have invested significantly in dedicated, circuit-switched videoconferencing systems and supporting networks
maintained by dedicated technical support personnel. These businesses have recognized the value of meeting face-to-face with key constituents such as employees, customers and
suppliers and, in particular, of facilitating interaction with branch operations and remote workers. Many have sought to justify the significant costs of these systems by the increased productivity
that can result from employees spending less time away from the office, as well as reduced employee travel costs and shortened customer decision-making cycles. Despite these benefits, however, the
businesses typically have deployed these circuit-switched systems on a limited basis, with use restricted principally to specifically configured corporate locations that are accessible only by
higher-level managers. Because these systems are difficult and not intuitive to use, even personnel with access typically use the systems only for limited purposes. 

    In
recent years, businesses and other enterprises have begun to demand less costly, broad-based implementations of real-time, group multimedia communications. New
communications standards and advances in computer technologyincluding faster processors, better audio and video compression schemes, and access to high speed broadband
networkshave made it feasible to integrate audio and video cost-effectively into the personal computing environment. 

    Moreover,
as the Internet has continued to experience dramatic growth in the number of users and as a means of conducting business, many enterprises have begun to make substantial
investments in developing the infrastructure necessary to take advantage of the power and accessibility of the Internet and other IP-based networks. These enterprises increasingly are
seeking to leverage their existing local
and wide area networks as well as the Internet to bring voice, video and data conferencing to their employees for use in a variety of business applications or to enhance a variety of interactions. 

    Hosted web collaboration services, for example, are frequently proprietary and not interoperable with standards-based videoconferencing systems, preventing enterprises from leveraging
their earlier investments in videoconferencing systems. Other existing IP-based solutions address only discrete voice, video or web collaboration needs and do not support the broad,
integrated range of multimedia communications increasingly required by commercial enterprises. None of these solutions, for example, offers interactive video. These stand-alone solutions are not
incorporated into an enterprise's workflow, and they are not easily integrated with other communications solutions. As a result, the implementation and maintenance of separate solutions for voice,
video and data communication needs can be complicated and expensive, requiring significant information technology, or IT, resources from external vendors or internal staff. 

    To
take advantage of the power and accessibility of IP-based networks for conducting multimedia communications, enterprises require solutions that can seamlessly provide
voice, video and data collaboration, also known as rich media communications. These rich media solutions must comply with existing and emerging communications standards in order to be interoperable
with rich media client applications that are, or will become, available from a variety of vendors. 

CUseeMe's Solution  

    CUseeMe develops and markets software products that enable voice and video communications over IP-based networks. All of CUseeMe's product
offerings are built upon its core client/server technologies. They are targeted, however, at distinct audiences or environments that require particular applications, features and integration
capabilities. CUseeMe is currently focusing on three target markets: 


Videoconferencing
 is the traditional market for MCUs. This market generally consists of enterprises that
have already installed videoconferencing clients, either in conference rooms or on desktop computers, and that need MCUs to facilitate multipoint conferencing. Many of these enterprises are seeking to
migrate from conferencing solutions based on the Integrated Services Digital Network, or ISDN, to IP-based conferencing. CUseeMe's software-based MCU, CUseeMe Conference Server, supports
conferences among groups of end-users and is offered with a number of options for additional conferencing functionality, including Continuous Presence, Streaming Media, Meeting Controller
and Conferencing for Microsoft Exchange. 

Videochat
 is the market for informal video communication over the Internet. This market generally consists
of individual consumers who connect from their residences and who use the Internet to keep in touch with family and friends and to meet new people and participate in videochat rooms. CUseeMe's desktop
video collaboration software, CUseeMe Pro, and CUseeMe's public videochat site, CUseeMe World, facilitate these communications. 

Rich media communications
 is an
emerging interactive, web-based voice, video and data collaboration market
that adds an existing workflow environment such as an enterprise's intranet, instant messaging platform or groupware package. Customers in this market typically have had little, if any, prior
experience with videoconferencing and are seeking to enhance their existing communications environments through the addition of live voice and video and various forms of collaboration. In
March 2001, CUseeMe introduced CUseeMe Videoware, which includes both client and server technologies for enterprise-wide deployment of web-based voice and video
communications and group collaboration to desktop computers. CUseeMe Videoware provides a rich media communications environment for desktop conferencing that can be integrated with an enterprise's
existing messaging and collaboration systems. 

    CUseeMe has designed its software products to provide the following benefits to customers in its targeted markets: 

    End-To-End Breadth.
  CUseeMe believes that it is the only vendor to offer a complete
IP-based software voice and video communications solution for both client and server applications. By enabling both an end-user's experience on a desktop computer and
back-end server functionality, CUseeMe's solutions are able to offer control across the full spectrum of communications and collaboration. CUseeMe's end-to-end
solution also enables a tighter integration of client and server applications than is typically achieved with traditional mix-and-match conferencing environments. 

    Significant Cost Savings.
  CUseeMe's software products enable enterprises to increase the productivity of their
employees, while reducing travel and telecommunications costs. By offering voice and video communications products that require no proprietary hardware, CUseeMe is able to offer its solutions at a
substantially lower price than vendors of traditional hardware-based systems. Because CUseeMe's solutions are based on industry standards for interoperability, enterprises can leverage their existing
videoconferencing resources, especially in environments that are making the transition from ISDN-based to IP-based conferencing. CUseeMe Videoware has been designed to provide a complete
end-to-end solution that avoids the need for "mix and match" component solutions and the attendant installation and integration costs. 

    Ease of Deployment and Use.
  CUseeMe's solutions are centrally deployed and managed, which enables them to be
implemented without the need to install and configure software separately on every user's desktop computer. CUseeMe's solutions are designed to be easy to use by any end-user who is
familiar with the universal web browser interfaces. CUseeMe's solutions essentially use the browser as a default interface. In addition, by integrating CUseeMe's videoconferencing solution with the
calendar, scheduling, user directory and other capabilities of Microsoft Exchange and Outlook, CUseeMe is able to take advantage of users' familiarity with these popular collaboration packages. 

    Scalability.
  CUseeMe's solutions can be implemented efficiently and economically across multiple locations because they
are software-based and centrally deployed. CUseeMe's MCUs can be configured with different numbers of conferencing ports and placed strategically throughout a network, mapping intelligently to the
network architecture to improve performance and lower bandwidth usage. CUseeMe's web-based client software can be widely deployed to desktop computers because it is automatically installed
the first time a user connects to a conference, eliminating the need for a separate client installation on each desktop computer. 

    Flexibility and Customization.
  CUseeMe's client technology provides a customer with flexibility in defining
end-users' conferencing experiences. By choosing from a variety of standard web page templates or custom-creating specific user interfaces, customers can adapt CUseeMe's client software in
a way that fits seamlessly within their existing web environments and meets their users' needs. CUseeMe's CUseeMe Web technology makes it possible for users to access different web conferencing
interfaces for different kinds of communications such as training sessions, weekly team meetings and ad-hoc communications. Each web interface that is created can be adapted to provide a
number of video windows, and a layout and mix of collaboration tools appropriate to meet the needs of a particular conferencing environment. 

    Enhanced Functionality.
  In addition to CUseeMe's core client end server products, it offers a variety of options
intended to enhance the functionality of CUseeMe's solution for different users. For example, CUseeMe supplements its MCU offering with options that include continuous presence, which provides
enterprises with increased flexibility and control by allowing users to view four video windows simultaneously, rather than just a single window, and streaming media integration, which enables
interactive conferences to be streamed live to view-only participants or recorded for playback on demand. Microsoft Outlook scheduling is also available as an option with the MCU, allowing 

enterprises to schedule, manage and update online conferencing within the Microsoft Outlook environment. Similarly, CUseeMe Videoware provides seamless integration with the Microsoft Exchange and
Outlook environment. 

CUseeMe's Strategy  

    CUseeMe's goal is to be the leading provider of software products that enable voice and video communications over the Internet and IP-based
networks. CUseeMe's strategies to achieve this objective include: 

    Maintain Technology Leadership.
  All of CUseeMe's software products are designed and developed to operate within an IP
environment. CUseeMe believes this approach has provided it with technological advantages over other vendors, which must migrate from traditional ISDN-based technologies to the IP
environment. Industry periodicals have recognized CUseeMe's technology leadership in granting awards to its client and server products and technologies. CUseeMe intends to build upon its technology
leadership by developing products that support important emerging technologies, such as multicast, which is already supported by the CUseeMe Conference Server, and session initiation protocol, or SIP,
a new Internet Engineering Task Force protocol for the establishment, modification and termination of
conferencing and telephony sessions over IP-based networks. SIP offers the potential to be much faster, more scalable and easier to implement that H.323, and CUseeMe believes that it will
become the predominant standard for voice and video over the Internet. 

    Facilitate Integrated Voice and Video Communications.
  CUseeMe is focused on providing software products that enhance
existing modes of communication and collaboration, rather than require users to learn complex videoconferencing applications that force them to step outside of their everyday workflow. The traditional
approach of providing videoconferencing as a stand-alone application has failed to make video communications compelling, easy-to-use or accessible on a broad scale. CUseeMe's
approach will allow interactive rich media capabilities to be added to a corporate network without introducing new applications on the desktop. CUseeMe is seeking to enhance existing forms of
communication by integrating desktop conferencing needs into existing directory services, web-based intranets and groupware, as well as instant messaging and other corporate communications
applications deployed in an enterprise. The CUseeMe Videoware, which became commercially available in late March 2001, is designed to provide a rich media communications environment that can
interface with enterprises' existing applications and workflow. 

    Support Standards Implementation for Interoperability.
  All of CUseeMe's software products are based on industry
standards for interoperability. This allows them to be interoperable with other clients and devices, either directly or via gateways, so that an enterprise implementing CUseeMe's solutions can
leverage its legacy videoconferencing resources as well as communications beyond an IP-based network. CUseeMe will continue to implement standards-based functionality into upcoming
releases of its videoconferencing, videochat and videoware products. 

    Target Enterprise Markets.
  CUseeMe believes that enterprises such as businesses, educational institutions and
government organizations will account for the most significant growth in voice and video communications and collaboration for the foreseeable future. Enterprises tend to be earlier adopters of new
technologies that provide significant productivity enhancements, and they present opportunities for broad-scale deployments. CUseeMe has developed functionality within its products, such as
centralized deployment, that targets the special needs of enterprises. CUseeMe will, however, selectively pursue opportunities in the consumer market, since CUseeMe believes its experience in selling
software into this market and in addressing the open Internet has provided it with a deeper understanding of the needs of end-users and thereby helped CUseeMe to make its technologies
easier to use and more robust. 

    Broaden Sales Channels.
  As the result of CUseeMe's recent focus on integrated voice and video communications and web
collaboration, CUseeMe is seeking to expand its traditional channel program to include systems integrators, value-added resellers, service providers, and original equipment
manufacturers. For example, in seeking to sell solutions based on desktop integration, CUseeMe intends to work with value-added resellers and systems integrators that deliver desktop solutions to
enterprises and those that provide integration for groupware environments such as Microsoft Exchange and Outlook. Broader sales channels also can provide CUseeMe with opportunities to
cost-effectively expand its selling efforts both to particular segments of the enterprise market, such as governmental institutions, and to enterprises located outside the United States.
In March 2001, CUseeMe announced its new channel program called Alliance Partners Excel, or APEX, which is intended to enable system integrators, value-added resellers and service providers
worldwide to include integrated rich media communications in the overall mix of their product and service offerings. 

CUseeMe's Products  

    CUseeMe develops and markets software products that enable voice and video communications over the Internet and IP-based networks. With over a
decade of IP-based communications experience, CUseeMe is a technology leader in interactive voice and video collaboration. CUseeMe's award-winning technologies and products facilitate
standards-based collaborative communications, both between individual participants and among groups of participants, over the Internet, corporate intranets, and virtual private networks. 

    All
of CUseeMe's products are based upon its core technology suite. CUseeMe's core technologies are all software-based and can be applied to a variety of applications, either
"out-of-the-box" or customized for particular situations. With these core technologies, CUseeMe can enable web-based or stand-alone applications for
voice and video. CUseeMe has extended and enhanced its core client and server technologies through years of development and experience. 

    All
of CUseeMe's products support industry standards for interoperability, which allows them to be interoperable with other clients and devices, either directly or via gateways. As a
result, an enterprise implementing CUseeMe's solutions can leverage its legacy videoconferencing resources as well as communications beyond an IP-based network. The key standards that
CUseeMe's products support have been established by the International Telecommunications Union, or ITU, and include: 


H.323
which defines standards for the implementation of real-time voice and video communications and conferencing over packet-based networks
and thereby provides a common protocol that allows communications products offered by different vendors to work together; and


T.120
which defines a protocol for whiteboard, application sharing and data collaboration for multipoint conferencing applications. 

    In
addition, CUseeMe supports indirectly, via gateways, additional standards such as ITU H.320, a protocol for the implementation of communication and conferencing for
ISDN-based products. 

    CUseeMe
has created its own videochat web site, CUseeMe World, to showcase its core technologies. CUseeMe World enables users to experience CUseeMe's technology by participating in
public videochat rooms. Users can join existing videochat rooms or create their own videochat rooms on-the-fly. Since CUseeMe World became available to the public in 1999, its
membership has grown to nearly 340,000 users and videochat participation has increased to an average of approximately 300 concurrent users. CUseeMe World provides CUseeMe with feedback on marketing
and development issues by allowing it to monitor behavior and usage. This feedback has, for example, helped CUseeMe make its technology and products more intuitive and user-friendly.
CUseeMe World has also provided an environment in which CUseeMe can perform pre-release testing of new products or product versions for scalability and performance. 

CUseeMe Web Toolkit  

    CUseeMe offers a software developer's toolkit that enables web developers to embed interactive voice, video and text features into web pages or Internet-based
applications. This toolkit is part of the CUseeMe Web technology, which is an integrated component of CUseeMe Videoware. The toolkit can be used to enhance a web site or application by adding
multimedia communications such as videochat, videoconferencing and collaboration, interactive electronic commerce and help desk functionality, and instant messaging. Developers can determine how many
video windows to include and whether users can send video and audio or simply receive them. As a toolkit, this product allows developers to embed multimedia components into web pages while maintaining
the web site's own branding, look and feel. 

    The
CUseeMe Web toolkit can be used by internal web development resources to customize the CUseeMe Web technology underlying the toolkit and adapt that technology into their current
web environment. Alternatively, enterprises can choose to have the entire process handled by a systems integrator or other third-party vendor. 

    After
a web site has been enhanced using CUseeMe Web technology, end users can access the embedded multimedia features through the web site, using a free plug-in. The
plug-in automatically installs on the user's desktop computer when the user accesses a CUseeMe Web-enabled web page for
the first time, eliminating the need for a separate client installation or configuration on the end user's desktop computer. 

    CUseeMe

CUseeMe Conference Server  

    CUseeMe Conference Server was introduced in December 2000 and represents the third generation of CUseeMe's server product, or MCU. CUseeMe's initial MCU
software, the Reflector, became commercially available in 1997. Its successor, MeetingPoint, became commercially available in 1997 and was the first H.323-based software MCU. 

    CUseeMe
Conference Server is a software-only MCU that enables rich media group conferencing with a variety of clients. CUseeMe Conference Server can create a virtual
conference room over any IP-based network using H.323 and T.120 conferencing standards. In addition to being compatible with H.323 clients, CUseeMe Conference Server is interoperable with
standards-based voice-over-IP audio clients and can connect, via gateways, to legacy ISDN-based H.320 videoconferencing clients and to standard phone connections.
This interoperability allows enterprises to leverage their existing conferencing resources, especially in environments that are making the transition from ISDN conferencing, and to extend
communication beyond IP-based networks. 

    Multiple
CUseeMe Conference Servers can be linked together for large conference deployments or to optimize the flow of data between branch offices and other remote locations. As a
result, it can scale to meet an enterprise's growing requirements. CUseeMe Conference Server supports conferencing in a number of server environments, including Windows NT, Windows 2000, Sun Solaris
and Linux operating systems. 

    CUseeMe offers a number of options to extend the functionality of CUseeMe Conference Server: 


Continuous Presence
 allows standard H.323 clients to receive up to four video windows simultaneously,
instead of just one. If there are more than four participants in the conference, a user can choose to have the video switched by voice, displaying the last four active speakers, or by a specified
increment of time. A user also can choose to anchor one or more specific participants and let the other video panes switch between the remaining participants.


Streaming Media
 can be used to stream a live, interactive conference out to a large number of
view-only participants or to record a conference for future playback on demand. The streaming media add-on provides a bridge between H.323-based conferencing and
streaming media server/player technologies, such as Microsoft's Windows media and Real Networks' RealPlayer. CUseeMe believes that it is the only H.323 MCU vendor to offer streaming media integration.


Meeting Controller
 provides a toolbar for controlling meeting interaction features for live, multipoint
videoconferencing. This add-on gives each participant in the conference the ability to control the participant's experience, regardless of the H.323 client being used by the participant.
Meeting Controller makes it easy for participants to join a conference and invite other participants to join. It also includes specialized features such as moderation and the ability to "lock in"
selected participants' audio and video.


Microsoft Outlook Scheduling
, which was introduced in December 2000, integrates CUseeMe Conference
Server with a Microsoft Exchange 2000 Conferencing Server. This add-on enables standards-based group conferencing to be scheduled, managed and updated by users within the Microsoft Outlook
environment. Users can enter into a virtual conference room by clicking on the meeting in their calendar, making desktop conferencing more accessible to users through their standard workflow. 

    CUseeMe
Conference Server pricing begins at a suggested retail price of $8,995 for a ten-port server. Continuous Presence and Streaming Integration options are available
as add-ons at a suggested retail price of $4,995 each, and the Microsoft Outlook Scheduling option is available at a suggested retail price of $3,995. The Meeting Controller option,
available only for the Windows 2000/NT version of the CUseeMe Conference Server, is priced beginning at $4,495 for ten users. 

    CUseeMe's
MCU software has received the following industry awards:

CUseeMe Pro  

    CUseeMe Pro is CUseeMe's desktop video collaboration software for both Windows and Macintosh operating systems. CUseeMe Pro installs on a desktop computer and
works with a variety of video cameras. Users can display up to 12 video windows and can share documents using applications sharing and whiteboard features. They can connect to a virtual conference
room via the CUseeMe Conference Server. 

    CUseeMe
Pro is targeted to the consumer market. It can also provide a cost-effective alternative for professionals who do not require the enhanced functionality and
features offered by CUseeMe Web 

technology. CUseeMe Pro is available at a suggested retail price of $69. CUseeMe Pro also may be included in webcam bundles offered from time to time by third parties. 

CUseeMe Videoware  

    CUseeMe Videoware, which became commercially available in late March 2001, is a rich media communications environment that interfaces with existing
messaging and collaboration environments. CUseeMe Videoware includes both client and server technologies for enterprise-wide deployment of web-based voice and video
communications and group collaboration to the desktop. CUseeMe Videoware allows enterprises to leverage their legacy videoconferencing investments because it is interoperable with standards-based
clients, including H.323 clients, H.320 clients and telephone connections via gateways. 

    While
videoconferencing traditionally has been treated as a stand-alone application, CUseeMe Videoware is designed to integrate with existing email, scheduling and workflow
environments, either through messaging and collaboration packages such as Microsoft Exchange and Outlook or through an enterprise's intranet or web-based instant messaging. 

    CUseeMe
Videoware currently includes technologies to enable web touring, streaming media, continuous presence for non-web-based endpoints and web templates for
a variety of communications applications. CUseeMe intends to add integrated video instant messaging capabilities to the next version of CUseeMe Videoware. 

    CUseeMe
Videoware is available in two versions: CUseeMe Videoware, which is available for Windows NT, Windows 2000, Sun Solaris and Linux servers, and CUseeMe Videoware for Microsoft
Exchange, which is available only for Windows 2000 servers. CUseeMe's pricing model for CUseeMe Videoware parallels pricing for enterprise messaging and collaboration packages, including both an
application server license and user access licenses. CUseeMe Videoware pricing begins at $39,995 for an application server license for 25 users. The required user access licenses start at $79 per
user. 

Research and Development  

    Since the sale of CUseeMe's legacy connectivity business line in February 2000, all of CUseeMe's research and development has been focused on group
conferencing technology. CUseeMe's research and development expenditures totalled $5.8 million in 2000 and $4.8 million in 1999, including expenditures on research and development
contractors of $404,000 in 2000 and $253,000 in 1999. 

    CUseeMe
expects that its total expenditures for research and development in 2001 will be relatively flat as compared to 2000, although the actual amount will depend on a number of
factors, including the level of market acceptance of CUseeMe's current products, its ability to fill personnel requisitions on a timely basis, and the rate of technological change in the group
conferencing industry. 

Marketing and Distribution  

    CUseeMe historically has marketed and sold its products through a combination of strategic partners, distributors and original equipment manufacturers, its
direct sales organization, and directly over the Internet. As the result of CUseeMe's recent focus on integrated voice and video communications, CUseeMe is seeking to expand its traditional channel
program to include systems integrators, value-added resellers, service providers and additional original equipment manufacturers. CUseeMe's new APEX channel program is intended to enable system
integrators, value-added resellers and service providers worldwide to include integrated rich media communications in overall mix of their product and service offerings. 

    CUseeMe
has established distribution relationships in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea,
Netherlands, Norway, 

Slovania, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. CUseeMe has also formed original equipment manufacturer or bundling relationships in order to provide customers with turnkey
solutions and to facilitate product sales through distribution channels. Since 1996, CUseeMe has engaged Tech Data and Ingram Micro as distributors to deliver its desktop videoconferencing client
software to consumers through retail channels, including store chains and superstores. In March 2001, CUseeMe received a 60-day termination notice from Tech Data. CUseeMe does not
expect that the termination of its distribution relationship with Tech Data will have a material adverse effect on its business. 

    CUseeMe's
sales force is located in Nashua, New Hampshire, and La Gaude, France. As of March 1, 2001, CUseeMe had 36 full-time sales and marketing employees. 

    CUseeMe
maintains web sites where prospective customers can obtain information about its products and services and download CUseeMe's multimedia conferencing products. CUseeMe
conducts marketing programs, including direct mail, advertising, public relations and product literature, to support each of its sale channels and to position and promote its products and services.
Marketing personnel provide price lists and product descriptions and assist the direct sales force through lead generation and sales training. 

Customer Service and Support  

    CUseeMe is committed to maintaining customer satisfaction and loyalty. CUseeMe employs technical customer representatives located in Nashua, New Hampshire to
support and service its customer base. Some of CUseeMe's distributors and original equipment manufacturer customers maintain separate customer support organizations for their own customers. CUseeMe
provides second-tier support to those organizations. 

    CUseeMe
provides customer support via telephone, fax and e-mail during normal business hours for its warranty product customers. CUseeMe also offers a variety of
fee-based maintenance and support options, including an option for support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and automatic shipments of all enhancements and upgrades for
licensed products. To augment its optional support services, CUseeMe provides searchable online frequently asked questions and answers, as well as a searchable knowledge base. CUseeMe monitors a
number of third-party mail lists and related web sites in order to ensure technical accuracy for its products. Customer support specialists diagnose and solve technical problems related not only to
CUseeMe's products but also to other hardware and software with which its products may interact. CUseeMe tracks all support requests, including current status reports and historical customer
interaction logs, using a series of customer databases. CUseeMe uses customer feedback as a source of ideas for product improvements and enhancements. 

    CUseeMe
charges CUseeMe customers for technical support on a per-incident basis if they are not covered by a maintenance contract. 

Proprietary Rights  

    CUseeMe's success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary technology. CUseeMe currently has no patents and relies primarily on copyright, trademark and trade
secrets law, as well as employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, to protect its intellectual property. CUseeMe has applied for a patent on a portion of the technology underlying
the continuous presence feature of CUseeMe Conference Server. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by CUseeMe to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation
of its technology or independent development by others of similar technology. Litigation may be necessary to enforce CUseeMe's intellectual property rights or to protect its trade secrets. Any such
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on CUseeMe's business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, while
CUseeMe believes that its products and 

technology do not infringe the proprietary rights of others, third parties may assert infringement and other claims against CUseeMe. 

    In
1998 CUseeMe acquired ownership of some of the key technologies embedded in its software offerings: 


In
July 1998, CUseeMe purchased intellectual property rights and other selected assets comprising T.120 whiteboard and data collaboration technology
from Labtam Communications, an Australian corporation. CUseeMe has incorporated the purchased T.120 technology into its CUseeMe Conference Server.


CUseeMe's
multimedia conferencing products, CUseeMe Pro and CUseeMe Conference Server, are commercial, enhanced versions of Freeware CUseeMe and its
related server. Freeware CUseeMe and its related server were developed by a research institute at Cornell University. In June 1995, CUseeMe had entered into a software license agreement with
the Cornell Research Foundation that granted it the exclusive worldwide right to develop, modify, market, distribute and sublicense commercial versions of Freeware CUseeMe and its related server, as
well as the rights to appoint licensee distributors and to use the trademark "CUseeMe." In November 1998, CUseeMe acquired the Cornell Research Foundation's trademark and other intellectual
property rights in Freeware CUseeMe and the related server technology, in lieu of continuing to license those rights. The purchase price for these rights consisted of (1) a note in the
principal amount of $900,000, of which $300,000 is due on each of June 30, 2000, June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2002, and (2) warrants to purchase 150,000 shares of CUseeMe's
common stock at a price of $1.00 per share.


In
December 1998, CUseeMe acquired from RADVision a one-time source code snapshot of a H.323 protocol stack. This acquisition has
allowed CUseeMe to modify and enhance source code embedded in its products. 

Competition  

    The market for multimedia group conferencing products is extremely competitive, and CUseeMe expects that competition will intensify in the future. CUseeMe
believes that the principal competitive factors in the multimedia group conferencing industry are price, video and audio quality, interoperability, functionality, reliability, service and support,
hardware platforms supported, and vendor and product reputation. CUseeMe believes that its ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors both within and outside CUseeMe's control,
including the adoption and evolution of industry standards, the pricing policies of its competitors and suppliers, the timing of the introduction of new software products and services by CUseeMe and
others, its ability to hire and retain quality employees, and industry and general economic trends. In addition, because the barriers to entry in CUseeMe's market are relatively low and the potential
market is large, CUseeMe anticipates continued growth in the industry and the entrance of new competitors in the future. 

    In
offering Internet communications products and services, CUseeMe currently competes, or expects to compete, directly or indirectly with the following categories of providers: 


H.323
MCU vendors, such as Accord, Ezenia!, PictureTel and RADVision;


videoconferencing
client vendors, such as Microsoft NetMeeting, Polycom, PictureTel, VTEL and VCON;


non-videoconferencing
collaborative product vendors, such as Astound, Centra, Placeware and WebEx; and


application
service providers, such as Evoke, PictureTel and WebEx. 

    The
H.323 MCU market encompasses two types of MCUs: a software-only server and a hardware server. There is a substantial price variance between software and hardware
servers, which tends to dictate the suitability of one or the other in specific situations. From a price and scalability standpoint, the software server lends itself well to large, distributed and
expandable deployments, whereas the hardware server is often best suited to finite centralized deployments. CUseeMe, PictureTel, and Ezenia! market the only software-only MCUs; Accord,
Ezenia! and RADvision market hardware MCUs. Most of these providers work with third-party clients. CUseeMe and PictureTel are the only vendors offering both client and server products. 

    As
with MCUs, client vendors can be split into software or hardware categories. In the software client category, CUseeMe Pro competes with Microsoft NetMeeting. PictureTel, Polycom,
VCON and VTEL all provide hardware clients. The hardware assist typically allows the hardware clients to demonstrate performance superior to software-only clients, but these clients are
marketed at a $1,000 to $12,000 price point. PolyCom ViewStation and the PictureTel 900 series are hardware-based endpoints. Sales of these products are targeted to the high-end
videoconferencing enterprise market. Integrators and value-added resellers wrap solutions around hardware-based endpoints, using their application programmer interface, along with CUseeMe Conference
Server's application programmer interface, to provide solutions to enterprises. This includes distance learning and videoconferencing service offerings. 

    The
disparate non-videoconferencing category encompasses semi-interactive presentation software solutions. Semi-interactive presentation software
solutions is a broad term utilized here to represent products integrating streaming with some form of limited interactive technology. These products combine streaming media, shared text and separate
telephony integration in one solution. 

    In
the emerging application service provider market, PictureTel offers conferencing services to its business-to-business customers, WebEx primarily
concentrates its services in the data collaboration area, and EVC offers educational content conferencing services. 

    H.323
is being rapidly adopted by the industry as the global standard for group conferencing products. A number of companies, including Ezenia!, PictureTel and RADVision, have
announced standards-based server products that compete directly with CUseeMe Conference Server. It is likely that other companies will also enter this market in the near future. 

    Many
of CUseeMe's current and potential competitors, including Microsoft, PictureTel and Ezenia!, have significantly longer operating histories and significantly greater managerial,
financial, marketing, technical and other competitive resources, as well as greater name recognition, than CUseeMe does. As a result, CUseeMe's competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or
emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion
and sale of their products and services. CUseeMe may not be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors. In addition, competition could increase if new companies enter the market or
if existing competitors expand their service offerings. An increase in competition could result in material price reductions or loss of market share by CUseeMe and could have a material adverse effect
on CUseeMe's business, financial condition and results of operations. 

    To
remain competitive, CUseeMe must continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing. CUseeMe may not have sufficient resources to make those investments or may
not succeed in making the technological advances necessary to be competitive. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish collaborative relationships
among themselves or with third parties, including third parties with which CUseeMe has a relationship, to increase the visibility and utility of their products and services. Accordingly, it is
possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire a significant market share, which could have a material adverse effect on CUseeMe's business, financial condition and results
of operations. 

Employees  

    At March 1, 2001, CUseeMe had 126 full-time employees, including 55 in research and development, 36 in sales and marketing, 14 in technical
support, and 21 in general and administrative and software manufacturing. Sixteen of these employees were located in France and, in accordance with applicable French law, were represented by a labor
union. CUseeMe also has seven part-time employees in the United States. CUseeMe's other employees were located in the United States and were not represented by any labor organization.
CUseeMe has experienced no work stoppages and believes that its relations with its employees are good. 

Facilities  

    CUseeMe conducts its operations from its headquarters in Nashua, New Hampshire and La Gaude, France. CUseeMe's facility in New Hampshire contains approximately
27,000 square feet, including 23,500 square feet for engineering and office space, 2,500 square feet for production space and 1,000 square feet for storage. CUseeMe leases its office in New Hampshire
from an unaffiliated party under the terms of a five-year lease ending July 2001 pursuant to which CUseeMe is responsible for maintenance, repairs, taxes, insurance and utilities.
Base rent is $82,000 for the first half of 2001. In February 2001, CUseeMe exercised a renewal option for one two-year term. Base rent for the renewal is estimated to be $84,000 for
2001, $168,000 for 2002 and $84,000 for 2003. 

    The
facility in La Gaude, France contains approximately 8,000 square feet of engineering and office space. CUseeMe leases its office in France from several unaffiliated parties under
a series of similar leases ending on December 31, 2001, under which CUseeMe is responsible for maintenance, repairs, taxes, insurance and utilities. Base rent for this space is $7,200 for 2001. 

    CUseeMe
previously occupied 5,000 square feet of engineering and office space at a site in San Jose, California. This space is subleased to an unaffiliated party under the terms of a
five-year lease ending December 31, 2001. Base rent for this space is $89,000 for 2001. CUseeMe's base income under the sublease exceeds its base rent under the primary lease. 

    CUseeMe
expects to extend or renew the leases for its main facility in New Hampshire and its facilities in France and to continue to occupy those facilities for the foreseeable
future. If CUseeMe is unable to extend or renew those leases on acceptable terms, CUseeMe believes that alternative space would be available at acceptable rates. 

Legal Proceedings  

    From time to time, CUseeMe has received and may receive in the future notice of claims of infringement of other parties' proprietary rights. Although CUseeMe
believes that its products and technology do not infringe the proprietary rights of others, additional third parties may assert infringement and other claims against CUseeMe in the future. 

CUSEEME MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

    The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. CUseeMe's actual results could differ materially from those
discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Business of CUseeMe," as well
as those discussed elsewhere in this prospectus/joint proxy statement. 

Overview  

    CUseeMe develops and markets software products that enable voice and video communications over the Internet and IP-based networks. In order to
focus exclusively on these products, CUseeMe sold the assets of its legacy connectivity business to a subsidiary of Powerlan, a publicly held Australian company, in February 2000. 

    CUseeMe
derives revenue from the sale of software product licenses and from related services. Software license fees are derived from licenses for CUseeMe Pro, CUseeMe's
videoconferencing client software; CUseeMe Conference Server (and its earlier release, CUseeMe MeetingPoint), CUseeMe's group conferencing server; and the CUseeMe Web toolkit, CUseeMe's software
developer's toolkit for embedding multimedia components into web pages. CUseeMe's services revenues are derived solely from services relating to CUseeMe Conference Server and consist principally of
post-contract customer support fees. 

    CUseeMe
recognizes revenue in accordance with Statement of Position No. 97-2, 
Software Revenue Recognition,
 as
amended. Software license revenue is recognized upon receipt of a firm customer order and shipment of the software, net of allowances for estimated future returns, provided that no significant
obligations remain on CUseeMe's part, the fee is fixed and determinable, and collection of the related receivable is deemed probable by management. If conditions for acceptance apply subsequent to
delivery, revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance if such acceptance is not deemed to be perfunctory. Service maintenance fees, which generally are payable in advance and are
non-refundable, are recognized ratably over the service period, typically twelve months. Revenue from training and consulting services is recognized as services are provided. Software
license fees, consulting fees and training fees that have been prepaid or invoiced but that do not yet qualify for recognition as
revenue under CUseeMe's policy, and prepaid maintenance fees not yet recognized as revenue, are reflected as deferred revenue. CUseeMe's software arrangements sometimes contain multiple elements, such
as software products, services and post-contract customer support. Revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements that qualify for separate element treatment is
allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements based on vendor specific objective evidence. Vendor specific objective evidence is limited to the price charged when the
element is sold separately or, in the case of post-contract customer support, the renewal rate. For transactions where vendor specific objective evidence exists for undelivered elements
but not for delivered elements, CUseeMe uses the residual method in accordance with Statement of Position 98-9, 
Modification of SOP 97-2, with Respect
to Certain Transactions
. Under the residual method, the total fair value of the undelivered elements, as indicated by vendor-specific objective evidence, is deferred and
subsequently recognized in accordance with the relevant sections of SOP 97-2, and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is
recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements. 

    Software
development costs meeting recoverability tests are capitalized under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86, 
Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed
. The costs incurred between the point at which technological feasibility is 

established and general release to the public were not material. As a result, no software costs were capitalized in 1999 or 2000. 

    On
November 27, 2000, CUseeMe announced that it had reorganized its workforce in order to control costs and maximize its resource management. As a result of this
reorganization, CUseeMe laid off 26 employees on that date and eliminated ten additional positions that were open due to attrition in the ordinary course of business. At this time, CUseeMe also
announced the consolidation of its service operations center and CUseeMe's two satellite offices into its corporate headquarters. In connection with the restructuring, CUseeMe incurred operating
expenses totalling $185,000, all of which were recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2000.

Revenue  

    Total revenue was $12.0 million in 1999 and $12.1 million in 2000. Revenue from CUseeMe's legacy connectivity product line, which it sold in
February 2000, totalled $2.2 million in 1999, compared with $171,000 in 2000. Total revenue from CUseeMe's continuing product lines, which excludes legacy connectivity revenue, increased
22% from $9.8 million in 1999 to $11.9 million in 2000. 

    Software license revenue decreased 6% from $10.7 million in 1999 to $10.0 million in 2000. Software license revenue from CUseeMe's continuing product line, net of
software license revenue from its legacy connectivity product line, increased 11% from $8.9 million in 1999 to $9.9 million in 2000. 


Software
license revenue from CUseeMe Conference Server increased 16% from $5.7 million in 1999 to $6.6 million in 2000. In 2000, CUseeMe
increased the number of its transactions with original equipment manufacturers. These transactions were largely responsible for an increase in the number of server ports licensed, but the resulting
revenue gains were offset in part by the lower average price per port attributable to the volume purchases made by the manufacturers.


Software
license revenue from CUseeMe Pro including bundled camera kits, net of reserve for returns, decreased 41% from $2.9 million in 1999 to
$1.7 million in 2000. Significantly increased pricing pressures were reflected in discounts and rebates that led to a decrease of approximately 30% in the average selling price of the CUseeMe
Pro bundled kits. This decrease was offset slightly by an increase in the number of bundled kits shipped in 2000.


The
CUseeMe Web toolkit began shipping in the first fiscal quarter of 2000 and contributed $1.6 million of software license revenue in 2000. More
than one-half of this revenue was derived from a sale to a single vendor in the Pacific Rim. 

    Service
and other revenue increased 33%, from $1.5 million in 1999 to $2.0 million in 2000. Post-contract customer support revenue, excluding revenue
associated with CUseeMe's legacy connectivity products, increased 33%, from $1.0 million in 1999 to $1.4 million in 2000. This increase reflected the significant growth in 1999 in
CUseeMe's sales of licenses for the prior release of CUseeMe Conferencing Server. The remaining $466,000 of the increase in service and other revenue from 1999 to 2000 was derived principally from
training and professional services and one-time development projects. 

    Revenue
from sales outside the United States comprised 24% of total revenue in 1999 and 41% of total revenue in 2000. 

Cost of Revenue  

    Cost of revenue consists principally of royalties and associated amortization of paid license fees relating to third-party software included in CUseeMe's
products, as well as costs of product media, manuals, packaging materials, cameras, duplication and shipping. Total cost of revenue increased 52%, from $2.5 million in 1999 to
$3.9 million in 2000. Total cost of revenue for legacy connectivity products was $75,000 in 1999, compared to $6,000 in 2000. Total cost of revenue for CUseeMe's continuing product lines, which
excludes legacy connectivity cost of revenue, increased 56%, from $2.5 million in 1999 to $3.9 million in 2000. 

    Cost
of software license revenue was $2.4 million in both 1999 and 2000. CUseeMe's increased shipments of CUseeMe Pro bundled kits in 2000 resulted in higher dollar costs. 

    Cost
of services and other revenue increased from $186,000 in 1999 to $1.4 million in 2000. The significant increase in dollar and margin costs resulted primarily from the
inclusion in 2000 of $866,000 of technical support expense and $334,000 of professional services expense. In prior years, CUseeMe regarded technical support expense as a marketing activity and
reported it as an operating expense, since it provided technical support for freeware product. In 2000, CUseeMe's technical support expense became directly associated with post-contract
customer support revenue, as it implemented per-call charges for technical support customers not party to a maintenance contract. As a result of changes in CUseeMe's service delivery,
CUseeMe began to report technical support expense in cost of services and other revenue in 2000, rather than reporting it as an operating expense as CUseeMe had in 1999 

and earlier years. Professional service expense was allocated proportionately on the basis of ports utilized by paying customers versus ports internally deployed for the CUseeMe World portal site. 

    CUseeMe
intends to continue its strategy of improving the features and functionality of its products, particularly CUseeMe Conference Server and future products incorporating CUseeMe
Conference Server technology, through the incorporation of third-party software. As a result, CUseeMe's cost of software license revenue as a percentage of software license revenue may increase or
fluctuate in the future. 

Sales and Marketing  

    Sales and marketing expense primarily consists of costs associated with personnel, sales commissions, trade shows, advertising and promotional materials. Sales
and marketing expense increased by 39% from $7.3 million in 1999 to $10.1 million in 2000. This increase was attributable principally to: 


costs
of bandwidth and infrastructure and other expenses incurred in operating CUseeMe World, which became available to the public in 1999;


personnel
costs attributable to an increase in average headcount from 1999 to 2000; and


expenses
resulting from increased participation in marketing programs and trade shows in 2000. 

    The
increase was offset in part by the inclusion of technical support expense in 2000 in cost of services and other revenue, as described above. Technical support expense of $820,000
was included in sales and marketing expense in 1999. 

Research and Development Expense  

    Research and development expense consists primarily of costs of personnel and noncapitalized supplies and tools. Research and development expense increased by
23% from $4.8 million in 1999 to $5.8 million in 2000. This increase was attributable to the hiring of additional research and development personnel, the engagement of contractors for
product development, and personnel-related expenses associated with special developmental projects for original equipment manufacturers and strategic partners. 

General and Administrative Expense  

    General and administrative expense consists of costs of administrative, financial and general management activities, including legal, accounting and other
professional fees. General and administrative expense increased by 83%, from $2.4 million in 1999 to $4.3 million in 2000. This increase included: 


$348,000
incurred in expanding CUseeMe's management information systems department from three employees in 1999 to nine employees in 2000 in order to
accommodate the needs of CUseeMe's growing infrastructure and increased IT reporting and management requirements;


$390,000
incurred for management consulting and information systems consulting;


$110,000
incurred to engage a third-party billing vendor to track sales in CUseeMe's web-based storefront in 2000;


$469,000
of legal, insurance and other professional service fees; and


$200,000
of additional facilities expense in 2000 associated with CUseeMe's services operation center in Somerville, Massachusetts and supplemental office
space in Nashua, New Hampshire, both of which have been closed and consolidated into CUseeMe's main headquarters in Nashua. 

    The
increase in general and administrative expense in 2000 also reflected several smaller matters relating to foreign tax withholdings, depreciation on capital additions, salary
increases for executive management and increased travel expense. 

Other Income (Expense), Net  

    Other income (expense), net increased from $82,000 in 1999 to $1.8 million in 2000. This increase principally reflected: 


an
increase in interest income from $178,000 in 1999 to $1.1 million in 2000, as a result of CUseeMe's investment of its net proceeds from private
placements of common stock in December 1999; and


a
gain of $776,000 in 2000 from CUseeMe's sale of its legacy connectivity line of business to Powerlan USA. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

    CUseeMe used $12.7 million in cash and cash equivalents in 2000 and generated cash of $15.7 million in 1999. Cash used in 2000 primarily
comprised CUseeMe's net loss of $10.2 million, purchases of computer equipment and third-party software licenses for $3.1 million, and investment in short-term securities in
the amount of $3.0 million. These uses were offset in part by depreciation and amortization of $2.3 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options in the amount of $784,000.
Cash generated in 1999 principally represented CUseeMe's receipt of $19.7 million in net proceeds from its private placement of common stock in December 1999, partially offset by its net
loss of $4.8 million and a net increase in accounts receivable of $2.1 million. 

    CUseeMe's
capital expenditures in 2000 consisted principally of purchases of computer equipment for $1.5 million and software for $596,000. CUseeMe plans on investing
approximately $750,000 in capital equipment in 2001 to upgrade computer equipment and to build out and strengthen its information systems infrastructure. CUseeMe's capital requirements may vary
materially from those it now anticipates, depending on a number of factors including: 


the
level of CUseeMe's research and development activities;


the
rate of market acceptance of CUseeMe's software offerings; and


the
success of CUseeMe's sales, marketing and distribution strategy. 

    At
December 31, 2000, CUseeMe had cash and cash equivalents of $9.3 million, short-term investments of $3.3 million and working capital of
$12.9 million. At February 28, 2001, CUseeMe had cash and cash equivalents of $8.1 million, short-term investments of $3.3 million and working capital of
$10.7 million. CUseeMe continues to experience a negative cash flow from operations in each fiscal quarter. CUseeMe is not currently a party to any bank credit arrangements or other loan
facility. CUseeMe believes that its current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund its operations and capital expenditures through the fourth quarter
of 2001. If CUseeMe does not complete the proposed merger with First Virtual Communications, its liquidity after the fourth quarter of 2001 will depend on its internally generated funds and ability to
obtain funds from additional equity or debt financings from external sources. Moreover, if CUseeMe does not meet its goals with respect to revenue or if its costs are higher than anticipated, CUseeMe
may require substantial additional funds at an earlier date, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. 

Inflation  

    Although certain of CUseeMe's expenses increase with general inflation in the economy, inflation has not had a material effect on its financial condition or
results of operations to date. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  

    As of December 31, 2000, CUseeMe Networks held a total of $12,594,471 of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. These securities primarily consist
of investments in high grade commercial paper, overnight repurchase agreements and corporate bonds, or debt securities, and equity securities. The debt securities, which are fixed rate and generally
held to maturity, are subject to interest rate risk in the event they are liquidated prior to maturity. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not materially impact CUseeMe's
financial position or results of operations. For equity securities, which approximated $500,000 in carrying value at December 31, 2000, a 10% change in fair value would not have a material
impact on CUseeMe's financial position or results of operations. 

    A
portion of CUseeMe's operations consist of software research and development activities at its French subsidiary. CUseeMe's exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates
primarily to amounts owed by its French subsidiary, which are denominated in Euros and approximate $300,000 at December 31, 2000. Consequently, a 10% change in the exchange rate would not have
a material impact on CUseeMe's financial position or results of operations. CUseeMe does not regularly enter into derivative or foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the impact of
fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Euro. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

    In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.133, 
Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
, which requires companies to record derivatives on their balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. Gains or
losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. As initially issued,
SFAS 133 was effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. In July 1999, the FASB issued SFAS 137, 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities-Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS NO 133
. SFAS 137 deferred the effective date of SFAS 133 until the first fiscal quarter beginning
after June 15, 2000. The adoption of SFAS 133 and 137 is not expected to have a material effect on CUseeMe's financial position or results of operations.

DESCRIPTION OF FIRST VIRTUAL COMMUNICATIONS' CAPITAL STOCK    

    First Virtual Communications is authorized to issue up to 35,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which 27,437 shares have been designated as Series A preferred stock. As of March 30, 2001, 17,429,183 shares of common stock were issued and
outstanding and 27,437 shares of Series A preferred stock were issued and outstanding. 

Common Stock  

    The holders of First Virtual Communications common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held of record upon such matters and in such
manner as may be provided by law. The holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably dividends, if any, as may be declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available for
dividend payments. Holders of common stock have no preemptive rights or rights to convert their common stock into any other securities. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to
the common stock. All outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. 

Preferred Stock  

    The First Virtual Communications board of directors is authorized to issue up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series.
The board of directors may establish and alter from time to time, the designation, powers, preferences and rights to the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions
thereof. Shares of Series A preferred stock may be converted at any time into shares of common stock at an initial conversion rate of 1:125. Series A preferred stock is not entitled to
receive dividends unless and until the board of directors declares a dividend in respect of the common stock out of funds legally available for dividend payments. Holders of Series A preferred
stock vote together with the common stock as a single class on all matters except as specifically provided in the First Virtual Communications certificate of incorporation or as otherwise required by
law. Each share of Series A preferred stock has that number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock then issuable upon conversion of such share of Series A preferred
stock. There are no redemption rights applicable to the Series A preferred stock. In the event that First Virtual Communications liquidates, dissolves or winds up, the holders of
Series A preferred stock are entitled to receive in preference to the holders of common stock or other junior stock, but after holders of any senior stock, and pari passu with the holders of
any parity stock, a per share amount of $1,000 per share of Series A preferred stock, plus any declared but unpaid dividends. First Virtual Communications must obtain approval from a majority
of the holders of the Series A preferred stock in order to (1) alter the First Virtual Communications certificate of incorporation or bylaws in any way which would adversely affect the
Series A preferred stock, (2) effect a liquidation or dissolution, (3) commence a bankruptcy, or (4) redeem or repurchase any junior or parity stock of First Virtual
Communications. 

Registration Rights  

    Set forth below is a summary of the registration rights of Vulcan Ventures, holder of First Virtual Communications Series A preferred stock. 

    Demand Registrations.
  Vulcan Ventures may request that First Virtual Communications file a registration statement for a
number of shares held by it equal to at least 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock. First Virtual Communications will be obligated to effect only three registrations pursuant to a request by
Vulcan Ventures. If shares requested to be included in a demand registration by these holders of registration rights must be excluded due to limitations on the number of shares to be registered on
behalf of the selling holders due to the underwriters' advice in an offering, the 

registration statement will not include any shares to be offered by First Virtual Communications or sold by other stockholders, and the number of registrable securities included in the registration
statement will be allocated pro rata among all holders of shares with registration rights, based on the number of registrable securities held by each holder. 

    Piggyback Registration Rights.
  Vulcan Ventures has unlimited rights to request that the shares of common stock issuable
on conversion of the Series A preferred stock be included in any First Virtual Communications initiated registration or a registration by another stockholder, excluding registrations on
Form S-8, Form S-4 or other comparable forms, or with respect to an employee benefit plan or solely in connection with a Rule 145 transaction under the Securities Act of 1933 or
if any other stockholder is allowed to register shares of common stock. However, if the underwriter in a registration determines, in good faith, to limit the number of shares proposed to be issued,
then the reduction will be done on a pro rata basis. 

    Form S-3 Registrations.
  If First Virtual Communications qualifies for registration on Form S-3, Vulcan Ventures
may request in writing that First Virtual Communications effect registration of common stock issuable on conversion of the Series A preferred stock on Form S-3, provided that the gross
offering price of the shares to be so registered in each the registration is $2,500,000 or more. First Virtual Communications is not required to effect a registration on Form S-3 more than once in any
six month period, within 180 days after a registration statement other than on Form S-8, Form S-4 or comparable form, or with respect to an employee benefit plan or in connection with a
Rule 145 transaction under the Securities Act of 1933. 

    Transferability.
  The registration rights are transferable upon notice by Vulcan Ventures to First Virtual
Communications of the transfer, provided that the transferee assumes the rights and obligations of the transferor for such shares and the transferee is either an affiliate of the holder, or, as a
result of the transfer, the transferee holds at least 250,000 shares of common stock, or the transferee is a bank, insurance company or other financial institution. 

    Mr. Ungermann
also has certain registration rights pursuant to an agreement entered into with First Virtual Communications prior to its public offering. These rights expire
May 4, 2001. 

COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHTS    

General  

    The rights of First Virtual Communications stockholders are governed by the First Virtual Communications certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the Delaware
General Corporation Law, or DGCL. The rights of CUseeMe stockholders are governed by the CUseeMe certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the DGCL. 

    Upon
consummation of the merger, the stockholders of CUseeMe will become stockholders of First Virtual Communications. The rights of the CUseeMe stockholders differ from the rights of
the First Virtual Communications stockholders because the CUseeMe charter documents differ in certain material respects from the First Virtual Communications charter documents. 

    The
following is a summary of the principal differences between the rights of the CUseeMe stockholders and the rights of the First Virtual Communications stockholders. These
differences can be examined in full by reference to the respective charter documents of CUseeMe and First Virtual Communications. 

Size of the Board of Directors  

    Under the First Virtual Communications certificate, the number of directors constituting the entire board of directors may be changed by one or more
resolutions adopted by the board of directors. As long as the current holder of First Virtual Communications Series A preferred stock holds not less than 50% of the Series A preferred
stock, the size of the First Virtual Communications board of directors may not be increased to greater than seven without the written consent of the holder. The number of directors of First Virtual
Communications is currently fixed at six and will be increased to seven upon the closing of the merger. 

    Under
the CUseeMe bylaws, the number of directors constituting the entire board of directors may be changed by a resolution of the board of directors and may be increased or decreased
at any time or from time to time by the directors by vote of the majority then in office, except any resolution to decrease the size may only be made in order to eliminate vacancies existing by reason
of the death, resignation or removal of one or more of the directors. The number of directors of CUseeMe may not be less than five nor more than seven. The number of directors of CUseeMe is currently
fixed at five; however, a vacancy currently exists on the board. 

Classification of the Board of Directors  

    The DGCL permits, but does not require, a classified board of directors, divided into as many as three classes with staggered terms under which one half or
one-third of the directors are elected for terms of two or three years, respectively. The First Virtual Communications bylaws provide for a classified board of directors. First Virtual
Communications has a classified board consisting of three classes, each class consisting, as nearly as possible, of one third of the total numbers of directors, with each class having a
three-year term. CUseeMe bylaws do not provide for a classified board of directors. 

Cumulative Voting  

    The First Virtual Communications certificate and bylaws are silent as to cumulative voting. The CUseeMe certificate states that there shall be no cumulative
voting. 

Removal of Directors  

    Under the First Virtual Communications bylaws, unless otherwise restricted by statute, any director or the entire board of directors may be removed from office
at any time, (i) with cause by the 

affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation entitled to vote at an election of directors, or the voting
stock, or (ii) without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of the voting stock. 

    Under
the CUseeMe bylaws, the board of directors or any individual director may be removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of
the shares of the capital stock of the corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at an election of directors. 

Filling Vacancies on the Board of Directors  

    Under the DGCL, vacancies may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office (even though less than a quorum) unless otherwise provided in the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws. The DGCL further provides that if, at the time of filling any vacancy, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the board (as constituted
immediately prior to any such increase), the Delaware Court of Chancery may, upon application of any holder or holders of at least ten percent of the total number of outstanding stock having the right
to vote for directors, summarily order a special election to be held to fill any such vacancy or to replace directors chosen by the board of directors to fill such vacancy. 

    The
First Virtual Communications certificate provides that any vacancy on the board of directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other causes and any
newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors, shall (unless otherwise determined by resolution of the board of directors and except as otherwise provided by law)
be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the board of directors, and not by the stockholders. 

    The
CUseeMe bylaws state that newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors and other vacancies may be filled by vote of the stockholders at a
meeting called for the purpose, or by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. 

Right to Call Special Meetings of Directors  

    Under the First Virtual Communications bylaws, special meetings of the board of directors may be held at any time and place within or without the State of
Delaware whenever called by the chairman of the board, the president or any two of the directors. 

    The
CUseeMe bylaws state that special meetings of the board of directors must be called by the president or by one-third or more in number of directors, with reasonable
notice thereof being given to each director by the caller of the meeting. 

Right to Call Special Stockholder Meetings  

    Under the First Virtual Communications bylaws, special meetings of the stockholders of First Virtual Communications may be called at any time by (i) the
chairman of the board of directors, (ii) the chief executive officer, (iii) the board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized
directors or (iv) by the holders of shares entitled to cast not less than 50% of the votes at the meeting, and shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as the board of
directors shall fix. Except as otherwise required by law, the holder of each share of First Virtual Communications' capital stock is entitled to notice of any stockholder meeting. Such notice shall be
sent to each stockholder entitled to vote not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting. 

    The CUseeMe bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called for any purpose or purposes by the president and shall be called by the president or secretary at
the request in writing of a majority of directors. Written notice of a special meeting shall be given not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder
entitled to vote at such meeting. 

Amendments to Certificates of Incorporation  

    Under the DGCL, amendments to a corporation's certificate of incorporation require the approval of the board of directors and stockholders holding a majority
of the outstanding stock of that class entitled to vote on that amendment as a class, unless a different proportion is specified in the certificate of incorporation or by other provisions of the DGCL. 

    The
First Virtual Communications certificate provides that the corporation may amend its certificate in any manner permitted by applicable law, except with respect to Article V,
relating to the board of directors, Article VI, relating to director liability, and Article VII, relating to amendments to the certificate. Amendments to the preceeding articles would
require the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the voting stock. 

    The
CUseeMe certificate provides that the corporation may amend its certificate in any manner permitted by applicable law. 

Amendments to Bylaws  

    Under the DGCL, bylaws of a corporation may be amended or repealed by stockholders, and, if provided for in the corporation's certificate, by the directors. 

    The
First Virtual Communications certificate and bylaws provide that the bylaws may be amended or repealed by a majority of the board of directors then in office or by the affirmative
vote of the holders of an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Voting Stock. 

    The
CUseeMe certificate and bylaws provide that the bylaws may be amended or repealed by a majority of the board of directors then in office or by the affirmative vote of the holders
of at least three-fourths of the outstanding stock entitled to vote any regular meeting of stockholders. 

ADDITIONAL MATTERS FOR CONSIDERATION
  BY FIRST VIRTUAL COMMUNICATIONS STOCKHOLDERS    

    Approval by the First Virtual Communications stockholders of the two proposals submitted to stockholders of First Virtual Communications in this
prospectus/joint proxy statement will be required to complete the merger. If either First Virtual Communications proposal is not approved by the First Virtual Communications stockholders, then the
merger will not occur. 
The First Virtual Communications board of directors believes that the merger and related transactions are in the best interests of First Virtual
Communications and its stockholders and the board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote for the proposal to issue shares of First Virtual Communications common stock to CUseeMe
stockholders and for the proposal to amend First Virtual Communications' Certificate of Incorporation, as described below.

Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation  

    As a condition precedent to CUseeMe's obligation to complete the merger, First Virtual Communications is required to amend its certificate of incorporation.
First Virtual Communications' stockholders are requested to approve the amendment of the First Virtual Communications certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized shares of First Virtual
Communications common stock from 35,000,000 to 100,000,000 shares, an increase of 65,000,000 shares. 

    An
increase in the authorized capital stock of First Virtual Communications is necessary to create a sufficient number of shares of First Virtual Communications common stock for
issuance in connection with the merger and for issuance of First Virtual Communications common stock upon exercise of CUseeMe stock options assumed by First Virtual Communications in the merger. In
addition, the additional authorized capital stock will provide the board of directors with additional flexibility to use its capital stock for business and financial purposes in the future. The shares
may be issued, without further stockholder approval, for various purposes, including, without limitation, raising capital, providing equity incentives to employees, including officers and directors
and consultants, establishing strategic relationships with other companies and expanding the combined company's business through the acquisition of other businesses. 

    Under
the First Virtual Communications certificate of incorporation, no stockholder, other than Vulcan Ventures Incorporated, is entitled to preemptive rights in respect of any future
issuances of capital stock, and no preemptive rights are contemplated in the proposed amendment. Except for the issuance of shares of stock in connection with the merger, First Virtual Communications
does not presently contemplate seeking stockholder approval for any future issuance of capital stock unless required to do so by an obligation imposed by applicable law, a regulatory authority or a
third party. 

    The
additional shares of capital stock that would become available for issuance if the amendment of the First Virtual Communications certificate of incorporation is approved could
also be used by First Virtual Communications to oppose a hostile takeover attempt or delay or prevent changes in control or management. For example, without further stockholder approval, the board of
directors could strategically sell shares of First Virtual Communications stock in a private transaction to purchasers who would oppose a takeover or favor the then current board of directors.
Although this proposal to increase the authorized capital stock has been prompted by the board's desire to consummate the merger and for other business and financial considerations, and not by the
threat of any hostile takeover attempt, nor is the board currently aware of any such attempts directed at First Virtual Communications nevertheless, stockholders should be aware that approval of this
amendment could facilitate future efforts by First Virtual Communications to deter or prevent changes in control of First Virtual Communications, including transactions in which the stockholders might
otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. 

    The
additional First Virtual Communications common stock to be authorized by approval of the amendment would have rights identical to the currently outstanding First Virtual
Communications 

common stock. The issuance of the First Virtual Communications common stock in connection with the merger would not affect the rights of the holders of currently outstanding First Virtual
Communications common stock, except for effects incidental to increasing the number of shares of First Virtual Communications common stock outstanding, such as dilution of the earnings per share and
voting rights of current stockholders. 

THE FIRST VIRTUAL COMMUNICATIONS BOARD BELIEVES THAT APPROVAL OF THE AMENDMENT OF THE FIRST VIRTUAL COMMUNICATIONS CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION IS IN THE BEST
INTEREST OF FIRST VIRTUAL COMMUNICATIONS AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS AND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE FIRST VIRTUAL COMMUNICATIONS STOCKHOLDERS VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS PROPOSAL.

LEGAL MATTERS    

    The validity of the shares of First Virtual Communications common stock to be issued in connection with the merger and the tax-free nature of the
transaction will be passed upon for First Virtual Communications by Cooley Godward 
LLP
, San Diego, California. Certain tax matters related to the merger
will be passed upon for CUseeMe by Hale and Dorr 
LLP
 Boston, Massachusetts. 

REPRESENTATIVES OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS    

    Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP
 expect to be present at the First Virtual Communications special
meeting and representatives of Ernst & Young 
LLP
 expect to be present at the CUseeMe special meeting. While the representatives have stated that
they do not plan to make a statement at the meetings, they will be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders in attendance. 

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS    

    First Virtual Communications' stockholders who wish to submit proposals for First Virtual Communications' 2002 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must have
submitted the proposal to First Virtual Communications, 3393 Octavius Drive, Santa Clara, California 95054, Attention: Assistant Secretary, in advance of January 2, 2002, for inclusion, if
appropriate, in First Virtual Communications' proxy statement and form of proxy relating to its 2002 Annual Meeting. The deadline for submitting a stockholder proposal or a nomination for director
that is not to be included in that proxy statement and proxy is not later than the close of business on March 3, 2002 nor earlier than the close of business on January 31, 2002.
Stockholders are also advised to review the First Virtual Communications bylaws, which contain additional requirements with respect to advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations. 

    If
the merger is not entered into, CUseeMe will schedule its 2001 Annual Meeting and distribute a separate proxy statement. A CUseeMe stockholder who intends to present a proposal at
the 2002 annual meeting of the CUseeMe stockholders for inclusion in its 2002 proxy statement must submit the proposal 60 days prior to the date of the annual meeting. In order for the proposal
to be included in the proxy statement, the stockholder submitting the proposal must meet eligibility standards and must comply with procedures established by the SEC, and the proposal must comply with
the requirements as to form and substance established by applicable laws and regulations. The proposal must be mailed to CUseeMe's secretary at 542 Amherst Street, Nashua, New Hampshire 03063.
In addition, in accordance with the bylaws of CUseeMe, a stockholder wishing to bring an item of business before the 2002 annual meeting or to nominate any person for election to the CUseeMe board of
directors at the 2002 annual meeting must deliver proper notice of the item of business or nomination to CUseeMe at its offices no later than 60 days prior to the date of the annual meeting,
even if the item or nomination is not to be included in its proxy statement. If CUseeMe gives less than 70 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting, then the stockholder must
deliver such notice to us at CUseeMe's offices no later than the tenth day after the earlier of (a) the day on which it mailed notice of the date of the meeting and (b) the day on which it publicly
disclosed the date of the meeting. The notice must include certain specific information regarding the proposed item of business or nominee, the stockholder making the proposal, other stockholders
known to support the proposal, their stock ownership and their interest in the proposal. If the merger is completed, CUseeMe will have only one stockholder (First Virtual Communications) and therefore
will not conduct a 2001 or 2002 annual meeting.

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of First Virtual Communications, Inc. 

    In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of First Virtual Communications Inc. (formerly
FVC.COM, Inc.), and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

FIRST VIRTUAL COMMUNICATIONS, INC.  

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

NOTE 1THE COMPANY AND A SUMMARY OF ITS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  

THE COMPANY  

    First Virtual Communications, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in California under the name First Virtual Corporation in October 1993 and
subsequently reincorporated in Delaware in December 1997. In July 1998, the Company changed its name to FVC.COM, Inc., and on February 5, 2001 the Company changed its name
to First Virtual Communications, Inc. The Company provides systems and services that enable system integrators and service providers to deliver an integrated suite of video collaboration
applications to their enterprise customers. The Company sells its products worldwide through original equipment manufacturers ("OEM partners"), distributors and resellers. 

    The
Company has one reporting segment based on its management structure. 

USE OF ESTIMATES  

    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION  

    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated. Investments in entities of which the Company owns between 20% and 50% and on which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence but not control are accounted for
under the equity method. 

    Minority
interest reflects the interest of minority shareholders in the operating results of consolidated subsidiaries. 

CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS  

    The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents and those with maturities
greater than three months are considered short-term investments. The Company has classified all short-term investments as available-for-sale.
Short-term investments held at December 31, 2000 and 1999 have been presented at cost, which approximated fair value. 

INVEN
