                              [ORTHALLIANCE LOGO]

                 MERGER PROPOSED -- YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

     OrthAlliance, Inc. and Orthodontic Centers of America, Inc. have entered
into a merger agreement which provides that, subject to approval by
OrthAlliance's stockholders and other conditions, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
OCA would merge into OrthAlliance, and OrthAlliance would become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of OCA. Stockholders of OrthAlliance would receive shares of OCA
common stock in exchange for their shares of OrthAlliance Class A and Class B
common stock, except for holders of OrthAlliance Class B common stock who
properly exercise their appraisal rights under Delaware law, with cash to be
paid instead of any fractional shares of OCA common stock.

     We cannot complete the merger without the approval of the stockholders of
OrthAlliance. OrthAlliance has scheduled a special meeting of its stockholders
to vote on the merger agreement. In order for the merger agreement to be
approved, a majority of the outstanding shares of OrthAlliance Class A and Class
B common stock, voting together as a single class, that are eligible to vote
must be voted in favor of the merger agreement. The date, time and place of the
special meeting is as follows:

                                                , 2001
                                   .M. (          TIME)

     The attached Proxy Statement/Prospectus provides you with detailed
information about the proposed merger and the companies involved. We encourage
you to read it carefully. You can also obtain information about OCA and
OrthAlliance from documents each has filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

     Your vote is very important, regardless of how many shares you
own.  Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting of stockholders,
please take the time to vote your proxy by completing and mailing the enclosed
proxy card to us. If your proxy is properly given and not revoked without
indicating how you want to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote in favor
of the merger agreement. If you attend the special meeting of stockholders, you
may vote your shares in person if you wish, even though you previously voted
your proxy.

     The Board of Directors of OrthAlliance recommends that stockholders of
OrthAlliance vote "FOR" approval of the merger agreement.

                                            Very truly yours,

                                            W. Dennis Summers

Statement/Prospectus attached to this notice for more complete information

                                ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:   WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A:   Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting of OrthAlliance
     stockholders, please vote your proxy promptly by indicating on the enclosed
     proxy card how you want to vote, and by signing and mailing the proxy card
     in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible so that your shares may
     be represented at the special meeting of stockholders. If your proxy is
     properly given and not revoked without indicating how you want to vote,
     your proxy will be counted as a vote in favor of the merger agreement.

     You are invited to the special meeting of OrthAlliance stockholders to vote
     your shares in person. If you do vote your proxy, you can take it back at
     any time until OrthAlliance stockholders vote at the special meeting of
     stockholders, and vote another proxy or attend the special meeting and vote
     in person.

     Regardless of whether you plan to attend the special meeting in person, we
     encourage you to vote your proxy promptly. This will help to ensure that a
     quorum is present at the special meeting and will help reduce the costs
     associated with the solicitation of proxies.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF ORTHALLIANCE RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS OF
     ORTHALLIANCE VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

Q:   IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
     SHARES FOR ME?

A:   Only if you provide instructions to your broker on how to vote by following
     the directions your broker provides. Without instructions from you to your
     broker, your shares will not be voted.

Q:   WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS?

wholly-owned subsidiary of OCA. It was formed on May 15, 2001 solely for the
purpose of entering into the merger agreement and being merged into OrthAlliance
according to the terms of the merger agreement.

ORTHALLIANCE, INC.
21535 Hawthorne Boulevard, Suite 200
Torrance, California 90503
(310) 792-1300

pediatric dentistry practices in the United States. As of March 31, 2001,
OrthAlliance was affiliated with 226 orthodontists and pediatric dentists
practicing in 395 centers throughout the United States.

THE MERGER (PAGE 29)

     OCA, OCA Acquisition Corporation and OrthAlliance entered into a merger
agreement whereby OCA Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of OCA,
will merge into OrthAlliance, with OrthAlliance becoming a wholly-owned
subsidiary of OCA, subject to approval by OrthAlliance stockholders and other
conditions. OCA and OrthAlliance hope to complete the merger during the third
quarter of 2001. The merger agreement is attached to this Proxy
Statement/Prospectus as Annex A. You should read it carefully.

WHAT ORTHALLIANCE STOCKHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE IN THE MERGER (PAGE 29)

     If the merger is completed, OrthAlliance stockholders will receive a fixed
number of shares of OCA common stock for each share of OrthAlliance Class A and
Class B common stock they own (which is referred to as the "exchange ratio"),
except for holders of OrthAlliance Class B common stock who properly exercise
their appraisal rights under Delaware law. The amount of the exchange ratio will
depend

upon how many of 184 designated orthodontists and pediatric dentists, who are
owners/employees of professional entities that are parties to OrthAlliance
service or consulting agreements, enter into, along with their professional
entity, amendments to their respective employment agreements and service or
consulting agreements prior to completion of the merger, as provided in the
merger agreement, and the percentage of OrthAlliance's service fees during the
12 months ended March 31, 2001 represented by those orthodontists and pediatric
dentists. The following chart describes the exchange ratio in the Merger:

                                    ORTHALLIANCE AFFILIATED PRACTITIONERS EXECUTING AMENDMENTS
                                   ------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              PERCENTAGE OF ORTHALLIANCE ANNUAL
EXCHANGE RATIO                           NUMBER                   SERVICE FEES REPRESENTED
- --------------                     ------------------         ---------------------------------

0.09214..........................  56 or less           or    Less than 31.00%
0.10135..........................  At least 57 to 75    and   At least 31.00%-40.99%
0.11056..........................  At least 76 to 93    and   At least 41.00%-50.99%
0.12899..........................  At least 94 to 112   and   At least 51.00%-60.99%
0.16585..........................  113 or more          and   61.00% or more

     As of           , 2001,           of these designated orthodontists and
pediatric dentists, along with their respective professional entity, have
amended their respective employment agreements and OrthAlliance service or
consulting agreements, representing about   % of OrthAlliance's service fees
during the 12 months ended March 31, 2001. Based upon those amounts,
OrthAlliance stockholders would receive 0.      shares of OCA common stock for
each share of OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common stock in the merger. These
amounts, however, may change prior to completion of the merger.

     OCA will not issue any fractional shares of OCA common stock. Instead, an
OrthAlliance stockholder will receive cash equal to the product of (1) the
average of the last reported sale prices per share of OCA common stock as
reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the three trading days immediately
preceding the date on which the merger is completed, times (2) the fraction of a
share of OCA common stock to which the stockholder otherwise would be entitled.

     If the merger is completed, each outstanding and unexercised option or
warrant to purchase shares of OrthAlliance Class A or Class B common stock will
no longer represent a right to acquire shares of OrthAlliance Class A or Class B
common stock and will be automatically converted into a right to acquire shares
of OCA common stock. The number of shares underlying each new option, as well as
the exercise price, will be adjusted by the amount of the exchange ratio.

OCA'S STOCK PRICE WILL FLUCTUATE (PAGE 66)

     OCA expects the market price of its common stock to fluctuate due to market
factors beyond its control before and following the merger. Because the exchange
ratio, once determined, is fixed and the market price of OCA common stock may
fluctuate, the value of the shares of OCA common stock that OrthAlliance
stockholders will receive in the merger may increase or decrease prior to
completion of the merger. OCA cannot assure you that the market price of OCA
common stock will not decrease before or after completion of the merger.

SPECIAL MEETING (PAGE 24)

     A special meeting of the stockholders of OrthAlliance will be held on
          , 2001 at the following time and place:

                                          , 2001
                                 .m. (     Time)
                             ---------------------
                             ---------------------
                             ---------------------

     At the special meeting, stockholders of OrthAlliance will be asked to
approve the merger agreement among OCA, OCA Acquisition Corporation and
OrthAlliance.

ORTHALLIANCE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT ORTHALLIANCE
STOCKHOLDERS APPROVE THE MERGER AGREEMENT (PAGE 25)

     The Board of Directors of OrthAlliance believes that the proposed merger
among OCA, OCA Acquisition Corporation and OrthAlliance is in the best interests
of OrthAlliance stockholders, and recommends that OrthAlliance stockholders vote
"FOR" the proposal to approve the merger agreement. This belief is based on a
number of factors described in this document, including the receipt of a
fairness opinion from OrthAlliance's financial advisor.

VOTE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER (PAGE 24)

     In order for the merger to be approved, a majority of the outstanding
shares of OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common stock, voting together as a
single class, eligible to vote must be voted in favor of the merger agreement.

     The following chart describes the OrthAlliance stockholder vote required to
approve the merger agreement:

Number of shares of OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common
  stock outstanding on             , 2001...................
Number of votes necessary to approve the merger agreement...
Percentage of outstanding shares of OrthAlliance Class A and
  Class B common stock necessary to approve the merger
  agreement.................................................  50.01%
Number of votes that executive officers and directors of
  OrthAlliance can cast as of             , 2001............
Percentage of votes that executive officers and directors of
  OrthAlliance can cast as of             , 2001............       %

RECORD DATE; VOTING POWER (PAGE 25)

     You can vote at the special meeting of OrthAlliance stockholders if you
owned OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common stock as of the close of business
on             , 2001, the record date set by OrthAlliance's Board of Directors.
Each share of OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common stock is entitled to one
vote.

     On             , 2001, there were      shares of OrthAlliance Class A and
Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the merger agreement.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER (PAGE 31)

     In 1999, OrthAlliance began to explore various strategic alternatives to
enhance stockholder value, including a sale of the company to OCA or a financial
investor. During 2000, OrthAlliance engaged U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray to advise
it in connection with these strategic alternatives and appointed special
committees of OrthAlliance's Board of Directors to evaluate these alternatives
and consider various acquisition proposals. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray contacted
a number of financial investors about their interest in acquiring OrthAlliance,
and OrthAlliance engaged in discussions with several financial investors and OCA
about a potential transaction. In October 2000, OrthAlliance was contacted by a
potential financial buyer about the possibility of engaging in a "going private"
transaction involving OrthAlliance's affiliated practitioners. OrthAlliance
continued to negotiate with this potential financial buyer until it indicated on
May 8, 2001 that it was no longer interested in pursuing a transaction with
OrthAlliance. In April 2001, OCA contacted OrthAlliance to explore a potential
merger of the two companies. During April and May 2001, representatives of OCA
and OrthAlliance had several discussions and meetings about a potential merger
and negotiated the terms of a merger agreement.

     On May 16, 2001, OCA's Board of Directors and OrthAlliance's special
committee and Board of Directors each met in separate special meetings to
consider the proposed merger between OrthAlliance and OCA and the terms of the
proposed merger agreement. OCA's Board of Directors and OrthAlliance's

special committee and Board of Directors received presentations from their
respective financial advisors, legal counsel, accountants and management
regarding the merger. Following these presentations and discussion among the
members of the respective boards of directors and OrthAlliance's special
committee, the merger agreement was separately approved by OCA's Board of
Directors and by OrthAlliance's special committee and Board of Directors on May
16, 2001.

WHY OCA AND ORTHALLIANCE ARE SEEKING TO MERGE (PAGES 37 AND 40)

     The merger will combine the strengths of OCA and OrthAlliance. With
OrthAlliance becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of OCA, the companies should be
able to achieve superior financial performances compared to each company
operating independently. One reason for this is that the combined companies are
expected to increase revenue growth by adding over 200 orthodontists and
pediatric dentists to OCA's existing base of over 400 affiliated orthodontists.
The combined companies should also provide an increase in operating margin
because OCA would be able to leverage its computer and operating systems and
other resources over a larger base of affiliated practitioners.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT OF OCA FOLLOWING THE MERGER (PAGE 89)

     If the merger is completed, one of the directors of OrthAlliance will be
appointed by OCA's Board of Directors to serve as a director of OCA. That
director will be selected by the Boards of Directors of OCA and OrthAlliance.
Following the merger, Bartholomew F. Palmisano, Sr., currently the Chairman of
the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of OCA, would continue to serve
in those positions.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (PAGE 53)

     The merger has been structured as a tax-free reorganization for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, OrthAlliance stockholders generally
will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the
exchange of their OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common stock for OCA common
stock in the merger, except for OrthAlliance stockholders who receive cash
instead of fractional shares of OCA common stock or OrthAlliance Class B
stockholders who exercise their appraisal rights under Delaware law. OCA and
OrthAlliance, as well as current OCA stockholders, will not recognize any gain
or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger.
Determining the actual tax consequences of the merger to you can be complicated,
and will depend on your specific situation and many variables not within our
control. Accordingly, we strongly urge you to consult your own tax advisor for a
full understanding of the merger's tax consequences.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (PAGE 53)

     We expect that the merger will be treated as a purchase transaction under
generally accepted accounting principles for accounting and financial reporting
purposes.

ORTHALLIANCE'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR SAID THAT THE PROPOSED MERGER
CONSIDERATION WAS FAIR TO ORTHALLIANCE STOCKHOLDERS FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF
VIEW (PAGE 41)

     U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray rendered an opinion to a special committee of
the Board of Directors of OrthAlliance that, as of the date of the opinion, the
merger consideration proposed to be received by the stockholders of OrthAlliance
was fair from a financial point of view to the stockholders of OrthAlliance.
This opinion is attached as Annex C to this document. You should read it
carefully.

INTERESTS OF ORTHALLIANCE DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT IN THE MERGER (PAGE 54)

     Directors and executive officers of OrthAlliance will be issued shares of
OCA common stock in the merger on the same basis as other stockholders of
OrthAlliance. The following chart shows the number of

shares of OCA common stock that may be issued to directors and executive
officers of OrthAlliance in the merger:

Shares of OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common stock,
  including stock options exercisable within 60 days,
  beneficially owned by OrthAlliance executive officers and
  directors on June 30, 2001................................   820,007
Maximum number of shares of OCA common stock that may be
  received in the merger by OrthAlliance officers and
  directors, based upon this beneficial ownership and the
  maximum exchange ratio....................................   135,998

     W. Dennis Summers, the Chairman of the Board and Interim President and
Chief Executive Officer of OrthAlliance, is a participant in OrthAlliance's stay
bonus and severance plan whereby, if Mr. Summers' employment is terminated for
any reason within 12 months following the completion of the merger, he would
receive payment of $200,000. In addition, Mr. Summers is to receive a stay bonus
equal to $33,333 at the earlier of three months following the completion of the
merger or termination of his employment by OrthAlliance for any reason other
than for cause following the completion of the merger. Various other
non-executive officers and employees of OrthAlliance are also participants in
this stay bonus and severance plan.

     Various other officers of OrthAlliance, including Paul H. Hayase, Senior
Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of OrthAlliance, Stephen M. Toon,
Senior Vice President and Chief Development Officer of OrthAlliance, and James
C. Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of OrthAlliance,
are parties to severance or employment agreements with OrthAlliance under which
they may be entitled to severance payments and benefits upon termination of
their employment following a change in control of OrthAlliance. We anticipate
that the merger would be a change in control for purposes of these agreements.

     Dr. Randall K. Bennett, Dr. Larry D. Dormois, Dr. Douglas D. Durbin, Dr.
Raymond G. W. Kubisch and Dr. Stephen G. Tracey, each of whom is a director of
OrthAlliance and an orthodontist or pediatric dentist affiliated with
OrthAlliance, are eligible to receive various financial incentives that OCA is
offering to OrthAlliance affiliated orthodontists and pediatric dentists who
amend their employment agreement and service or consulting agreement with
OrthAlliance as provided in the merger agreement, or who enter into OCA's form
of business services agreement effective as of the merger. These incentives,
which consist of varying amounts of OCA common stock, are conditioned on, among
other things, the completion of the merger. As of the date of this Proxy
Statement/Prospectus,           of these directors have amended their employment
agreement and service or consulting agreement, and are eligible to be granted
shares of OCA common stock if the merger is completed.

ORTHALLIANCE CLASS B STOCKHOLDERS HAVE APPRAISAL RIGHTS (PAGE 26)

     Holders of OrthAlliance Class B common stock have the right to exercise
appraisal rights and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their
shares of OrthAlliance Class B common stock as determined by the Delaware
Chancery Court. Holders of Class B common stock have appraisal rights under
Delaware law because these shares are neither publicly traded nor held of record
by more than 2,000 holders. The fair value of shares of OrthAlliance Class B
common stock as determined by the Delaware Chancery Court may be more or less
than, or the same as, the value of the OCA common stock to be received by
holders of OrthAlliance Class A common stock and OrthAlliance Class B common
stock who do not exercise appraisal rights. To exercise appraisal rights,
holders of OrthAlliance Class B common stock must precisely follow certain
procedures, or the appraisal rights may be lost. These procedures are described
in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the relevant provisions of Delaware law,
and include the requirement that the stockholders file certain notices with
OrthAlliance and refrain from voting their shares in favor of the merger. If
they exercise their appraisal rights, their shares of OrthAlliance Class B
common stock will not be exchanged for shares of OCA common stock in the merger,
and their only right will be to receive the appraised fair value of their shares
of OrthAlliance Class B common stock in cash. A copy of the Delaware statute
describing these appraisal rights and the procedures for exercising them is

attached as Annex B to this Proxy Statement/Prospectus. OrthAlliance Class B
stockholders who perfect their appraisal rights and receive cash in exchange for
their shares of OrthAlliance Class B common stock may recognize gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

     OrthAlliance Class A stockholders do not have the right under Delaware law
to exercise appraisal rights because OrthAlliance Class A common stock is
publicly traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market National Market System.

WE MUST MEET SEVERAL CONDITIONS TO COMPLETE THE MERGER (PAGE 58)

     The completion of the merger depends on a number of conditions being met,
including the following:

     - Stockholders of OrthAlliance approving the merger;

     - The New York Stock Exchange listing the shares of OCA common stock to be
       issued to OrthAlliance stockholders;

     - Receipt of all required approvals and the expiration of any regulatory
       waiting periods;

     - The absence of any governmental order blocking completion of the merger
       or of any proceedings by a government body trying to block it;

     - Receipt of opinions of legal counsel to OCA and OrthAlliance that the
       merger will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a tax-free
       reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code;

     - The absence of any material adverse effect on OCA and OrthAlliance in
       general; and

     - At least 56 of 184 designated OrthAlliance affiliated professionals, and
       a number of those OrthAlliance affiliated professionals representing at
       least 30% of OrthAlliance's annual service fees, amending their
       respective employment agreement and OrthAlliance service or consulting
       agreement on terms specified in the merger agreement. As of             ,
       2001,           of these designated orthodontists and pediatric dentists,
       along with their respective professional entity, have amended their
       respective employment agreements and OrthAlliance service or consulting
       agreements, representing   % of OrthAlliance's service fees during the 12
       months ended March 31, 2001, which exceeded the minimum amounts required
       under this condition. These amounts, however, may change prior to
       completion of the merger.

     In cases where the law permits, a party to the merger agreement could elect
to waive a condition that has not been satisfied and complete the merger
although the party is entitled not to complete the merger. We cannot be certain
whether or when any of these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, where
permissible), or that the merger will be completed.

WE MAY TERMINATE THE MERGER AGREEMENT (PAGE 58)

     OrthAlliance and OCA can agree at any time to terminate the merger
agreement without completing the merger, even if the stockholders of
OrthAlliance have already voted to approve it.

     OCA can terminate the merger agreement if the Board of Directors of
OrthAlliance recommends, accepts or enters into an agreement or letter of intent
relating to an acquisition proposal other than the one described in this
document, or withdraws or modifies its recommendation of the merger agreement as
described in this document.

     OrthAlliance can terminate the merger agreement if its Board of Directors
elects to terminate the merger agreement solely to concurrently enter into an
agreement relating to an acquisition proposal that the Board determines in good
faith is more favorable than the one described in this document, after
determining in good faith that the failure to do so would violate the Board's
fiduciary duties and giving notice to OCA.

     Moreover, either OCA or OrthAlliance can terminate the merger agreement in
the following circumstances:

     - If the merger isn't completed by November 30, 2001;

     - If the stockholders of OrthAlliance do not approve the merger;

     - If the other party violates, in a significant way, any of its
       representations, warranties, covenants or obligations contained in the
       merger agreement; and

     - If the other party does not satisfy its conditions required to complete
       the merger, and these conditions have become incapable of being fulfilled
       or cured and have not been waived.

     Generally, a party can only terminate the merger agreement in one of these
situations if that party is not in violation of the merger agreement or if its
violations of the merger agreement are not the cause of the event permitting
termination.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MAY PROVE INACCURATE (PAGE 95)

     This document, and other documents to which you are referred in this
document, contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and
uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include information about
possible or assumed future results of our operations or the performance of the
combined companies after the merger. Forward-looking statements generally refer
to a future period and/or include any of the words "believes," "expects,"
"anticipates," "should," "would," "will," "estimates," "plans" or "intends" or
similar expressions. Many possible events or factors could affect each of our
future financial results and performance and that of the combined company after
the merger and could cause those results or performance to differ materially
from those expressed in forward-looking statements. These possible events or
factors include the following:

     - Problems or delays in bringing us together, either before or after the
       merger is completed;

     - Legal and regulatory risks and uncertainties;

     - Economic, political and competitive forces affecting our businesses,
       markets, constituencies or securities; and

     - Inaccuracies in our analyses of these risks and forces, and lack of
       success of strategies developed to deal with them.

COMPARATIVE UNAUDITED PER SHARE DATA

     The following table shows information, for the periods indicated, about
OCA's and OrthAlliance's historical net income per share, dividends per share
and book value per share. The table also provides similar information that
reflects the merger of OCA and OrthAlliance (which is referred to as "pro forma"
information). In presenting the comparative pro forma information for certain
time periods, we have assumed the use of the purchase method of accounting. In
addition, the table provides "pro forma equivalent" information for
OrthAlliance, which was obtained by multiplying the OCA and OrthAlliance pro
forma amounts by assumed exchange ratios of 0.09214 and 0.16585 (the minimum and
maximum amounts of the exchange ratio). It is intended to reflect the fact that
OrthAlliance stockholders will be receiving less than one share of OCA common
stock for each share of OrthAlliance common stock exchanged in the merger.

                     SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA AND
        UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The following tables show summarized unaudited historical consolidated
financial data for OCA and for OrthAlliance and also show similar pro forma
information reflecting the merger among OCA, OCA Acquisition Corporation and
OrthAlliance. The pro forma information reflects the purchase method of
accounting for the merger.

     The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2001
assumes that the merger was completed on March 31, 2001. The unaudited pro forma
statements of income for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and the year
ended December 31, 2000 assumes that the merger was completed on January 1,
2000. The purchase price allocation used in these unaudited pro forma financial
statements is based upon preliminary estimates, which are subject to change as
additional information is obtained.

     The following items have not been factored into these pro forma financial
statements but could have a material impact on the actual financial position and
operating results of OCA after the merger:

     We expect to incur merger-related expenses as a result of combining our
companies. We also anticipate that the merger will provide the combined
companies with financial benefits such as reduced operating expenses and the
opportunity to earn more revenue.

     In connection with the proposed merger with OrthAlliance, OCA has
implemented six programs under which it may offer shares of its common stock to
orthodontists and pediatric dentists who are owners and employees of
professional entities that are parties to service, management service or
consulting agreements with OrthAlliance and its subsidiaries. Participation in
each of these programs would be conditioned upon amendment of the orthodontists'
or pediatric dentists' employment agreements and OrthAlliance service,
management service or consulting agreements or execution of new business
services agreements with OCA prior to the merger, execution of a participation
agreement and completion of the proposed merger with OrthAlliance, among other
things.

     Because these items have not been factored into the pro forma financial
statements, the pro forma information, while helpful in illustrating the
financial attributes of the combined companies under one set of assumptions,
does not attempt to predict or suggest future results. Also, the information
provided for the three month period ended March 31, 2001 does not necessarily
indicate what the results will be for all of 2001.

     The pro forma adjustments in the pro forma financial statements assume an
exchange ratio of 0.10135 shares of OCA common stock for each share of
OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common stock and a price per share of OCA
common stock of $30. The actual exchange ratio will depend upon how many of 184
designated orthodontists and pediatric dentists who are owners/employees of
professional entities that are parties to OrthAlliance service or consulting
agreements, enter into, along with their professional entity, amendments to
their respective employment agreements and service, management service or
consulting agreements prior to completion of the merger, as provided in the
merger agreement, and the percentage of OrthAlliance's service fees during the
twelve months ended March 31, 2001 represented by those orthodontists and
pediatric dentists.

     Assuming the minimum exchange ratio provided in the merger agreement, which
is 0.09214, the purchase price, the adjustment to reflect goodwill from the
merger and shareholders' equity would be $33.86 million, $25.05 million and
$335.55 million, respectively, in the pro forma balance sheet at March 31, 2001;
the number of shares used to compute earnings per share would increase by 1.13
million shares and earnings per share would be the same as the amount presented
in the pro forma condensed consolidated statement of income for the year ended
December 31, 2000; and the number of shares used to compute earnings per share
would increase by 1.13 million shares and earnings per share would be the same
as the amount presented in the pro forma condensed consolidated statement of
income for the three months ended March 31, 2001.

     Assuming the maximum exchange ratio provided in the merger agreement, which
is 0.16585, the purchase price, the adjustment to reflect goodwill from the
merger and shareholders' equity would be $60.95 million, $52.14 million and
$362.63 million, respectively, in the pro forma condensed consolidated balance
sheet at March 31, 2001; the number of shares used to compute earnings per share
would increase by 2.03 million shares and earnings per share would decrease by
$0.01 from the amount presented in the pro forma condensed consolidated
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2000; and the number of
shares used to compute earnings per share would have increased by 2.031 million
shares and earnings per share would be the same as the amount presented in the
pro forma condensed consolidated statement of income for the three months ended
March 31, 2001.

     OCA believes that the assumptions used in preparing the unaudited pro forma
consolidated financial statements provide a reasonable basis for presenting all
of the significant effects of the merger other than any synergies anticipated by
OCA and nonrecurring charges directly attributable to the merger and that will
result from combining operations, and that the pro forma adjustments give effect
to those assumptions in the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and
the unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income.

     The information in the following tables is based on the historical
financial information of OCA and OrthAlliance that has been presented in their
prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and which have been
incorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement/Prospectus. All of the
summary financial information provided in the following tables should be read in
connection with this historical financial information. For information on how to
obtain OCA's and/or OrthAlliance's historical financial information presented in
their prior filings, you should refer to the section of this document captioned
"WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION." The financial information as of and for
the interim periods ended March 31, 2001 and 2000 has not been audited and in
the respective opinions of management reflects all adjustments, consisting only
of normal recurring adjustments necessary to a fair presentation of such data.

"N/A"  Not applicable for the period indicated.
(1) This amount represents a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
    principle effective January 1, 1999 related to Statement of Position 98-5,
    "Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities."
(2) This amount represents a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
    principle effective January 1, 2000 related to revenue recognition and Staff
    Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements"
    ("SAB 101").
(3) These amounts represent the full dilutive effect of the exercise of common
    equivalent shares (stock options) outstanding during the year.
(4) Pro forma amounts were calculated assuming OCA's change in revenue
    recognition effective January 1, 2000 pursuant to SAB 101 had been in effect
    for all periods presented.
(5) These amounts are presented as of the end of the period.
(6) These amounts represent the growth in net revenue in the indicated period
    relative to the comparable prior-year period by orthodontic centers that
    were affiliated with OCA throughout each of the two periods being compared.
    There were 53 of these comparable orthodontic centers in 1995, 75 in 1996,
    130 in 1997, 227 in 1998, 332 in 1999, 469 in 2000, 468 in the three months
    ended March 31, 2000 and 527 in the three months ended March 31, 2001. The
    amount of that growth has been significantly affected by the number of
    newly-opened orthodontic centers included in the computation, because
    newly-opened orthodontic centers have experienced significant growth during
    their first 26 months of operations. The average term of a patient contract
    is about 26 months. OCA's affiliated orthodontic centers have typically
    reached maturity as patients are added during the first 26 months of
    operations.
(7) This amount represents the growth in net revenue in 2000 for orthodontic
    centers open throughout 1999 and 2000, compared to pro forma net revenue for
    these centers in 1999, calculated as if OCA's change in accounting principle
    pursuant to SAB 101 effective January 1, 2000 had been in effect throughout
    1999 and 2000.
(8) To conform to the balance sheet presentation as of December 31, 2000,
    amounts reported as of December 31, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999 as patient
    prepayments (previously reported as a liability) have been reclassified as a
    reduction of service fees receivable.

                          ORTHALLIANCE SPECIAL MEETING

GENERAL

     This Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first being mailed on or about
            , 2001 to all persons who were OrthAlliance stockholders on
            , 2001.

     Along with this Proxy Statement/Prospectus, OrthAlliance stockholders are
being provided with a Notice of Special Meeting and a form of proxy card that is
solicited by OrthAlliance's Board of Directors for use at the special meeting of
OrthAlliance stockholders and at any adjournments or postponements of that
meeting.

     At the special meeting, OrthAlliance stockholders will consider and vote
upon a proposal to approve and adopt an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as
of May 16, 2001, among OrthAlliance, OCA and OCA's wholly-owned subsidiary, OCA
Acquisition Corporation. The merger agreement provides for the merger of OCA
Acquisition Corporation into OrthAlliance, with OrthAlliance thereby becoming a
wholly-owned subsidiary of OCA.

     The special meeting of OrthAlliance stockholders will be held at the
following time and place:

                                           , 2001
                                   .m. (          Time)

     OCA stockholders are not voting on the merger agreement.

PROXIES

     We encourage you to promptly vote your proxy by completing, signing, dating
and returning the enclosed proxy card solicited by OrthAlliance's Board of
Directors, even if you plan to attend the special meeting.

     You may revoke any proxy given in connection with this solicitation by:

     - Delivering to OrthAlliance's corporate Secretary a written notice
       revoking the proxy prior to the taking of the vote at the OrthAlliance
       special meeting;

     - Delivering a duly executed proxy relating to the same shares bearing a
       later date; or

     - Attending the meeting and voting in person (although, attendance at the
       OrthAlliance special meeting without voting at the meeting will not in
       and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy).

     You should address all written notices of revocation and other
communications with respect to the revocation of proxies to the following:

                               OrthAlliance, Inc.
                      21535 Hawthorne Boulevard, Suite 200
                           Torrance, California 90503
                      Attention: Paul H. Hayase, Secretary

     For a notice of revocation or later proxy to be valid, however,
OrthAlliance must actually receive it prior to the vote of OrthAlliance
stockholders at the special meeting. OrthAlliance will vote all shares of
OrthAlliance common stock represented by valid proxies received through this
solicitation, and not revoked before they are exercised. If no specification is
made, OrthAlliance will vote the proxies in favor of approval of the merger
agreement.

     OrthAlliance is currently unaware of any other matters that may be
presented for action at the OrthAlliance special meeting. If other matters do
properly come before the special meeting, then shares of

OrthAlliance common stock represented by proxies will be voted (or not voted) by
the persons named in the proxies in their discretion.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, OrthAlliance will
request banks, brokers and other record holders of OrthAlliance common stock to
send proxy cards and proxy material to the beneficial owners of OrthAlliance
common stock and obtain their voting instructions, if necessary. OrthAlliance
will reimburse these record holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing.
If necessary, OrthAlliance may also use several of its regular employees, who
will not be specially compensated, to solicit proxies from OrthAlliance
stockholders, either personally or by telephone, telegram, facsimile or special
delivery letter.

RECORD DATE AND VOTING RIGHTS

     OrthAlliance's Board of Directors has fixed             , 2001 as the
record date for the determination of OrthAlliance stockholders entitled to
receive notice of and to vote at OrthAlliance's special meeting of stockholders.
Accordingly, only OrthAlliance stockholders of record at the close of business
on             , 2001 will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the special
meeting. At the close of business on OrthAlliance's record date, there were
     shares of OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common stock entitled to vote
together as a single group at the special meeting, held by approximately
          holders of record, and the directors and executive officers of
OrthAlliance beneficially owned about   % of the outstanding shares of
OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common stock.

     The presence, in person or by proxy, of stockholders holding a majority of
the voting power of all outstanding shares of OrthAlliance Class A and Class B
common stock entitled to vote will constitute a quorum for the special meeting.
Each share of OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common stock outstanding on the
record date entitles the holder of the share to one vote as to the approval of
the merger agreement or any other proposal that may properly come before the
special meeting.

     For purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the
transaction of business, OrthAlliance will count shares of OrthAlliance Class A
and Class B common stock present in person at the special meeting but not
voting, and for which OrthAlliance has received proxies but with respect to
which holders of such shares have abstained, as present at the special meeting.
Abstentions are counted as present at the special meeting for purposes of
determining whether a quorum exists and have the effect of a vote "against" any
matter as to which they are specified. Proxies submitted by brokers that do not
indicate a vote for some or all of the proposals because they don't have
discretionary voting authority and have not received instructions as to how to
vote on those proposals (so-called "broker non-votes") will be counted as
present at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum
exists and have the effect of a vote "against" any proposal as to which
instructions on how to vote were not provided.

     Under OrthAlliance's bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law,
approval of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of
a majority of the outstanding shares of OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common
stock, voting together as a single class, that are entitled to vote at the
special meeting. Because approval of the merger agreement requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of OrthAlliance Class A
and Class B common stock, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same
effect as negative votes. Accordingly, OrthAlliance's Board of Directors urges
you to complete, date and sign the accompanying proxy card and return it
promptly in the enclosed, postage-paid envelope.

RECOMMENDATION OF ORTHALLIANCE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     OrthAlliance's Board of Directors has approved the merger agreement.
OrthAlliance's Board of Directors believes that the merger is in the best
interests of OrthAlliance and its stockholders and recommends that OrthAlliance
stockholders vote "FOR" approval and adoption of the merger agreement. The
conclusion of OrthAlliance's Board of Directors with respect to the merger is
based on a number of factors, including the receipt of a fairness opinion from
OrthAlliance's financial advisor. See "THE

MERGER -- OrthAlliance's Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of
OrthAlliance's Board of Directors."

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     When the merger is completed, holders of OrthAlliance Class B common stock
who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who comply
with the procedures prescribed in Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law will be entitled to a judicial appraisal of the fair value of
their shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment
or expectation of the merger, and to receive payment of the fair value of their
shares in cash, together with a judicially determined fair rate of interest.
Appraisal rights are available to holders of OrthAlliance Class B common stock
under the Delaware General Corporation Law because OrthAlliance Class B common
stock is neither publicly traded nor held of record by more than 2,000 holders.
HOLDERS OF ORTHALLIANCE CLASS A COMMON STOCK ARE NOT ENTITLED TO APPRAISAL
RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER BECAUSE SHARES OF ORTHALLIANCE CLASS A
COMMON STOCK ARE QUOTED FOR PUBLIC TRADING ON THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET NATIONAL
MARKET SYSTEM.

     Appraisal rights allow the stockholder to receive cash in the amount of the
fair value of the shares as appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery in lieu
of consideration the stockholder would otherwise receive in the merger. A person
having a beneficial interest in shares of OrthAlliance Class B common stock that
are held of record in the name of another person, such as a broker or nominee,
must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized
below properly and in a timely manner to perfect whatever appraisal rights the
beneficial owner may have.

     The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining
to appraisal rights under Delaware law. Any holder of OrthAlliance Class B
common stock who wishes to exercise such appraisal rights, or who wishes to
preserve his or her right to do so, should review Section 262 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law, a copy of which is attached as Annex B to this Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and the following discussion carefully. Because of the
complexity of Section 262 and the need to strictly comply with various technical
requirements, you should read Annex B in its entirety.

     The availability of appraisal rights is conditioned upon full compliance
with procedures set forth in Section 262 of Delaware General Corporation Law.
Failure to comply timely and properly with the procedures specified in that
section will result in the complete loss of appraisal rights. Accordingly, any
OrthAlliance Class B stockholder who wishes to receive the value of his or her
OrthAlliance Class B common stock in cash should consult with his or her own
legal counsel.

     PROCEDURE FOR THE EXERCISE OF ORTHALLIANCE CLASS B STOCKHOLDERS APPRAISAL
RIGHTS.  At least 20 days prior to the special meeting at which the merger
agreement is submitted to OrthAlliance stockholders for approval, OrthAlliance
must notify each holder of Class B common stock that appraisal rights are
available under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and include
in such notice a copy of Section 262. THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS
CONSTITUTES SUCH NOTICE, AND THE APPLICABLE STATUTORY PROVISIONS ARE ATTACHED TO
THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AS ANNEX B.

     In order to be eligible to exercise appraisal rights, an OrthAlliance Class
B stockholder must:

     - Deliver to OrthAlliance a written demand for appraisal of the
       stockholder's shares prior to the vote on the merger agreement; and

     - Not vote such shares of OrthAlliance Class B common stock in favor of the
       merger agreement.

     A vote against the adoption of the merger agreement will not in and of
itself constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of
Section 262. The written demand must reasonably inform OrthAlliance of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends to demand appraisal
of the fair value of the shares of OrthAlliance Class B common stock that he or
she holds. A stockholder's failure to make the written demand prior to the
taking of the vote on the adoption of the

merger agreement at the special meeting of OrthAlliance stockholders will
constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.

     If the merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective date of the
merger, OrthAlliance, as the surviving corporation of the proposed merger with
OCA Acquisition Corporation, must notify each dissenting holder of OrthAlliance
Class B common stock who satisfied the statutory requirements for appraisal
rights of the date of the completion of the merger.

     JUDICIAL APPRAISAL OF ORTHALLIANCE CLASS B COMMON STOCK.  Within 120 days
after the completion of the merger, OrthAlliance or any OrthAlliance Class B
stockholder who has complied with Section 262 may file a petition in the
Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the
holder's shares of OrthAlliance Class B common stock. OrthAlliance is under no
obligation to file such a petition and has no present intention to file such a
petition. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the holders of OrthAlliance Class
B common stock to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal
rights in respect of their shares of OrthAlliance Class B common stock within
the time period prescribed in Section 262.

     Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, any OrthAlliance
Class B stockholder who has complied with the requirements for the exercise of
appraisal rights under Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to
receive from OrthAlliance a statement setting forth the aggregate number of
shares of OrthAlliance Class B common stock not voted in favor of the adoption
of the merger agreement and with respect to which demands for appraisal have
been received and the aggregate number of stockholders of such shares.
OrthAlliance must mail such statement within 10 days after receipt of a written
request for the statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period
for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.

     If a holder of OrthAlliance Class B common stock timely files a petition
for appraisal and a copy of the petition is served upon OrthAlliance,
OrthAlliance will be obligated within 20 days to file with the Delaware Register
in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all
holders of Class B common stock who have demanded payments for their shares and
with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached.
After notice to such stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court
of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on such a petition to determine
those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become
entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262. The Delaware Court of Chancery
may require the holders of OrthAlliance Class B common stock who demanded
payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware
Register in Chancery for notation on the certificate of the pendency of the
appraisal proceeding. If any stockholder fails to comply with such direction,
the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such
stockholder.

     After determining the holders of OrthAlliance Class B common stock entitled
to an appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the fair value of
their shares of OrthAlliance Class B common stock, exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together
with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to
be fair value. Holders of OrthAlliance Class B common stock considering seeking
appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of OrthAlliance
Class B common stock as so determined could be more than, the same as or less
than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not
seek appraisal of their shares of OrthAlliance Class B common stock. They should
also be aware that investment banking opinions as to fairness from a financial
point of view are not necessarily opinions as to fair value under Section 262.
The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that proof of value by any techniques or
methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and
otherwise admissible in court should be considered in the appraisal proceedings.
In addition, Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy,
depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be the exclusive remedy of a
stockholder seeking appraisal. The Delaware Court of Chancery will also
determine the amount of interest, if any, to be paid upon the amounts to be
received by persons whose shares of OrthAlliance Class B common stock have been
appraised. The costs of the action may be determined by

the court and taxed upon the parties as the court deems equitable. The court may
also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal
proceeding, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares entitled to be
appraised.

     Any holder of OrthAlliance Class B common stock who has duly demanded an
appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not, after the effective time of
the merger, be entitled to vote the shares of OrthAlliance Class B common stock
subject to such demand for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of
dividends or other distributions on those shares of OrthAlliance Class B common
stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of
OrthAlliance Class B common stock as of a record date prior to the completion of
the merger).

     If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his or her shares of
OrthAlliance Class B common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or
effectively withdraws or loses, such holder's right to appraisal, the shares of
OrthAlliance Class B common stock of such stockholder will be deemed to have
been converted at completion of the merger into the right to receive the
appropriate number of shares of OCA common stock. A stockholder will fail to
perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder's right to appraisal if no
petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the completion of the
merger, or if the stockholder delivers to OrthAlliance a written withdrawal of
the holder's demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the merger, except that
any such stockholder's attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the
completion of the merger will require the written approval of OrthAlliance and,
once a petition for appraisal is filed, the appraisal proceeding may not be
dismissed as to any stockholder absent court approval.

                                   THE MERGER

     The discussion in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus of the merger of OCA
Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of OCA, into OrthAlliance,
with OrthAlliance thereby becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of OCA, does not
purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the full text of the
merger agreement and the other annexes attached to, and incorporated by
reference into, this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

DESCRIPTION OF THE MERGER

     Upon completion of the merger, OCA Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of OCA, will merge into OrthAlliance, the separate corporate
existence of OCA Acquisition Corporation will cease, and OrthAlliance will be
the surviving corporation and continue to exist as a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of OCA. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain
conditions set forth in the merger agreement, the merger will become effective
upon the filing of articles of merger in the offices of the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation
Law. See "THE MERGER AGREEMENT -- Conditions to the Merger."

     At the effective time of the merger, OrthAlliance stockholders, other than
holders of OrthAlliance Class B common stock who perfect appraisal rights under
Delaware law, will have no further rights as OrthAlliance stockholders, other
than to receive the consideration to be issued to them in the merger. After the
effective time, there will be no transfers on OrthAlliance's stock transfer
books of shares of OrthAlliance common stock. If, after the effective time of
the merger, stock certificates representing shares of OrthAlliance common stock
are presented for transfer to the exchange agent for the merger, they will be
canceled and exchanged for certificates representing shares of OCA common stock
as provided in the merger agreement.

     The merger will have the effects set forth in Section 251 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law.

     Upon completion of the merger, OCA Acquisition Corporation's articles of
incorporation and bylaws as in effect upon completion of the merger will be
those of OrthAlliance, as the surviving corporation.

EXCHANGE RATIO

     At the effective time of the merger, automatically by virtue of the merger
and without any action on the part of any party or stockholder, each share of
OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common stock outstanding immediately prior to
the effective time will become and be converted into the right to receive a
fixed number of shares of OCA common stock. The amount of the exchange ratio
will depend upon how many of 184 designated orthodontists and pediatric dentists
who are owners/employees of professional entities that are parties to
OrthAlliance service or consulting agreements, enter into, along with their
professional entity, amendments to their respective employment agreements and
service or consulting agreements prior to the merger, as provided in the merger
agreement and the percentage of OrthAlliance's service fees during the 12 months
ended March 31, 2001 represented by those orthodontists and pediatric dentists.
The following chart describes the number of shares of OCA common stock to be
exchanged for each share of Class A and Class B common stock:

                                    ORTHALLIANCE AFFILIATED PRACTITIONERS EXECUTING AMENDMENTS

                                                              PERCENTAGE OF ORTHALLIANCE ANNUAL
EXCHANGE RATIO                           NUMBER                   SERVICE FEES REPRESENTED
- --------------                     ------------------         ---------------------------------

0.09214..........................  56 or less           or    Less than 31.00%
0.10135..........................  At least 57 to 75    and   At least 31.00%-40.99%
0.11056..........................  At least 76 to 93    and   At least 41.00%-50.99%
0.12899..........................  At least 94 to 112   and   At least 51.00%-60.99%
0.16585..........................  113 or more          and   61.00% or more

     As of             , 2001,   of these designated orthodontists and pediatric
dentists, along with their respective professional entity, have amended their
respective employment agreements and OrthAlliance

service or consulting agreements, representing   % of OrthAlliance's service
fees during the 12 months ended March 31, 2001. Based upon those amounts,
OrthAlliance stockholders would receive 0.      shares of OCA common stock for
each share of OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common stock in the merger. These
amounts, however, may change prior to completion of the merger.

     In the amendment to their respective employment agreement, the OrthAlliance
affiliated orthodontist or pediatric dentist, and his or her professional
entity, would agree to include OrthAlliance as a third party beneficiary and
continue the orthodontist's or pediatric dentist's employment as an orthodontist
or pediatric dentist, as applicable, for a period of at least three years
following the merger. In the amendment to his or her respective OrthAlliance
service or consulting agreement, the OrthAlliance affiliated orthodontist or
pediatric dentist, and his or her professional entity, would agree to use OCA's
proprietary computer software and business systems in connection with the
business functions of his or her practice, maintain the current status of the
advertisement or non-advertisement, as the case may be, of his or her practice
to the general public, unless OCA otherwise agrees, and continue the
orthodontist's or pediatric dentist's employment as an orthodontist or pediatric
dentist, as applicable, for a period of at least three years following the
merger.

     The exchange ratio will not be adjusted to reflect any change in the price
of OCA common stock. OCA expects the market price of its common stock to
fluctuate due to market factors beyond its control between the date of this
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the date on which the merger is completed and
thereafter. Since the exchange ratio, once determined, is fixed and the market
price of OCA common stock is expected to fluctuate and may decrease, the implied
market value of OCA common stock that OrthAlliance stockholders will receive in
the merger may increase or decrease prior to completion of the merger. For
further information concerning the historical market prices of OCA common stock
and OrthAlliance Class A common stock, see "PRICE RANGE OF COMMON STOCK AND
DIVIDENDS." OCA cannot assure you that the market price of OCA common stock will
not decrease before or after the merger.

     If, prior to the merger, shares of OCA common stock are changed into a
different number or class of shares due to any reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or
if a stock dividend is declared on the shares of OCA common stock with a record
date prior to the merger, the exchange ratio will be adjusted accordingly.

     Shares of OrthAlliance Class B common stock with respect to which appraisal
rights have been properly demanded in accordance with Section 262 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law or held directly or indirectly by OCA or
OrthAlliance or any of their respective subsidiaries will not be converted into
OCA common stock automatically at the effective time of the merger. At the
effective time, all shares of OrthAlliance common stock held directly or
indirectly by OCA or OrthAlliance or any of their respective subsidiaries will
be canceled and will cease to exist, and no OCA common stock or other
consideration will be delivered in exchange for such shares. Also at the
effective time, all shares of OCA common stock held by OrthAlliance or its
subsidiaries will become treasury stock and all other shares of OCA common stock
outstanding as of the effective time will remain outstanding.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Shares of OrthAlliance Class B common stock as to which appraisal rights
have been properly demanded under Delaware law will not be converted into the
right to receive, or be exchangeable for, OCA common stock. Instead, the holders
of these shares will be entitled to cash payment of the appraisal value of the
shares in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporate Law.
However, if any holder of these shares subsequently delivers a written
withdrawal of their demand for appraisal rights, or if any holder fails to
establish his or her entitlement to appraisal rights, the holder will forfeit
his or her appraisal rights and his or her shares of OrthAlliance Class B common
stock will be deemed to have been converted into the right to receive, and to
have become exchangeable for, the consideration due under the merger agreement.
See "ORTHALLIANCE SPECIAL MEETING -- Appraisal Rights."

OUTSTANDING OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

     At the effective time of the merger, each unexpired option or warrant
granted by OrthAlliance to purchase shares of OrthAlliance common stock which is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time will cease
to represent a right to acquire shares of OrthAlliance common stock and will
automatically be assumed by OCA and converted into an option or warrant, as
applicable, to purchase a number of shares of OCA common stock at an exercise
price determined as follows:

     - The number of shares of OCA common stock to be subject to an option or
       warrant as converted will equal the product of the number of shares of
       OrthAlliance common stock subject to the option or warrant times the
       exchange ratio, with any fractional shares of OCA common stock rounded
       down to the nearest whole share; and

     - The exercise price per share of OCA common stock under an option or
       warrant as converted will equal the exercise price per share of
       OrthAlliance common stock subject to the option or warrant divided by the
       exchange ratio, with the exercise price rounded up to the nearest cent.

     At the effective time of the merger agreement, the other terms of each
OrthAlliance option or warrant will continue to apply in accordance with its
terms, the applicable stock option plan and applicable law, except that
references to OrthAlliance and its subsidiaries will mean OCA and its
subsidiaries.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     In 1999, OrthAlliance began a review of its business and corporate strategy
in light of the declining market price of OrthAlliance Class A common stock.

     In September 1999, representatives of OrthAlliance and OCA engaged in
preliminary discussions about the possibility of pursuing a strategic merger or
acquisition. OCA indicated that it was not interested in pursuing such a
transaction at that time.

     On March 9, 2000, OrthAlliance engaged U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray to advise
OrthAlliance with respect to strategic and financial alternatives to enhance
stockholder value and created a special committee of OrthAlliance's Board of
Directors to explore proposals for the combination, sale or restructuring of
OrthAlliance. This special committee consisted of three directors of
OrthAlliance, W. Dennis Summers, G. Harry Durity and Craig McKnight. During
Spring 2000, OrthAlliance's Board of Directors and the special committee
received presentations from management and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray as to
various matters, including an overview of several strategic alternatives. U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray then began a process of soliciting indications of interest
from parties who might be interested in buying, or making an equity investment
in, OrthAlliance. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and OrthAlliance prepared a
confidential offering memorandum describing OrthAlliance and between March 2000
and October 2000, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray contacted approximately 73
potential financial buyers, 37 of whom signed a confidentiality agreement and
received the confidential memorandum. The one potential strategic buyer
identified by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray was OCA, who at that time did not
express an interest in OrthAlliance.

     Four potential financial buyers submitted preliminary non-binding
indications of interest during Summer 2000, three of whom conducted a due
diligence review of OrthAlliance and received presentations from OrthAlliance
management. OrthAlliance also received an additional inquiry from another party
proposing a $15 million to $20 million private equity transaction. In late
August 2000, one of the potential financial buyers submitted a non-binding offer
to acquire OrthAlliance and the party that submitted the private equity inquiry
submitted a revised offer. The special committee's attempts to improve either
offer in the succeeding weeks were unsuccessful, and both potential investors
soon informed OrthAlliance that they were no longer interested in a transaction
with OrthAlliance, even at lower transaction values. Effective October 16, 2000,
OrthAlliance's Board of Directors disbanded the special committee, because it
determined that none of the potential investors was interested in proceeding and
that there were no remaining expressions of interest for OrthAlliance to pursue.
On October 16, 2000, the closing price of OrthAlliance's Class A common stock
was $4.1875 per share.

     In early November, another potential financial buyer contacted U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray to express an interest in participating in a "going private"
transaction and over the next several months engaged in discussions with U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray and OrthAlliance's management. In mid-December 2000, this
potential financial buyer provided a preliminary term sheet to OrthAlliance.

     To avoid potential conflicts of interest that could have arisen from the
evaluation of the potential financial buyer's proposal for the acquisition of
OrthAlliance or other proposals submitted by, or with the participation of,
members of OrthAlliance's Board of Directors, management and/or affiliated
orthodontists and pediatric dentists, on January 2, 2001, OrthAlliance's Board
of Directors formed a new special committee to evaluate all anticipated
proposals for the combination, sale or restructuring of OrthAlliance. The
special committee was authorized to consider the terms of any such proposals, to
negotiate definitive agreements with respect to such proposals and to report to
OrthAlliance's Board of Directors the special committee's recommendations and
conclusions with respect to any proposals. In making its determinations, the
special committee was authorized to establish such procedures, review such
information, and engage such financial advisors and legal counsel as it deemed
appropriate. OrthAlliance's Board selected Messrs. Durity and McKnight as the
members of the special committee. Messrs. Durity and McKnight were members of
OrthAlliance's Board of Directors and were not employed by OrthAlliance or any
of OrthAlliance's affiliated practices.

     In early January 2001, Bartholomew F. Palmisano, Sr., the Chief Executive
Officer of OCA, engaged in preliminary discussions with W. Dennis Summers, the
Interim Chief Executive Officer of OrthAlliance, regarding the possibility of
the parties pursuing a strategic merger. The parties entered into a
confidentiality agreement to facilitate the exchange of due diligence materials.
On January 5, 2001, Mr. Summers, other representatives of OrthAlliance and two
of OrthAlliance's affiliated practitioners met with Mr. Palmisano in Metairie,
Louisiana to engage in further preliminary discussions. The parties did not
elect to pursue a transaction at that time.

     The potential financial buyer conducted due diligence at OrthAlliance's
main business office in mid-January 2001 and indicated that it was interested in
continuing to proceed with a transaction.

     On January 24, 2001, OrthAlliance issued a press release stating that its
Board of Directors had adopted resolutions creating a special committee to
explore strategic alternatives to increase stockholder value and that the
special committee was authorized to hire an investment banker and other advisors
to assist the special committee in performing its duties.

     On January 31, 2001, OrthAlliance's Board of Directors reconstituted the
special committee due to time conflicts in the business schedule of Mr. Durity,
replacing Mr. Durity with Robert W. Miller, a newly-appointed member of
OrthAlliance's Board. Mr. Miller was not employed by OrthAlliance or any of
OrthAlliance's affiliated practices.

     On February 9, 2001, the special committee met with U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray to discuss the firm's relationship with OrthAlliance, its prior efforts
to arrange a strategic transaction for OrthAlliance and its view of
OrthAlliance's long-term prospects. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray informed the
special committee that it was currently in discussions with several potential
bidders, including the potential financial buyer that expressed an interest in
pursuing a "going private" transaction. The special committee also met with
members of OrthAlliance's management to discuss OrthAlliance's financial
condition and future prospects, the status of pending litigation and certain
notices received by OrthAlliance from affiliated practitioners threatening to
terminate their service and consulting agreements with OrthAlliance.

     On February 16, 2001, the special committee again met with U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray and formally engaged U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray to serve as its
financial advisor. At the meeting, the special committee then reviewed with its
advisors a draft merger agreement it had received from the potential financial
buyer proposing to acquire OrthAlliance for $4.25 cash per share of OrthAlliance
common stock. Members of the special committee expressed concern over several
provisions in the draft merger agreement, particularly a "break-up" fee of $5
million if the transaction was not completed by August 1, 2001 and several

conditions to complete the merger that were not within the control of
OrthAlliance, such as the following conditions:

     - OrthAlliance affiliated practitioners representing at least 75% of
       OrthAlliance's annual revenue for fiscal year 2000 must have agreed to
       extend their employment agreements with OrthAlliance's affiliated
       practices until September 30, 2004;

     - OrthAlliance affiliated practitioners must have agreed to co-invest in
       cash or OrthAlliance common stock approximately $19 million in a parent
       company of OrthAlliance's successor; and

     - OrthAlliance's revolving credit facility must have remained in place on
       substantially the same terms following the financial buyer's acquisition
       of OrthAlliance.

The special committee negotiated with the potential financial buyer and
attempted to revise the draft merger agreement to exclude or revise these
conditions and to reduce or restructure the break-up fee.

     From February 16 to February 22, 2001, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed
certain financial and other information concerning OrthAlliance, met with
certain members of OrthAlliance's management and met by telephone with the
potential financial buyer to discuss its proposal. During the same period, the
special committee met by telephone with the potential financial buyer to
negotiate the terms of the draft merger agreement.

     On February 22, 2001, Mr. Miller, on behalf of the special committee, and
representatives of the potential financial buyer met in Atlanta, Georgia, to
negotiate the terms of the draft merger agreement. During the meeting, the
potential financial buyer was unwilling to increase the cash price per share to
be paid to OrthAlliance's stockholders and indicated that its initial $4.25 cash
offer would be subject to downward adjustment based on its continuing due
diligence review of OrthAlliance. The potential financial buyer also expressed
hesitation in acquiring OrthAlliance unless the acquisition was structured as an
acquisition led by OrthAlliance affiliated practitioners. At the conclusion of
the meeting, the potential financial buyer informed the special committee that
it was suspending further negotiations until it discussed with certain
OrthAlliance affiliated practitioners their degree of support for the potential
financial buyer's acquisition proposal. Those discussions ensued during March
2001.

     On March 30, 2001, the special committee received a term sheet containing a
revised proposal from the potential financial buyer and from certain of
OrthAlliance's affiliated practitioners, including the following members of
OrthAlliance's Board: Dr. Randall K. Bennett, Dr. Douglas D. Durbin, Dr. Raymond
G. W. Kubisch, Dr. Stephen G. Tracey and Dr. Larry D. Dormois. The revised
proposal set forth terms substantially similar to the terms contained in the
draft merger agreement previously presented to the special committee, although
the potential financial buyer now proposed a formula-based price tied to the
average market price per share of OrthAlliance's Class A common stock prior to
execution of a definitive agreement, rather than a fixed cash price per share.
The formula-based price yielded a price per share of OrthAlliance common stock
of $2.79 to OrthAlliance's stockholders as of the date of the revised proposal.

     Between April 6, 2001 and April 24, 2001, the parties and their
representatives engaged in negotiations regarding the terms of the revised
proposal as set forth in a revised draft of the merger agreement. During these
negotiations, the potential financial buyer stated that it would be necessary
for it to maintain a relationship with OrthAlliance's senior lenders following
the potential financial buyer's acquisition of OrthAlliance. The special
committee informed the potential financial buyer that OrthAlliance's senior
lenders would likely require a reduction in their commitments to OrthAlliance
under OrthAlliance's revolving credit facility and/or some form of additional
equity investment or reduction of indebtedness prior to consenting to any
acquisition of OrthAlliance by the potential financial buyer.

     In early April 2001, Mr. Summers was contacted by Mr. Palmisano, OCA's
Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Palmisano indicated that OCA might be interested in
acquiring OrthAlliance. On April 10, 2001, Mr. Summers informed the special
committee, through its legal counsel, of his discussions with Mr. Palmisano. The
special committee subsequently directed Mr. Summers to continue discussions with

Mr. Palmisano. During April 2001, OCA and its advisors reviewed due diligence
materials provided to them by OrthAlliance.

     On April 24, 2001, the special committee was informed that negotiations
between the potential financial buyer and First Union National Bank, the agent
under OrthAlliance's revolving credit facility, over the terms of a consent by
OrthAlliance's senior lenders to the potential financial buyer's acquisition of
OrthAlliance had been suspended by First Union. Between April 24, 2001 and May
4, 2001, the special committee and its advisors attempted to recommence
negotiations between First Union and the potential financial buyer and to
arrange a meeting between First Union and the potential financial buyer.

     On April 26, 2001, Mr. Summers informed the special committee that he had
arranged a meeting with OCA to discuss a potential transaction with OCA, and
that OCA was retaining Banc of America Securities LLC to act as its financial
advisor in connection with the potential transaction. On April 27, 2001, Mr.
Summers and the special committee's legal counsel met with Mr. Palmisano and
OCA's legal counsel, and discussed possible transaction structures, including a
stock-for-stock merger of the two companies.

     On May 2, 2001, the special committee received a draft merger agreement
from OCA's legal counsel. The special committee and its representatives reviewed
the terms of the draft merger agreement and determined to schedule a meeting
with OCA to further discuss OCA's proposal. Pursuant to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement entered into between OrthAlliance and the potential
financial buyer, the special committee informed the potential financial buyer
that OrthAlliance had received an indication of interest from another bidder.

     On May 4, 2001, Mr. Miller, on behalf of the special committee, and Mr.
Palmisano, on behalf of OCA, along with their respective legal counsel and
financial advisors, met in Atlanta, Georgia. Mr. McKnight attended the meeting
by telephone. During the meeting, the parties discussed the terms of the draft
merger agreement, including a proposed condition to OCA's obligation to complete
the merger based on the execution by a minimum number of OrthAlliance's
affiliated practitioners of certain amendments to their existing employment
agreements and service and consulting agreements with OrthAlliance.

     On May 7, 2001, Mr. Miller spoke by telephone with the potential financial
buyer to discuss its progress in meetings with First Union and whether First
Union was willing to recommend to OrthAlliance's other senior lenders that they
approve the potential financial buyer's acquisition of OrthAlliance. The
potential financial buyer indicated that First Union would be in a position to
consent to the execution of a binding agreement between OrthAlliance and the
potential financial buyer on an expedited basis but that it would take between
two to three weeks before all of OrthAlliance's senior lenders would be in a
position to approve the consummation of the acquisition. The potential financial
buyer indicated that First Union and the other senior lenders were still in the
process of assessing the new credit relationship that would be established if
the potential financial buyer were to acquire OrthAlliance. Mr. Miller informed
the potential financial buyer that he was not opposed to entering into a
definitive agreement with a limited financing contingency necessitated by the
senior lenders' inability to deliver a final approval for the transaction in a
timely manner, but that the acquisition price per share originally proposed by
the potential financial buyer would need to be increased to account for the
addition of such a limited financing contingency. In response, the potential
financial buyer proposed a two-tier offer price of either $2.95 per share
contingent upon 70% of OrthAlliance's affiliated practitioners extending their
employment agreements through September 30, 2004 or $2.55 per share contingent
upon 60% of OrthAlliance's affiliated practitioners similarly extending their
employment agreements. The potential financial buyer further stated that its
offer would expire at noon on May 8, 2001.

     At a meeting of the special committee on May 7, 2001, the special committee
was informed that OrthAlliance's management had received a preliminary proposal
from a second potential financial buyer with respect to the acquisition of
OrthAlliance through an employee stock ownership plan. The special committee
determined that in light of the advanced stages of its negotiations with the
initial potential financial buyer and OCA and the complexities of a transaction
involving an employee stock ownership

plan, it was not in a position to initiate discussions with a new bidder at such
time. The special committee, however, instructed U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray to
communicate to the potential bidder that the special committee would consider
its proposal along with other proposals currently being considered by the
special committee.

     On May 8, 2001, the special committee received a letter from the initial
potential financial buyer sent prior to its noon deadline stating that the
potential financial buyer was rescinding its offer and was no longer interested
in acquiring OrthAlliance. The potential financial buyer stated that pursuing a
transaction with OrthAlliance was not viable for the potential financial buyer
given the position of OrthAlliance's senior lenders and the terms proposed by
the special committee with regard to a limited financing contingency.

     Later on May 8, 2001, Mr. Palmisano contacted Messrs. Miller and McKnight
and communicated to the special committee a revised proposal for OCA's
acquisition of OrthAlliance, including the use of a tiered exchange ratio and
changes to the condition to OCA's obligation to complete the merger based upon
the amount of OrthAlliance's affiliated practitioners who amended the terms of
their employment agreements and service and consulting agreements with
OrthAlliance.

     At a meeting of the special committee on May 8, 2001, the special committee
and its advisors reviewed OCA's revised proposal and determined that in light of
the rescission of the potential financial buyer's proposal earlier in the day
and the substantial improvement in the terms of OCA's proposal, Mr. Miller would
continue his discussions with Mr. Palmisano.

     Between May 8, 2001 and May 11, 2001, representatives of OCA, OrthAlliance
and the special committee continued to negotiate the terms of a merger agreement
between OCA and OrthAlliance.

     On May 9, 2001 and May 14, 2001, OCA's Board of Directors met by telephone
with OCA's management and its advisors to discuss the terms of a potential
merger with OrthAlliance, the results of OCA's due diligence review of
OrthAlliance and Banc of America Securities' preliminary views of the proposed
financial terms of the merger. OCA's Board of Directors discussed the merits of
a transaction with OrthAlliance as well as specific terms of the proposed merger
agreement. OCA's Board authorized Mr. Palmisano to continue negotiations with
OrthAlliance.

     From February 2001 until May 12, 2001, the special committee periodically
updated OrthAlliance's full Board of Directors as to the general status of its
negotiations with the potential financial buyer and OCA.

     On May 12, 2001, OrthAlliance's Board of Directors, together with advisors
to OrthAlliance and the special committee, met in Atlanta, Georgia, to consider
a revised draft of the merger agreement. OrthAlliance's legal counsel reviewed
with OrthAlliance's directors their fiduciary duties in connection with their
consideration of the proposed merger. The special committee's legal counsel
reviewed the principal terms of the draft merger agreement. U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray presented a preliminary analysis of the financial terms of the merger
and the results of its due diligence review of OCA. OrthAlliance's directors
questioned U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray regarding certain aspects of its valuation
methodologies and analyses and extensively discussed the advantages and
disadvantages of the proposed merger with OCA. At the conclusion of the meeting,
OrthAlliance's Board instructed the special committee and its advisors to
continue negotiations with OCA.

     From May 13, 2001 to May 16, 2001, the parties continued to negotiate
specific terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including provisions that
related to determination of the exchange ratios.

     On May 16, 2001, OCA's Board of Directors met in a special meeting held by
telephone to consider the proposed merger with OrthAlliance and the terms of the
proposed merger agreement. OCA's Board received presentations from its advisors
regarding the merger, the terms of the proposed merger agreement and the
directors' fiduciary duties. Banc of America Securities presented a financial
analysis, outlined in materials distributed to OCA's directors, of the exchange
ratio in the merger and delivered its oral opinion, which opinion was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion dated May 16, 2001, to

OCA's Board of Directors that as of such date, and based on and subject to the
assumptions, limitations and considerations stated therein, the exchange ratio
in the merger was fair from a financial point of view to OCA. Following these
presentations and discussions among the members of OCA's Board, the definitive
merger agreement was approved by OCA's Board of Directors.

     Also on May 16, 2001, the special committee, together with its advisors,
held a meeting by telephone to discuss the proposed merger with OCA. A copy of
the final version of the merger agreement, a fairness opinion from U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray and related analyses and other materials had been delivered to the
special committee prior to the meeting. The special committee discussed with its
advisors the terms of the proposed final version of the merger agreement. U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray then presented a financial analysis, outlined in materials
distributed to the special committee, of OCA's offer and delivered an opinion
addressed to the special committee that the merger consideration proposed to be
received by the stockholders of OrthAlliance was fair to the holders of
OrthAlliance common stock from a financial point of view. Following the delivery
of such opinion, the special committee unanimously determined that:

     - The merger, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated were
       advisable, fair to and in the best interests of OrthAlliance and its
       stockholders; and

     - The special committee recommend to OrthAlliance's Board of Directors that
       it approve, accept and declare advisable the merger, the merger agreement
       and the transactions contemplated thereby and recommend to OrthAlliance's
       stockholders that they approve the merger and the merger agreement.

     Following this meeting of the special committee, OrthAlliance's Board of
Directors, together with its advisors and the special committee's legal counsel,
held a meeting by telephone to consider the recommendation of the special
committee and to consider the proposed merger with OCA. A final version of the
merger agreement, the fairness opinion from U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray to the
special committee and related analyses and other materials had been delivered to
the directors prior to the meeting. OrthAlliance's legal counsel reviewed with
the directors the fiduciary duties of the directors and discussed the terms of
the proposed final version of the merger agreement. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
then presented a financial analysis, outlined in materials distributed to
OrthAlliance's Board, of OCA's offer and reviewed its opinion to the special
committee that the merger consideration proposed to be received by the
stockholders of OrthAlliance was fair to the holders of OrthAlliance common
stock from a financial point of view. OrthAlliance's Board extensively discussed
the advantages and disadvantages of entering into a merger agreement with OCA.
In light of the potential conflicts of interests involving the directors who are
practitioners affiliated with OrthAlliance and who might receive incentives,
along with other OrthAlliance affiliated practitioners, to enter into extended
employment, consulting or service agreements with OCA, the directors held two
votes. In the first vote, the directors of OrthAlliance who were not
practitioners affiliated with OrthAlliance determined that:

     - The merger, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
       thereby were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of OrthAlliance
       and its stockholders;

     - OrthAlliance's Board recommend to OrthAlliance's stockholders that they
       approve the merger and the merger agreement; and

     - OrthAlliance's management was authorized to finalize the appropriate
       documents and execute a definitive merger agreement.

In the second vote, OrthAlliance's full Board of Directors, with one dissent,
adopted these same resolutions.

     Final negotiations with respect to the merger agreement and related
schedules continued through the evening of May 16, 2001 and the merger agreement
was executed later that evening. A press release announcing the merger agreement
was issued on May 17, 2001.

ORTHALLIANCE'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER; RECOMMENDATION OF ORTHALLIANCE'S BOARD OF
DIRECTORS

     OrthAlliance's Board of Directors considered and approved the merger
agreement at a special meeting of the Board held on May 16, 2001. In reaching
its decision to approve the merger and the merger agreement, OrthAlliance's
Board of Directors considered the following factors:

     BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PROSPECTS.  In evaluating the terms of
the proposed merger and the merger agreement, OrthAlliance's Board of Directors
considered, among other things, information with respect to the financial
condition, results of operation, business and prospects of OrthAlliance. The
directors particularly considered the future prospects of OrthAlliance,
including the following factors:

     - Growth Prospects.  The Board believed that OrthAlliance's historically
       low stock price and its restricted ability to incur additional
       indebtedness had prevented and would continue to prevent OrthAlliance, as
       an independent company, from realizing its business strategy of expanding
       its network of affiliated orthodontic and pediatric dental practices.
       Specifically, although OrthAlliance regularly had met analysts' earnings
       estimates, the closing price of OrthAlliance's Class A common stock on
       May 16, 2001, the date of the special meeting of OrthAlliance's Board to
       consider the merger, was $3.24 per share, a decrease of 73.0% from
       OrthAlliance's initial public offering price of $12.00 per share on
       August 26, 1997. This low valuation made it difficult for OrthAlliance to
       utilize its common stock in connection with acquisitions. In addition,
       OrthAlliance's revolving credit facility restricted the amount of new
       indebtedness OrthAlliance could incur to fund acquisitions, and
       OrthAlliance was approaching limitations on its leverage ratio and its
       fixed charge coverage ratio included in its revolving credit facility,
       which might also restrict OrthAlliance's ability to affiliate with
       additional practices. OrthAlliance's Board had also been informed by
       OrthAlliance's management that cash from operations might not be
       sufficient to fund OrthAlliance's growth and that OrthAlliance had
       reduced the number of new affiliations with orthodontists and pediatric
       dentists in order to conserve capital resources. OrthAlliance's Board
       further believed that the market price for OrthAlliance Class A common
       stock could decline further as a result of anticipated decreases in
       acquisition activity and an associated decrease in revenue growth
       attributable to acquisitions. OrthAlliance's Board therefore believed
       that OrthAlliance was unlikely to be able to fund, except at a minimum
       level, the expansion of its network of affiliated practices through
       either issuances of equity, the incurrence of additional debt or through
       cash from operations.

     - Deteriorating Relationship with Certain Affiliated
       Practitioners.  Because many of OrthAlliance's affiliated practitioners
       received shares of OrthAlliance common stock and options to purchase
       OrthAlliance common stock in consideration of their affiliation with
       OrthAlliance, OrthAlliance's Board of Directors believed that the
       significant decline in the price of OrthAlliance's Class A common stock
       adversely affected OrthAlliance's relationship with these affiliated
       practitioners. In the Board's opinion, the discontent with the market
       price of OrthAlliance Class A common stock led several affiliated
       practitioners to complain about OrthAlliance's provision of services to
       such affiliated practices and led certain of these practitioners to send
       notices of default to OrthAlliance, or institute litigation against
       OrthAlliance, alleging that OrthAlliance has failed to provide certain
       services to the practitioners' affiliated practices.

     - Potential Loss of Revenue.  OrthAlliance's Board believed that, without a
       significant restructuring of OrthAlliance, a potentially significant
       portion of OrthAlliance's future service fee revenues were at risk of
       being lost beginning in August 2002. Approximately 33.0% of
       OrthAlliance's 2000 net revenue was generated by affiliated practices
       with affiliated practitioners whose initial employment term expires in
       August 2002 and whose employment agreements may be terminated upon one-
       year's prior written notice. In light of the level of dissatisfaction
       with OrthAlliance by certain of its affiliated practitioners,
       OrthAlliance's Board believed there was some risk that some affiliated
       practitioners would exercise their right to terminate their employment
       agreements with OrthAl-

       liance in August 2001, which might reduce OrthAlliance future revenues
       and decrease the market price of OrthAlliance's Class A common stock.

     ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTIONS.  OrthAlliance's Board considered the
opportunities and alternatives available to OrthAlliance if the merger were not
to be undertaken, including the possibilities of continuing to operate
OrthAlliance as an independent entity, a sale of OrthAlliance through a merger
with a company other than OCA and, in respect of each alternative, the timing
and likelihood of actually accomplishing these alternatives. OrthAlliance's
Board concluded that the merger with OCA was the most viable alternative for
addressing the Board's concerns and is more feasible than the alternatives. In
light of the extensive process undertaken by OrthAlliance and U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray to locate a financial or strategic partner, other than OCA,
OrthAlliance's Board concluded it was unlikely that another bidder would make a
definitive proposal to effect a business combination with OrthAlliance which
would result in a transaction that would provide greater value to OrthAlliance's
stockholders. The Board also believed that absent the merger with OCA or a
similar transaction or significant restructuring of OrthAlliance, OrthAlliance
could possibly follow the experience of other orthodontic practice management
companies that have exited the industry because of discontent within their
practice network.

     OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN COMBINED COMPANY.  The overriding reason for
the merger is that OrthAlliance's Board believes the proposed combination of
OrthAlliance and OCA should generate substantially more value for stockholders
than OrthAlliance could generate on its own or in connection with any other
reasonably possible transaction. The Board considered the fact that the merger
would enable OrthAlliance's stockholders to continue to participate in the
growth of the combined business conducted by OCA and OrthAlliance following the
merger and to benefit from the potential appreciation in value of shares of OCA
common stock, based on the expected revenue growth for OCA that would be
generated by its acquisition of OrthAlliance.

     POTENTIAL PREMIUM.  OrthAlliance's Board considered the value of the
exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement relative to the current and
historical market price of OrthAlliance Class A common stock. Specifically,
based on the minimum exchange ratio of 0.09214, and a closing price of OCA
common stock price of $29.50 per share as of May 16, 2001, the value to be
received by OrthAlliance stockholders in the merger represents approximately a
2.23% discount and a 9.16% premium over the average closing price of
OrthAlliance Class A common stock for the 30 and 90 days, respectively, prior to
the announcement of the merger. Based on the maximum exchange ratio of 0.16585,
and a closing price of OCA common stock of $29.50 per share as of May 16, 2001,
the value to be received by OrthAlliance stockholders in the merger represents
approximately a 75.97% and 96.47% premium over the average closing price of
OrthAlliance Class A common stock for the 30 and 90 days, respectively, prior to
the announcement of the merger.

     LIQUIDITY OF OCA STOCK.  OrthAlliance's Board gave consideration to the
fact that OCA's common stock is a highly liquid currency, which will provide
OrthAlliance's stockholders with an increased ability to sell their stock in an
orderly manner without affecting the stock price. Between April 15, 2001 and May
15, 2001, the 30 day period ending the day before the execution of the merger
agreement, OrthAlliance's average daily trading volume was 61,691 shares per
day, compared to 484,355 shares per day for OCA common stock for the same time
period.

     FAIRNESS OPINION.  OrthAlliance's Board considered the opinion of the
special committee's financial advisor, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, to the effect
that the merger consideration proposed to be received by the stockholders of
OrthAlliance was fair to OrthAlliance's stockholders from a financial point of
view.

     SPECIAL COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION.  OrthAlliance's Board also considered the
special committee's recommendation that the Board approve the merger agreement.
In determining to make that recommendation, the special committee also
considered the factors described in this section.

     FIXED EXCHANGE RATIO.  OrthAlliance's Board considered that a fixed
exchange ratio was more favorable under all of the circumstances than an
adjustable exchange ratio, despite the fact that the market price of OCA's
common stock could decrease. Because the exchange ratio, once determined, is

fixed, the aggregate number of shares of OCA common stock to be issued in the
merger will also be fixed. Therefore, as OCA's common stock price fluctuates, so
does the value to be received by OrthAlliance stockholders for their shares of
OrthAlliance common stock. The market value of OCA common stock would also be
subject to the fluctuations of the stock market following the merger.

     TERMINATION PROVISIONS.  OrthAlliance's Board considered as favorable the
provisions of the merger agreement which permit the Board to respond to an
unsolicited proposal with respect to an alternative business combination and to
terminate the merger agreement and approve a superior proposal that the Board
determines in accordance with its fiduciary duties is in the best interest of
OrthAlliance's stockholders.

     LIKELIHOOD OF CLOSING.  OrthAlliance's Board considered as favorable the
likelihood that the merger would be completed, given OCA's experience,
reputation and financial resources.

     TAX CONSEQUENCES.  OrthAlliance's Board considered as favorable the
expected qualification of the merger as a tax-free reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

     POTENTIAL NEGATIVE FACTORS.  OrthAlliance's Board of Directors also
considered and balanced against the potential benefits of the merger, a number
of potentially negative factors, including, the following:

     - The risk that the merger would not be completed, particularly as a result
       of the inability to satisfy the condition that a minimum amount of
       OrthAlliance's affiliated practitioners amend their employment agreements
       and OrthAlliance service or consulting agreements. See "THE MERGER
       AGREEMENT -- Conditions to the Merger."

     - The potential effect of the public announcement of the merger agreement
       on OrthAlliance's operating revenues and operating results and
       OrthAlliance's ability to attract and retain key management and other
       personnel.

     - The possibility that the market value of OCA's common stock might
       decrease, causing less aggregate value to be paid to OrthAlliance
       stockholders.

     - The fact that OrthAlliance's stockholders will not receive the full
       benefit of any future growth in the value of their equity that
       OrthAlliance may have achieved as an independent company, and the
       potential disadvantage to OrthAlliance stockholders if OrthAlliance and
       OCA do not perform well as a combined company.

     - The possibility that some of the provisions of the merger agreement,
       including the non-solicitation and termination fee payment provisions,
       might have the effect of discouraging other persons potentially
       interested in merging with or acquiring OrthAlliance from pursuing such
       an opportunity. See "THE MERGER AGREEMENT -- No Other Transactions
       Involving OrthAlliance."

     - The possibility that certain members of OrthAlliance's management and
       Board of Directors may be deemed to have interests in the merger that are
       different from or in addition to their interests as OrthAlliance
       stockholders generally. See "-- Interests of Certain Persons in the
       Merger."

     This discussion of the factors considered by OrthAlliance's Board of
Directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but is believed to include all
material factors considered by OrthAlliance's Board. In view of the number and
wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the
merger and the complexity of these matters, OrthAlliance's Board of Directors
did not find it practicable to, nor did it attempt to, quantify, rank or
otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors that it considered.
Rather, OrthAlliance's Board of Directors conducted an overall analysis of the
factors described above, including thorough discussions with and questioning of
OrthAlliance management and its legal, financial and accounting advisors. In
considering the factors described above, individual members of OrthAlliance's
Board of Directors may have given different weight to different factors.
OrthAlliance's Board of Directors considered all of these factors as a whole and
overall considered the factors to be favorable to, and to support, its
determination.

     BASED ON A THOROUGH EVALUATION OF THESE FACTORS, ORTHALLIANCE'S BOARD OF
DIRECTORS BELIEVES THE MERGER IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF ORTHALLIANCE
STOCKHOLDERS. ORTHALLIANCE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT ORTHALLIANCE
STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

OCA'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     OCA's Board of Directors believes that the addition of OrthAlliance's
affiliated orthodontists and pediatric dentists will complement OCA's existing
base of over 400 affiliated orthodontists, and enhance OCA's position as the
leading provider of integrated business services to orthodontic practices. OCA's
Board of Directors also believes that the merger will provide the opportunity
for enhanced revenue growth and increased operating margin, and enable OCA to
leverage its computer and operating systems and other resources over a larger
base of affiliated practitioners.

     OCA's Board of Directors deliberated and approved the merger agreement at a
special meeting held on May 16, 2001. In reaching its determination to approve
and adopt the merger agreement, OCA's Board of Directors consulted with OCA's
management and financial, accounting and legal advisors, and considered a number
of factors. The following is a discussion of information and factors considered
by OCA's Board of Directors in reaching this determination. This discussion is
not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered by
OCA's Board of Directors. In the course of its deliberations with respect to the
merger, OCA's Board of Directors discussed the anticipated impact of the merger
on OCA and OCA's stockholders. In reaching its determination to approve and
recommend the merger agreement, OCA's Board of Directors did not assign any
relative or specific weights to the factors considered in reaching such
determination, and individual members of OCA's Board of Directors may have given
differing weights to different factors.

     The following includes the material factors that were considered by OCA's
Board of Directors:

     - Its review, based in part on presentations by OCA's management, and
       legal, accounting and financial advisors, of:

      - The business, operations, technology, dividends, financial condition and

FAIRNESS OPINION OF ORTHALLIANCE'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray was engaged to act as the exclusive financial
advisor in connection with the merger based on U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's
long-standing relationship with OrthAlliance and its reputation, expertise and
experience in similar transactions. On May 16, 2001, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
rendered to the special committee its oral opinion to the effect that, as of
such date and based upon and subject to certain matters stated in the opinion,
the merger consideration proposed to be received by the stockholders of
OrthAlliance was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
OrthAlliance common stock. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray subsequently confirmed its
oral opinion by delivering a written opinion, dated as of May 16, 2001, to the
OrthAlliance special committee.

     The full text of the U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray written opinion is attached
as Annex C to this Proxy Statement/Prospectus. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's
opinion is addressed to the OrthAlliance special committee and does not
constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should
vote at OrthAlliance's special meeting of stockholders. U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray's opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view,
of the proposed merger consideration to the holders of OrthAlliance common
stock, and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray expresses no opinion as to the merits of
the underlying decision by OrthAlliance to engage in the merger. The summary of
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's opinion in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. You
should read the U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray opinion carefully and in its
entirety.

     In connection with its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed certain
publicly available financial and other information concerning OrthAlliance and
OCA and certain internal analyses and other information furnished to, or
discussed with, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray by OrthAlliance and OCA. In addition,
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray relied upon and assumed the accuracy of OrthAlliance
management's concerns that OrthAlliance had limited growth prospects as a
stand-alone company, that OrthAlliance's relationships with certain affiliated
practices were deteriorating due to the decline in the stock price of
OrthAlliance Class A common stock and that there was a potential loss of revenue
in connection with the termination of employment agreements of affiliated
practitioners in August 2002. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray also engaged in
discussions with members of the senior management of OrthAlliance and OCA
regarding the business and prospects of their respective companies and the joint
prospects of a combined company. In addition, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray:

     - Reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for OrthAlliance Class
       A common stock and OCA common stock;

     - Compared certain financial and stock market information for OrthAlliance
       and OCA with similar information for certain other companies whose
       securities are publicly traded;

     - Reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations that
       U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray deemed comparable in whole or in part;

     - Reviewed the terms of the merger agreement and certain related documents;
       and

     - Performed such other studies and analyses and considered such other
       factors as U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray deemed appropriate.

     U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray did not assume responsibility for independent
verification of, and has not independently verified, any information, whether
publicly available or furnished to it, concerning

OrthAlliance, OCA or the combined company, including, but not limited to any
financial information, forecasts or projections considered in connection with
the rendering of its opinion. Accordingly, for purposes of its opinion, U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of
all such information and has not conducted a physical inspection of any of the
properties or assets, and has not prepared or obtained any independent
evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities, of OrthAlliance or
OCA.

     With respect to the financial forecasts and projections made available to
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and used in its analyses, including, but not limited
to, the analyses and forecasts of certain synergies expected by OrthAlliance and
OCA to be achieved as a result of the merger, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray has
assumed that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of OrthAlliance or
OCA, as the case may be, as to the matters covered. In rendering its opinion,
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray expresses no view as to the reasonableness of such
forecasts and projections, including the synergies, or the assumptions on which
they are based. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's opinion was necessarily based upon
economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to it as of May 16, 2001.

     For purposes of rendering its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray assumed,
in all respects material to its analysis, that:

     - The representations and warranties of OrthAlliance, OCA and OCA
       Acquisition Corporation contained in the merger agreement are true and
       correct;

     - OrthAlliance, OCA and OCA Acquisition Corporation will each perform all
       of the covenants and agreements to be performed by it under the merger
       agreement; and

     - All conditions to the obligations of each of OrthAlliance, OCA and OCA
       Acquisition Corporation to complete the merger will be satisfied without
       waiver of any of these conditions.

U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray also assumed that all material governmental,
regulatory or other approvals or consents required in connection with the
completion of the merger will be obtained and that in connection with obtaining
these approvals or consents, or any amendments, modifications or waivers to any
agreements, instruments or orders to which either OrthAlliance or OCA is a party
or is subject, or by which it is bound, no limitations, restrictions or
conditions will be imposed or amendments, modifications or waivers made that
would have a material adverse effect on OrthAlliance or OCA or materially reduce
the contemplated benefits of the merger to OrthAlliance. U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray is expressing no opinion as to the price at which OrthAlliance Class A
common stock or OCA common stock will trade at any time. U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray assumed that the terms were the most beneficial terms from
OrthAlliance's perspective that could, under the circumstances, be negotiated
among the parties and expressed no opinion as to whether any alternative
transaction might be more favorable to OrthAlliance.

     The following is a summary of the material analyses and factors considered
by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in connection with its opinion to the OrthAlliance
special committee dated as of May 16, 2001:

     ANALYSIS OF SELECTED PUBLIC COMPANIES.  U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray compared
certain financial and stock market information for OrthAlliance with similar
information for the following selected publicly held companies:

     - American Dental Partners, Inc.;

     - Birner Dental Management Services, Inc.;

     - Castle Dental Centers, Inc.;

     - InterDent, Inc.;

     - Monarch Dental Corporation; and

     - OCA.

U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray calculated enterprise value, which U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray defined as equity market value plus debt, less cash and equivalents,
relative to each company's latest 12 months revenue and earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray also calculated share price relative to each
company's estimated calendar year 2001 and 2002 earnings per share (commonly
referred to as EPS) estimates. All multiples were based on closing stock prices
on May 15, 2001. EPS estimates for the selected companies were based on
estimates as reported by the Institutional Brokers Estimate System (commonly
referred to as IBES) and Advest, Inc., and EPS estimates for OrthAlliance were
based on the internal estimates of the management of OrthAlliance. This analysis
noted that EPS estimates for 2002 were available for only two of the six
companies in this analysis. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray then compared the
multiples for the selected companies to the multiples for OrthAlliance assuming
OrthAlliance common stock prices of $2.59 and $4.66 in the merger. This analysis
indicated multiples of selected valuation data as follows:

                                                         SELECTED MULTIPLES
                                            ---------------------------------------------

                                            -------------   -----------------------------
                                            $2.59   $4.66   MEDIAN   MEAN    HIGH    LOW

     ANALYSIS OF SELECTED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS.  U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
reviewed multiples of revenue and earnings paid in the following two merger and
acquisition transactions, with the acquiror being listed before the target: TA
Associates, Inc./Physicians' Specialty Corp. and Vestar Capital Partners/
Sheridan Healthcare, Inc. For these selected merger and acquisition
transactions, this analysis indicated multiples of enterprise value to the
latest 12 months net revenue of 1.0x to 1.6x; multiples of enterprise value to
the latest 12 months EBITDA of 6.0x to 9.1x; multiples of enterprise value to
the latest 12 months operating income of 7.9x to 11.7x; and multiples of
enterprise value to the latest 12 months net income of 9.6x to 17.4x. This
analysis noted that there have been no acquisitions of publicly-traded practice
management companies since November 1999.

     PREMIUM PAID ANALYSIS.  U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed the range of
premiums paid in 11 change-of-control transactions of healthcare services
companies with transaction values greater than $50 million completed from
January 1, 1999 to May 15, 2001. These transactions indicated a range of
premiums based on the target company's stock price one-month prior to
announcement of the transaction of (7.6)% to 83.3%, with a mean of 44.8% and a
median of 58.1%, and a one-week prior premium of 2.0% to 85.3%, with a mean of
37.8% and a median of 34.3%. The premium paid in the merger based on a per share
price of $2.59 of OrthAlliance Class A common stock one-month prior, and
one-week prior, to public announcement of the merger were 16.1% and (13.7)%,
respectively. The premium paid in the merger based on a per share price of $4.66
for OrthAlliance Class A common stock for the one-month, and one-week, prior to
public announcement of the merger was 109.0% and 55.3%, respectively.

     DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.  U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray performed a
discounted cash flow analysis for OrthAlliance to estimate the present value of
the stand-alone, unleveraged, after-tax free cash flows that OrthAlliance could
generate through December 31, 2005 based on estimates provided by the management
of OrthAlliance. The stand-alone discounted cash flow analysis was determined by
adding the present value at March 31, 2001 of the projected free cash flows
generated by OrthAlliance over the period from April 1, 2001 through December
31, 2005, the present value of OrthAlliance's estimated terminal value in 2005
and OrthAlliance's cash at March 31, 2001, and subtracting OrthAlliance's total
debt on March 31, 2001. The analysis assumed that 70% of practitioner revenue is
renewed in future periods. The range of estimated terminal values for
OrthAlliance was calculated by applying terminal value multiples ranging from
3.0x to 6.0x to the projected 2005 EBITDA of OrthAlliance. The cash flows and
terminal values were discounted to present value using discount rates ranging
from 23.0% to 27.0% to reflect the uncertainty of contract renewals for
OrthAlliance affiliated orthodontists and pediatric dentists.

This analysis yielded an implied equity reference range for OrthAlliance common
stock of $0.06 to $5.56 per share, as compared to the closing price per share of
OrthAlliance Class A common stock on May 15, 2001 of $3.20.

     CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS.  U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyzed the relative
contribution of OrthAlliance to the estimated revenues, EBITDA and net income of
the combined company in calendar years 2001, 2002 and 2003 based on estimates
provided by the management of OrthAlliance and, with respect to OCA, estimates
of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. Assuming that all services fees are paid under
OrthAlliance's existing contracts and that no contracts are renewed upon
expiration, this analysis indicated the following:

     - For calendar year 2001, OrthAlliance would have contributed approximately
       32.7% of the revenues, 22.2% of the EBITDA and 15.3% of the net income of
       the pro forma combined company;

     - In calendar year 2002, OrthAlliance would have contributed approximately
       28.4% of the revenues, 18.9% of the EBITDA and 12.6% of the net income of
       the pro forma combined company; and

     - In calendar year 2003, OrthAlliance would have contributed approximately
       20.5% of the revenues, 14.0% of the EBITDA and 7.2% of the net income of
       the pro forma combined company.

Based on the minimum amount of the exchange ratio, current holders of
OrthAlliance common stock would own approximately 2.2% of the equity of the pro
forma combined company upon completion of the merger. Based on the maximum
amount of the exchange ratio, current holders of OrthAlliance common stock would
own approximately 3.9% of the equity of the pro forma combined company upon
completion of the merger.

     The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description
of the opinion of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray to the OrthAlliance special
committee or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a
fairness opinion is a complex analytical process involving various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analyses and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances,
and, therefore, such an opinion is not readily susceptible to summary
description. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray believes that its analyses and the
summary set forth above must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions of its analyses, without considering all analyses, or selecting
portions of the above summary, without considering all factors and analyses,
could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying such
analyses and opinion.

     In performing its analyses, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray made numerous
assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the
control of OrthAlliance and OCA. No company, transaction or business used in
such analyses as a comparison is identical to OrthAlliance, the pro forma
combined company or the proposed merger, nor is an evaluation of the results of
such analyses entirely mathematical. Rather, such analyses involve complex
considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics
and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other
values of the companies, businesses or transactions being analyzed. The
estimates contained in such analyses and the ranges of valuations resulting from
any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those
suggested by such analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of
businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the
prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, such
analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

     U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's opinion and financial analyses were only one
of many factors considered by OrthAlliance's special committee and Board in
their evaluation of the proposed merger and should not be viewed as
determinative of the views of OrthAlliance's management with respect to the
proposed merger consideration or the merger.

     U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray is an internationally recognized investment
banking firm and, as a customary part of its investment banking business, is
engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, private placements and
valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. OrthAlliance selected U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray to serve as its exclusive financial advisor based on U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray's long-standing relationship with OrthAlliance and its
reputation, expertise and experience in similar transactions. U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray has in the past provided financial services to OrthAlliance, including
participation as a lender in OrthAlliance's revolving credit facility, for which
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray has received customary compensation. U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray maintains a market in OrthAlliance Class A common stock and
regularly publishes research reports regarding the health care industry and
publicly owned companies in the health care industry. In the ordinary course of
business, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray may actively trade or hold the securities
and other instruments and obligations of OrthAlliance or OCA for its own account
and the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long
or short position in such securities, instruments or obligations.

     Pursuant to a letter agreement, dated February 16, 2001, between
OrthAlliance and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, OrthAlliance agreed to pay U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray $350,000 for rendering its opinion, which amount will be
credited against a transaction fee equal to 1.25% of the transaction value
payable upon completion of the merger. In addition, OrthAlliance has agreed to
reimburse U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses,
not to exceed $50,000 without the prior written consent of OrthAlliance,
including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, and to indemnify U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray and certain related parties against certain liabilities,
including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws, relating to, or
arising out of, its engagement.

FAIRNESS OPINION OF OCA'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     In April 2001, OCA retained Banc of America Securities LLC to act as its
financial advisor in connection with the merger. Banc of America Securities is a
nationally recognized investment banking firm and regularly engages in the
valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other
purposes. OCA selected Banc of America Securities to act as its financial
advisor on the basis of Banc of America Securities' experience and expertise in
transactions similar to the merger, its reputation in the investment community
and its historical investment banking relationship with OCA.

     On May 16, 2001, Banc of America Securities delivered its oral opinion,
which opinion was subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion
dated May 16, 2001, to OCA's Board of Directors that, as of such date, and based
on and subject to the assumptions, limitations and considerations stated
therein, the exchange ratio in the merger was fair from a financial point of
view to OCA.

     The full text of the Banc of America Securities opinion to OCA's Board of
Directors is attached as Annex D. You should read this opinion carefully and in
its entirety in connection with this Proxy Statement/Prospectus. However, also
included is the following summary of the Banc of America Securities opinion,
which is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.

     The Banc of America Securities opinion is addressed to the OCA Board of
Directors. It does not constitute a recommendation or advice of any kind to
OrthAlliance stockholders in connection with the merger. The opinion addresses
only the financial fairness of the exchange ratio to OCA. The opinion does not
address the relative merits of the merger or any alternatives to the merger, the
underlying decision of OCA's Board of Directors to proceed with or effect the
merger or any other aspect of the merger. The opinion does not address the
prices at which OCA common stock or OrthAlliance common stock will trade
following the announcement or consummation of the merger. In furnishing its
opinion, Banc of America Securities did not admit that it is an "expert" as that
term is used in the Securities Act of 1933, nor did Banc of America Securities
admit that its opinion constitutes a report or valuation within the

meaning of the Securities Act. Statements to that effect are included in Banc of
America Securities' opinion.

     For purposes of the opinion, Banc of America Securities:

     - Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other
       business and financial information of OrthAlliance and OCA;

     - Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and
       operating data concerning OrthAlliance and OCA that were prepared by the
       respective managements of OrthAlliance and OCA;

       managements of OrthAlliance and OCA;

     - Reviewed and discussed with the respective managements of OCA and
       OrthAlliance information relating to certain potential strategic,
       financial and operational benefits anticipated to result from the merger
       prepared by the respective managements of OCA and OrthAlliance;

     - Discussed the past and current operations, financial condition and
       prospects of OCA with senior executives of OCA, and the past and current
       operations, financial condition and prospects of OrthAlliance with senior
       executives of OrthAlliance;

     - Reviewed certain pro forma information, prepared by the management of
       OCA, reflecting the potential impact of the merger on OCA's earnings per
       share, cash flow, consolidated capitalization and financial ratios;

     - Reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for OrthAlliance Class
       A common stock and OCA common stock;

     - Compared the financial performance of OrthAlliance and OCA and the prices
       and trading activity of OrthAlliance Class A common stock and OCA common
       stock with that of certain other publicly traded companies it deemed
       generally relevant;

     - Compared certain financial terms of the merger to corresponding financial
       terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other business
       combination transactions it deemed generally relevant;

     - Reviewed a draft of the merger agreement, dated May 16, 2001, and certain
       related documents; and

     - Performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as it
       deemed appropriate.

     In connection with Banc of America Securities' review of the exchange ratio
in the merger, with the consent of OCA's Board of Directors, Banc of America
Securities:

     - Did not assume any responsibility for independent verification of any of
       the information provided to or reviewed by it for the purpose of its
       opinion and relied on such information being complete and accurate in all
       material respects;

     - Was advised, and assumed, with respect to the financial forecasts
       referred to above, including information relating to certain strategic,
       financial and operational benefits anticipated from the merger, that such
       forecasts were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
       available estimates and good faith judgments of the respective
       managements of OrthAlliance and OCA as to the future financial
       performance of OrthAlliance and OCA, respectively;

     - Did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or
       liabilities of OCA, nor was it furnished with any such appraisals;

     - Assumed that the merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization for
       federal income tax purposes and that the merger will be accounted for as
       a purchase for financial accounting purposes;

     - Was not asked to, nor did it, offer any opinion as to the material terms
       of the merger agreement or any related documents or the obligations
       thereunder, or the form of the merger, and assumed that

       each of OCA and OrthAlliance will comply with all material covenants and
       obligations in the merger agreement and that the merger will be validly
       consummated without waiver, modification or amendment of any material
       term, condition or agreement in the merger agreement;

     - Did not participate in negotiations with respect to the terms of the
       merger agreement, assumed that such terms are the most beneficial terms
       from OCA's perspective that could under the circumstances be negotiated
       among the parties and expressed no opinion as to whether any alternative
       transaction might be more favorable to OCA; and

     - Assumed that the final terms of the merger agreement would not vary
       materially from those set forth in the draft dated May 16, 2001.

     The Banc of America Securities opinion was necessarily based on economic,
market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available
to it as of, the date of its opinion. Accordingly, although developments after
May 16, 2001 may affect its opinion, Banc of America Securities did not assume
any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion, which speaks only as
of the date of the opinion.

     The following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses
performed by Banc of America Securities and reviewed with OCA's Board of
Directors in connection with providing Banc of America Securities' opinion to
OCA's Board. Some of the summaries of financial analyses performed by Banc of
America Securities include information presented in tabular format. In order to
understand fully the financial analyses performed by Banc of America Securities,
you should read the tables together with the text of each summary. The tables
alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses.
Considering the data set forth in the tables without considering the full
narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and
assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete
view of the financial analyses performed by Banc of America Securities. The
following information, to the extent based on market data, is as of May 15,
2001, and does not necessarily indicate current or future market conditions.

     Banc of America Securities performed an analysis of the latest 12 month
trading range, an analysis of selected comparable public companies, an analysis
of precedent transactions, an analysis of selected premiums paid and an analysis
of discounted cash flow for OrthAlliance as described below. Based on these
valuation methodologies, and taking into account both the variations in the
exchange ratio based on the number of OrthAlliance's affiliated orthodontists,
pediatric dentists and professional corporations that amend their employment
agreements or service agreements, as contemplated by the merger agreement, and
the potential adverse effect on OrthAlliance's future operating results of less
than all of the OrthAlliance orthodontists, pediatric dentists and professional
corporations amending their agreements, Banc of America Securities derived the
following aggregate implied per share equity reference range for OrthAlliance
Class A and Class B common stock, as compared to the merger consideration based

     LATEST TWELVE-MONTH TRADING RANGE ANALYSIS.  Banc of America Securities
reviewed the share trading range of OrthAlliance Class A common stock to provide
a perspective on current public market value based on OrthAlliance's trading
performance for the latest twelve-month trading period. Banc of America
Securities reviewed the number of shares of OrthAlliance Class A common stock
traded at specified prices during the twelve-month period prior to May 15, 2001,
as set forth below:

     SELECTED COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES ANALYSIS.  Based on public and other
available information, Banc of America Securities calculated the multiples of
the aggregate value of OrthAlliance, which Banc of America Securities defined as
equity value plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents, to OrthAlliance's
revenues, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(commonly referred to as EBITDA) and earnings before interest and taxes
(commonly referred to as EBIT) for the latest 12 months. Banc of America
Securities also calculated the ratios of equity value to book value and the
multiples of share price to earnings per share (commonly referred to as EPS),
for both the latest 12 months and those estimated for calendar year 2001. Banc
of America Securities then compared those results to the results of similar
calculations made with respect to the following companies that Banc of America
Securities deemed to be comparable to OrthAlliance:

     - American Dental Partners, Inc.;

     - InterDent, Inc.;

     - Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc.;

     - Hanger Orthopedic Group, Inc.;

     - US Oncology, Inc.;

     - Ameripath, Inc.;

     - Radiologix, Inc.; and

     - Monarch Dental.

     Each company was selected because it had an active public trading market
for its equity securities, was a physician practice management company and Banc
of America Securities believed the company had operating characteristics similar
to those of OrthAlliance. The comparable company analysis compared OrthAlliance
to the comparable companies on the basis that the companies selected were the
most relevant given the factors considered above. Consequently, Banc of America
Securities did not include every company that could be deemed to be a
participant in the same industry. Estimated financial data for the selected
companies were based on publicly available research analysts' consensus
estimates, where available, and for OrthAlliance were based on internal
estimates of OrthAlliance management.

     The following table sets forth multiples indicated by this analysis:

     Banc of America Securities then applied a range of selected multiples for
the selected companies to corresponding data of OrthAlliance, which yielded
implied share prices for OrthAlliance as follows:

                                                                              IMPLIED

  Estimated Calendar Year 2001 EPS.......................    11.0x-15.0x     $4.82-$6.57

     No company used in the comparable company analysis is identical to
OrthAlliance. Accordingly, an analysis of the foregoing results is not
mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of
OrthAlliance and other factors that could affect the public trading value of the
companies to which OrthAlliance is being compared.

     PRECEDENT TRANSACTIONS ANALYSIS.  Banc of America Securities reviewed the
consideration offered in the following eight transactions:

          DATE                         ACQUIROR                             TARGET

     The selected transactions were chosen because the target companies were
companies that, for purposes of this analysis, Banc of America Securities
considered generally comparable to OrthAlliance. All multiples were based on
publicly available information at the time of announcement of the relevant
transaction.

                                                                  SELECTED

     Banc of America Securities then applied a range of selected multiples for
the selected companies to corresponding data of OrthAlliance, which yielded
implied share prices for OrthAlliance as follows:

                                                                              IMPLIED

  Latest 12 Months EBIT..................................     8.0x-12.0x    $6.80-$13.24

     No transaction used in the precedent transaction analysis is identical to
the merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the foregoing results is not
mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of
OrthAlliance and other factors that could affect the transactions to which the
merger is being compared.

     SELECTED PREMIUMS PAID ANALYSIS.  Banc of America Securities analyzed the
premiums paid in 3,396 domestic, all-stock acquisitions announced since 1997, as
reported by Thomson Financial Data, and the premiums paid in the selected
comparable transactions listed above. Banc of America Securities calculated the
premiums offered relative to the stock prices of the acquired companies one day
and one month prior to the announcement of the transactions. The following table
sets forth the median and mean of the premiums paid in these transactions:

     Banc of America Securities then applied a range of selected premiums for
the selected transactions to corresponding data of OrthAlliance, which yielded
implied share prices for OrthAlliance as follows:

                                                                       IMPLIED ORTHALLIANCE

Stock Price One Month Prior..........................   20.0%-30.0%         $2.70-$3.04

     DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.  Banc of America Securities performed
discounted cash flow analyses by using financial cash flow projections of
OrthAlliance for the fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2005 prepared by the
respective management of OCA and OrthAlliance assuming a (i) 60% and (ii) 30%
level of OrthAlliance affiliated practitioners electing to amend their
respective employment agreements and OrthAlliance service or consulting
agreements as provided in the merger agreement. In conducting these analyses,
Banc of America Securities assumed that OrthAlliance would perform in accordance
with these projections. Banc of America Securities first estimated the terminal
value of the projected cash flows by

applying multiples to OrthAlliance's projected 2005 EBITDA, which multiples
ranged from 6.0x to 7.0x. Banc of America Securities then calculated the present
values of the projected cash flows and the terminal values using discount rates
ranging from 13.0% to 17.0%. The 60% signage rate analysis yielded implied share
prices of $3.71 to $5.34, while the 30% signage rate analysis yielded implied
share prices of $1.41 to $3.50.

     PRO FORMA ANALYSES.  In addition, Banc of America Securities performed an
analysis of relative contribution and an analysis of accretion/dilution for the
combined company as described below.

     - Contribution Analysis.  Banc of America Securities used the projections
       of the respective managements of OrthAlliance and OCA to review the
       estimated contribution of each company to the revenue, EBITDA, EBIT and
       net income for each of the last 12 months, estimated calendar year 2001
       and projected calendar year 2002 assuming a (i) 60% and (ii) 30% level of
       OrthAlliance affiliated practitioners elected to amend their respective
       employment agreements and OrthAlliance service or consulting agreements
       as provided in the merger agreement. These analyses did not take into
       account any potential synergies following completion of the merger. These
       analyses indicated that OrthAlliance would contribute the following
       percentages of the items listed below for the combined company:

                                                               ORTHALLIANCE CONTRIBUTION

  Projected 2002............................................       5.6%           6.3%

     Banc of America Securities then compared these percentages to the pro forma
share ownership of OrthAlliance's stockholders in the combined company implied
by the transaction, based on OrthAlliance's and OCA's closing stock prices on
May 15, 2001. Banc of America Securities noted that on a pro forma basis, the
implied ownership of OrthAlliance stockholders in the combined company on a
fully diluted basis was 4.4%, assuming a 60% level of amendments, and 2.5%,
assuming a 30% level of amendments.

     - Accretion/Dilution Analysis.  Using financial forecasts based on the
       projections of the management of OrthAlliance and the projections of the
       management of OCA, and assuming pre-tax operating synergies as estimated
       by management of OCA, Banc of America Securities reviewed the pro forma
       effects of the merger, assuming first a 60% level of amendments and then
       a 30% level of amendments. Banc of America Securities compared the
       estimated EPS on a stand-alone basis for OCA to the estimated EPS of the
       combined company for projected calendar years 2002 through 2005. These
       analyses indicated that the proposed merger would be accretive to OCA's
       estimated EPS in calendar years 2002 through 2005. The actual results
       achieved by the combined company may vary from projected results and the
       variations may be material.

     OTHER FACTORS.  In the course of preparing its opinion, Banc of America
Securities also reviewed and considered other information and data, including:

     - Research analysts' reports for OCA common stock and OrthAlliance Class A
       common stock;

     - The historical price performance of OCA common stock and OrthAlliance
       Class A common stock; and

     - The relative price performance and trading characteristics of OCA common
       stock and OrthAlliance Class A common stock and the relationship between
       movements in OCA common stock, movements in OrthAlliance Class A common
       stock and movements in selected stock indices.

     As noted above, the foregoing discussion is merely a summary of the
analyses and examinations that Banc of America Securities considered to be
material to its opinion. It is not a comprehensive description of all analyses
and examinations actually conducted by Banc of America Securities. The
preparation of a fairness opinion is not susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. Banc of America Securities believes that its analyses and
the summary above must be considered as a whole. Banc of America Securities
further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors
considered, without considering all analyses and factors, would create an
incomplete view of the process underlying the analyses set forth in its
presentation to OCA's Board of Directors. Banc of America Securities did not
assign any specific weight to any of the analyses described above. The fact that
any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not meant to
indicate that that analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis.
Accordingly, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis
described above should not be taken to be Banc of America Securities' view of
the actual value of OCA or OrthAlliance.

     In performing its analyses, Banc of America Securities made numerous
assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of OCA and
OrthAlliance. The analyses performed by Banc of America Securities involve the
application of complex methodologies and educated judgment and are not
necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by these analyses.
These analyses were prepared solely as part of Banc of America Securities'
analysis of the financial fairness of the exchange ratio to be paid by OCA in
the merger and were provided to OCA's Board of Directors in connection with the
delivery of Banc of America Securities' opinion. The analyses do not purport to
be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold
or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in
the future, and these estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty.

     As described above, Banc of America Securities' opinion and presentation to
OCA's Board of Directors were only one of the many factors taken into
consideration by OCA's Board of Directors in evaluating the proposed merger, and
should not be viewed as determinative of the views of OCA's Board or management
with respect to the merger or the exchange ratio provided for in the merger.

     Under an engagement letter dated April 25, 2001, OCA agreed to pay Banc of
America Securities a fee of $500,000, which was payable upon delivery of the
fairness opinion, which amount will be credited against a fee equal to the
greater of $1,200,000 or 1.0% of the value of the merger payable upon completion
of the merger. OCA's Board of Directors was aware of this fee structure and took
it into account in considering Banc of America Securities' fairness opinion and
in approving the merger. The engagement letter calls for OCA to reimburse Banc
of America Securities for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including
reasonable fees and disbursements of Banc of America Securities' counsel, up to
$50,000, and OCA has agreed to indemnify Banc of America Securities and related
persons against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal
securities laws.

     In the ordinary course of its business, Banc of America Securities or its
affiliates actively trade the debt and equity securities of OCA and OrthAlliance
for their own account and for the accounts of customers. Accordingly, Banc of
America Securities or its affiliates may at any time hold a long or short
position in those securities. Banc of America Securities and its affiliates
have, in the past, performed

various financial advisory and financing services for OCA, including acting as
documentation agent under OCA's revolving credit facility, and received fees for
rendering such services.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     OCA intends to account for the merger as a purchase transaction under
generally accepted accounting principles.

CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following is a summary of the material anticipated U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the merger to OrthAlliance stockholders who hold shares of
OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common stock as a capital asset. The summary is
based on the Internal Revenue Code, applicable Treasury regulations, and
administrative rulings and court decisions in effect as of the date of this
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, all of which are subject to change at any time,
possibly with retroactive effect.

     This summary is not a complete description of all of the consequences of
the merger. In particular, this summary does not address U.S. federal income tax
considerations applicable to stockholders subject to special treatment under
U.S. federal income tax law, such as:

     - Non-U.S. persons;

     - Financial institutions;

     - Dealers in securities;

     - Insurance companies;

     - Tax-exempt entities;

     - Holders of shares of OrthAlliance Class B common stock who exercise their
       appraisal rights;

     - Holders who acquired shares of OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common
       stock upon the exercise of an employee stock option or right or otherwise
       as compensation; and

     - Holders who hold shares of OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common stock
       as part of a hedge, straddle or conversion transaction.

In addition, no information is provided in this summary with respect to the tax
consequences of the merger under applicable foreign, state or local laws.

     OCA has received an opinion of Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis, PLLC, and
OrthAlliance has received an opinion of Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP, that, as of
the respective dates of the opinions, the merger will be treated for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and that OCA and OrthAlliance will each be a
party to that reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the
Internal Revenue Code. It is a condition to the obligation of each of OCA and
OrthAlliance to complete the merger that their respective tax counsel confirm
its opinion as of the closing date. These opinions do not bind the Internal
Revenue Service and do not preclude the IRS or the courts from adopting a
contrary position. OCA and OrthAlliance do not intend to obtain a ruling from
the IRS on the tax consequences of the merger.

     The opinions of the parties' respective tax counsel regarding the merger
have relied, and the opinions regarding the merger as of the closing date will
each rely, on (1) representations and covenants made by OCA and OrthAlliance,
including those contained in certificates of officers of OCA and OrthAlliance,
and (2) specified assumptions, including an assumption regarding the completion
of the merger in the manner contemplated by the merger agreement. In addition,
the opinions of the parties' respective tax counsel have assumed, and the tax
counsel's ability to provide the opinions at the closing of the merger will
depend on, the absence of changes in existing facts or in law between the date
of this Proxy Statement/ Prospectus and the closing date. If any of those
representations, covenants or assumptions is inaccurate, the parties' respective
tax counsel may not be able to provide one or more of the required opinions to
be

delivered at the closing of the merger and/or the tax consequences of the merger
could differ from those described in the opinions that tax counsel have
delivered.

     OCA and OrthAlliance expect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

     - The merger will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of
       Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code;

     - No gain or loss will be recognized by OCA or OrthAlliance as a result of
       the merger;

     - No gain or loss will be recognized by OrthAlliance stockholders on the
       exchange of all of their respective shares of OrthAlliance Class A and
       Class B common stock solely for shares of OCA common stock in the merger,
       except with respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional share of OCA
       common stock; and

     - The aggregate tax basis of the OCA common stock received by OrthAlliance
       stockholders in exchange for all of their respective shares of
       OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common stock will be the same as the
       aggregate tax basis of shares of OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common
       stock surrendered in exchange therefor, reduced by any amount allocable
       to a fractional share of OCA common stock for which cash is received.

     Generally, cash received by an OrthAlliance stockholder in lieu of a
fractional share of OCA common stock will be treated as received in redemption
of that fractional share interest, and the OrthAlliance stockholder should
generally recognize capital gain or loss for federal income tax purposes
measured by the difference between the amount of cash received and the portion
of the tax basis of the share of OrthAlliance Class A or Class B common stock
allocable to that fractional share of OCA common stock. This gain or loss should
be a long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period for the share of
OrthAlliance Class A or Class B common stock is greater than one year at the
effective time of the merger. The holding period of a share of OCA common stock
received in the merger, including a fractional share interest deemed received
and redeemed as described in this paragraph above, will include the holder's
holding period in OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common stock surrendered in
exchange for OCA common stock.

     This discussion of material U.S. federal income tax consequences is
intended to provide only a general summary, and is not a complete analysis or
description of all potential federal income tax consequences of the merger. This
discussion does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or are
contingent on, individual circumstances. In addition, it does not address any
non-income tax or any foreign, state or local tax consequences of the merger.
ACCORDINGLY, ORTHALLIANCE STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT WITH THEIR TAX
ADVISORS REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM, INCLUDING THE
EFFECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX LAWS AND OF
POTENTIAL CHANGES TO APPLICABLE TAX LAW.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

     Certain members of OrthAlliance's management and Board of Directors may be
deemed to have interests in the merger that are in addition to their interests
as OrthAlliance stockholders generally. OrthAlliance's Board of Directors was
aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving
the merger agreement.

     W. Dennis Summers, the Chairman of the Board and Interim President and
Chief Executive Officer of OrthAlliance, is a participant in OrthAlliance's stay
bonus and severance plan, whereby, if Mr. Summers' employment is terminated for
any reason within 12 months following completion of the merger, he will receive
payment of $200,000. In addition, Mr. Summers would receive a stay bonus equal
to $33,333 at the earlier of three months following the completion of the merger
or termination of his employment by OrthAlliance for any reason other than for
cause following the completion of the merger. Various other non-executive
officers and employees of OrthAlliance are also participants in this bonus and
severance plan.

     Various officers of OrthAlliance, including Paul H. Hayase, Senior Vice
President, General Counsel and Secretary of OrthAlliance, Stephen M. Toon,
Senior Vice President and Chief Development Officer of OrthAlliance, and James
C. Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of OrthAlliance,
are parties to severance or employment agreements with OrthAlliance under which
they may be entitled to severance payments and benefits upon termination of
their employment following a change in control of OrthAlliance. We anticipate
that the merger would be a change in control for purposes of these agreements.

     Dr. Randall K. Bennett, Dr. Larry D. Dormois, Dr. Douglas D. Durbin, Dr.
Raymond G. W. Kubisch and Dr. Stephen G. Tracey, each of whom is a director of
OrthAlliance and an orthodontist or pediatric dentist affiliated with
OrthAlliance, are eligible to receive various financial incentives that OCA is
offering to OrthAlliance affiliated orthodontists and pediatric dentists who
amend their employment agreement and service or consulting agreement with
OrthAlliance as provided in the merger agreement, or who enter into OCA's form
of business services agreement effective as of the merger. These incentives,
which consist of varying amounts of OCA common stock, are conditioned on, among
other things, the completion of the merger. As of the date of this Proxy
Statement/Prospectus,      of these directors have amended their employment
agreement and service or consulting agreement, and are eligible to be granted
shares of OCA common stock if the merger is completed.

     Directors and executive officers of OrthAlliance will receive shares of OCA
common stock in the merger on the same basis as other OrthAlliance stockholders.
The following chart shows the number of shares of OCA common stock that may be
issued to directors and executive officers of OrthAlliance in the merger:

Shares of OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common stock,
  including stock options exercisable within 60 days,
  beneficially owned by OrthAlliance executive officers and
  directors as of June 30, 2001.............................  820,007
Shares of OCA common stock that may be received in the
  merger by OrthAlliance executive officers and directors
  (based on such beneficial ownership)......................  135,998

     Members of OrthAlliance's Board of Directors have certain interests under
the merger agreement regarding indemnification and continuation of liability
insurance coverage following the merger. See "THE MERGER
AGREEMENT -- Indemnification."

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS

     At the effective time of the merger, OrthAlliance stockholders will
automatically become OCA stockholders (except for those holders of OrthAlliance
Class B common stock who properly exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law).
OCA is a Delaware corporation governed by provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law and OCA's restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws.
OrthAlliance is a Delaware corporation governed by provisions of the Delaware
General Corporation Law and OrthAlliance's amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and bylaws. See "COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS."

RESTRICTIONS ON RESALES BY AFFILIATES

     The shares of OCA common stock issuable to OrthAlliance stockholders upon
completion of the merger have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933.
These shares may be traded freely without restriction by those stockholders who
are not deemed to be "affiliates" of OrthAlliance, as that term is defined in
SEC rules under the Securities Act. An "affiliate" of a company generally
includes its directors and executive officers and holders of a significant
amount of the company's voting stock.

     Shares of OCA common stock received by those OrthAlliance stockholders who
are deemed to be "affiliates" of OrthAlliance, as that term is defined in SEC
rules under the Securities Act, at the time of the OrthAlliance special meeting
may be resold without registration under the Securities Act only as permitted by
Rule 145 under the Securities Act. Under Rule 145, during the one-year period
following completion of the merger, affiliates of OrthAlliance may resell shares
of OCA common stock received by them in the merger subject to limitations on the
number of shares that may be sold during any three-month period and the manner
in which the shares may be sold, including the use of a broker and non-
solicitation of a buyer.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following summary of certain terms and provisions of the merger
agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement,
which is incorporated into this document by reference and, with the exception of
exhibits and schedules to the merger agreement, is attached as Annex A to this
Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     OCA will deposit with EquiServe, as the exchange agent for the merger,
certificates representing the shares of OCA common stock and cash to be paid in
lieu of fractional shares of OCA common stock to which a holder of certificates
formerly representing shares of OrthAlliance Class A and Class B common stock
would otherwise be entitled based on the exchange ratio.

     Promptly after the completion of the merger, the exchange agent will mail
to each holder of record of a certificate formerly representing shares of
OrthAlliance Class A or Class B common stock a form letter of transmittal for
use in exchanging such stockholder's OrthAlliance certificates for shares of OCA
common stock and/or cash due under the merger agreement. Upon surrender of an
OrthAlliance certificate for exchange and cancellation to the exchange agent,
together with a duly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of an
OrthAlliance certificate will be entitled to receive the number of whole shares
of OCA common stock and cash for any fractional shares to which such holder has
become entitled in accordance with the merger agreement. OCA will pay to each
OrthAlliance stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share
of OCA common stock, after taking into account all OrthAlliance certificates
delivered by the stockholder, an amount in cash to be paid in lieu of fractional
shares, without interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the average
of the last sale prices of OCA common stock as reported on the New York Stock
Exchange for the three trading days immediately preceding the merger.
OrthAlliance certificates so surrendered will immediately be canceled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any cash to be paid upon such surrender,
whether in lieu of fractional shares of OCA common stock or with respect to
unpaid dividends or distributions thereon.

     ORTHALLIANCE STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT SEND IN THEIR STOCK CERTIFICATES UNTIL
THEY RECEIVE THE TRANSMITTAL MATERIALS FROM THE EXCHANGE AGENT.

     Any part of the OCA common stock certificates and cash deposited with the
exchange agent that remains unclaimed by OrthAlliance stockholders for 12 months
after the merger will be paid to OCA. After that time, OrthAlliance stockholders
may look only to OCA for payment of the shares of OCA common stock, cash in lieu
of fractional shares of OCA common stock and any unpaid dividends and
distributions on OCA common stock deliverable in respect of each share of
OrthAlliance common stock held by the stockholder, in each case, without
interest. OCA, OrthAlliance, the exchange agent and any other person will not be
liable to any former OrthAlliance stockholder for any amounts properly delivered
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws. If any OrthAlliance certificate is not surrendered prior to the
end of the applicable period under any applicable escheat or similar law, or
immediately prior to the date on which any shares of OCA common stock, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of OCA common stock or any dividends or
distributions with respect to the certificates would escheat to or become the
property of any governmental authority, then the shares of OCA common stock,
cash and dividends or distributions with respect to the OrthAlliance
certificates will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of OCA.

     If any certificate formerly representing OrthAlliance common stock is lost,
stolen or destroyed, OCA can require the holder to give an affidavit of that
fact and to post a bond in an amount that OCA or the exchange agent may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made with respect to this
OrthAlliance certificate. Upon making such affidavit and/or posting such bond,
the exchange agent will issue the shares of OCA common stock and/or cash due
under the merger agreement.

     No dividends or other distributions with respect to OCA common stock
declared after the merger and payable to OCA stockholders of record will be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered OrthAlliance

certificate until the holder of the certificate surrenders the OrthAlliance
certificate. After the proper surrender of an OrthAlliance certificate, the
record holder of the certificate will receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest, which the holder would have received if he
or she had exchanged his OrthAlliance certificate immediately after the merger.

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

     The obligations of OrthAlliance and OCA to complete the merger are subject
to the satisfaction, or waiver, where legally allowed, at or prior to the
effective time of the merger, of a number of conditions, which are set forth in
the merger agreement. These conditions include:

     - Approval of the merger agreement by OrthAlliance stockholders;

     - The New York Stock Exchange listing the shares of OCA common stock to be
       issued to OrthAlliance stockholders as consideration under the merger
       agreement;

     - Any waiting period, and any extension, applicable to the completion of
       the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act having expired or being
       terminated;

     - The absence of any legal prohibition to completion of the merger;

     - Absence of an event or change that has a material adverse effect on
       either OCA or OrthAlliance;

     - The accuracy of the parties' representations and warranties and
       performance of the parties' obligations under the merger agreement; and

     - Receipt of the required tax opinions.

     OCA's obligation to complete the merger is also conditioned upon at least
56 of 184 designated orthodontists and pediatric dentists who are
owners/employees of professional entities that are parties to service or
consulting agreements with OrthAlliance, and a number of those orthodontists and
pediatric dentists representing at least 30% of OrthAlliance's service fees
during the 12 months ended March 31, 2001, executing, along with their
professional entity, amendments to their respective employment agreement and
service or consulting agreement, as provided in the merger agreement. As of
          , 2001,      of these designated orthodontists and pediatric dentists,
along with their respective professional entity, have amended their respective
employment agreements and OrthAlliance service or consulting agreements,
representing      % of OrthAlliance's service fees during the 12 months ended
March 31, 2001, which exceeded the minimum amounts required under this
condition. These amounts, however, may change prior to completion of the merger.

     We cannot guarantee that the conditions precedent to the merger will be
satisfied or, where legally permitted, waived by the party permitted to do so,
or that the merger will be completed.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT.  The merger agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the completion of the merger, whether before or after approval of the
merger by OrthAlliance stockholders, as set forth in the merger agreement,
including by mutual consent of OCA and OrthAlliance.

     BY EITHER PARTY.  In addition, the merger agreement may be terminated by
either party if:

     - The merger is not consummated by November 30, 2001;

     - OrthAlliance's stockholders fail to approve the merger agreement;

     - The other party materially breaches its representations or covenants set
       forth in the merger agreement and fails to cure that breach within the
       prescribed time limit; or

     - The other party does not satisfy its conditions required to complete the
       merger, and these conditions have become incapable of being fulfilled or
       cured and have not been waived.

     BY OCA.  OCA may terminate the merger agreement if:

     - OrthAlliance's Board of Directors fails to recommend in this Proxy
       Statement/Prospectus that OrthAlliance's stockholders approve the merger
       agreement;

     - OrthAlliance's Board of Directors withdraws, modifies in a way adverse to
       OCA or discloses its intention to withdraw its approval or recommendation
       of the merger agreement;

     - OrthAlliance's Board of Directors approves or recommends, or publicly
       proposes to approve or recommend, any tender offer, exchange offer,
       merger proposal or other proposal or offer to acquire 15% or more of the
       equity interest in, or all or substantially all of the assets of,
       OrthAlliance or its subsidiaries, other than the merger described in this
       Proxy Statement/Prospectus;

     - OrthAlliance's Board of Directors recommends a superior acquisition
       proposal and withdraws or modifies its approval or recommendation of the
       merger agreement, or terminates the merger agreement solely to
       concurrently enter into a merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
       agreement or letter of intent with respect to the superior acquisition
       proposal, after determining in good faith that the failure to do so would
       violate the Board's fiduciary duties and giving notice to OCA. The
       superior acquisition proposal must be a bona fide, written tender offer,
       exchange offer, merger proposal or other proposal or offer to acquire all
       or substantially all of the capital stock or assets of OrthAlliance,
       which OrthAlliance's Board of Directors determines, in good faith, is
       more favorable to OrthAlliance and its stockholders than the merger
       described in this Proxy Statement/ Prospectus, with any required
       financing being fully committed and reasonably capable of being obtained,
       and is reasonably capable of being completed without undue delay; or

     - OrthAlliance accepts or enters into an agreement or letter of intent with
       respect to any tender offer, exchange offer, merger proposal or other
       proposal or offer to acquire 15% or more of the equity interest in, or
       all or substantially all of the assets of, OrthAlliance or its
       subsidiaries, other than the merger described in this Proxy
       Statement/Prospectus.

     BY ORTHALLIANCE.  OrthAlliance may terminate the merger agreement if its
Board of Directors elects to terminate the merger agreement solely to
concurrently enter into a merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement or letter of intent with respect to the superior acquisition proposal,
after determining in good faith that the failure to do so would violate the
Board's fiduciary duties and giving notice to OCA. The superior acquisition
proposal must be a bona fide, written tender offer, exchange offer, merger
proposal or other proposal or offer to acquire all or substantially all of the
capital stock or assets of OrthAlliance, which OrthAlliance's Board of Directors
determines, in good faith, is more favorable to OrthAlliance and its
stockholders than the merger described in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus, with
any required financing being fully committed and reasonably capable of being
obtained, and is reasonably capable of being completed without undue delay.

     EFFECTS OF TERMINATION.  If the merger agreement is terminated, it will
become void and have no effect, except with respect to the parties' obligations
regarding confidential information, expenses and certain break-up fees payable
upon termination of the merger agreement in some circumstances, as set forth in
the merger agreement. Termination of the merger agreement also will not relieve
or release a breaching party from liability or damages for its breach of the
merger agreement.

BREAK-UP FEES

     BREAK-UP FEE TO OCA UPON TERMINATION FOR CERTAIN EVENTS.  If the merger
agreement is terminated because:

     - OrthAlliance's Board of Directors fails to recommend in this Proxy
       Statement/Prospectus that OrthAlliance's stockholders approve the merger
       agreement;

     - OrthAlliance's Board of Directors withdraws, modifies in a way adverse to
       OCA or discloses its intention to withdraw its approval or recommendation
       of the merger agreement;

     - OrthAlliance's Board of Directors approves or recommends, or publicly
       proposes to approve or recommend, any tender offer, exchange offer,
       merger proposal or other proposal or offer to acquire 15% or more of the
       equity interest in, or all or substantially all of the assets of,
       OrthAlliance or its subsidiaries, other than the merger described in this
       Proxy Statement/Prospectus;

     - OrthAlliance's Board of Directors recommends a superior acquisition
       proposal and withdraws or modifies its approval or recommendation of the
       merger agreement, or terminates the merger agreement solely to
       concurrently enter into a merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
       agreement or letter of intent with respect to the superior acquisition
       proposal, after determining in good faith that the failure to do so would
       violate the Board's fiduciary duties and giving notice to OCA. The
       superior acquisition proposal must be a bona fide, written tender offer,
       exchange offer, merger proposal or other proposal or offer to acquire all
       or substantially all of the capital stock or assets of OrthAlliance,
       which OrthAlliance's Board of Directors determines, in good faith, is
       more favorable to OrthAlliance and its stockholders than the merger
       described in this Proxy Statement/ Prospectus, with any required
       financing being fully committed and reasonably capable of being obtained,
       and is reasonably capable of being completed without undue delay;

     - OrthAlliance accepts or enters into an agreement or letter of intent with
       respect to any tender offer, exchange offer, merger proposal or other
       proposal or offer to acquire 15% or more of the equity interest in, or
       all or substantially all of the assets of, OrthAlliance or its
       subsidiaries, other than the merger described in this Proxy
       Statement/Prospectus; or

     - The merger is not consummated by November 30, 2001 or OrthAlliance's
       stockholders fail to approve the merger agreement, and, at any time after
       May 16, 2001 and before termination of the merger agreement, any tender
       offer, exchange offer, merger proposal or other proposal or offer to
       acquire 15% or more of the equity interest in, or all or substantially
       all of the assets of, OrthAlliance or its subsidiaries, other than the
       merger described in this Proxy Statement/ Prospectus, is publicly
       announced or otherwise communicated to OrthAlliance's stockholders and is
       not publicly withdrawn or rescinded, and OrthAlliance or its subsidiary
       enters into a definitive agreement with respect to the acquisition
       proposal within 12 months after termination of the merger agreement;

then, OrthAlliance is to pay $4,000,000 in cash to OCA, and reimburse OCA for
all of its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the merger agreement, this Proxy Statement/ Prospectus, other documents or
actions contemplated or related to the merger agreement and any related
financing, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $500,000.

     BREAK-UP FEE TO ORTHALLIANCE UPON TERMINATION BY OCA FOR NON-SATISFACTION
OF CONDITION TO CLOSING.  If OCA terminates the merger agreement solely as a
result of non-satisfaction of the condition that at least 56 of 184 designated
orthodontists and pediatric dentists who are owners/employees of professional
entities that are parties to service or consulting agreements with OrthAlliance,
and a number of those orthodontists and pediatric dentists representing at least
30% of OrthAlliance's service fees during the 12 months ended March 31, 2001,
execute, along with their professional entity, amendments to their respective
employment agreement and OrthAlliance service or consulting agreement prior to
the merger, as provided in the merger agreement, then:

     - OCA will pay $1,000,000 in cash to OrthAlliance; and

     - For a period of two years following the date of termination, OCA will not
       directly or indirectly solicit or induce any orthodontist, pediatric
       dentist or professional entity that was a party to, or an owner and
       employer of a professional entity that was a party to, a service or
       consulting agreement with OrthAlliance or its subsidiaries as of May 16,
       2001, to terminate their employment agreement or their service or
       consulting agreement with OrthAlliance.

CONDUCT OF BUSINESS PRIOR TO THE MERGER AND OTHER COVENANTS

     In the merger agreement, OrthAlliance and OCA agreed that, except as
expressly contemplated or permitted by the merger agreement or with the prior
written consent of the other party, each will carry on their respective
businesses in the ordinary course, consistent with past practice. OrthAlliance
and OCA also agreed to refrain from engaging in, or permitting its subsidiaries
to engage in, certain activities which are described in the merger agreement.

     OrthAlliance has agreed to refrain from:

     - Declaring, setting aside or paying any dividends on, or making any other

       OrthAlliance or another subsidiary of OrthAlliance;

     - Repurchasing, redeeming or otherwise acquiring any shares of its capital
       stock or any of its subsidiaries, or any securities convertible into or
       exercisable for any shares of its capital stock or any of its
       subsidiaries, except according to option plans existing on the date of
       the merger agreement;

     - Splitting, combining or reclassifying any shares of its capital stock, or
       issuing or authorizing or proposing the issuance of any other securities
       in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for, shares of its capital
       stock;

     - Issuing or authorizing its capital stock other than the issuance of
       OrthAlliance Class A common stock upon the exercise, conversion or
       fulfillment of options issued or existing under OrthAlliance's option
       plans, warrants or OrthAlliance Class B common stock, all to the extent
       outstanding and in existence on May 16, 2001 and in accordance with their
       terms on May 16, 2001;

     - Issuing any options or other securities convertible into or exchangeable
       for its capital stock;

     - Amending its certificate of incorporation or bylaws;

     - Making any capital expenditures other than those which are made in the
       ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or are
       necessary to maintain existing assets in good repair;

     - Entering into any new line of business;

     - Acquiring or agreeing to acquire any business or division thereof, or
       otherwise acquiring any assets other than expenditures for current assets
       in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and
       expenditures for fixed or capital assets in the ordinary course of
       business consistent with past practice;

       severance, bonus or similar arrangement, except as required by applicable

       May 16, 2001;

     - Entering into, amending or terminating any employment, severance,
       consulting, change in control or similar agreement, arrangement or

NO OTHER TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING ORTHALLIANCE

     OrthAlliance has agreed to "non-solicitation" provisions prohibiting it
from seeking an alternative transaction. Under these non-solicitation
provisions, OrthAlliance agreed that it and its subsidiaries, officers,
directors, employees, attorneys, investment bankers and other representatives
will not directly or indirectly:

     - Encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate, entertain or accept any tender
       offer, exchange offer, merger proposal or other proposal or offer to
       acquire 15% or more of the equity interest in, or all or

       substantially all of the assets of, OrthAlliance or its subsidiaries,
       other than the merger described in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus;

     - Enter into any agreement with respect to any tender offer, exchange
       offer, merger proposal or other proposal or offer to acquire 15% or more
       of the equity interest in, or all or substantially all of the assets of,
       OrthAlliance or its subsidiaries, other than the merger described in this
       Proxy Statement/ Prospectus;

     - Enter into any arrangement, understanding or agreement requiring it to
       abandon, terminate or fail to complete the merger;

     - Propose or make any tender offer, exchange offer, merger proposal or
       other proposal or offer to acquire 15% or more of the equity interest in,
       or all or substantially all of the assets of, OrthAlliance or its
       subsidiaries, to any person other than OCA and OCA Acquisition
       Corporation;

     - Participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish or disclose
       any information to, any person, other than OCA and OCA Acquisition
       Corporation, in connection with or with respect to any tender offer,
       exchange offer, merger proposal or other proposal or offer to acquire 15%
       or more of the equity interest in, or all or substantially all of the
       assets of, OrthAlliance or its subsidiaries, other than the merger
       described in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus; or

     - Authorize or permit any subsidiary, officer, director, employee,
       attorney, investment banker or other representative of OrthAlliance to
       take any of these actions.

     OrthAlliance also agreed that it will notify OCA within 24 hours after
receiving any request for information or tender offer, exchange offer, merger
proposal or other proposal or offer to acquire 15% or more of the equity
interest in, or all or substantially all of the assets of, OrthAlliance or its
subsidiaries, or any inquiry, proposal, discussions or negotiations with respect
to any such acquisition proposal, and promptly provide OCA with the terms and
conditions of the proposal, copies of any written materials received in
connection with the proposal and the identity of the person making the proposal.
OrthAlliance must keep OCA fully informed of the status and details of any such
acquisition proposal and promptly provide to OCA any non-public information
concerning OrthAlliance provided to any other person in connection with any such
acquisition proposal which was not previously provided to OCA.

     OrthAlliance further agreed that its Board of Directors will not withdraw
or modify in a manner adverse to OCA or OCA Acquisition Corporation the Board's
approval and recommendation of the merger agreement. OrthAlliance further agreed
that its Board of Directors will not approve or recommend any tender offer,
exchange offer, merger proposal or other proposal or offer to acquire 15% or
more of the equity interest in, or all or substantially all of the assets of,
OrthAlliance or its subsidiaries, other than the merger described in this Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

     However, in response to an unsolicited, bona fide, written tender offer,
exchange offer, merger proposal or other proposal or offer to acquire 15% or
more of the equity interest in, or all or substantially all of the assets of,
OrthAlliance or its subsidiaries, OrthAlliance may, after giving notice to OCA,
take one or more of the following actions if OrthAlliance's Board of Directors
determines in good faith that failure to take the action or actions would
violate the Board's fiduciary duties:

     - Participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with the person
       making the acquisition proposal;

     - Provide information to the person making the acquisition proposal, based
       on a confidentiality agreement with terms that are no more favorable to
       that person than the terms of the confidentiality agreement between
       OrthAlliance and OCA; and

     - Authorize and permit its officers, directors, employees, attorneys,
       investment bankers and other representatives to take these actions.

     In addition, OrthAlliance's Board of Directors may recommend a superior
acquisition proposal and withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of
the merger agreement, or terminate the merger agreement solely to concurrently
enter into a merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement

or letter of intent with respect to the superior acquisition proposal, if the
Board determines in good faith that the failure to do so would violate the
Board's fiduciary duties and gives notice to OCA. The superior acquisition
proposal must be a bona fide, written tender offer, exchange offer, merger
proposal or other proposal or offer to acquire all or substantially all of the
capital stock or assets of OrthAlliance, which OrthAlliance's Board of Directors
determines, in good faith, is more favorable to OrthAlliance and its
stockholders than the merger described in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus, with
any required financing being fully committed and reasonably capable of being
obtained, and is reasonably capable of being completed without undue delay.

     OrthAlliance may also take or disclose to its stockholders a position
contemplated under the SEC's tender offer rules or make any disclosure to its
stockholders if OrthAlliance's Board of Directors determines in good faith that
the failure to do so would violate the Board's fiduciary duties.

OrthAlliance as provided by OrthAlliance in its certificate of incorporation for
six years after the merger and to provide, for six years after the merger,
directors' and officers' liability insurance for the directors and officers of
OrthAlliance at an annual premium not to exceed 200% of the amount expended by
OrthAlliance as of May 16, 2001.

AMENDMENT OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The merger agreement may be amended only by a written instrument signed on
behalf of each of OrthAlliance, OCA and OCA Acquisition Corporation at any time
prior to the effective time of the merger, and before or after OrthAlliance
stockholders approve the merger agreement.

WAIVER

     At any time prior to the effective time of the merger, OCA and OrthAlliance
may extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the other party under the merger agreement, waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other party contained in the merger
agreement or waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the
other party contained in the merger agreement.

(1) Information for OCA affiliated orthodontists is for 2000.
(2) Information for traditional orthodontists is for 1998, and is derived from
    the 1999 Journal of Clinical Orthodontists Orthodontic Practice Study, a
    biennial study of the U.S. orthodontic industry. Information for 1999 and
    2000 has not been published.
(3) For traditional orthodontists, this amount represents a weighted average.
(4) For OCA affiliated orthodontists, this amount represents the standard fee
    for a term of treatment that averages 26 months.
(5) For OCA affiliated orthodontists, this amount is based upon orthodontists
    who had been affiliated with OCA for at least 12 months as of January 1,
    2000.

     OCA develops and implements marketing and advertising plans for its
affiliated orthodontists, using television, radio and print advertising and
internal marketing promotions. During 2000, OCA spent an average of $66,439 per
affiliated orthodontist on direct marketing costs and advertising. In contrast,
traditional orthodontists, who rely primarily on referrals from dentists and
patients, spent an average of $4,400 on marketing and advertising in 1998.

     OCA believes that its marketing and advertising strategy has allowed its
affiliated orthodontists to generate significantly greater patient volume than
traditional orthodontists. Each of OCA's affiliated orthodontists who had been
affiliated with OCA and its subsidiaries for at least one year generated an
average of 538 new case starts during 2000, as compared to the 1998 national
average of 200 new case starts per orthodontist. During 2000, OCA's affiliated
orthodontists generated a total of about 161,000 new case starts, representing
initial new patient contract balances of $494.1 million for 2000, an increase of
33.9% from $369.1 million for 1999.

     OCA's operating systems and office designs, along with the efficient use of
an average of five orthodontic assistants per orthodontic center, have enabled
OCA's affiliated orthodontists to treat more patients per day as compared to
traditional orthodontists. OCA's innovative office designs permit an affiliated
orthodontist to treat patients without moving from room to room. OCA's
proprietary patient scheduling system groups appointments by the type of
procedure and dedicates certain days exclusively to new patients. During 2000,
OCA's affiliated orthodontists who practiced in orthodontic centers open

throughout 1999 and 2000 treated an average of 78 patients per operating day, as
compared to an average of 45 patients per operating day treated during 1998 by
orthodontists in the United States generally.

     Orthodontists who had been affiliated with OCA for at least three years
earned pre-tax practice income of about $420,000 during 2000, which was 40.0%
higher than the average pre-tax practice income of $300,000 reported in the 1999
Journal of Clinical Orthodontists Orthodontic Practice Study as earned by
orthodontists in the United States during 1998.

     The following table provides information about the growth in the number of
OCA's affiliated orthodontic centers during the periods shown:

     Of OCA's 603 affiliated orthodontic centers at March 31, 2001, 315 were
developed by OCA, 364 were existing orthodontic practices the assets of which
were acquired by OCA and 76 were consolidated into another affiliated
orthodontic center. OCA expects that future growth in the number of its
affiliated orthodontic centers will come from both developing orthodontic
centers with existing and newly recruited orthodontists affiliated with OCA and
its subsidiaries and acquiring the assets of, and entering into service and
consulting agreements with, existing orthodontic practices.

OCA ACQUISITION CORPORATION

     OCA Acquisition Corporation is a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of OCA. It was formed on May 15, 2001 solely for the purpose of
entering into the merger agreement and being merged into OrthAlliance according
to the terms of the merger agreement.

                                  ORTHALLIANCE

OVERVIEW

     OrthAlliance was incorporated on October 21, 1996 and provides practice
management and consulting services to orthodontic and pediatric dental practices
throughout the United States. OrthAlliance manages or provides consulting
services with respect to certain business aspects of orthodontic and pediatric
dental practices affiliated with OrthAlliance, which are sometimes referred to
as "allied practices," and provides capital for the development and growth of
allied practices.

     OrthAlliance's wholly-owned subsidiaries, incorporated in Delaware, include
PedoAlliance, Inc. and OrthAlliance Finance, Inc., OrthAlliance Properties,
Inc., OrthAlliance Services, Inc., OrthAlliance Holdings, Inc., and OrthAlliance
New Image, Inc. The subsidiaries were formed to provide practice management,
patient financing, consulting and other services to allied orthodontic and
pediatric dental practices or their patients. OrthAlliance New Image was formed
specifically in connection with OrthAlliance's acquisition of substantially all
of the assets of New Image Orthodontic Group, Inc., which was effective March 1,
2000.

     On August 26, 1997, OrthAlliance affiliated with 55 allied practices,
including 81 orthodontists and one pediatric dentist operating 147 offices in 16
states, pursuant to long-term management service and consulting agreements, and
commenced its initial operations. From August 26, 1997 to March 31, 2001,
OrthAlliance increased the number of allied practices, including pediatric
dental practices, to a net total of 176, with approximately 226 orthodontists
and pediatric dentists operating approximately 395 offices in 32 states at March
31, 2001. OrthAlliance Finance was formed in December 1997 to offer financing
alternatives to the patients of the allied practices. During 2000, OrthAlliance
Finance funded 289 loans to patients for a total value of $0.8 million and had
$1.3 million of loans outstanding as of March 31, 2001.

     OrthAlliance provides fee-based management or consulting services to its
allied practices which allows its allied orthodontists and pediatric dentists to
concentrate on providing cost effective, quality patient care. OrthAlliance does
not practice orthodontics or dentistry, but generally acquires certain operating
assets of an orthodontic and pediatric dental practice, employs the practice
staff and administrative employees (except orthodontists and dentists, and where
applicable law requires, hygienists and dental assistants), and enters into
service or consulting agreements with the allied practices. Pursuant to these
agreements, OrthAlliance provides management or consulting services to the
allied practices, including billing and collections, cash management,
purchasing, inventory management, payroll processing, advertising and marketing,
financial reporting and analysis, productivity reporting and analysis, training,
associate orthodontist recruiting and capital for satellite office development
and acquisitions. Where state law allows and upon request by an allied practice,
OrthAlliance leases equipment or office space to the allied practices.

ORTHALLIANCE'S OPERATING STRATEGY

     OrthAlliance's operating strategy focuses on enabling the allied practices
to compete more effectively and realize greater profitability than other
practices, thereby providing an inducement for additional practices to affiliate
with OrthAlliance.

     Management of OrthAlliance believes that the services and support that
OrthAlliance provides to its allied orthodontists impact the level of patient
care positively by increasing the allied orthodontists' and pediatric dentists'
time available to concentrate on patient care. The qualifications of providers
of orthodontic and pediatric dental services vary from general dentists who have
taken weekend courses to graduates of accredited three-year programs. Nearly all
allied orthodontists and pediatric dentists affiliated with the allied practices
are graduates of accredited orthodontic or pediatric dental programs.
OrthAlliance established two clinical care advisory committees, one consisting
of allied orthodontists and the other consisting of allied pediatric dentists,
to formulate educational and training programs and to consult with each other on
current treatments, techniques and issues.

     OrthAlliance identifies practice-level strategies that have proven
successful for individual allied practices and shares this information among
other allied practices. OrthAlliance provides its allied orthodontists and
pediatric dentists with comparative operating and financial data to enable the
allied orthodontists and pediatric dentists to detect areas of their practices
that could be improved. OrthAlliance provides its own analysis of such operating
and financial data and recommends changes to improve performance. OrthAlliance
consults with its allied practices that have demonstrated success in a certain
area and generally seeks to facilitate communication among allied practices
through periodic conferences and meetings and through the Internet.

     OrthAlliance implements a variety of operating procedures and systems to
improve the productivity and profitability of its allied practices and to
achieve economies of scale including, without limitation, centralized payroll
processing and national group purchasing contracts. Operating efficiencies and
economies are instituted with the allied orthodontist's and pediatric dentists'
consent on a per allied practice need basis.

     OrthAlliance assists its allied practices in developing and implementing
payment plans designed to make orthodontic and pediatric dental services more
affordable to prospective patients. Many of OrthAlliance's allied practices
historically receive a down payment of approximately 25% of the total treatment
plan fee at the early stages of the procedure. Recognizing that orthodontic
services are largely discretionary and that a significant down payment is often
a deterrent to prospective patients, OrthAlliance believes that flexible payment
plans or financing opportunities are an effective means of increasing patient
volume. Payment plans are tailored to respond to the various market demands and
opportunities. OrthAlliance makes general recommendations to its allied
practices with respect to instituting flexible payment plans and develops and
implements market-tailored plans at the request of individual allied practices.
In addition, OrthAlliance provides access to working capital necessary for its
allied practices to implement flexible payment plans which may result in the
reduction or elimination of down payments.

     In consultation with and upon approval of its allied practices,
OrthAlliance develops and implements marketing plans to augment each allied
practice's referral and other marketing systems. Certain allied practices have
developed referral systems with local dentists. Upon the request of an allied
practice and in appropriate markets, OrthAlliance attempts to assist such allied
practice in reaching potential patients through print, local television and
radio advertising.

ORTHALLIANCE'S GROWTH STRATEGY

     OrthAlliance's growth strategy includes affiliation with existing practices
in both new and existing markets, the development of satellite offices for
existing allied practices and internal growth through improved operating
efficiencies.

     OrthAlliance offers a variety of operating procedures and systems to
improve the productivity and profitability of its allied practices. OrthAlliance
implements payroll processing, financial reporting and analysis, national group
purchasing, discounted contracts and assists with appropriate credit and
collection policies which accommodate specific needs of its allied practices.
Operating efficiencies and economies are instituted on a per allied practice
need basis.

     If management determines market demand supports practice expansion,
OrthAlliance assists allied orthodontists and pediatric dentists in developing
satellite offices to be integrated into allied practices. OrthAlliance provides
a certain amount of capital for practice expansion, market research, site
selection, office design and marketing support for satellite office development.

     OrthAlliance targets for affiliations a market that includes approximately
half of the orthodontic and pediatric dental practices in the United States
(approximately 4,500 orthodontic practices and 1,500 pediatric dental
practices), which practices fit OrthAlliance's model of quality and opportunity
for revenue

and earnings growth. OrthAlliance believes that affiliation will be an
attractive option for existing practices, because OrthAlliance:

     - Provides access to capital to open and integrate new offices into
       existing allied practices;

     - Makes available best practice ideas from other allied practices;

     - Designs and offers business and clinical procedures for allied practices;

     - With the approval of the allied orthodontist or pediatric dentist,
       employs the necessary business and non-professional personnel for allied
       practices;

     - Helps allied practices by recommending marketing and advertising
       strategies; and

     - Assists allied orthodontists and pediatric dentists with administrative
       and business related tasks.

     OrthAlliance has reduced the number of affiliations with existing practices
in order to conserve capital resources. This is partially due to OrthAlliance's
low stock price, which has made it difficult for OrthAlliance to raise capital
and affiliate with practices.

     In addition to traditional affiliations, OrthAlliance believes that a
complementary element to OrthAlliance's growth strategy includes the development
of de novo practices, or new practices. De novo practice development represents
an opportunity for OrthAlliance to build practices from the ground up in key
strategic markets. By drawing on the experiences of its existing members,
OrthAlliance can help to identify and implement the "best practices" for de novo
operations. OrthAlliance has, to date, established two de novo practices.

PAYMENT PLAN AND CASE FEES

     In the allied practitioners' offices at the initial orthodontic treatment,
generally the patient signs a contract outlining the terms of the treatment,
including the anticipated length of treatment, total fees and payment terms.
OrthAlliance's allied orthodontists determine the appropriate fee to charge for
services to patients based upon market conditions in the respective areas served
by the allied orthodontists. Generally, the amount charged by OrthAlliance's
allied orthodontists is independent of the patient's source of payment. The
number of required monthly payments is estimated at the beginning of the case
and generally corresponds to the anticipated number of months of treatment.
Generally, OrthAlliance's allied practices require approximately 25% of the
treatment contract to be paid upon installation of the braces, and the remaining
75% evenly over the remainder of the treatment term.

     If the treatment period exceeds the period originally estimated by the
allied orthodontist, the patient and the allied orthodontist will determine
whether payment for additional treatment will be required. If the treatment is
completed prior to the scheduled completion date, the patient is required to pay
the remaining balance of the contract. If a patient terminates the treatment
prior to the completion of the treatment period, the patient is required to pay
the balance due for services rendered to date.

     Other payment plans with lower monthly payments are available for patients
who have insurance coverage for the treatment. Payments from patients with
insurance may be lower, depending upon the amount of the fee paid on behalf of
the patient by insurance policies. For patients with insurance coverage, the
portion of the fee not covered by insurance is paid by the patient.

AGREEMENTS WITH ORTHALLIANCE ALLIED PRACTICES AND ALLIED PRACTITIONERS

     Each of OrthAlliance's allied practices has entered into the following
three material agreements:

     - An acquisition agreement, which may be in the form of a purchase and sale
       agreement whereby OrthAlliance acquires certain of the assets, or stock
       of an entity holding certain assets, of the allied practice, or an
       agreement and plan of reorganization, whereby the allied practice
       transfers certain assets to OrthAlliance;

     - Either a service agreement or a consulting agreement, depending upon the
       applicable state regulatory requirements or a management service
       agreement for OrthAlliance New Image practices, whereby OrthAlliance
       provides management or consulting services to the allied practice; and

     - An employment agreement between the allied practice and each related
       allied practitioner who is an equity holder in the allied practice or who
       provides orthodontic or pediatric dental services through such practice
       for more than ten days each month.

     Each acquisition agreement generally results in the sale by the allied
practice of its equipment, licenses, inventory, accounts receivable, furniture
and other personal property, or some combination thereof based on applicable
state laws or regulations, in exchange for consideration based on the allied
practice's adjusted patient revenue. The aggregate purchase price paid by
OrthAlliance is generally payable in cash, shares of OrthAlliance Class A common
stock, or a promissory note as determined by each allied practice and
OrthAlliance. The aggregate consideration, including acquisition costs, paid by
OrthAlliance in connection with the affiliation of the 176 allied practices net
of consolidation from August 26, 1997 to March 31, 2001 was approximately $217.9
million, comprised of approximately $91.2 million in cash, 8.2 million shares of
OrthAlliance Class A common stock and promissory notes of $29.2 million.

     Each service agreement generally requires or permits OrthAlliance to
perform certain services for its allied practices, including providing and
maintaining specified furnishings and equipment; providing necessary employees,
except practitioners and, where applicable law requires, hygienists and dental
assistants; establishing appropriate business systems; purchasing and
maintaining inventory; performing payroll and accounting functions; providing
billing and collection services with respect to patients, insurance companies
and third-party payors; arranging certain legal services not related to
malpractice litigation; designing and executing a marketing plan; advising with
respect to new office locations; and managing and organizing the allied
practice's files and records, including patient records where permitted by
applicable law. If the allied practice lacks sufficient funds to pay its current
expenses, OrthAlliance is required to advance funds to the allied practice for
the purpose of paying such expenses, subject to terms to be agreed upon. In
exchange for performing the services described above, OrthAlliance receives a
management fee based on one of three fee structures. These fees are structured
as follows:

     - A designated percentage ranging from 13.5% to 20% of adjusted patient
       revenue;

     - A designated percentage of patient revenue, ranging from 14% to 17%,
       subject to annual adjustments based upon improvements in the allied
       practice's operating margin in the most recent calendar year as compared
       with the immediately preceding calendar year; or

     - A fixed dollar fee with annual fixed dollar increases for each year of
       the term of the management agreement.

     OrthAlliance has entered into agreements with certain allied practices to
make the payment of such management fees after the first two years contingent on
various factors, including practice profitability compared to acquisition
consideration, timely reporting of information, participation in practice
improvement programs and orthodontist hours worked. Prior patient revenue is not
necessarily indicative of the level of revenue that these practices may be
expected to generate in the future.

     The term of each service agreement is for 20, 25 or 40 years, subject to
prior termination by either party in the event the other party becomes subject
to voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceedings or materially breaches the
agreement, subject to a cure period. In addition, the allied practices may
terminate the service agreements upon the occurrence of a change of control of
OrthAlliance, which does not include a transaction approved by OrthAlliance's
Board of Directors. Upon the expiration or termination of the service agreement,
the allied practice may, and in certain circumstances must, repurchase for cash,
at book value, certain assets, including all equipment, and assume certain
liabilities of OrthAlliance related to the allied practice.

     Each service agreement is generally not assignable by either party thereto
without the written consent of the other party; however, OrthAlliance may assign
the service agreement without the allied practice's

consent to any entity under common control with OrthAlliance. OrthAlliance and
the allied practice indemnify each other for costs and expenses incurred by the
other party that are caused directly or indirectly by, as the case may be,
OrthAlliance's or the allied practice's intentional or negligent acts or
omissions. In the case of the allied practice's obligation to indemnify
OrthAlliance, such obligation also applies to intentional or negligent acts and
omissions occurring prior to the date of the service agreement. As of March 31,
2001, OrthAlliance was a party to service agreements with 76 allied practices.

     Certain provisions of the consulting agreement are substantially similar to
the service agreement, including provisions relating to OrthAlliance's
obligation to loan funds to the allied practice in the event the allied practice
is unable to pay its current expenses, termination of the consulting agreement,
repurchase of assets and assumption of liabilities by the allied practice upon
expiration or termination, assignment and indemnification.

     The services available to the allied practice under each consulting
agreement generally include consulting with respect to equipment and office
needs; preparing staffing models appropriate for an allied practice; advising
and training with respect to business systems; purchasing and maintaining
inventory; advising with respect to and providing or arranging accounting and
bookkeeping services; advising with respect to developing a marketing plan;
assessing the financial feasibility of establishing new offices; providing
billing and collection services; and assisting the allied practice in organizing
and developing filing and recording systems. In exchange for such services,
OrthAlliance receives a consulting fee based on one of the three fee structures.
As of March 31, 2001, OrthAlliance was a party to consulting agreements with 69
allied practices.

     Pursuant to both the service agreements and consulting agreements,
OrthAlliance's allied practitioners maintain professional control over and
ownership of their practices, determine which personnel will be allied with the
allied practices and set their own standards of practice. OrthAlliance does not
engage in the practice of orthodontics or dentistry. Each of OrthAlliance's
allied practitioners is responsible for compliance of his or her allied practice
with state and local regulations applicable to the practice of orthodontics and
dentistry and with licensing or certification requirements. Each of
OrthAlliance's allied practices, in its sole discretion, determines the fees to
be charged for services provided to patients based upon market conditions in the
service area and other factors deemed appropriate by the allied practice. Each
allied practice executes payor contracts and acquires and pays for its own
malpractice insurance coverage.

     In March 2000, OrthAlliance and OrthAlliance New Image assumed the
obligations of New Image under the various management service agreements between
New Image and the orthodontic practices with whom it had entered into management
service agreements. The form of management service agreements provides for a
variation of the service fee calculation compared to the traditional
OrthAlliance form defined in the service or consulting agreement. Under the
management service agreements, the service fee amount varies monthly depending
on the allied practice's financial performance and represents the residual
amount after the payment of practice expenses and contractually determined
practice distributions. The service fee is affected by two variables, (i) total
allied practice gross revenue, less refunds, and (ii) operating expenses.
Service fees are calculated based on two separate standardized grids set forth
in the management service agreement that determine:

     - The percent of practice revenue that is distributed to the allied
       practice based on that allied practice's gross revenue, less refunds; and

     - Any additional or offsetting percentage of gross revenue, less refunds,
       that is distributed to the allied practice based upon that allied
       practice's overhead.

     Pursuant to the gross revenue grid, in general, OrthAlliance's retained
service fees increase if the allied practice's gross revenue increases and
decrease if the allied practice's gross revenue decreases. Pursuant to the
overhead grid, in general, OrthAlliance's retained service fees decrease if the
allied practice's overhead expenses increase and the retained service fees
increase if the allied practice's overhead decreases. The maximum retained
service fee percentage is 20.0%. The average service fee percentage for

the OrthAlliance New Image allied practices is approximately 16.1%. In addition,
a few OrthAlliance New Image management service agreements provide for a fixed
percentage service fee.

     Each allied practitioner who is or becomes an equity holder in an allied
practice or who provides orthodontic or dental services through an allied
practice for more than 10 days a month is required to execute an employment
agreement with the allied practice. Each employment agreement generally provides
that the allied practitioner will perform professional services for the allied
practice for a period of five years, subject to prior termination (i) for cause
by the allied practice, which generally means death, incapacity, willful
misconduct, conviction for a felony, or chronic alcoholism or drug addiction,
and (ii) by the allied practitioner in the event of a material breach by the
allied practice. The allied practitioner agrees that following termination or
expiration of the employment agreement, he or she will not compete for a period
of two years in the market in which the allied practice operates an office and
will limit the methods of advertising in the area in which an allied practice is
located.

ORTHALLIANCE MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     GENERAL.  OrthAlliance derives net revenues by providing services pursuant
to long-term management and consulting agreements with allied practices.
OrthAlliance provides management or consulting services to each allied practice
and assumes substantially all operating expenses except for compensation to the
allied practitioners and other employees that OrthAlliance cannot employ
according to applicable state laws. In exchange for assuming these expenses and
providing services, OrthAlliance records revenues in amounts equal to the
assumed expenses plus a service fee or consulting fee, as described below. In
general, the management and consulting agreements provide for the recognition of
fees to OrthAlliance based on a negotiated percentage of the adjusted patient
revenue of allied practices. The timing of the payment of such service fees is
based upon cash collected. Adjusted patient revenue is net patient revenue, as
determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
including certain accrual adjustments, including those related to patient
prepayments, and adjustments for contractual allowances and other discounts,
plus an adjustment for uncollectible accounts.

     Patient revenue is recognized as services are performed. For orthodontic
services, approximately 20% of the orthodontic contract revenues are recognized
at the time of initial treatment and generally approximates 25% of the total
treatment plan revenues collected by the allied practice. The balance of the
contract revenue is realized evenly over the remaining treatment period. The 20%
estimated revenue at the initial treatment date is based on the estimated costs
incurred by OrthAlliance at that time as compared to the total costs of
providing the contracted services and is consistent with industry standards. The
percentage includes the estimated costs of diagnosis and treatment plan
development, initial treatment by OrthAlliance employees at the allied
practices, orthodontic supplies and associated administrative services.

     The service fee is earned and paid monthly to OrthAlliance by each of its
allied practices using one of three different fee structures set forth in its
service and consulting agreements:

     - A designated percentage ranging from 13.5% to 20% of the adjusted patient
       revenue. The average designated percentage is 17% for OrthAlliance's
       allied practices subject to this fee structure. In some cases, the allied
       practice must guarantee a minimum level of service fees to be paid by the
       allied practice for a portion of the agreement ranging from one to 25
       years;

     - A designated percentage of adjusted patient revenue, ranging from 14% to
       17%, subject to an annual adjustment based upon improvements in the
       allied practice's operating margin in the most recent calendar year as
       compared with the immediately preceding calendar year. No annual
       adjustment will be made which would result in reducing the designated
       percentage below the percentage applicable during the first year of the
       management or consulting agreement. Operating margin is defined as the
       percentage determined by dividing operating profit by adjusted patient
       revenue. Operating profit is equal to adjusted patient revenue less
       operating expenses, excluding the service fee and such expenses
       associated with the allied practices which OrthAlliance is prohibited

       from incurring, primarily consisting of orthodontist compensation. The
       average designated percentage is 16.2% for the allied practices subject
       to this fee structure; or

     - A fixed dollar fee with annual fixed dollar increases for each year of
       the term of the service or consulting agreement.

     OrthAlliance has entered into agreements with certain allied practices to
make the payment of service fees after the first two years contingent on various
factors, including practice profitability compared to acquisition consideration,
timely reporting of information, participation in practice improvement programs
and orthodontist hours worked.

     In March 2000, OrthAlliance assumed the obligations of New Image under the
various management service agreements between New Image and the orthodontic
practices with whom it had entered into management service agreements. The form
of management service agreement provides for a variation of the service fee
calculation compared to the traditional OrthAlliance form defined in the service
or consulting agreement. Under the management service agreements, the service
fee amount varies monthly depending on the allied practice's financial
performance and represents the residual amount after the payment of practice
expenses and contractually determined practice distributions. The service fee is
affected by two variables: (1) total allied practice gross revenue, less
refunds, and (2) overhead. Service fees are calculated based on two separate
standardized grids set forth in the management service agreement that determine:

     - The percent of practice revenue that is distributed to the allied
       practice based on that allied practice's gross revenue, less refunds,
       which is referred to as the "gross revenue grid;" and

     - Any additional or offsetting percentage of gross revenue, less refunds,
       that is distributed to the allied practice based upon that allied
       practice's overhead, which is referred to as the "overhead grid."

Pursuant to the gross revenue grid, in general, OrthAlliance's retained service
fees increase if the allied practice's gross revenue increases and decrease if
the allied practice's gross revenue decreases. Pursuant to the overhead grid, in
general OrthAlliance's retained service fees decrease if the allied practice's
overhead expenses increase and the retained service fees increase if the allied
practice's overhead decreases. The maximum retained service fee percentage is
20.0%. The average service fee percentage for the New Image allied practices is
approximately 16.1% at December 31, 2000. In addition, a few New Image
management service agreements provide for a fixed percentage service fee.

     Expenses reported by OrthAlliance include certain of the expenses to
operate the orthodontic or pediatric dental offices and all of the expenses of
any corporate offices, facilities or functions. Therefore, salaries and benefits
include the wages, benefits, taxes or other employment costs for all employees
of OrthAlliance, including practice office staff, business office staff and
management personnel. Rent includes facility expenses for both practice offices
and corporate offices. General and administrative expenses include professional
services, such as legal and accounting, utilities, advertising, marketing,
insurance, telephone, license fees, office supplies and shipping expenses.
Advertising and marketing costs, which are included in general and
administration costs, includes practice activities to attract new patients and
corporate activities to attract new orthodontists or pediatric dentists to join
OrthAlliance. Practice supplies include only those expenses required by
OrthAlliance's allied practitioners to provide treatment to patients.

     From time to time OrthAlliance may receive notices of alleged defaults of
certain service or consulting agreements. To date, OrthAlliance believes that
such claims of alleged default are without merit and vigorously defends
OrthAlliance's position. However, there is no assurance that such present or
future disputes will be resolved favorably for OrthAlliance.

     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  The consolidated statements of income of
OrthAlliance for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 include net
income of $7.5 million on net revenues of $74.4 million, net income of $9.6
million on net revenues of $95.7 million, and net income of $9.5 million on net
revenues of $142.0 million, respectively. The unaudited consolidated statements
of income of OrthAlliance

for the three months ended March 31, 2000 and 2001 include net income of $2.6
million on net revenues of $30.1 million and net income of $1.8 million on net
revenues of $38.6 million, respectively. For the years 1998, 1999 and 2000 and
the three month periods ended March 31, 2000 and 2001, OrthAlliance had income
before income taxes of $13.7 million, $16.9 million, $17.0 million, $4.6 million
and $3.2 million, respectively. Direct expenses for the fourth quarter of 2000
included approximately $800,000 in expenses incurred in the separation of
OrthAlliance's former chief executive officer and certain other charges.

     The following table sets forth certain selected condensed consolidated
income statement data for the periods indicated in thousands of dollars and as a
percentage of total net revenues:

  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2001 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,
  2000.

     - Operating Income and Net Income.  OrthAlliance's operating income for the
       three months ended March 31, 2001 decreased 11.2% to $5.0 million from
       $5.7 million in the comparable period in 2000. Net income for the three
       months ended March 31, 2001 decreased 29.5% to $1.8 million from $2.6
       million in the comparable period in 2000.

     - Net Revenues.  Net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2001
       increased 28.0% to $38.6 million from $30.1 million for the comparable
       quarter in 2000. The increase in net revenues for the three months ended
       March 31, 2001, relative to the same period in 2000, is primarily due to
       the New Image acquisition, which was effective March 1, 2000, overall
       increases in the internal growth of comparative same-store collections of
       over 6.0%, and the first quarter effect of practice acquisitions. Net
       revenues as reported by OrthAlliance include OrthAlliance's contractual
       service or consulting fee based in part on patient revenues, as well as
       reimbursed expenses of the allied practices.

     - Operating Expenses.  Total operating expenses increased 37.1% to $33.6
       million, or 87.0% of net revenues, for the three months ended March 31,
       2001 from $24.5 million, or 81.3% of net revenues, for the comparable
       period in 2000.

       Direct expenses including salaries and benefits, orthodontic and dental
       supplies, and rent increased 38.7% to $19.1 million, or 49.6% of net
       revenues, for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from $13.8 million,
       or 45.8% of net revenues, for the comparable 2000 quarter. Salaries and
       benefits increased 41.8% to $12.2 million, or 31.6% of revenues for the
       three months ended March 31, 2001,

       compared to $8.6 million, or 28.6% of net revenues for comparable quarter
       in 2000. Similarly, orthodontic and dental supplies increased 41.9% to
       $3.8 million or 9.9% of net revenues in the first quarter in 2001,
       compared to $2.7 million or 8.9% of net revenues for the same period in
       2000. Rent increased 24.6% to $3.1 million or 8.1% of revenues for the
       three months ended March 31, 2001 from $2.5 million or 8.3% of net
       revenues for the same period in 2000. The increase in direct expenses
       compared to the prior year is attributable to the acquisition of New
       Image for the full quarter 2001 and other allied practices, as well as
       the expansion and growth of existing allied practices.

       General and administrative expenses increased 35.1% to $12.5 million, or
       32.5% of net revenues, for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from
       $9.3 million, or 30.8% of net revenues, for the comparable 2000 quarter.
       General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the
       acquisition of New Image and additional allied practices during the
       period as well as the expansion and growth of previously existing allied
       practices offsetting reductions in marketing and advertising and other
       costs.

       Depreciation and amortization expenses increased approximately 34.2% to
       $1.9 million or 4.9% of net revenues for the three months ended March 31,
       2001 from $1.4 million or 4.7% of net revenues. This increase is
       attributable to the increase in intangible assets associated with the
       affiliations of allied practices and the acquisition of New Image. Net
       intangible assets approximated $124.0 million at March 31, 2001 and
       December 31, 2000. Depreciation and amortization expenses primarily
       relate to the depreciation of capital assets and the amortization of
       excess cost over the fair value of net assets acquired and certain other
       intangibles. OrthAlliance's policy is to amortize goodwill over the
       expected period to be benefited, generally 25 years.

     - Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased to $2.0 million for the
       three months ended March 31, 2001 from $1.3 million for the comparable
       period in 2000. The increase was primarily due to increased borrowings
       under OrthAlliance's revolving credit facility in support of allied
       practices affiliated and certain debt obligations issued and assumed in
       connection with the New Image acquisition. OrthAlliance's borrowings
       under its revolving credit facility were $64.0 million at March 31, 2001,
       $62.0 million at December 31, 2000 and $51.0 million at March 31, 2000.
       Total debt was approximately $82.4 million and $83.0 million at March 31,
       2001 and December 31, 2000, respectively. See "-- Liquidity And Capital
       Resources."

     - Provision for Income Taxes.  The provision for income taxes decreased
       29.0% to $1.4 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2001
       from $2.0 million for the comparable 2000 quarter. OrthAlliance's
       effective income tax rates for the periods ended March 31, 2001 and 2000,
       respectively, were higher than the statutory tax rate primarily due to
       the amortization of certain intangible assets not being deductible for
       income tax purposes. The effective tax rate was 44.2% and 44.0% for the
       three month period ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999.

     - Net Income and Operating Income.  Net income for the year ended December
       31, 2000 of $9.5 million remained at approximately the same level as net
       income in 1999. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2000
       increased 25.4% to $23.7 million from $18.9 million in 1999. The increase
       in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2000 is attributable
       to an overall increase in net revenues related primarily to the
       acquisition of New Image and other allied practices and internal same
       store growth. Despite achieving higher operating income, net income
       remained flat due to the severance of OrthAlliance's former president and
       chief executive officer, higher than expected interest rates, higher
       taxes and other increased expenses.

     - Net Revenues.  Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000
       increased 48.4% to $142.0 million from $95.7 million in 1999. The
       increase in net revenues is due primarily to an increase in affiliations
       of allied practices, the acquisition of New Image, as well as internal
       store to store growth for the year approximating 8.0% compared to 9.0% in
       1999. New Image contributed

       approximately $20.7 million of the total year 2000 revenues. Net revenues
       as reported by OrthAlliance include OrthAlliance's contractual service or
       consulting fee based in part on adjusted patient revenues, as well as
       reimbursed expenses of the allied practices.

     - Operating Expenses.  Total operating expenses increased 54.0% to $118.3
       million, or 83.3% of net revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2000
       from $76.8 million, or 80.2% of net revenues, from the prior year.

       Direct expenses including salaries and benefits, orthodontic and dental
       supplies and rent increased 47.7% to $68.1 million, or 48.0% of net
       revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $46.1 million, or
       48.2% of net revenues, from the prior year. Direct expenses have
       increased in absolute dollars as a result of the acquisition of New Image
       and other allied practices, the expansion and growth of existing allied
       practices, as well as expenses relating to the resignation of
       OrthAlliance's former president and chief executive officer. The amount
       of severance paid to OrthAlliance's former president and chief executive
       officer totaled approximately $600,000. The decrease in direct expenses
       as a percentage of 1999 net revenues is primarily attributable to
       economies of scale related to salaries and benefits and other direct
       expenses.

       Salaries and benefits increased 49.4% to $42.5 million, or 29.9% of net
       revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $28.4 million, or
       29.7% of net revenues from the prior year. Salaries and benefits have
       increased in absolute dollars as a result of the acquisition of New Image
       and allied practices, the expansion and growth of existing allied
       practices, as well as expenses relating to the resignation of
       OrthAlliance's former president and chief executive officer.

       General and administrative expenses, consisting primarily of
       administrative operating costs, non-rent facility costs, professional
       fees and overhead costs, increased 62.7% to $43.4 million, or 30.6% of
       net revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $26.6 million, or
       27.9% of net revenues, from the prior year. General and administrative
       expenses have shown an increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage
       of revenue relating primarily to the acquisition of New Image and other
       allied practices, expansion and growth of previously existing allied
       practices, and higher laboratory cost.

     - Depreciation and Amortization.  Depreciation and amortization expense
       increased approximately 69.1% to $6.7 million, or 4.7% of net revenues,
       for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $4.0 million, or 4.1% of net
       revenues from the prior year. This increase was attributable to the
       increase in intangible assets associated with the acquisition of New
       Image and other allied practices in 2000. Intangible assets increased
       from $83.6 million in 1999 to $124.2 million in 2000. Depreciation and
       amortization expense primarily relates to the depreciation of capital
       assets and the amortization of excess cost over the fair value of net
       assets acquired, often referred to as "goodwill," and certain other
       intangibles. OrthAlliance's policy has been to amortize goodwill over the
       expected period to be benefited, not to exceed the term of the management
       or consulting agreements.

     - Interest Expense.  For the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
       interest expense was approximately $7.4 million and $2.5 million,
       respectively and represents interest charges on OrthAlliance's borrowings
       on its revolving credit facility and notes payable. The increase was
       primarily due to increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility
       in support of the acquisition of New Image and other allied practices
       affiliated during the period. OrthAlliance borrowings under the revolving
       credit facility increased from $47.5 million at December 31, 1999 to
       $62.0 million as of December 31, 2000. See "-- Liquidity And Capital
       Resources."

     - Provision for Income Taxes.  Provision for income taxes for 2000 and 1999
       was approximately $7.5 million and $7.3 million, respectively. A
       reconciliation of the provision for income taxes for the years ending
       December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 to the amount computed at the federal
       statutory rate is included in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
       Statements included elsewhere in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
       OrthAlliance's effective income tax rates for the years ended December
       31, 2000 and 1999 were higher than the statutory tax rate primarily due
       to the

       amortization of certain intangible assets which were not deductible for
       income tax purposes. The effective tax rate was 44.0% for the year ended
       December 31, 2000 compared to 43.0% for the comparable period in 1999.

  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998.

     - Net Income and Operating Income.  Net income for the year ended December
       31, 1999 increased 27.2% to $9.6 million from $7.5 million from 1998.
       Operating income for the year ended December 31, 1999 increased 36.5% to
       $18.9 million from $13.9 million from 1998. The increase in net income
       and operating income for the year ended December 31, 1999 is attributable
       to an overall increase in net revenues related to allied practice
       acquisitions, internal same store growth and a reduction of expenses as a
       percentage of net revenues.

     - Net Revenues.  Net revenues increased 28.7% from 1998 to 1999, from $74.4
       million to $95.7 million. The increase in net revenues is primarily due
       to an increase in affiliations of allied practices together with an
       increase of approximately 9.0% attributed to internal growth of
       comparable existing practices. Net revenues as reported by OrthAlliance
       include OrthAlliance's contractual service or consulting fee based in
       part on adjusted patient revenues, as well as reimbursed expenses of the
       allied practices.

     - Operating Expenses.  Total operating expenses increased 26.9% to $76.8
       million, or 80.2% of net revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1999
       from $60.5 million, or 81.4% of net revenues, from the prior year.

       Direct expenses including salaries and benefits, orthodontic and dental
       supplies and rent increased 25.8% to $46.1 million, or 48.2% of net
       revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $36.6 million, or
       49.3% of net revenues from the prior year. Direct expenses have increased
       in absolute dollars as a result of the affiliation of additional allied
       practices during the period as well as the expansion and growth of
       previously existing allied practices. The decrease in direct expenses as
       a percentage of 1999 net revenues is primarily attributable to economies
       of scale related to salaries and benefits and other direct expenses.

       Salaries and benefits increased 24.2% to $28.4 million, or 29.7% of net
       revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $22.9 million, or
       30.8% of net revenues from the prior year. The decrease in salaries and
       benefits as a percentage of revenues is a result of a significant number
       of current year practice affiliations whereby their employees remained
       employees of the allied practice's professional corporations.
       Accordingly, for these practices, salary and benefit expenses are not
       reported by OrthAlliance. OrthAlliance expects that in future periods
       salaries and benefits will increase in absolute dollars, but may vary as
       a percentage of net revenues.

       General and administrative expenses, consisting primarily of
       administrative operating costs, non-rent facility costs, professional
       fees and overhead costs, increased 24.4% to $26.7 million, or 27.9% of
       net revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $21.5 million, or
       28.8% of net revenues, from the prior year. General and administrative
       expenses have shown an increase in absolute dollars primarily related to
       the acquisition of additional allied practices during the period as well
       as the expansion and growth of previously existing allied practices
       offset by reductions in marketing, advertising and other costs.

     - Depreciation and Amortization.  Depreciation and amortization expense
       increased approximately $1.6 million in 1999 from 3.3% to 4.1% of net
       revenues from the prior year. This increase was attributable to the
       increase in intangible assets associated with the affiliation of allied
       practices in 1999. Intangible assets increased from $50.9 million to
       $83.6 million from 1998 to 1999. Depreciation and amortization expense
       primarily relates to the depreciation of capital assets and the
       amortization of goodwill and certain other intangibles. OrthAlliance's
       policy is to amortize goodwill over the expected period to be benefited,
       not to exceed the term of the management or consulting

       agreements. For the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, depreciation
       and amortization expense approximates $4.0 million and $2.4 million,
       respectively.

     - Interest Expense.  For the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998,
       interest expense was approximately $2.5 million and $0.6 million,
       respectively, and represents interest charges on OrthAlliance's
       borrowings on its revolving credit facility. The increase was primarily
       due to increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility in
       support of allied practices affiliated during the period. OrthAlliance
       borrowings under the revolving credit facility increased from $15.5
       million at December 31, 1998 to $47.5 million as of December 31, 1999.
       See "-- Liquidity And Capital Resources."

     - Provision for Income Taxes.  Provision for income taxes for 1999 and 1998
       approximates $7.3 million and $6.1 million, respectively. A
       reconciliation of the provision for income taxes for the years ending
       December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 to the amount computed at the federal
       statutory rate is included in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
       Statements included elsewhere in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
       OrthAlliance's effective income tax rates for the years ended December
       31, 1999 and 1998 were higher than the statutory tax rate primarily due
       to the amortization of certain intangible assets which were not
       deductible for income tax purposes. The effective tax rate was 43.0% for
       the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to 45.0% for the comparable
       period in 1998.

     QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS.  OrthAlliance's unaudited quarterly operating
information (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) for the years ended

     SEASONALITY.  Most patients who seek orthodontic treatment are children and
young adults, although the number of adults seeking treatment has been
increasing in recent years, particularly with the introduction of new products
such as Invisalign. Based upon information provided by OrthAlliance's allied
practices, and based upon the results of operations in 1998, 1999 and 2000,
OrthAlliance generally experiences an increase in new patient volume during the
summer months when children are not in school.

OrthAlliance also expects the lowest volume of patient starts during the
Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday season when children are on vacation and when
many of the allied practices are closed. As a consequence, OrthAlliance expects
higher patient revenue in the third quarter and lower patient revenue in the
fourth quarter. Accordingly, OrthAlliance generally expects a stronger third
quarter in terms of revenue.

     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.  OrthAlliance has funded its operations to
date primarily through cash from operations, OrthAlliance's revolving credit
facility and other available capital sources. This capital is used for
affiliations with new allied practices, development of allied practice
enhancements, development of allied practice satellite offices, capital asset
additions and general working capital needs. As of March 31, 2001 and December
31, 2000 OrthAlliance had a working capital balance of $15.9 million and $11.5
million, respectively. As of March 31, 2001, OrthAlliance's principal sources of
liquidity included cash and short term investments of approximately $7.8 million
and the revolving credit facility, which as of that date had $11.0 million of
available credit. OrthAlliance's balance of $64.0 million in outstanding
borrowings under its revolving credit facility at March 31, 2001 bears interest
at the prime interest rate plus a margin or the London InterBank Offering Rate
plus a margin. As of March 31, 2001, OrthAlliance believes it was in compliance
with all terms of the revolving credit facility. On April 14, 2000, OrthAlliance
expanded its revolving credit facility to $75.0 million, which expires on April
13, 2003 and has substantially similar terms to the previous credit facility.
OrthAlliance's working capital increased 38.0% to $15.9 million at March 31,
2001, and decreased 46.0% to $11.5 million at December 31, 2000 from $21.5
million at December 31, 1999. Stockholders' equity increased 10.0% to $76.0
million at March 31, 2001 from $69.0 million at March 31, 2000, and increased
9.2% to $74 million at December 31, 2000 from $67.8 million on December 31,
1999.

     OrthAlliance's operating activities generated cash of $6.6 million during
the three month period ended March 31, 2001. Net cash used in financing
activities approximated $3.2 million for three month period ended March 31, 2001
and consisted of borrowings and repayments on the revolving credit facility and
other debt and treasury shares purchased. Cash used in investing activities of
$0.6 million in the three month period ended March 31, 2001 consisted of
payments in connection with allied practices affiliated and capital
expenditures, primarily for office and computer equipment used in OrthAlliance
operations. OrthAlliance does not currently have any material commitments with
respect to any capital expenditures. OrthAlliance's operating activities
generated cash of $12.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2000,
primarily attributed to net income during the period, increased patient
prepayments and other factors which were offset by increases in patient and
other receivables, compared to $15.2 million during the year ended December 31,
1999. Net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately $1.2 million
in the year ended December 31, 2000. Cash used in financing activities consisted
of debt repayment and the repurchase of OrthAlliance's Class A common stock. For
the year ended December 31, 2000, OrthAlliance borrowed approximately $83.0
million and repaid $81.5 million. Repurchase of OrthAlliance's Class A common
stock totaled approximately $3.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 1999,
$28.1 million was provided by financing activities and resulted primarily from
borrowings under the revolving credit facility. Cash used in investing
activities of $17.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2000 consisted of
payments in connection with the acquisition of New Image and other allied
practices affiliated and capital expenditures, primarily for office and computer
equipment used in OrthAlliance operations. Cash used in investing activities was
$35.3 million in the year ended December 31, 1999 and consisted of payments in
connection with the affiliation of allied practices and capital expenditures,
primarily for office and computer equipment used in OrthAlliance operations.
OrthAlliance does not currently have any material commitments with respect to
any capital expenditures.

     On December 30, 1997, OrthAlliance entered into a credit agreement with
First Union National Bank to provide a $25 million revolving line of credit. The
interest on borrowings accrues at either the bank's prime rate or the London
InterBank Offering Rate, plus a margin. Amounts borrowed are secured by security
interests in substantially all of OrthAlliance's assets, which include accounts
receivable, management and consulting agreements and the capital stock of
OrthAlliance's wholly-owned subsidiaries. OrthAlliance expanded the revolving
credit facility on March 26, 1999 from $25.0 million to $55.0 million

and from $55.0 million to $75.0 million on April 14, 2000. Outstanding amounts
under the April 14, 2000 agreement are repayable in full on April 13, 2003. As
of March 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 and 1999, the outstanding balance under
this credit facility was $64.0 million, $62.0 million and $47.5 million,
respectively. There can be no assurance that OrthAlliance will be able to renew
or replace its revolving credit facility or obtain alternate financing on
reasonable terms, if at all. As of March 31, 2001, OrthAlliance was in
compliance with the terms and covenants of the revolving credit facility.

     In 1997, after the completion of OrthAlliance's initial public offering and
the affiliation of its founding 55 allied practices, OrthAlliance acquired
certain operating assets of, or the stock in entities that held certain
operating assets of, 11 additional orthodontic practices. The total
consideration paid for these allied practices was $12.4 million, of which $2.1
million was paid in cash and the balance through the issuance of 863,775 shares
of OrthAlliance Class A common stock.

     For the year ended December 31, 1998, OrthAlliance acquired certain
operating assets of, or the stock in entities that held certain operating assets
of, 36 additional allied practices. The total consideration paid for these
allied practices was $46.8 million, of which $24.5 million was paid in cash,
$2.5 million issued in short-term notes payable and the balance through the
issuance of 1,640,492 shares of OrthAlliance Class A common stock.

     For the year ended December 31, 1999, OrthAlliance acquired certain
operating assets of, or the stock in entities that held certain operating assets
of, 36 additional allied practices. The total consideration paid for these
allied practices was $39.5 million, of which $33.0 million was paid in cash,
$5.7 million in long term notes payable and the balance through the issuance of
93,584 shares of OrthAlliance Class A common stock.

     For the year ended December 31, 2000, OrthAlliance acquired certain
operating assets of, or the stock in entities that held certain operating assets
of 43 additional allied practices. Of the 43 allied practices, 31 practices were
acquired on March 1, 2000, by acquiring substantially all of the assets of New
Image Orthodontic Group, Inc., a privately held Georgia corporation based in
Atlanta, Georgia, for a total consideration, including acquisition costs, of
approximately $32.1 million. The acquisition price included a cash payment of
$5.6 million; an estimated $0.3 million in acquisition costs; promissory notes
issued of approximately $12.9 million, with interest rates ranging from 6% to
10%, repayable over a one to five year period; the assumption of approximately
$13.4 million of existing debt due to New Image's former orthodontic practices,
repayable over the next five years at interest rates approximating 9%; and the
issuance of approximately 273,000 stock options.

     OrthAlliance's capital resources needed to continue acquisition and
development efforts are expected to be funded through a combination of cash
flows provided by ongoing operations, OrthAlliance's revolving credit facility,
the issuance of equity and debt securities, as described in OrthAlliance's
registration statement on Form S-4 which became effective on August 6, 1999, and
other sources. OrthAlliance management believes that these sources of capital
will be sufficient to meet OrthAlliance's capital requirements for the next
twelve months. OrthAlliance may choose to issue debt or equity to meet its
future long-term capital needs, as management deems appropriate. There can be no
assurance that OrthAlliance will be able to raise such additional working
capital on acceptable terms, if at all. In the event OrthAlliance is unable to
raise additional working capital, further measures would be necessary including,
without limitation, the delay, or scale back of its operations, new allied
practice affiliations, marketing programs and other actions. Certain of such
measures may require third party consents or approvals, including the banks
under the revolving credit facility, and there can be no such assurance that
such consents or approvals can be obtained. OrthAlliance has reduced the number
of new affiliations in order to conserve capital resources.

     The management and consulting agreements provide for short-term advances by
OrthAlliance to its allied practices for working capital requirements and other
purposes on terms to be mutually agreed upon. These items are advanced and
repaid in a revolving manner. Generally, advances are repaid when allied
practices deposit patient revenue into their depository accounts. Advances occur
when the allied practice operating expenses paid exceed patient revenue earned.
From time to time, OrthAlliance may enter into

short-term loan agreements with allied practices for office expansion or
satellite office programs. Loans are provided generally at an interest rate of
prime plus 1.5% with monthly payments through maturity.

     ACQUISITION OF NEW IMAGE ORTHODONTIC GROUP, INC.  On March 1, 2000,
OrthAlliance, through OA New Image, a wholly owned subsidiary, closed a purchase
and sale agreement with New Image. OrthAlliance acquired substantially all the
assets of New Image.

     New Image was founded in February 1997 and provides business operations,
financial and marketing and administrative services to orthodontic practices
across the United States in accordance with long-term service agreements. The
transaction was accounted for as a purchase and includes practice management
agreements with 36 orthodontic practitioners operating in 50 locations with over
$33 million in annualized revenues.

     The collective value of the acquisition of New Image was approximately
$32.1 million. Of this amount, $5.6 million was paid in cash, an estimated $0.3
million in acquisition costs, approximately $13.4 million of debt was assumed
and $12.9 million in promissory notes were issued to the sellers, with interest
rates ranging from 6% to 10%, and approximately 273,000 stock options with an
aggregate fair value of approximately $0.6 million.

     During 2000, OrthAlliance integrated New Image into its business
operations. OrthAlliance management continues to believe that OrthAlliance will
benefit from the economies of scale and synergies resulting from the
acquisition.

     INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE EXAMINATION.  The Internal Revenue Service has
completed its examination of OrthAlliance's federal income tax return for the
year ended December 31, 1998. OrthAlliance has agreed with the Internal Revenue
Service's proposed adjustment of approximately $0.6 million of additional tax
payments for the years ended 1998 and 1999 which was paid in March 2001. The
adjustment related to timing differences between book and tax with regard to
certain capitalized practice acquisition costs. OrthAlliance adequately provided
reserves in prior years and the additional tax payments did not result in
additional income tax expense in fiscal 2000.

     STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN.  During the three months ended March 31, 2001,
OrthAlliance acquired 4,300 shares of its Class A common stock at an approximate
cost of $13,000. OrthAlliance is authorized to repurchase additional shares from
time to time. Payments for such share repurchases come from operating cash flow
and/or revolving credit facility borrowings. The timing and the amount of shares
to be purchased are generally determined based on the evaluation of working
capital needs and stock market conditions.

     On December 1, 2000, OrthAlliance announced the extension of its common
stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $6.8 million of its Class A common
stock. OrthAlliance had initially announced the program on October 22, 1998.
OrthAlliance is authorized to purchase shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market
National Market System at prevailing prices through December 31, 2001. During
2000, OrthAlliance had repurchased about 900,000 shares amounting to $3.8
million under this program. Share repurchases are financed by a combination of
operating cash flow and borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The
timing and the amount of shares to be purchased will be determined based on the
evaluation of working capital needs and stock market conditions. Subsequent to
December 31, 2000, OrthAlliance has acquired 4,300 shares of its Class A common
stock at a cost of approximately $13,000. As of March 31, 2001, OrthAlliance's
total purchase of Class A common stock totaled approximately $6.7 million.

     OTHER EVENTS.  OrthAlliance's Class A common stock is currently quoted on
the Nasdaq Stock Market National Market System under the symbol "ORAL." For
continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Stock Market National Market System,
OrthAlliance must meet certain tests. OrthAlliance disclosed in previous filings
that the continued listing of its Class A common stock was permitted under
temporary amendments to the listing requirements adopted by the Nasdaq Stock
Market. On June 29, 2001, the SEC approved those amendments which include, among
other things, a minimum bid price of $3.00 per share and minimum stockholders'
equity of $10 million. OrthAlliance is currently in compliance with the amended
listing standards.

     Recent Accounting Pronouncements.  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (which is
commonly referred to as "SFAS") No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities," as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138. SFAS No.
133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for
hedging activities. It requires that entities recognize all derivatives as
either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments
at fair value. OrthAlliance management anticipates that the adoption of SFAS No.
133 will not have a material effect on OrthAlliance's results of operations or
financial position.

     The SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements, on December 3, 1999. This pronouncement clarifies existing
revenue recognition principles and states that revenue is generally realized or
realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services rendered,
the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is
reasonably assured. OrthAlliance management believes OrthAlliance is in
compliance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101.

     In April 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (which is commonly
referred to as "FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 44, Accounting for
Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation: an Interpretation of APB
Opinion No. 25. This pronouncement seeks to interpret the application of APB No.
25, primarily in relation to modifications to the terms of existing awards and
to the scope of APB No. 25. The adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 44 did not
have a material impact on OrthAlliance's results of operations or its financial
position.

     INFLATION.  OrthAlliance does not believe that inflation has had a material
effect on its results of operations. There can be no assurance that
OrthAlliance's business will not be affected by inflation in the future.

     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK.  OrthAlliance
does not have any derivative financial instruments as of March 31, 2001.
Further, OrthAlliance is not exposed to interest rate risk as OrthAlliance's
revolving line of credit agreement has a variable interest rate. Therefore, the
fair value of these instruments is not affected by change in market interest
rates. OrthAlliance believes that the market risk arising from not hedging its
financial instruments is not material.

     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  From time to time, OrthAlliance is involved in various
legal proceedings, claims and litigation matters arising in the ordinary course
of business, including labor and personnel related issues. In the opinion of
management, the outcome of such routine matters will not have a material adverse
effect on OrthAlliance's business, financial condition or results of operations.

     From time to time, OrthAlliance has been, and can expect to be, involved in
disputes and/or litigation with certain of its allied practices. Certain allied
practitioners have also sent notices of default to, or commenced litigation
against, OrthAlliance alleging that OrthAlliance has failed to provide certain
services under the management and consulting agreements with the allied
practices. Other litigation alleges that certain provisions of OrthAlliance's
management or consulting agreements may be unenforceable, among other claims.
OrthAlliance vigorously defends against such claims and believes that such
claims are without merit. The number of such claims and notices of default have
increased since the date of OrthAlliance's merger agreement with OCA.
OrthAlliance believes that such claims and disputes will not have a material
adverse effect on OrthAlliance. See "THE MERGER -- OrthAlliance's Reasons For
the Merger; Recommendation of OrthAlliance's Board of Directors."

                 MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS FOLLOWING THE MERGER

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     After the merger is completed, one member of OrthAlliance's Board of
Directors will be appointed by OCA's Board of Directors to serve as a director
of OCA. This individual will be selected by the Boards of Directors of OCA and
OrthAlliance.

     At the effective time of the merger, the directors of OCA Acquisition
Corporation immediately prior to the effective time will be the directors of
OrthAlliance.

MANAGEMENT

     The officers of OCA prior to the merger would continue to serve as the
officers of OCA upon the merger.

     Following the merger, the then Board of Directors of OrthAlliance will
select the individuals who would serve as the officers of OrthAlliance.

                      COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS

     OrthAlliance stockholders, whose rights are currently governed by
OrthAlliance's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws and by
the Delaware General Corporation Law, will become stockholders of OCA upon
completion of the merger. As such, the rights of the former OrthAlliance
stockholders will thereafter be governed by OCA's restated certificate of
incorporation, its bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law.

     While it is impractical to summarize all of the pertinent differences, set
forth below are the material differences between the rights of OrthAlliance
stockholders under OrthAlliance's governing documents and the rights of OCA
stockholders under OCA's governing documents. Because OCA and OrthAlliance are
both organized under the laws of Delaware, the differences in stockholders
rights arise solely from the differences in the governing documents, rather than
governing law.

VOTING RIGHTS; ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT

     OCA.  OCA's restated certificate of incorporation provides that each issued
and outstanding share of OCA common stock entitles the holder to one vote on
each matter with respect to which stockholders are entitled to vote. A majority
of votes cast by OCA stockholders entitled to vote at a OCA stockholder meeting
is sufficient to approve any matter which properly comes before the meeting.
OCA's bylaws provide that stockholders may take action by the unanimous written
consent of all stockholders entitled to vote on any matter accompanied by a
written waiver of any right to dissent signed by each stockholder entitled to
notice of the meeting but not entitled to a vote at it.

     ORTHALLIANCE.  OrthAlliance's amended and restated certificate of
incorporation provides that each issued and outstanding share of OrthAlliance
Class A and Class B common stock entitles the holder to one vote on each matter
with respect to which stockholders are entitled to vote. A majority of votes by
stockholders of OrthAlliance Class A common stock and Class B common stock that
are voting together as a single class is necessary to decide all matters.
OrthAlliance's bylaws provide that stockholders may take action by the written
consent of no less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary at a
meeting of the stockholders entitled to vote on any matter.

CLASSES OF COMMON STOCK; STOCKHOLDER CONVERSION RIGHTS

     OCA.  OCA's governing documents do not provide for classes of OCA common
stock or stock conversion rights for holders of OCA common stock.

     ORTHALLIANCE.  OrthAlliance's amended and restated certificate of
incorporation provides that holders of OrthAlliance Class B common stock are
prohibited from transferring their shares of Class B common stock, except to the
stockholder's close relatives. Holders of OrthAlliance Class B common stock may
convert these shares into an equal number of shares of OrthAlliance Class A
common stock at any time. In addition, holders of OrthAlliance Class B common
stock are required to convert their shares of Class B common stock to Class A
common stock when the market price of OrthAlliance Class A common stock reaches
and maintains for 20 consecutive trading days certain levels. The first
conversion price equals 150% of Class A common stock's share price at its
initial public offering (which was $12.00 per share), or $18.00 per share. The
second conversion price equals 120% of the first conversion price, or $21.60.
The third conversion price equals 120% of the second, or $25.92. The fourth
conversion price equals 120% of the third, or $31.10. The fifth conversion price
equals 120% of the fourth, or $37.32. Adjustments are made for any stock splits
or stock dividends. When the Class A common stock reaches a conversion price
level, 20% of the total number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding,
allocated on a pro rata basis, will be converted into Class A common stock, with
each such share of Class B common stock being converted into eight shares of
Class A common stock. Six years after August 1997, each remaining share of Class
B common stock will automatically convert into one share of Class A common
stock. OrthAlliance's bylaws provide that OrthAlliance will reserve at all times
shares of Class A common stock sufficient to effect a conversion of all
outstanding shares of Class B common stock.

STOCKHOLDER NOMINATIONS AND PROPOSALS

     OCA.  OCA's governing documents do not contain any provisions which require
OCA stockholders to provide advance notice to OCA prior to proposing business or
nominating persons at an annual meeting or a special meeting of stockholders.

     ORTHALLIANCE.  OrthAlliance's bylaws provide that OrthAlliance stockholders
propose to bring business to be considered, or to nominate individuals for
election of directors, at an annual meeting of stockholders must notify
OrthAlliance not later than 120 calendar days and not earlier than 150 calendar
days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's annual
meeting. In the case of a special meeting, OrthAlliance stockholders must notify
OrthAlliance not less than 30 days prior to the date of the meeting.
OrthAlliance's bylaws also require that any stockholder notice of nomination for
election of a director provide certain information concerning the stockholder
and his or her nominee, including, among other things, the information regarding
the nominee as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed under
the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the consent of
the nominee to serve as a director of OrthAlliance if elected. The presiding
officer of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge any stockholder proposals or
nominations that are not made in compliance with these procedures.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     OCA.  OCA's Board of Directors is to consist of two to 15 members, as
determined from time to time by OCA's Board of Directors, and on the date of
this Proxy Statement/Prospectus consisted of six members. Any vacancy arising
from a director's early retirement from the Board of Directors or an increase in
the number of members of the Board of Directors is to be filled by a majority
vote of the remaining directors. The members of OCA's Board of Directors are
divided into three classes, with the classes elected for staggered three-year
terms. At each annual meeting of stockholders, OCA stockholders elect for a term
of three years successors to the class of directors whose term expires at the
annual meeting. A director may resign at any time by providing written notice to
OCA, OCA's Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the President.

     ORTHALLIANCE.  OrthAlliance's Board of Directors is to consist of up to
nine directors, as determined from time to time by OrthAlliance's Board of
Directors and on the date of this Proxy Statement/ Prospectus OrthAlliance's
Board of Directors consisted of nine directors. The members of OrthAlliance's
Board of Directors are divided into three classes, with the classes elected for
staggered three-year terms. At each annual meeting of stockholders, OrthAlliance
stockholders elect for three-year terms successors to the class of directors
whose term expires at the annual meeting. However, any vacancy or an increase in
the number of members of OrthAlliance's Board of Directors is to be filled by
majority vote of the OrthAlliance directors then in office, even if less than a
quorum or by a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of the directors. Any
OrthAlliance director so elected will serve only until the next annual meeting
when his or her successor is elected.

CHANGE OF CONTROL

     OCA.  OCA's governing documents contain several provisions which make a
change of control of OCA more difficult to accomplish without the approval of
OCA's Board of Directors, including the following:

     - OCA's Board of Directors is divided into three classes so that
       approximately one-third of the directors will be subject to re-election
       at each annual meeting of the stockholders of OCA;

     - A director may be removed only for cause by a vote of the holders of at
       least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote; and

     - OCA's Board of Directors may determine the rights and preferences of
       preferred stock which OCA may issue without stockholder approval.

     ORTHALLIANCE.  OrthAlliance's governing documents contain several
provisions which make a change of control of OrthAlliance more difficult to
accomplish without the approval of OrthAlliance's Board of Directors, including
the following:

     - OrthAlliance's Board of Directors is divided into three classes with the
       classes elected for staggered three-year terms so that approximately
       one-third of the directors will be subject to re-election at each annual
       meeting of the stockholders of OrthAlliance;

     - Stockholders of OrthAlliance Class A common stock and Class B common
       stock will receive the same consideration per share in the event of a
       merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of property or stock;

     - OrthAlliance's Board of Directors may determine the rights and
       preferences of preferred stock which OrthAlliance may issue without
       stockholder approval; and

     - OrthAlliance's bylaws provide that nominations by stockholders for
       election of directors at any annual meeting of stockholders must notify
       OrthAlliance not later than 120 calendar days and not earlier than 150
       calendar days prior to the first anniversary date of the preceding year's
       annual meeting. In the case of a special meeting, OrthAlliance
       stockholders must notify OrthAlliance not less than 30 days prior to the
       date of the meeting.

REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

     OCA.  OCA's governing documents provide that a director of OCA may be
removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote.

     ORTHALLIANCE.  OrthAlliance's governing documents provide that a director
of OrthAlliance may be removed only for cause by an affirmative vote the holders
of a majority of shares entitled to vote.

AMENDMENT OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS

     OCA.  The affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the
shares entitled to vote is required to amend, repeal or adopt provisions of
OCA's restated certificate of incorporation that are inconsistent with those
pertaining to OCA's Board of Directors, limitation of directors' personal
liability, indemnification, removal of directors and amendments of OCA's
restated certificate of incorporation. OCA's bylaws require an affirmative vote
of two-thirds of the stockholders of OCA common stock to amend or repeal OCA's
bylaws.

     ORTHALLIANCE.  OrthAlliance maintains the right to amend, repeal or adopt
any provision contained in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation
as prescribed under Delaware General Corporation Law. An affirmative vote of
two-thirds of OrthAlliance stockholders entitled to vote may amend, repeal or
adopt OrthAlliance's bylaws. OrthAlliance's Board of Directors also have the
power to amend, repeal or adopt OrthAlliance's bylaws. Any bylaws adopted by
OrthAlliance's Board of Directors may be amended or repealed by a vote of the
holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote.

          CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

     This Proxy Statement/Prospectus contains certain forward-looking statements
about the financial condition, results of operations and business of OCA and
OrthAlliance and about the combined companies following the merger. These
statements concern the cost savings, revenue enhancements and other advantages
the companies expect to obtain from the merger, the anticipated impact of the
merger on OCA's financial performance, tax consequences and accounting treatment
of the merger, market prices of OCA common stock and OrthAlliance Class A common
stock and earnings estimates for the combined company. These statements appear
in several sections of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus, including "SUMMARY,"
"THE MERGER -- OCA's Reasons for the Merger," "THE MERGER -- OrthAlliance's
Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of OrthAlliance's Board of Directors,"
"THE MERGER -- Fairness Opinion of OCA's Financial Advisors" and "THE
MERGER -- Fairness Opinion at OrthAlliance's Financial Advisors." Also, the
forward-looking statements generally include any of the words "believes,"
"expects," "anticipates," "intends," "estimates," "should," "would," "will,"
"plans" or similar expressions.

     Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. They
involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The future results and stockholder
values of OCA and OrthAlliance, and of the combined companies, may differ
materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Many of the
factors that could influence or determine actual results are unpredictable and
not within the control of OCA or OrthAlliance. In addition, neither OCA nor
OrthAlliance intends to, nor are they obligated to, update these forward-looking
statements after this Proxy Statement/Prospectus is distributed, even if new
information, future events or other circumstances have made them incorrect or
misleading as of any future date. For all of these statements, OCA and
OrthAlliance claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking
statements provided in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

     Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contemplated by these forward-looking statements include, among others, the
following possibilities:

     - Cost savings the companies expect from the merger might not be fully
       realized or realized within the time frame the companies anticipate;

     - Revenues following the merger may be lower than expected;

     - Changes in laws or government rules, or the way in which courts interpret
       these laws or rules, may adversely affect the companies' businesses;

     - Changes in accounting standards, or the interpretation of those
       standards, may adversely affect the companies' financial results;

     - Business conditions, inflation or securities markets may undergo
       significant change;

     - General economic and business conditions;

     - Our expectations and estimates concerning future financial performance,
       financing plans, government regulation and the impact of competition;

     - Anticipated trends in our businesses; and

     - Existing and future dental statutes and regulations and other laws
       affecting our business, or changes in those laws or the interpretation of
       those laws.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of OrthAlliance, Inc.:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
OrthAlliance, Inc. (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years ended December 31, 2000. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of OrthAlliance, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years ended December 31,
2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.

1. BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION

a. ORGANIZATION

     OrthAlliance, Inc. ("OrthAlliance"), a Delaware corporation, was
incorporated on October 21, 1996 and provides practice management and consulting
services to orthodontic and pediatric dental practices throughout the United
States. Effective prior to the closing of the initial public offering of shares
of OrthAlliance's Class A Common Stock (the "Offering" or "IPO"), Premier
Orthodontic Group, Inc. ("Premier") and US Orthodontic Care, Inc. ("USOC")
merged with and into OrthAlliance. In the merger, the outstanding common stock
of USOC and Premier converted into shares of Class A Common Stock ("Common
Stock") and shares of Class B Common Stock ("Class B Common Stock"). On August
26, 1997, OrthAlliance acquired (the "Acquisitions") simultaneously with the
closing of the IPO certain operating assets of or the stock of entities holding
certain tangible and intangible assets and assumed certain liabilities of 55
orthodontic practices in exchange for shares of Common Stock and cash. The
Acquisitions were accounted for in accordance with the Securities and Exchange
Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 48.

     OrthAlliance's wholly owned subsidiaries, incorporated in Delaware, include
PedoAlliance, Inc. ("PedoAlliance") and OrthAlliance Finance, Inc. ("OA
Finance") were formed in December 1997. PedoAlliance Properties Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of PedoAlliance, OrthAlliance Properties, Inc. and OrthAlliance
Services, Inc. were incorporated in California in April 1999. OrthAlliance
Holdings, Inc., incorporated in Texas, and OrthAlliance New Image, Inc. ("OA New
Image") were formed in January 2000. These subsidiaries were formed to provide
practice management, patient financing, consulting and other services
(collectively "Management Services") to allied orthodontic and pediatric dental
practices (the "Allied Practices") or their patients. OrthAlliance, Inc. and its
subsidiaries are collectively referred to as "OrthAlliance" or the "Company".

b. AGREEMENTS WITH ALLIED PRACTICES

     The Company is party to management service agreements with the Allied
Practices. These are either "Service Agreements," "Consulting Agreements," or
"Management Service Agreements," collectively "Management Agreements." The type
of Management Agreements are determined by the Company and each Allied Practice
based primarily on applicable state laws and regulations and are as follows:

     Service Agreements

     The parties to each Service Agreement include the Company and the Allied
Practice, which typically is a professional corporation or association owned by
the related Orthodontist or Pediatric Dentist. Each Service Agreement generally
requires the Company to perform the following services for the Allied Practices:
provide and maintain specified furnishings and equipment; provide necessary
employees (except Orthodontists and Pediatric Dentists, and where applicable law
requires, hygienists and dental assistants); establish appropriate business
systems; purchase and maintain inventory; perform payroll and accounting
functions; provide billing and collection services with respect to patients,
insurance companies, and third-party payors; arrange certain legal services not
related to malpractice litigation; design and execute a marketing plan; advise
with respect to new office locations; and manage and organize the Allied
Practices' files and records, including patient records where permitted by
applicable law. If the Allied Practice lacks sufficient funds to pay its current
operating expenses, the Company is also required to advance funds to the Allied
Practice for the purpose of paying such expenses. In exchange for performing the
services described

                                       F-7

                      ORTHALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
      AMOUNT AND DISCLOSURES AS OF MARCH 31, 2001 AND FOR THE THREE MONTHS
                  ENDED MARCH 31, 2000 AND 2001 ARE UNAUDITED.
                (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

above, the Company receives a management fee based on one of the three fee
structures described in section c. below.

     The term of each Service Agreement is 20 to 25 years, subject to prior
termination by either party in the event the other party becomes subject to
voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceedings or materially breaches the
agreement, subject to a cure period. In addition, the Allied Practices may
terminate the Service Agreements upon the occurrence of a change of control of
OrthAlliance (as defined therein, which does not include a transaction approved
by the Company's Board of Directors). Upon the expiration or termination of the
Service Agreement, the Allied Practice may, and in certain circumstances must,
repurchase for cash (at book value) certain assets, including all equipment, and
assume certain liabilities of the Company related to the Allied Practice.

     Service Agreements are generally not assignable by either party thereto
without the written consent of the other party; however, the Company may assign
the Service Agreement without the Allied Practice's consent to any entity under
common control of the Company. The Company and the Allied Practice agree to
indemnify each other for costs and expenses incurred by such other party that
are caused directly or indirectly by, as the case may be, the Company's or the
Allied Practice's intentional or negligent acts or omissions. In the case of the
Allied Practice's obligation to indemnify the Company, such obligation also
applies to intentional or negligent acts and omissions occurring prior to the
date of the Service Agreement.

     Consulting Agreements

     The parties to each Consulting Agreement include the Company and the Allied
Practice. Certain provisions of the Consulting Agreement are substantially
similar to the Service Agreement, including provisions relating to the Company's
obligation to loan funds to the Allied Practice in the event the Allied Practice
is unable to pay its current operating expenses; termination of the Consulting
Agreement; repurchase of assets and assumption of liabilities by the Allied
Practice upon expiration or termination; assignment; and indemnification.

     The services provided by the Company to the Allied Practice under each
Consulting Agreement generally include consulting with respect to equipment and
office needs; preparing staffing models appropriate for an Allied Practice;
advising and training with respect to business systems; purchasing and
maintaining inventory; advising with respect to and providing or arranging
accounting and bookkeeping services; advising with respect to developing a
marketing plan; assessing the financial feasibility of establishing new offices;
providing billing and collection services; and assisting the Allied Practice in
organizing and developing filing and recording systems. In exchange for such
services, the Company receives a consulting fee based on one of the three fee
structures described below.

     Management Service Agreements

     In March 2000, the Company and OA New Image assumed the obligations of New
Image under the various Management Service Agreements ("MSA") between New Image
and the orthodontic practices with whom it had entered into MSAs. The form of
MSA provides for a variation of the service fee calculation compared to the
traditional Company form defined in the service or consulting agreement. Under
the MSAs, the service fee amount varies monthly depending on the Allied
Practices financial performance and represents the residual amount after the
payment of practice expenses and contractually determined practice
distributions. The service fee is affected by two variables, (1) total Allied
Practice gross revenue, less refunds, and (2) overhead. Service fees are
calculated based on two separate standardized grids set forth in the MSA that
determine (i) the percent of practice revenue that is
                                       F-8

distributed to the Allied Practice based on that Allied Practice's gross
revenue, less refunds, ("Gross Revenue Grid") and (ii) any additional or
offsetting percentage of gross revenue, less refunds, that is distributed to the
Allied Practice based upon that Allied's Practice's overhead ("Overhead Grid").
Pursuant to the Gross Revenue Grid, in general, the Company's retained service
fees increase if the Allied Practice's gross revenue increases and decrease if
the Allied Practice's gross revenue decreases. Pursuant to the Overhead Grid, in
general, the Company's retained service fees decrease if the Allied Practice's
overhead expenses increase and the retained service fees increase if the Allied
Practice's overhead decreases. The maximum retained service fee percentage is
20.0%. The average service fee percentage for the OA New Image Allied Practices
is approximately 16.1%. In addition, a few OA New Image MSAs provide for a fixed
percentage service fee.

c. CALCULATION OF MANAGEMENT FEES

     Management fees are calculated pursuant to the Management Agreements based
upon the Allied Practice's Adjusted Patient Revenue calculated on the accrual
basis. There are three economic models by which the management fee may be
calculated under the Management Agreements discussed above which are as follows:

          (i) a designated percentage ranging from 13.5% to 20% of Adjusted
     Patient Revenue. The average designated percentage is 17% for the Allied
     Practices subject to this fee structure. In some cases, the Allied Practice
     must guarantee a minimum level of management fees to be paid by the Allied
     Practice for a portion of the agreement ranging from one to 25 years.

          (ii) a designated percentage of Adjusted Patient Revenue, ranging from
     14% to 17%, subject to an annual adjustment based upon improvements in the
     Allied Practice's operating margin in the most recent calendar year as
     compared with the immediately preceding calendar year. No annual adjustment
     will be made which would result in reducing the designated percentage below
     the percentage applicable during the first year of the Management
     Agreement. Operating margin is defined as the percentage determined by
     dividing operating profit by Adjusted Patient Revenue. Operating profit is
     equal to Adjusted Patient Revenue less operating expenses, excluding the
     management fee and such expenses associated with the Allied Practices which
     the Company is prohibited from incurring, primarily consisting of
     orthodontist compensation. The average designated percentage is 16.2% for
     the Allied Practices subject to this fee structure.

          (iii) a fixed dollar fee with annual established fixed increases for
     each year of the Management Agreement.

     The Company has entered into agreements with certain Allied Practices to
make the payment of service fees after the first two years contingent on various
factors, including practice profitability compared to acquisition consideration,
timely reporting of information, participation in practice improvement programs
and orthodontist hours worked.

     The Company earns revenue by providing services pursuant to Management
Agreements with Allied Practices. The Company provides management or consulting
services to each Allied Practice and assumes substantially all operating
expenses except for compensation to the allied orthodontists and pediatric
dentists ("Allied Practitioners") and other employees that the Company may not
employ according to applicable state laws. In exchange for assuming these
expenses and providing services, the Company records revenues in amounts equal
to the assumed expenses plus a service fee or consulting fee, as described
below.

                                       F-9

                (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

     Patient revenue is recognized as services are performed. For orthodontic
services, approximately 20% of the orthodontic patient contract revenues are
recognized at the time of initial treatment. The balance of the contract revenue
is recognized evenly over the remaining treatment period. The 25% estimated
revenue at the initial treatment date is based on the estimated costs incurred
by the Company at that time as compared to the total costs of providing the
contracted services. The percentage includes the estimated costs of diagnosis
and treatment plan development, initial treatment by Company personnel,
orthodontic supplies, and associated administrative services.

     Expenses reported by the Company include certain of the expenses to operate
the orthodontic or pediatric dental offices and all of the expenses of any
corporate offices, facilities or functions.

d. PATIENT RECEIVABLES AND PATIENT PREPAYMENTS

     The difference in the timing of the recognition of adjusted patient revenue
and the collection of cash related thereto results in unbilled receivables or
patient prepayments. Unbilled patient receivables represent the earned revenue
in excess of billings to patients as of the end of each period. Patient
prepayments represent collections from patients or their insurance companies
which are received in advance of the performance of the related services.

     Patient receivables are recorded at net realizable value on the date of
affiliation and subsequent collections are used to pay Allied Practice operating
expenses, the Company's management fee, and payments to the Allied Practices.
Generally, any subsequent uncollectible accounts are recorded as a reduction of
net revenues, which reduces the Company's management fees at the applicable
service fee percentage.

     Generally, the Allied Practices require approximately 25% of the treatment
contract to be paid upon installation of the braces, and the remaining 75%
evenly over the remainder of the treatment term.

e. AMOUNTS DUE FROM ALLIED PRACTICES

     Amounts due from Allied Practices include short-term advances for operating
capital and short-term receivables related to a timing difference between when
the service fees are paid from the Allied Practice's accounts and when the
service fees are deposited by the Company. These items are advanced and repaid
in a revolving manner. Generally, advances are repaid when Allied Practices
deposit patient revenue into their depository accounts. Advances occur when the
Allied Practice operating expenses paid exceed patient revenue earned. Service
fees outstanding are generally paid within 30 days.

f. OPERATING EXPENSES OF ALLIED PRACTICES

     The Company is responsible for the payment of all operating expenses
incurred by the Allied Practice, except for compensation to Allied Practitioners
and other expenses of the Allied Practices that the Company is prohibited from
paying. Expenses that are the responsibility of the Company include the
following: (i) salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, workers compensation, health
insurance and other benefit plans, and other direct expenses of all employees of
OrthAlliance at each practice office, excluding those costs associated with
orthodontists and any other classification of employee which OrthAlliance is
prohibited from employing by applicable state laws or regulations; (ii) direct
costs of all employees or consultants that provide services to each practice
office except for Affiliated Orthodontists and other employees of the Allied
Practices that the Company is prohibited from employing, (iii) dental and office
supplies as permitted by applicable state laws or regulations, (iv) lease or
rent payments as permitted by

state laws or regulations, utilities, telephone and maintenance expenses for
practice facilities, (v) property taxes on OrthAlliance assets located at Allied
Practice offices, (vi) property, casualty, and liability insurance premiums,
(vii) orthodontists recruiting expenses, and (viii) advertising and other
marketing expenses attributable to the promotion of practice offices.

     All of the above expenses are paid directly to the third party provider of
the goods or services indicated. All of the above expenses are incurred by
OrthAlliance. Such expenses are classified together with similar expenses of the
Company in the consolidated statements of income. In exchange for incurring
these expenses and providing management services, the Company records revenue in
amounts equal to those incurred expenses.

     The Allied Practices retain the responsibility for the payment of any and
all direct employment expenses, including benefits, for any Orthodontist or
other employee that OrthAlliance is prohibited from employing by applicable
state laws or regulations. In addition, the Allied Practices retain the
responsibility for the payment of continuing education expenses, seminars,
professional licenses, professional membership dues and all other expenses of
any Orthodontist.

g. NEW AFFILIATIONS

     During the three months ended March 31, 2001, the Company entered into a
practice affiliation agreement with a practitioner to provide management
services and acquire certain operating assets for a total cash consideration
(including acquisition costs) of $0.9 million (unaudited). The acquired practice
operates one location and generated historical patient revenue of approximately
$0.9 million over the previous 12 months (unaudited). Prior patient revenue is
not necessarily indicative of the level of revenue that these practices may be
expected to generate in the future.

     For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company entered into or assumed
agreements with 43 Allied Practices. Included were 31 practices acquired from
New Image on March 1, 2000, as well as 2 pediatric dental practices, to provide
management and consulting services and acquire certain operating assets for a
total consideration (including acquisition costs) of $42.6 million. This
consideration consisted of options to acquire Class A Common Stock with a fair
value of $0.6 million, $14.8 million in cash, $27.2 million in affiliation and
notes payables. These Allied Practices operate 76 locations.

     For the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company entered into agreements
with 36 Allied Practices, 11 of which were pediatric dental practices, to
provide management services and acquire certain operating assets for a total
consideration (including acquisition costs) of $39.5 million. This consideration
consisted of 93,584 shares of Common Stock, from the Treasury, with an aggregate
value at various acquisition dates of $0.8 million, payment of $33.0 million in
cash, $5.7 million in affiliation and notes payable. These Allied Practices
operate 73 locations.

     For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company entered into agreements
with 36 Allied Practices, seven of which were related to pediatric dental
practices, to provide management services and acquire certain operating assets
for a total consideration (including acquisition costs) of $46.8 million. This
consideration consisted of 1,640,492 shares of Common Stock with an aggregate
value at various acquisition dates of $19.8 million and payment of $24.5 million
in cash and issuance of notes payable of $2.5 million. These Allied Practices
operate 70 locations.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

a. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

     The consolidated financial statements include OrthAlliance, Inc. and its
wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company does not consolidate the operations of
the Allied Practices which it manages as the Company's arrangements with its
Allied Practices do not meet the requirements for consolidation as set forth in
Emerging Issues Task Force consensus opinion 97-2 ("EITF 97-2"). All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

b. INTERIM ACCOUNTING POLICY

     The accompanying unaudited financial statements have not been audited by
independent public accountants, but in the opinion of the Company's management,
such unaudited statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal
recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position
of the Company as of March 31, 2001 and the results of operations and cash flows
for the three months ended March 31, 2000 and 2001. Although the Company's
management believes that the disclosures in these financial statements are
adequate to make the information presented not misleading, certain information
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles has been condensed or omitted pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The results of
operations for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000 are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

c. USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

d. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     The Company considers all highly-liquid investments with a maturity of
three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. All cash
equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximate fair value.

e. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET

     Property and equipment are stated at cost or fair value at acquisition date
if acquired upon affiliation with an Allied Practice. Routine maintenance and
repairs are expensed when incurred, while costs of improvements and renewals are
capitalized. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or remaining
lease terms as follows:

Furniture, fixtures and equipment...............  5 years
Leasehold improvements..........................  Shorter of 3-10 years or the related lease
                                                  term

     Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000
was approximately $0.9 million, $1.2 million, and $1.8 million, respectively.
Depreciation expense was $0.6 million and $0.4 million for the three month
periods ended March 31, 2000 and 2001, respectively (unaudited).

                (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

f. INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET

     The Management Agreements with Allied Practices include the acquisition of
certain tangible and intangible assets and the assumption of certain liabilities
of the Allied Practices. The Company allocates the purchase price to the
tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair
values. Intangible assets related to the Management Agreements are being
amortized using the straight-line method over their respective terms. The
Company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred
that indicate the remaining useful life of the intangible assets may warrant
revision or that the remaining balance of the intangible assets may not be
recoverable. As of December 31, 1999 and 2000, there were no events or
circumstances to indicate that any portion of the recorded net intangible assets
may not be recoverable.

     Amortization expense related to these intangible assets for the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 was $1.5 million, $2.8 million, and $4.9
million, respectively. Amortization expense was $1.0 million and $1.3 million
for the three month periods ended March 31, 2000 and 2001, respectively
(unaudited).

g. OTHER, NET

     Other, net consists primarily of deferred costs related to the Company's
bank credit facility. These costs are amortized using the straight-line method
over the expected period to be benefited. The amortization of deferred costs
related to the line of credit borrowings is included in interest expense.

h. NET REVENUES

     Net revenues primarily consist of management fee income and reimbursed
practice operating expenses (See Note 1). Such reimbursed practice operating
expenses amounted to $54.4 million, $68.9 million, and $106.1 million for the
years ended December 31, 1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively. Reimbursed practice
operating expenses were $30.1 million and $38.6 million for the three month
periods ended March 31, 2000 and 2001, respectively (unaudited).

i. INCOME TAXES

     The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."
The statement requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for
expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the
financial statements or tax returns. Deferred income taxes are provided for
temporary differences in the recognition of certain income and expense items for
financial reporting and tax purposes given the provisions of the enacted tax
laws.

j. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     As of December 31, 1999 and 2000 and as of March 31, 2001 carrying amounts
of the Company's financial instruments, which include cash and cash equivalents,
notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, notes payable and
line of credit borrowings, approximate fair value.

k. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133 "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging
