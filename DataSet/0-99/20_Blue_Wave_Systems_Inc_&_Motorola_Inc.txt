Based
on the estimated maximum number of shares of Motorola common stock that may be issued to former Blue Wave Systems Inc. stockholders pursuant to the proposed merger
described herein in exchange for shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock, calculated as the product of (i) the sum of (a) the maximum number of shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock

options, multiplied by (ii) an assumed exchange ratio applicable in the merger of 0.443 shares of Motorola common stock for each share of Blue Wave Systems common stock. 
(3)
Estimated
solely for the purpose of calculating the registration fee required by Section 6(b) of the Securities Act, and calculated pursuant to Rule 457(f)(1) and
Rule 457(c) thereunder on the basis of the market value of the Blue Wave Systems common stock to be exchanged in the merger, as the product of (i) $6.89 (the average of the high and low
sales prices per share of Blue Wave Systems common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on May 11, 2001) and (ii) 16,760,722, which is the sum of (a) the number of
shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock outstanding on May 14, 2001, (b) the aggregate number of shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock issuable pursuant to all outstanding employee
stock options and (c) the number of shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock otherwise expected to be issued prior to the date the merger is consummated.

Calculated
by multiplying .00025 by the proposed maximum aggregate offering price. 

The registrant hereby amends this registration statement on such date or dates as may be necessary to delay its effective date until the registrant shall
file a further amendment which specifically states that this registration statement shall thereafter become effective in accordance with Section 8(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or until this registration statement shall become effective on such date as the Securities and Exchange Commission, acting pursuant to said Section 8(a), may determine.

    I,

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER    

Q:  What is the proposed transaction?  

    A:  A wholly owned subsidiary of Motorola, Inc. will merge into Blue Wave Systems Inc. As a result, Blue Wave Systems will become
a wholly owned subsidiary of Motorola, and Blue Wave Systems stockholders will exchange their Blue Wave Systems shares for shares of Motorola common stock. 

Q:  Why are the companies proposing the merger?  

    A:  A combined company, with a larger and more diversified portfolio of products and resources, and integrated platform offerings, will more
effectively compete in the telecommunications hardware product industry. Blue Wave Systems brings important capabilities and technologies which, when combined with those of the Motorola Computer
Group, will enable the delivery of a more robust integrated platform for telecommunications OEM customers building applications such as media gateways, representing a significant
time-to-market enhancement for those customers. Industry consolidation has facilitated the creation of integrated platforms that are becoming more popular with our customer
base. By enabling us to deliver a robust integrated platform and therefore compete more effectively, the merger benefits both parties. 

Q:  What will I receive in the merger?  

    A:  Each share of Blue Wave Systems common stock you own will be exchanged in the merger for 0.443 of a share of Motorola common stock. For
example, if you own 1,000 shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock, you will receive 443 shares of Motorola common stock. You will receive only whole shares of Motorola common stock. You will receive
cash in lieu of any fractional shares as described below. 

Q:  What happens as the market price of Motorola stock fluctuates?  

    A:  The exchange ratio is a fixed number and will not be adjusted in the event of any increase or decrease in the price of Motorola common
stock. The value of the shares of Motorola common stock you will receive in the merger will therefore fluctuate as the price of Motorola common stock increases or decreases. You should therefore
obtain a current market quotation for Motorola common stock before voting on the merger. 

Q:  Will Motorola issue fractional shares?  

    A:  No. Motorola will not issue fractional shares. Instead, Blue Wave Systems stockholders will receive a cash payment for any fractional shares
based on the closing price of a share of Motorola common stock on the trading day immediately prior to the merger. 

Q:  Who must approve the merger?  

    A:  In addition to the approvals by the Motorola board of directors and the Blue Wave Systems board of directors, each of which has already been
obtained, and governmental and other regulatory approvals, the merger agreement and the merger must be approved by Blue Wave Systems' stockholders. 

Q:  What stockholder vote is required to approve the merger agreement and the merger?  

    A:  A majority of the outstanding shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock entitled to vote constitutes a quorum for the Blue Wave Systems
special meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock is required to approve the merger agreement and the merger. Blue
Wave Systems stockholders will have one vote for each share of Blue Wave Systems common stock owned by them. 

Q:  Does the Blue Wave Systems board of directors recommend approval of the merger agreement and the merger?  

    A:  Yes. After careful consideration, the Blue Wave Systems board of directors recommends that its stockholders vote in favor of the merger
agreement and the merger. For a more complete description of the recommendation of the Blue Wave Systems board of directors, see the sections entitled "The MergerBlue Wave Systems'
Reasons for the Merger" on page 26 and "The MergerRecommendation of the Blue Wave Systems Board of Directors" on page 27. 

Q:  What do I need to do now?  

    A:  We urge you to read this proxy statement/prospectus, including the appendices, carefully, and to consider how the merger will affect you as
a stockholder of Blue Wave Systems. You should also review the documents referenced under "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 66. 

Q:  How do I vote?  

    A:  You may vote by mailing a signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible so that those shares may be represented at
the special meeting. You may also attend the special meeting and vote in person. 

Q:  If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote my shares for me?  

    A:  Your broker will vote your shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock only if you provide your broker with instructions on how to vote. You
should follow the directions provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your shares. If you do not provide instructions to your broker, your shares will not be voted on the
merger. 

Q:  Can I change my vote?  

    A:  Yes. You may change your vote by delivering a later-dated, signed proxy card to Blue Wave Systems' secretary before the special meeting of
Blue Wave Systems stockholders, or by attending the special meeting and voting in person. 

Q:  Is the merger taxable?  

    A:  It is a condition of the merger that each of Motorola and Blue Wave Systems receives an opinion from its respective tax advisor stating that
the merger will be treated as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result of the merger qualifying as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Blue Wave Systems
stockholders will generally not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the exchange of their Blue Wave Systems common shares solely for Motorola common shares in the
merger, except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Motorola common stock. 

    We
describe the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger in more detail on pages 40-41. The tax consequences to you will depend on the facts of your own
situation. Please consult your tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences to you resulting from the merger. 

Q:  Am I entitled to appraisal rights?  

    A:  No. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, Blue Wave Systems stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the
merger. 

Q:  What will happen to my Blue Wave Systems stock options?  

    A:  All currently outstanding stock options issued to employees of Blue Wave Systems and not exercised prior to the merger will, if the holder
of the options executes a conversion agreement prior to the effective time of the merger, be converted into options for shares of Motorola common stock based on the 0.443 exchange ratio. All options
issued under the Blue Wave Systems directors' stock option 

plan that are not exercised prior to the merger will be terminated. In contemplation of the merger, the Blue Wave Systems board of directors intends to amend the Blue Wave Systems employee stock
option plan to cause all outstanding options to convert into options for shares of Motorola common stock, rather than terminate as currently provided in the plan. If you vote for the merger, then you
will also be voting to approve this amendment to the Blue Wave Systems employee stock option plan. 

Q:  Are there risks I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the merger?  

    A:  Yes. For example, the value of the shares you receive in the merger will not be known at the time you vote on the merger and may go up or
down as the market price of Motorola common stock goes
up or down. 
We urge you to obtain current market quotations of Motorola common stock and Blue Wave Systems common stock.  

    In evaluating the merger, you should carefully consider these and other factors discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" on pages 16-17. 

Q:  When do you expect to complete the merger?  

    A:  We expect to complete the merger late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter of this year. Because the merger is subject to
governmental approvals, however, we cannot predict the exact timing. We are awaiting the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. 

Q:  Should I send in my Blue Wave Systems stock certificates now?  

    A:  No. After we complete the merger, Motorola's exchange agent will send instructions to you regarding your Blue Wave Systems shares that were
converted in the merger. These instructions will explain how to exchange your Blue Wave Systems share certificates for Motorola share certificates and, if applicable, cash instead of any fractional
shares of Motorola stock that you would otherwise receive in the merger. 
Please do not send in your Blue Wave Systems stock certificates with your proxy card.  

Q:  When and where is the special meeting?  

    A:  The special meeting of Blue Wave Systems stockholders will be held at [  ] a.m., local time,
on [            ], [            ], 2001 at [            ]. 

Q:  What else will happen at the meeting?  

    A:  We know of no other matters which are expected to come before the special meeting. 

Q:  Whom can I call with questions?  

    A:  If you have any questions about the merger, please call Blue Wave Systems' Investor Relations Department at
(972) 277-4600 or Motorola's Investor Relations Department at (800) 262-8509.

Wave Systems is a leading supplier of high-channel Digital Signal Processing (DSP) subsystems used in telecommunication infrastructure equipment, such as voice over
packet (VoIP) gateways, digital wireless communications and intelligent peripherals. The ComStruct line of telecom infrastructure communication processing subsystems was launched in
January 1999. At the heart of the ComStruct line is the company's FACT software, which enables the DSP subsystem to be rapidly and effectively deployed in a variety of
carrier class telecom applications. Blue Wave Systems has been a market leader in DSP board-level products since 1983. 

    Blue Wave Systems is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. Blue Wave Systems' sales in 2000 were $34.8 million. Shares of Blue Wave Systems common
stock trade on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "BWSI". 

The Blue Wave Systems Special Meeting (see page 19)  

    The special meeting of the Blue Wave Systems stockholders will be held on [            ],
[            ], 2001, at [      ] a.m., local time, at [            ]. At the special meeting,
Blue Wave Systems stockholders will be asked: 


to
approve the merger agreement and the merger and, in so doing, to amend the Blue Wave Systems stock option plan to provide for the conversion of each
option that is oustanding under the plan into an option to purchase Motorola common stock; and


to
act on other matters that may be properly submitted to a vote at the Blue Wave Systems special meeting. 

Record Date; Stockholders Entitled to Vote (see page 19)  

    You can vote at the special meeting if you owned Blue Wave Systems shares at the close of business on May 25, 2001, the record date. 

    On
the record date, there were [      ] shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Blue Wave
Systems stockholders will have one vote at the special meeting for each share of Blue Wave Systems common stock that they owned on the record date. 

    You
can vote your shares by mailing the enclosed proxy card with your vote, signing it and mailing it in the enclosed return envelope. You can also vote your shares by attending the
special meeting and voting in person. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other fiduciary, you must instruct the bank, broker or other fiduciary to vote on your behalf or obtain a
proxy from the record holder to vote at the Blue Wave Systems special meeting. You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised. 

Vote Required (see page 20)  

    The holders of a majority of the shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock outstanding on the record date must vote for approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and the merger. A failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger. 

Reasons for the Merger (see page 26)  

    A combined company, with a larger and more diversified portfolio of products and resources, and integrated platform offerings, will more effectively compete in
the telecommunications hardware product industry. Blue Wave Systems brings important capabilities and technologies which, when combined with those of the Motorola Computer Group, will enable the
delivery of a more robust integrated platform for telecommunications OEM customers building applications such as media gateways, representing a significant time-to-market
enhancement for those customers. 

    Please
see the sections entitled "The Merger-Motorola's Reasons for the Merger" on page 26 and "The Merger-Blue Wave Systems' Reasons for the Merger" on
page 26 for additional explanation of Motorola's and Blue Wave Systems' reasons for the merger. 

Recommendation of the Blue Wave Systems Board of Directors (see page 27)  

The Blue Wave Systems board of directors has approved the merger agreement, the merger and the transactions contemplated in the merger
agreement and recommends that Blue Wave Systems stockholders vote "FOR" approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

Opinion of Financial Advisor to Blue Wave Systems (see page 29)  

    Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., Blue Wave Systems' financial advisor, delivered an opinion to the Blue Wave Systems board of directors that, as of the
date of the opinion, the exchange ratio to be received in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of Blue Wave Systems. We have attached this opinion as
Appendix C to this proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read the opinion carefully in its entirety to understand the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and
limitations on the review undertaken by Bear Stearns in providing its opinion. The opinion of Bear Stearns is directed to the Blue Wave Systems board of directors and does not constitute a
recommendation to any Blue Wave Systems stockholder with respect to any matter relating to the merger. 

The Merger (see page 22)  

    We propose that a wholly owned subsidiary of Motorola formed for the purpose of the merger merge with and into Blue Wave Systems. As a result, Blue Wave
Systems will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Motorola. 

    We
have attached the merger agreement as Appendix A to this proxy statement/prospectus, and have attached amendment no. 1 to the merger agreement as Appendix B to
this proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read the merger agreement, as amended by amendment no. 1, because it is the legal document that governs the merger. Unless the context
otherwise requires, references in this proxy statement/prospectus to the merger agreement refer to the merger agreement, as amended by amendment no. 1. We have also filed other related
agreements as exhibits to Motorola's registration statement on Form S-4 containing this proxy statement/prospectus. Please see the section titled "Where You Can Find More
Information" on page 66 for instructions on how to obtain copies of these exhibits. 

What You Will Receive in the Merger (see page 43)  

    Under the merger agreement, each of your Blue Wave Systems common shares will be exchanged for 0.443 of a share of Motorola common stock. 

    In
addition, you will receive cash payments instead of any fractional Motorola shares you would have otherwise received based on the closing price of a share of Motorola common stock
on the trading day immediately prior to the merger. 

    The
value of the Motorola shares you will receive in the merger will fluctuate as the market price of Motorola common stock changes. You should therefore obtain a market quotation of
the price of Motorola common stock before voting on the merger. 

    You
will have to surrender your Blue Wave Systems stock certificates to receive Motorola stock certificates. However, please do not send any Blue Wave Systems stock certificates until
you receive written instructions from Motorola's exchange agent after the merger is completed. 

Stock Options (see page 43)  

    At the effective time of the merger, the right to receive shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock under each outstanding option to purchase shares of Blue
Wave Systems common stock granted 

under the Blue Wave Systems stock option plan will become the right to purchase a number of shares of Motorola common stock equal to the number of shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock that were
subject to the option multiplied by 0.443 and rounded down to the next whole number, at an exercise price equal to the current exercise price divided by 0.443, if the holder of the option executes
prior to the effective time of the merger an agreement consenting to the terms of the conversion. At the effective time of the merger, each of these options will be vested as a result of the merger
and will be exercisable approximately ten business days after the merger. Except for the expiration date of each of these options, which will be the same as in effect immediately prior to the merger,
these options will be subject after the merger to the terms and conditions generally applicable to options granted under the Motorola Omnibus Incentive Plan of 2000. Options held by holders that do
not consent to the terms of conversion will expire by their terms as of the effective time of the merger. 

    At
the effective time of the merger, each additional outstanding option to purchase shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock, other than options granted pursuant to the Blue Wave
Systems Directors' Stock Option Plan, will become an option to purchase a number of shares of Motorola common stock equal to the number of shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock that were subject to
the option multiplied by 0.443, at an exercise price equal to the current exercise price divided by 0.443. Converted options will be rounded down so that any fractional shares that would otherwise be
issued under such options will be eliminated. These options will be subject to the same terms and conditions as were in effect immediately prior to the merger. Options granted pursuant to the Blue
Wave Systems directors' stock option plan will terminate at the effective time of the merger, if not exercised before then. 

Interests of Blue Wave Systems Directors and Officers in the Merger (see page 36)  

    At the close of business on the record date, directors and executive officers of Blue Wave Systems and their affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled to
vote approximately [      ] shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock, collectively representing approximately [      ]% of the
shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock outstanding on that date. In addition, certain executive officers of Blue Wave Systems have executed contingent employment agreements with Motorola that will
become effective at the time of the merger. Each director and executive officer of Blue Wave Systems has indicated his or her present intention to vote, or cause to be voted, the shares of Blue Wave
Systems common stock owned by him or her "FOR" the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger. 

Conditions to the Merger (see page 51)  

    We will complete the merger only if certain conditions are satisfied or waived, including: 


approval
and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger by a majority of the Blue Wave Systems stockholders;


the
expiration or termination of all applicable waiting periods, and any extensions of these periods, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act;


the
receipt of opinions of tax advisors that the merger will be treated as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes;


effectiveness
of the registration statement on Form S-4 that contains this proxy statement/prospectus;


the
approval of the listing on the New York Stock Exchange of the Motorola common stock to be issued to the Blue Wave Systems stockholders in the merger;
and


the
satisfaction of other customary contractual conditions set forth in the merger agreement. 

Material Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Blue Wave Systems Merger (see page 40)  

    The merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code. It is a condition of the merger
that each of Motorola and Blue Wave Systems receives an opinion from its tax advisor stating that the merger will be treated as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result of
the merger qualifying as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Blue Wave Systems stockholders generally will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the
exchange of their Blue Wave Systems common shares solely for Motorola common shares in the merger, except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Motorola common stock. 

Regulatory Matters (see page 41)  

    Motorola and Blue Wave Systems must make certain filings and take other actions necessary to obtain approvals from U.S. governmental authorities in connection
with the merger, including antitrust authorities. Motorola and Blue Wave Systems have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain any required governmental consents and approvals. 

    The
waiting period during which the U.S. antitrust authorities review the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act will expire on June 6, 2001. We expect to obtain
all other material required governmental approvals and, if all other conditions to the merger are satisfied, complete the merger late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter of 2001. We
cannot be certain, however, that Motorola and Blue Wave Systems will obtain all required governmental approvals, or that we will obtain these approvals without conditions that would be detrimental to
Motorola or Blue Wave Systems. 

No Appraisal Rights (see page 42)  

    Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, Blue Wave Systems stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger. 

Termination (see page 53)  

    Either Motorola or Blue Wave Systems may terminate the merger agreement if: 


the
merger is not completed by December 31, 2001;


a
final and nonappealable governmental order is entered enjoining or prohibiting the completion of the merger;


the
merger agreement fails to receive requisite Blue Wave Systems stockholder approval after a vote; or


the
other party materially breaches its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in certain circumstances and the breaching party fails
to cure the breach within 30 days of receiving written notice of the breach. 

    In
addition, Motorola may terminate the merger agreement without completing the merger if, among other things: 


the
Blue Wave Systems board of directors withdraws or modifies its approval or recommendation of the merger;


the
Blue Wave Systems board of directors recommends any alternative acquisition proposal to the Blue Wave Systems stockholders; 


Blue
Wave Systems or any of its officers or directors enters into discussions regarding an alternative acquisition proposal; or


Blue
Wave Systems enters into an agreement to consummate, or consummates, an acquisition transaction with a party other than Motorola or Earth Acquisition
Corporation. 

    Motorola
and Blue Wave Systems may mutually agree in writing to terminate the merger agreement without completing the merger. 

Termination Fee (see page 54)  

    Blue Wave Systems has agreed to pay Motorola a termination fee if the merger agreement is terminated by: 


Motorola
because the Blue Wave Systems board of directors has withdrawn or modified, in a manner adverse to Motorola, its recommendation of the merger; or


Motorola
or Blue Wave Systems under certain circumstances in which a third party has announced an intention to make an acquisition proposal, 

in
each case in an amount equal to 3.9% of the amount calculated by multiplying 7,250,000 by the average daily closing price of Motorola common stock for the 20-day period ending on the
date on which the merger agreement was terminated. 

Stock Option Agreement (see page 56)  

    In connection with the merger, Motorola and Blue Wave Systems entered into a stock option agreement under which Blue Wave Systems granted to Motorola an option
to purchase up to 19.9% of Blue Wave Systems' outstanding shares of common stock. The option is exercisable in the same circumstances under which Blue Wave Systems is required to pay to Motorola the
merger agreement termination fee at a price per share equal to $7.25. The stock option agreement limits the amount of total profit Motorola is permitted to receive as a result of the termination fee
and the exercise of the stock option to the amount of the merger agreement termination fee. We have attached the stock option agreement, and amendment no. 1 to the stock option agreement, as
Appendix E to this proxy statement/prospectus. 

Accounting Treatment (see page 36)  

    Motorola will account for the merger as a purchase of a business, which means that the assets and liabilities of Blue Wave Systems, including intangible
assets, will be recorded at their fair value with the remaining purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets and liabilities and in-process research and development reflected as
goodwill and the results of operations and cash flows of Blue Wave Systems will be included in Motorola's results prospectively after the merger. 

Effects of the Merger on the Rights of Blue Wave Systems Stockholders (see page 43)  

    The rights of Blue Wave Systems stockholders who receive Motorola shares in the merger will continue to be governed by Delaware law, but will also be governed
by Motorola's charter and Motorola's by-laws. The rights of Blue Wave Systems stockholders under Motorola's charter and by-laws will differ in certain respects from the rights
under the current Blue Wave Systems charter and by-laws. See "Comparison of Certain Rights of Common Stockholders of Motorola and Stockholders of Blue Wave Systems" on pages 61-64 for a
discussion of the material differences between the rights of holders of Motorola common stock and of Blue Wave Systems common stock. 

Management and Operations of Blue Wave Systems after the Merger (see page 42)  

    After the merger, Motorola plans to operate Blue Wave Systems as a part of the Motorola Computer Group within Motorola's Integrated Electronic Systems Sector.
Motorola expects that Rob N. Shaddock, current President and CEO of Blue Wave Systems, and the other current members of Blue Wave Systems' management and employees will continue their
employment with the business after the merger. 

Ownership of Shares after the Merger  

    After giving effect to the merger, the former Blue Wave Systems stockholders will hold less than 1% of the outstanding Motorola common stock as a result of the
merger, based upon the number of issued and outstanding shares of Motorola common stock as of [      ], 2001. 

Risk Factors (see page 16)  

    See "Risk Factors" for a discussion of certain risks that you should consider in evaluating whether to approve the merger and the merger agreement and thereby
become a holder of Motorola common stock. 

Listing of Motorola Common Stock (see page 51)  

    It is a condition to the completion of the merger that the Motorola shares to be issued to the Blue Wave Systems stockholders in the merger be authorized for
listing on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Forward-Looking Statements (see page 65)  

    Motorola and Blue Wave Systems have made forward-looking statements in this proxy statement/prospectus and in the documents to which we have referred you.
These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and therefore may not prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements include assumptions as to how Motorola may perform after the merger and,
accordingly, it is uncertain whether any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or, if any of them do transpire or occur, what impact they will have on
the results of operations and financial condition of Motorola or the price of its stock. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" on page 65 for further details. 

    When
we use words like "believes," "expects," "anticipates" or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. For those statements, Motorola and Blue Wave Systems
claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

    Because
the market price of Motorola common stock is subject to fluctuation, the market value of the Motorola shares that the Blue Wave Systems stockholders will receive in the merger
may increase or decrease before and after the special meeting. 
We urge Blue Wave Systems stockholders to obtain current market quotations for Motorola common stock and Blue
Wave Systems common stock. We cannot give any assurance as to the future prices or markets for Motorola common stock.  

RISK FACTORS    

    You should carefully consider the following important factors, in addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus, to determine whether to vote for the proposals relating to the merger. See "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 66. 

The value of shares of Motorola common stock to be received in the merger will fluctuate. You may receive more or less value depending on fluctuations in the
price of Motorola's common stock.
 The number of Motorola shares to be received in the merger for each Blue Wave Systems share is fixed. Therefore, because the market price of
Motorola shares is subject to fluctuation, the value at the time of the merger of the Motorola shares to be received by Blue Wave Systems stockholders will depend on the market price of Motorola
shares at that time. There can be no assurance as to the value of Motorola shares at that time. 

    The
market prices of Motorola common stock and Blue Wave Systems common stock when the merger is completed may vary from their market prices on the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus and on the date of the Blue Wave Systems special meeting. In addition, the merger may occur at a date later than the date of the special meeting, and there can be no assurance
that the market price of Motorola shares on the date of the special meeting will reflect the market price of Motorola shares at the time of the merger. The market price of Motorola shares has been,
and may continue to be, volatile. For example, during the 12-month period ending on [       ], 2001, the most recent practicable date prior to the mailing
of this proxy statement/prospectus, the closing price of Motorola common stock varied from a low of $[      ] to a high of
$[      ] and ended that period at $[      ], and the closing price of Blue Wave Systems common stock varied from a low of
$[      ] to a high of $[      ] and ended that period at $[      ]. See "Summary Selected
Financial InformationComparative Per Share Market Price and Dividend Information" on pages 14-15 for more detailed share price information. 

    These
variations may be the result of various factors including: 


changes
in the business, operations or prospects of Motorola or Blue Wave Systems;


governmental
or regulatory considerations;


with
respect to Blue Wave Systems, market assessments as to whether and when the merger will be consummated;


the
timing of the merger; and


general
stock market and economic conditions. 

Conditions to the merger may not be satisfied.
 The merger agreement contains conditions that, if not satisfied or waived, would result
in the merger not occurring, even though the Blue Wave Systems stockholders may have approved it. We cannot assure you that all of the closing conditions to the merger will be satisfied, that any
unsatisfied conditions will be waived or that the merger will occur. If the merger does not occur, Blue Wave Systems may incur significant expenses that could have a material adverse effect on the
financial and operating results of Blue Wave Systems. 

Blue Wave Systems may lose an opportunity to enter into a merger or business combination with another party on more favorable terms because of provisions in
the merger agreement which prohibit Blue Wave Systems from entering into such transactions or soliciting such proposals.
 While the merger agreement is in effect, subject to
very narrowly defined exceptions, Blue Wave Systems is prohibited from entering into or soliciting, initiating or encouraging any inquiries or proposals that may lead to a proposal or offer to enter
into certain transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets or other business combination, with any person other than Motorola. As a result of this prohibition, Blue Wave 

Systems may lose an opportunity to enter into a transaction with another potential partner on more favorable terms. 

If the merger is not completed, Blue Wave Systems may be unable to attract another strategic partner on equivalent or more attractive terms than those being
offered by Motorola.
 If the merger agreement is terminated and the Blue Wave Systems board of directors determines that it is in the best interests of the Blue Wave Systems
stockholders to seek a merger or business combination with another strategic partner, Blue Wave Systems cannot assure you that it will be able to find a partner offering terms equivalent or more
attractive than the price and terms offered by Motorola in the merger. 

The price of Motorola common stock may be affected by factors different from those affecting the value of Blue Wave Systems stock.
 Upon
completion of the merger, Blue Wave Systems stockholders will become Motorola common stockholders. Motorola's business differs from that of Blue Wave Systems, and Motorola's results of operations, as
well as the price of Motorola common stock, may be
affected by factors different from those affecting Blue Wave Systems' results of operations and the value of Blue Wave Systems stock. For a discussion of Motorola's business and certain factors to
consider in connection with its business, see Motorola's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 and Motorola's Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2001, each of which is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus.

THE BLUE WAVE SYSTEMS SPECIAL MEETING    

    We are furnishing this proxy statement/prospectus to Blue Wave Systems stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies from Blue Wave Systems
stockholders for use at the special meeting of Blue Wave Systems stockholders to be held on [            ], 2001 and at any adjournment or postponement of the meeting. We
are also furnishing this proxy statement/prospectus to Blue Wave Systems stockholders as a prospectus in connection with the issuance by Motorola of shares of Motorola stock in the merger. 

Date, Time and Place  

    The special meeting will be held on [            ], [            ], 2001, at
[      ] a.m. local time, at [            ]. 

Matters to be Considered at the Special Meeting  

    At the special meeting of Blue Wave Systems stockholders, and any adjournment of the special meeting, Blue Wave Systems stockholders will be asked: 


to
consider and vote upon a proposal to approve and adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Motorola, Earth Acquisition Corporation and Blue
Wave Systems, dated as of February 20, 2001, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Agreement and Plan of Merger on April 24, 2001, the merger under which Blue Wave Systems will become
a wholly owned subsidiary of Motorola and the amendment of the Blue Wave Systems stock option plan to provide for the conversion of each option that is outstanding under the plan into an option to
purchase Motorola common stock; and


to
consider and transact such other matters which may properly come before the special meeting or any and all adjournments thereof. 

Board of Directors Recommendation  

    The Blue Wave Systems board of directors has approved the merger agreement and the merger and recommends a vote "FOR" approval of the merger agreement and the
merger. 

Record Date  

    The Blue Wave Systems board of directors fixed the close of business on May 25, 2001 as the record date for the special meeting. Accordingly, only stockholders
of record of Blue Wave Systems stock at the close of business on May 25, 2001 are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. 

Quorum  

    The presence at the special meeting, either in person or by proxy, of a majority of the Blue Wave Systems shares issued and outstanding on the record date is
necessary to constitute a quorum to transact business at that meeting. 

    Abstentions
and broker "non-votes" count as present for establishing a quorum. Shares held by Blue Wave Systems in its treasury do not count toward a quorum. 

    A
broker "non-vote" occurs on an item when a broker is not permitted to vote on that item without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and no instructions
are given. We expect, in the event that a quorum is not present at the Blue Wave Systems special meeting, that the meeting will be adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies. 

Stockholders Entitled to Vote  

    At the close of business on the record date, May 25, 2001, there were [      ] shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote held by [      ] stockholders of record. 

At the close of business on the record date, there were no shares of Blue Wave Systems preferred stock outstanding. 

    The
holders of Blue Wave Systems common stock are entitled to cast one vote for each share of common stock they hold on each matter submitted to the common stockholders for a vote at
the special meeting. 

Vote Required  

    Approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Blue Wave Systems shares
outstanding on the record date voting as a single class. 

    Failure
to vote and abstentions will not be deemed to be cast either "FOR" or "AGAINST" the merger agreement and the merger. However, because approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and the merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Blue Wave Systems shares, the failure to vote and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
"AGAINST" the merger agreement and the merger. Shares held by a broker, bank or other fiduciary which are not voted because the customer has not provided instructions to the broker, bank or other
fiduciary will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger agreement and the merger. 

Voting Agreement  

    On February 20, 2001, each of the directors and executive officers of Blue Wave Systems entered into a voting agreement, under which, among other
things, they agreed to vote their shares of Blue Wave Systems stock "FOR" approval of the merger agreement and the merger. A copy of the voting agreement is attached as Appendix D to this proxy
statement/prospectus. Each of these directors and executive officers of Blue Wave Systems has also granted an irrevocable proxy and a power of attorney to Motorola representatives to vote his, her or
its shares of Blue Wave Systems stock "FOR" approval of the merger agreement and the merger. On the record date, the Blue Wave Systems stockholders that are parties to the voting agreement
collectively owned, on a fully-diluted basis, approximately 7.96% of the outstanding shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock. 

Proxies  

    All shares represented by properly executed proxy cards received in time for the special meeting will be voted at the special meeting in the manner specified
by the holders. 
Properly executed proxy cards that do not contain voting instructions with respect to approval of the merger agreement and the merger will be voted "FOR"
approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

    Shares
of Blue Wave Systems stock represented at the special meeting but not voting, including shares of Blue Wave Systems stock for which proxy cards have been received but for which
holders of shares have abstained, will be treated as present at the special meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of all business. 

    Only
shares affirmatively voted for approval of the merger agreement, including properly executed proxy cards that do not contain voting instructions, will be counted as favorable
votes for the merger proposal. 

    The
persons named as proxies by a stockholder may propose and vote for one or more adjournments of the special meeting, including adjournments to permit further solicitations of
proxies. No proxy voted against the proposal to approve the merger agreement and the merger will be voted in favor of any adjournment or postponement. 

Revocability of Proxies  

    You may revoke your proxy at any time prior to its use: 


by
delivering to the secretary of Blue Wave Systems at the address set forth below a signed notice of revocation or a later-dated, signed proxy card; or


by
attending the special meeting and voting in person. 

    Attendance
at the special meeting is not in itself sufficient to revoke a proxy. 

    All
written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to revocation of proxies should be addressed to Blue Wave Systems Inc., 2410 Luna Road, Carrollton,
Texas 75006. A proxy appointment will not be revoked by death or incapacity of the Blue Wave Systems stockholder executing the proxy card unless, before the shares are voted, notice of such death or
incapacity is filed with Blue Wave Systems' secretary or other person responsible for tabulating votes on Blue Wave Systems' behalf. 

Solicitation of Proxies and Expenses  

    Blue Wave Systems will pay the cost of soliciting proxies from its stockholders. In addition to solicitation by mail, Blue Wave Systems' directors, officers
and employees may solicit proxies by telephone, facsimile, e-mail, telegram or in person. Blue Wave Systems will also make arrangements with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees
and fiduciaries to send the proxy materials to beneficial owners. Upon request, we will reimburse those brokerage houses and custodians for their expenses in so doing. 

    Blue
Wave Systems has retained D.F. King & Co., Inc. to aid in the solicitation of proxies and to verify certain records relating to the solicitations. D.F. King will receive
customary fees as compensation for its services and reimbursement for its related out-of-pocket expenses. Blue Wave Systems has agreed to indemnify D.F. King against certain
liability arising out of or in connection with its engagement. 

Please do not send stock certificates with your proxy card.
 A transmittal form with instructions concerning the surrender of Blue Wave
Systems stock certificates will be mailed to you by Motorola's exchange agent promptly after completion of the merger. 

THE MERGER    

    This section of the proxy statement/prospectus, as well as the next section titled "The Merger Agreement" beginning on page 43, describes certain
aspects of the proposed merger. These sections highlight key information about the merger agreement and the merger, but they may not include all the information that a stockholder would like to or
should know. The merger agreement is attached as Appendix A to this proxy statement/prospectus, and amendment no. 1 to the merger agreement is attached as Appendix B to this proxy
statement/prospectus. We urge you to read the merger agreement, as amended, in its entirety. 

Structure of the Merger  

    If the merger is adopted by the holders of a majority of the outstanding common shares of Blue Wave Systems and the other conditions to the merger are
satisfied, Earth Acquisition Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Motorola formed for the purpose of the merger, will merge with and into Blue Wave Systems, with Blue Wave Systems being the
surviving corporation in the merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Motorola. 

Background  

    The Motorola Computer Group and Blue Wave Systems are actively involved in providing discrete portions of a telecommunications platform to leading
telecommunication original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). For the past several years, Blue Wave Systems has been a participant in the Motorola Computer Group's Partners Program, whose purpose is to
address a growing need expressed by the OEMs for more complete and integrated solutions. As a result, collaboration between Blue Wave Systems and the Motorola Computer Group has been extensive.
More recently, the OEMs have expressed an interest in outsourcing whole platforms to vendors who can provide robust, function-rich, high-availability systems rather than
just discrete portions or loosely-integrated modules. Many suppliers in this market have recognized this opportunity. 

    Representatives
from the Motorola Computer Group and Blue Wave Systems began exploring on a preliminary basis the merits of a business partnership on several occasions during 1999 and
2000. As these discussions became more detailed, a mutual non-disclosure agreement was executed by Motorola and Blue Wave Systems in September 1999 to facilitate further discussions
regarding a joint business relationship between the parties. As the year 2000 progressed, it became increasingly clear to the
management teams of both the Motorola Computer Group and Blue Wave Systems that, as independent suppliers, they would become increasingly marginal participants in a growing market. 

    In
August 2000, the Motorola Computer Group presented its strategy for addressing the OEM opportunity to a panel of senior Motorola officers and received approval to further
explore an acquisition of Blue Wave Systems. In early October 2000, executives from Motorola and Blue Wave Systems met in Loughborough, England to discuss the desirability of a business
combination. In mid-October 2000, Motorola requested a period of exclusivity from Blue Wave Systems during which it could conduct a due diligence investigation of Blue Wave Systems'
operations. At that time, Blue Wave Systems informed Motorola that it was in the process of engaging a financial advisor. 

    On
October 26, 2000, the Blue Wave Systems board of directors met to discuss: 


the
strategic necessity of a merger;


the
status of discussions with Motorola; and


the
process of determining the interest of other parties. 

    The
Blue Wave Systems board of directors concluded that further discussions with Motorola and others were in the best interests of Blue Wave Systems and its stockholders, and they
retained Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. to serve as financial advisor with respect to an acquisition transaction. 

    On
October 30, 2000, Bear Stearns informed Motorola that they would be conducting an accelerated solicitation of other potentially interested parties. Bear Stearns informed
Motorola on November 13, 2000 that Motorola would need to submit a formal acquisition bid as part of an auction process being conducted by Bear Stearns on behalf of Blue Wave Systems. On
November 16, 2000, Motorola submitted an all cash bid of $165 million, assuming exercise of all outstanding in-the-money employee stock options and retention of
all cash proceeds of these exercises by Blue Wave Systems, subject to satisfactory completion of Motorola's due diligence of Blue Wave Systems and review and approval by Motorola senior executives. At
Bear Stearns' request, a draft copy of a proposed merger agreement based on a cash tender offer was sent to Blue Wave Systems and its advisors on November 28, 2000. 

    On
December 4, 2000, at a special meeting of the Blue Wave Systems board of directors, Bear Stearns reviewed with the board of directors the companies that had expressed an
interest in a strategic relationship with Blue Wave Systems and the terms of their proposals. Motorola was discussed as a possible candidate for a business combination, and the board of directors was
again briefed on the proposal received from Motorola. The Blue Wave Systems board of directors approved further discussions with Motorola and asked to be kept informed of further developments. Blue
Wave Systems management executed a sixty-day exclusivity agreement with Motorola on December 4, 2000 in order to facilitate finalization of the terms of a transaction and to allow
Motorola to conduct due diligence and obtain internal approvals. 

    Motorola
began its due diligence activities on December 6, 2000 in the Dallas offices of Bear Stearns. In light of the continued deterioration of market value in the technology
sector, alternative structures for an eventual acquisition of Blue Wave Systems were discussed within Motorola. Subsequently, the parties discussed the possibility of a stock transaction, due in part
to the tax benefits to Blue Wave Systems stockholders which Blue Wave Systems management and advisors had expressed a desire to pursue. Ultimately, Motorola determined that it was also in its best
interests to utilize its stock as consideration for the acquisition of Blue Wave Systems. On December 20, 2000 Motorola informed Blue Wave Systems that it intended to adjust its offer to a
stock-for-stock offer of 5.7 million shares of Motorola common stock. 

    On
January 3, 2001, Bear Stearns informed Motorola that the Blue Wave Systems board of directors had not yet met to consider the revised proposal, but that initial informal
discussions suggested a lack of support. Bear Stearns indicated that Motorola should reconsider its position and improve its offer after Motorola's January 10, 2001 earnings announcement. On
January 12, 2001, Blue Wave Systems proposed that Motorola offer the greater of 6 million shares of Motorola common stock or $145 million worth of Motorola common stock. This
proposal was reviewed with Motorola senior management and on January 18, 2001, Motorola counter-proposed with 6.5 million shares, but with a floor of $135 million worth of
Motorola common stock, below which the parties could take alternative actions. Subsequent discussions led to an addition to Motorola's proposal of a maximum value of $165 million worth of
Motorola common stock. Motorola detailed this counter-offer, subject to the approval of the Motorola board of directors and finalization of a definitive merger agreement, in correspondence to Blue
Wave Systems on January 22, 2001. Motorola offered to waive its rights to exclusivity if the Blue Wave Systems board of directors was not interested in further pursuing the merger. 

    The
Blue Wave Systems board of directors approved moving forward with the Motorola counter-offer at a special meeting on January 24, 2001. At a regular meeting of the Motorola
board of directors on January 30, 2001, Motorola management briefed the board of directors on the proposed merger and the Motorola board approved the transaction, subject to satisfactory
completion of due diligence and 

finalization of a definitive merger agreement and related agreements. Motorola formally requested and received from Blue Wave Systems management a two-week extension of the exclusivity
period. 

    From
late January 2001 through the signing date of the final merger agreement on February 20, 2001, Motorola and Blue Wave Systems, together with their advisors,
continued to negotiate the terms and structure of the merger and the merger agreement, as well as the voting agreement and the stock option agreement. In addition, Motorola continued its due diligence
investigation of Blue Wave Systems. Also during this period Motorola and Blue Wave Systems began conducting conversations with a small number of Blue Wave Systems employees considered critical to the
future success of the company. The execution of contingent employment agreements by these employees with Motorola was a condition to signing the merger agreement. 

    On
February 13, 2001, a special telephonic meeting of the Blue Wave Systems board of directors was convened. Senior management of Blue Wave Systems reported on the progress of
Blue Wave Systems' negotiations with Motorola and made a presentation with respect to their recommendation that the Blue Wave Systems board of directors approve the transaction with Motorola. The Blue
Wave Systems board of directors reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed transaction with Bear Stearns. At the meeting, Bear Stearns rendered its oral opinion to the Blue Wave Systems board of
directors to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions stated in the opinion, the exchange ratio between Blue Wave Systems and Motorola was fair,
from a financial point of view, to the Blue Wave Systems stockholders. Blue Wave Systems' legal advisors reviewed for the Blue Wave Systems board of directors the terms and provisions of the merger
agreement, the voting agreement, the stock option agreement and related agreements that had been negotiated with Motorola and its advisors. In addition, Blue Wave Systems' legal counsel advised the
Blue Wave Systems board of directors with respect to their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed strategic merger. After discussion and consideration, the Blue Wave Systems board of
directors voted unanimously to approve the merger, the merger agreement, the voting agreement, the stock option agreement and all related transactions, and to recommend to the Blue Wave Systems
stockholders that they adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. From February 13, 2001 through February 20, 2001, Motorola continued to negotiate the contingent offer
agreements with certain employees of Blue Wave Systems. 

    The
merger agreement, the voting agreement and the stock option agreement were executed during the evening of February 20, 2001. On February 21, 2001, before the opening
of trading on NASDAQ, Blue Wave Systems and Motorola issued a joint press release to announce the proposed merger, and later in the morning conducted joint conference calls open to all interested
parties. 

    Subsequent
to the announcement, stock prices in general and technology stock prices in particular declined. From the date of announcement of the initial merger to April 4,
2001, the trading price for Motorola's common stock declined from $18.25 to $14.05 per share, or 23%. The trading price for Blue Wave Systems' common stock also declined from $7.94 to $5.50, or
approximately 31%, during the same period. Market capitalization for a peer group for Blue Wave Systems declined 44% during the same period. As a result of the significant change in market valuations
for both companies and their peer groups, several informal discussions were held during March 2001 to discuss whether and how to proceed with the merger. Both parties considered: 


the
near-term likelihood of Motorola's common stock trading at a level that would place the merger consideration in a range above the floor
originally set forth in the merger agreement;


whether
a closing would occur at certain levels below the floor merger value;


the
possibility of Motorola issuing additional shares;


the
parties lowering the applicable floor on market value for the merger; and


the
overall volatility for technology stocks in the current environment. 

    On
April 4, 2001, the Blue Wave Systems and Motorola management teams and their advisors met in Northbrook, Illinois to discuss the framework for a revised merger proposal.
During that meeting, the parties discussed amending the current merger agreement such that Motorola would add 750,000 shares of its common stock to the merger consideration, resulting in a total of
approximately 7,250,000 shares to be issued by Motorola in connection with the merger, subject to approval from the Blue Wave Systems board of directors and Motorola senior management. In addition,
the parties discussed removing any upper or lower value limitations and adjustments. As a result, the exchange ratio would be fixed at 0.443. 

    On
April 11, 2001, the Blue Wave Systems board of directors held a special telephonic meeting to consider the proposals negotiated by the company representatives at the meeting
in Northbrook. Blue Wave Systems' representatives and Bear Stearns discussed the negotiations and the possible alternatives to a merger with Motorola, including the lack of any other current
candidates to become a strategic partner with Blue Wave Systems. Bear Stearns discussed the general outlook for technology companies and provided information regarding peer group companies similar to
Blue Wave Systems and Motorola. The board also discussed the uncertainty in the stock market and the possibility of future performance issues that may affect Motorola, in light of the removal of any
floor on the value of the merger. The board also considered the likelihood of future improved performance of Motorola and the benefits that the merger may provide under those circumstances. After
discussion and consideration, the Blue Wave Systems board of directors voted unanimously to approve the proposed increase in the number of shares to be received, but requested that Bear Stearns and
Blue Wave Systems' management attempt to impose a floor on the value of the transaction. 

    From
April 11, 2001 through April 20, 2001, Motorola and Blue Wave Systems continued discussions regarding the merits of a floor on the transaction value in light of
on-going market volatility. The parties ultimately concluded that the increase of 750,000 shares was sufficient additional consideration in lieu of a transaction value floor given current
market conditions. 

    On
April 23, 2001, a special telephonic meeting of the Blue Wave Systems board of directors was convened. A quorum of the board of directors was present, but
Messrs. Forrest and Davis, both of whom were unavailable due to international travel, were not in attendance. Senior management of Blue Wave Systems and Bear Stearns discussed the proposed
changes to the agreements, the changes in the stock market environment, and the results of their due diligence review of Motorola. Bear Stearns updated its due diligence and market assessment and
accordingly rendered its oral opinion to the Blue Wave Systems board of directors to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions stated in the opinion,
the exchange ratio provided for in the proposed amendment to the merger agreement between Blue Wave Systems and Motorola was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Blue Wave Systems
stockholders. Blue Wave Systems' legal advisors reviewed for the Blue Wave Systems board of directors the terms and provisions of the amendment to the merger agreement and the amendment to the stock
option agreement that had been negotiated with Motorola and its advisors. In addition, Blue Wave Systems' legal counsel again advised the Blue Wave Systems board of directors with respect to their
fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed strategic merger. After discussion and consideration, the Blue Wave Systems board of directors who attended the special meeting voted unanimously to
approve the merger, the revised merger agreement, the revised stock option agreement and all related transactions, and to recommend to the Blue Wave Systems stockholders that they adopt the merger
agreement and approve the merger. 

    The
amendment to the merger agreement and the amendment to the stock option agreement were executed after the close of business on April 24, 2001. On April 24, 2001,
after the close of trading on the NASDAQ, Blue Wave Systems and Motorola issued a joint press release to announce the revised terms to the proposed merger. 

    Based
upon the trading price of Motorola common stock on [     ] , 2001, the last full trading day for which closing prices were available at the
time of the printing of this proxy statement/ 

prospectus, the value of the merger consideration was approximately $[  ] million or $[  ] per share of Blue Wave Systems
common stock. 

Motorola's Reasons for the Merger  

    Telecommunications OEMs have historically sourced many of the individual functional portions of their product platforms from many different vendors.
This method of platform procurement required considerable supply chain and engineering resources to complete the mechanical, electronic, and software integration of these parts into a platform. These
platforms, while having a direct effect on cost and reliability of the overall systems, were not the basis of competitive advantage at the OEM level. Rather, the OEMs generally competed based
on applications, products and services which they added
above the platform functionality. This process was resource intensive and occupied a considerable percentage of the overall development time and budget. 

    Recently,
these OEMs have been increasing the focus of their own resources on value-added product and services and have increasingly looked to their supply base to provide
complete platforms which have robust functionality, are fully integrated, and have certifiable high availability. The OEMs derive two benefits from this strategic shift, namely, significant
reductions in their time-to-market with new products and cost reductions in their own organizations and those of their supply chain. 

    The
Motorola Computer Group has historically addressed this opportunity through its Partnership Program with leading suppliers of various board-level and software products. Blue Wave
Systems has been a participant in the Motorola Computer Group Partnership Program for some time and the two organizations have developed a productive working relationship. As the outsourcing trend
toward integration has accelerated, Motorola determined that the ability to meet technical, cost and time-to-market expectations of the OEMs could no longer be achieved
by a Partnership Program alone. The effect of the outsourcing on suppliers of individual board-level solutions such as Blue Wave Systems has been to marginalize their ability to participate in
significant contracts since the OEMs have reduced their involvement in direct sourcing and integration. Motorola believes that Blue Wave Systems' digital signal processing products and software
for key telecommunications applications, such as next generation wireless infrastructure and voice gateways, when combined with the Motorola Computer Group's high availability computing platforms,
will enable Motorola to offer telecommunications OEM customers with the opportunity to bring smart networks to market more quickly. The Comstruct and FACT product lines and
the engineering and research and development expertise at Blue Wave Systems make Blue Wave Systems an attractive addition to the Motorola Computer Group. 

Blue Wave Systems' Reasons for the Merger  

    Recently, the telecommunications industry has experienced a significant amount of changes throughout its various business sectors, including those in which
Blue Wave Systems operates. In addition, the most recent fiscal quarters have evidenced increasing uncertainty and risk for companies that manufacture, sell and market various telecommunications
products. Blue Wave Systems has spent a significant amount of time considering the changing market conditions resulting from the increased consolidation in order to evaluate possible strategies for
Blue Wave Systems to increase stockholder value by continuing to expand its market share, increase popular product offerings and remain viable in the increasingly competitive market. Blue Wave Systems
made the determination that in order to remain successful, its best option was to pursue a combination with one or more business partners in order to increase its competitive position and ensure its
ability to continue to provide its stockholders with appropriate returns. Without a combination with strong business partners, Blue Wave Systems believes that it will be unable to maintain its current
rate of growth and profitability, given the increased competition from larger, better funded telecommunications companies, and that this 

additional competition may increasingly take away opportunities that are more readily available to companies that have additional market share, significant capital for research and development and the
ability to provide the efficiency and convenience of integrated platforms for their business customers. In consideration of those business issues, Blue Wave Systems began the process of evaluating a
number of business combinations and partnerships during 2000. Blue Wave Systems believes that combining its operations with the Motorola Computer Group, under the Motorola umbrella of companies, is a
necessary step in order to maintain viability in the market. 

    Blue
Wave Systems believes that while OEM customers will continue to increase the rate of outsourcing for their telecommunications products, they will also demand complete integrated
platforms for such products. This has resulted in a number of mergers and acquisitions in the supplier base as suppliers increase their scale, capabilities and intellectual property. Customer demand
for integrated platforms containing Blue Wave Systems' products will make the combination of the products, experience and customer distribution capabilities of Blue Wave Systems and Motorola
attractive. Blue Wave Systems believes that the merger will enable the combined company, with its larger and more diversified portfolio of products and resources, and integrated platform offerings, to
more effectively compete in the telecommunications hardware product industry. 

    After
considerable research and examination of different options, and considering its market and current business condition, Blue Wave Systems determined that none of its other
options have greater potential benefits to stockholders than the merger nor the assurance of success that Blue Wave Systems believes exists for the merger. The benefits of the merger to stockholders
are even more significant in an industry with customers demanding complete product integration. Blue Wave Systems believes that failing to take action to achieve those benefits could ultimately impair
Blue Wave Systems' performance, since its competitors continue to increase their size and technical capabilities, making their products a more attractive option than Blue Wave Systems' products
because of the increased integration and technical sophistication offered by them. 

    Blue
Wave Systems believes that Motorola's technical scale and access to additional customers and market opportunities will increase stockholder value by rapidly broadening the
customer base available to Blue Wave Systems and allowing Blue Wave Systems to strengthen its current relationships with its OEM customers. The integration of current and future Blue Wave Systems
products into Motorola's platforms will increase accessibility, and therefore demand, for Blue Wave Systems' products to its existing OEM customers. The broad base of Motorola's customers will enable
Blue Wave Systems to increase the number and variance of its product offerings at lower marginal costs, which will increase the attractiveness of the consolidated platform that Motorola and Blue Wave
Systems offer, both to current and potential OEM customers and give Blue Wave Systems greater flexibility in pursuing variations on its existing technical offerings. Blue Wave Systems determined that
the existing partnership arrangement with Motorola has demonstrated the potential for such benefits and that, in the current environment, the benefits to stockholders from Motorola's scale and
customer access can most easily be duplicated by pursuing the merger. 

Recommendation of the Blue Wave Systems Board of Directors  

    Information and Factors Considered by the Blue Wave Systems Board.
  The Blue Wave Systems board of directors believes
that the merger will allow Blue Wave Systems to leverage Motorola's global presence and to strengthen relationships with key customers. In connection with the board of directors' approval of the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and its determination to recommend that the Blue Wave Systems stockholders approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, the Blue
Wave Systems board of directors considered the following: 


the
strategic alternatives available to Blue Wave Systems in the current industry environment, including remaining an independent company; 


the
information and presentations by management of Blue Wave Systems concerning the companies' respective businesses, assets, management, competitive
position and prospects;


the
financial condition, cash flows and results of operations of Blue Wave Systems and Motorola, on both an historical and prospective basis;


the
fact that the value, as of the effective time of the merger, of the Motorola common shares to be received by Blue Wave Systems stockholders may
increase or decrease as a result of fluctuations in the price of the Motorola common shares;


the
opinion of Bear Stearns to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the matters and limitations set forth in the
opinion, the exchange ratio was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of Blue Wave Systems shares, and the financial presentation made by Bear Stearns to the Blue Wave Systems board of
directors in connection with delivery of the opinion;


the
opportunity for Blue Wave Systems stockholders to participate, as holders of Motorola common shares, in a larger, more diversified competitive company
in the telecommunications equipment industry, including participation in the value that may be generated through the combination of the two companies;


the
absence of any other firm proposal to engage in a business combination involving Blue Wave Systems at the time of the Blue Wave Systems board of
directors meeting held to approve the merger agreement on February 20, 2001, and at the time of the Blue Wave Systems board of directors meeting held to approve the amendment to the merger
agreement on April 23, 2001, despite various contacts between third parties and Blue Wave Systems' senior management and financial advisors;


the
belief of the Blue Wave Systems board of directors, after reviewing the contacts between third parties and Blue Wave Systems with senior management and
its advisors, that the likelihood of receiving a third party acquisition proposal was fairly low;


the
ability, subject to certain specified conditions, of Blue Wave Systems to provide information to a third party which has made an unsolicited superior
acquisition proposal;


the
other terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the limited number of closing conditions which provides increased certainty that the
merger will be completed;


the
fact that the merger is intended to be a tax-free exchange to Blue Wave Systems stockholders;


the
impact of the merger on employees, including provisions of the merger agreement intended to protect employee benefits and to encourage the retention of
officers and employees;


historical
market prices and trading information with respect to the Blue Wave Systems shares and the Motorola common shares and Blue Wave Systems'
relative contribution to the combined enterprise; and


current
industry, economic and market conditions. 

    The
discussion of the information and factors considered by the Blue Wave Systems board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive. In view of the variety of material factors
considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, the Blue Wave Systems board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to, the
specific factors considered in reaching its determination. In addition, the Blue Wave Systems board of directors did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular
factor was favorable or unfavorable to Blue Wave Systems, but rather conducted an overall analysis of the factors described above. In considering these factors, individual members of the Blue Wave
Systems board of directors 

may have given different weights to different factors. The Blue Wave Systems board of directors considered all these factors as a whole, and overall considered the factors to be favorable to and to
support its determination. For a discussion of the interests of some members of the Blue Wave Systems board of directors and management of Blue Wave Systems, see "Interests of Blue Wave Systems
Directors and Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 36. 

    Recommendation of the Blue Wave Systems Board.
  For the reasons discussed above, the Blue Wave Systems board of
directors has determined that the merger is advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Blue Wave Systems and the Blue Wave Systems stockholders, has adopted the merger agreement and approved
the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and recommends that the Blue Wave Systems stockholders vote "FOR" the approval and adoption of the merger and the merger
agreement. 

Opinion of Financial Advisor to Blue Wave Systems  

    Blue Wave Systems engaged Bear Stearns as its financial advisor based on Bear Stearns' experience and expertise. Bear Stearns is an internationally recognized
investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger. Bear Stearns, as part of its investment banking business, is continuously engaged in the valuation of
businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for
corporate and other purposes. 

    At
the April 23, 2001 meeting of the Blue Wave Systems board of directors, Bear Stearns delivered its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect
that, as of the date of the opinion, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in the written opinion, the exchange ratio of one share of Blue Wave Systems common stock
for 0.443 of a share of Motorola common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of Blue Wave Systems. The written opinion that was delivered on April 23, 2001
superseded any and all opinions, written and oral, previously delivered by Bear Stearns, and any such prior opinions are and were of no further effect. 

    We
have attached as Appendix C to this proxy statement/prospectus the full text of Bear Stearns' written opinion and urge you to read the opinion in its entirety. The opinion
sets forth the assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by Bear Stearns and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the Bear Stearns
opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion which is attached as Appendix C to this proxy statement/prospectus. 

    In
reading the discussion of the fairness opinion set forth below, you should be aware that Bear Stearns' opinion: 


was
provided to the Blue Wave Systems board of directors for its sole use and benefit;


did
not address Blue Wave Systems' underlying business decision to pursue the merger, the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative
business strategies that might exist for Blue Wave Systems or the effects of any other transactions in which Blue Wave Systems might engage;


did
not constitute a recommendation to the Blue Wave Systems board of directors as to how to vote in connection with the merger; and


does
not constitute a recommendation to any Blue Wave Systems stockholder as to how to vote in connection with the merger. 

    Although
Bear Stearns evaluated the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to the stockholders of Blue Wave Systems, the exchange ratio itself was determined
by Motorola and Blue Wave Systems through arm's-length negotiations. Bear Stearns provided advice to Blue Wave 

Systems during the course of such negotiations. Except as discussed below, Blue Wave Systems did not provide specific instructions to, or place any limitations on, Bear Stearns with respect to the
procedures to be followed or factors to be considered by it in performing its analyses or providing its opinion. 

    In
arriving at its opinion, Bear Stearns, among other things: 


reviewed
the merger agreement;


reviewed
Blue Wave Systems' Annual Reports to Stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended June 30,
1998 through 2000, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended September 30, 2000 and December 31, 2000, its preliminary results for the quarter ended
March 31, 2001 and its Reports on Form 8-K for the three-year period ending on the date of the opinion;


reviewed
certain operating and financial information, including projections for the five years ended June 30, 2005, provided to Bear Stearns by Blue
Wave Systems' management relating to Blue Wave Systems' business and prospects;


met
with certain members of Blue Wave Systems' senior management to discuss Blue Wave Systems' business, operations, historical and projected financial
results and future prospects;


had
limited discussions via telephone conference with certain members of Motorola's senior management to discuss Motorola's business, operations,
historical and projected financial results and future prospects;


reviewed
Motorola's Annual Reports to Stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 1997 through
2000, its preliminary results for the quarter ending March 31, 2001 and its Reports on Form 8-K for the three year period ending on the date of the opinion;


reviewed
the historical prices, trading multiples and trading volumes of the common stock of Blue Wave Systems and Motorola;


reviewed
publicly available financial data, stock market performance data and trading multiples of companies which Bear Stearns deemed generally comparable
to Blue Wave Systems and Motorola, as appropriate;


reviewed
the terms of recent acquisitions of companies which we deemed generally comparable to Blue Wave Systems and the merger;


performed
discounted cash flow analyses based on projections for Blue Wave Systems furnished to Bear Stearns; and


conducted
such other studies, analyses, inquiries and investigations as Bear Stearns deemed appropriate. 

    In
preparing its opinion, Bear Stearns relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information reviewed by Bear
Stearns, including, without limitation, the projections provided to Bear Stearns by Blue Wave Systems. With respect to Blue Wave Systems' projected financial results, Bear Stearns assumed that they
had been reasonably
prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the senior management of Blue Wave Systems as to the expected future performance of Blue Wave Systems. Other than
as set forth above, with respect to Motorola, Bear Stearns reviewed only the publicly available business, financial and trading information as specified above, and Bear Stearns was not instructed to
review, nor did it receive, any additional materials or information. With Blue Wave Systems' consent, Bear Stearns relied upon certain estimates made by Wall Street analysts with regard to Motorola's
projected financial results. Bear Stearns did not assume any responsibility for the independent verification of any such information or of the projections provided to Bear Stearns, and 

further relied upon the assurances of the senior management of Blue Wave Systems that it was unaware of any facts that would make such information or projections provided to Bear Stearns incomplete or
misleading. 

    Bear
Stearns also assumed that the merger will (1) qualify as a tax free reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes, and (2) be consummated in a timely
manner in accordance with the terms described in the merger agreement, without any regulatory limitations, restrictions, conditions, amendments or modifications that collectively would have a material
effect on Blue Wave Systems. In arriving at its opinion, Bear Stearns did not perform or obtain any independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Blue Wave Systems or
of Motorola, nor was it furnished with any such appraisals. During the course of its engagement with Blue Wave Systems, Bear Stearns was asked by the board of directors of Blue Wave Systems to
evaluate existing indications of interest from various third parties regarding a transaction with Blue Wave Systems, and it considered the results of such evaluation in rendering its opinion. 

    In
addition, Bear Stearns did not express any opinion as to the price or range of prices at which shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock or Motorola common stock may trade
subsequent to the announcement of the merger or as to the price or range of prices at which the shares of Motorola common stock may trade subsequent to the consummation of the merger. Bear Stearns'
opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions, and the information made available to Bear Stearns, as of the date of its opinion. Bear Stearns assumed no responsibility for
updating or revising its opinion based on circumstances or events occurring after that date. 

    The
following is a summary of the material valuation and financial and comparative analyses considered by Bear Stearns in connection with the rendering of the Bear Stearns opinion.
This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses underlying the Bear Stearns opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bear Stearns
opinion. 

    In
performing its analysis, Bear Stearns made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond the control of Bear Stearns, Motorola and Blue Wave Systems. Any estimates contained in the analysis performed by Bear Stearns are not necessarily indicative of actual values
or
future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by this analysis. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or
to reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities may actually be sold. Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, Bear
Stearns' opinion was among several factors considered by the Blue Wave Systems board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and the merger. 

    Comparable Company Analysis.
  Bear Stearns compared certain financial, trading and valuation information for Blue Wave
Systems and Motorola to certain publicly available financial, trading and valuation information for selected companies, which, in Bear Stearns' judgment, were comparable to Blue Wave Systems and
Motorola, respectively, for purposes of this analysis. With respect to Blue Wave Systems, Bear Stearns analyzed the following twelve companies:

The
harmonic mean of the comparable company multiples is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the comparable company multiples. 

    Bear
Stearns noted that, for the latest twelve months and projected calendar year 2002, price to earnings multiples of Blue Wave Systems were above the harmonic mean,
and with respect to the latest twelve months, the median, for Blue Wave Systems comparable companies, while the price to earnings multiples of Motorola were below or equal to the harmonic mean and the
median for Motorola comparable companies. Bear Stearns noted that for the latest twelve months and projected calendar year 2001, multiples of the equity value to revenue of Blue Wave Systems were
above the harmonic mean, and with respect to the latest twelve months, the median for Blue Wave Systems comparable companies, while the multiples of the equity value to the latest twelve months and
projected calendar year 2001 revenue of Motorola were below the harmonic mean and the median for Motorola comparable companies. Bear Stearns also noted that the merger multiples were above the
harmonic mean and the median for Blue Wave Systems comparable companies, with the exception of the projected calendar year 2001 price to earnings multiple, and above the harmonic mean for the Motorola
comparable companies, with the exception of the projected calendar year 2001 and projected calendar year 2002 price to earnings multiple. Bear Stearns further noted that none of the Motorola and Blue
Wave Systems comparable companies are identical to Motorola or Blue Wave Systems, respectively, and that, accordingly, any analysis of comparable companies necessarily involved complex
consideration and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that would necessarily affect the relative trading value of Motorola and Blue Wave
Systems versus the companies to which Motorola and Blue Wave Systems were compared. 

    Premium Analysis.
  Bear Stearns conducted an analysis of the implied premium paid to Blue Wave Systems stockholders.
Bear Stearns noted that, based upon the closing sales prices for Blue Wave Systems common stock as of April 20, 2001 and for Motorola common stock as of April 20, 2001, the exchange
ratio of 0.443 resulted in an implied one-day premium to Blue Wave Systems stockholders equal to 9.3%. Based on the average closing prices of Blue Wave Systems common stock for the
20 trading days ending April 20, 2001, the implied premium to Blue Wave Systems stockholders was 21.0%. Based on the 52 week high price of Blue Wave Systems common stock and the 52 week
low price of Blue Wave Systems common stock, the exchange ratio of 0.443 resulted in an implied premium to Blue Wave Systems stockholders of negative 52.6% and positive 99.2%, respectively. With
respect to the closing price of the Blue Wave Systems common stock on April 20, 2001 and the average closing price of the Blue Wave Systems common stock for the 20 preceding trading days, Bear
Stearns noted that such prices reflected information relating to the transaction between Blue Wave Systems and Motorola, which had been announced to the public on February 21, 2001. The results
of Bear Stearns' premium analysis is set forth below:

    Bear
Stearns noted that the merger multiples were within the range of multiples for comparable acquisitions and were generally consistent with both the harmonic mean and median of the
comparable 

transaction multiples. Bear Stearns also noted that none of the comparable acquisitions was identical to the merger and that, accordingly, any analysis of the comparable acquisitions necessarily
involved complex consideration and judgments concerning the differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that would necessarily affect the acquisition value of Blue Wave
Systems versus the acquisition values of the companies in the comparable acquisitions. 

    Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.
  Bear Stearns performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine an indicative range
of present values of Blue Wave Systems, assuming Blue Wave Systems continued to operate as a stand-alone entity in a manner consistent with its projections. In order to calculate this range, Bear
Stearns first determined Blue Wave Systems' implied enterprise value by adding: 


The
present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows that Blue Wave Systems would generate over the five year period through fiscal year
2005 if it operated in a manner consistent with its projections; and


The
present value of Blue Wave Systems' "terminal value" at the end of fiscal year 2005. 

    Blue
Wave Systems' terminal value at the end of the projection period was calculated by applying a range of multiples of enterprise values to estimated fiscal year 2005 revenue,
EBITDA, EBIT and unlevered net income. Bear Stearns used an enterprise value to revenue multiple range of 1.0x to 2.0x, an EBITDA multiple range of 9.0x to 11.0x, an EBIT multiple range of 11.0x to
13.0x and an unlevered net income multiple range of 17.0x to 19.0x when calculating Blue Wave Systems' terminal value. The present value of the sum of the projected unlevered free cash flows and the
terminal value was calculated using a range of discount rates of 19.0% to 24.0%. This discount rate range was determined based on an estimate of Blue Wave Systems' weighted average cost of capital.
Based on this analysis, the indicative enterprise value range for Blue Wave Systems was approximately $45 million to $90 million. 

    Pro Forma Earnings Per Share Accretion Analysis.
  Bear Stearns analyzed the impact of the merger on the projected
earnings per share of Motorola for the fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003. This analysis did not assume the realization of any potential synergies and also excluded any one-time charges.
Bear Stearns concluded that Motorola's diluted earnings per share for the projected fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003, would not materially change as a result of the merger. 

    The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and involves various judgments and determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant assumptions and financial analyses
and the application of these methods to the particular circumstances involved. The opinions are therefore not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description, and taking portions of the
analyses set out above, without considering the analysis as a whole, would, in the view of Bear Stearns, create an incomplete and misleading picture of the processes underlying the analyses considered
in rendering its opinion. Bear Stearns did not form a judgment as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support
its opinion. In arriving at its
opinion, Bear Stearns considered the results of its separate analyses but did not attribute particular weight to any one analysis or factor. The analyses performed by Bear Stearns, particularly those
based on estimates and projections, are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. These
analyses were prepared solely as part of the Bear Stearns analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to the stockholders of Blue Wave Systems. 

    Under
the terms of its engagement letter with Bear Stearns, Blue Wave Systems has agreed to pay Bear Stearns 1% of the aggregate transaction value with a minimum total fee of
$1.5 million, $500,000 of which became payable to Bear Stearns upon the delivery of its first opinion to the Blue Wave Systems board of directors, and $250,000 of which became payable to Bear
Stearns upon delivery of the second opinion to the Blue Wave Systems board of directors. The remaining fee will become payable 

upon consummation of the merger. Blue Wave Systems has also agreed to indemnify Bear Stearns against certain liabilities in connection with its engagement, including certain liabilities under the
federal securities laws. 

    Bear
Stearns may provide financial advisory and financing services to the company surviving the merger and/or its affiliates and may receive fees for the rendering of these services.
In the ordinary course of its business, Bear Stearns may actively trade the securities of Blue Wave Systems and/or Motorola for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly,
Bear Stearns may at any time hold a long or short position in these securities. 

Accounting Treatment  

    We anticipate that the merger will be accounted for as a purchase business combination for financial reporting and accounting purposes, under accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price paid by Motorola for Blue Wave Systemsincluding direct costs of
the mergerwill be allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities of Blue Wave Systems based upon the fair value of Blue Wave Systems' identifiable assets and liabilities as of the
effective date of the merger and in-process research and development, with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets and liabilities and
in-process research and development reflected as goodwill. After consummating the merger, the financial condition and results of operations of Blue Wave Systems will be included, but not
separately reported, in the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Motorola. 

Effectiveness of Merger  

    The merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Delaware secretary of state, or at such later time as is stated in the
certificate of merger. The filing of a certificate of merger will occur as soon as practicable, but no later than the first business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the
completion of the merger described in the merger agreement or another date agreed to by Motorola and Blue Wave Systems. 

Interests of Blue Wave Systems Directors and Officers in the Merger  

    In considering the recommendation of the Blue Wave Systems board of directors in favor of the merger agreement and the merger, you should be aware that certain
directors and executive officers of Blue Wave Systems have interests in the merger that are different from or in addition to the interests of stockholders of Blue Wave Systems. The Blue Wave Systems
board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, along with other matters, in approving the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. These interests are
described below. These interests relate to or arise from, among other things: 


the
continued indemnification of current directors and officers of Blue Wave Systems;


the
retention of certain current officers of Blue Wave Systems as employees of Motorola following the merger;


the
ownership of stock options for Blue Wave Systems stock held by officers and directors of Blue Wave Systems; and


certain
employment agreements with officers and directors of Blue Wave Systems. 

    Indemnification Arrangements.
  The merger agreement provides that Motorola will cause Blue Wave Systems to maintain the
current provisions regarding indemnification of officers and directors currently contained in Blue Wave Systems' charter documents for a period of six years after the merger, and will indemnify such
individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against all claims, damages, costs, expenses and liabilities arising out of acts or omissions occurring prior to the merger. Motorola 

will also cause Blue Wave Systems to maintain current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance policies for a period of three years after the merger, so long as the cost of doing so
does not exceed 150% of the current amount expended by Blue Wave Systems. 

    Stock Option Plans.
  As of [      ], 2001, directors and executive officers of Blue
Wave Systems beneficially owned an aggregate of 1,131,350 shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock, including options to purchase Blue Wave Systems shares exercisable within 60 days. At the
time of the announcement of the merger, the Blue Wave Systems employee stock option plan provided that, upon a change of control, all unexercised options under that plan would expire. On
[            ], 2001, the Blue Wave Systems board of directors adopted resolutions amending the Blue Wave Systems employee stock option plan so that as a result of the
merger all outstanding options under such plan will be vested in full and converted into options for shares of Motorola stock, as contemplated in the merger agreement, subject to the holder entering
into an option conversion agreement. In approving the merger and merger agreement, stockholders of Blue Wave Systems will be approving this amendment to the employee stock option plan. Any options for
which the holder does not deliver an option conversion agreement will be terminated upon closing of the merger. In addition, the merger agreement requires that all unexercised options issued to
members of the Blue Wave Systems board of directors under the Blue Wave Systems Directors' Stock Option Plan will be terminated at the time of the merger. Those options issued to former holders of
options of Loughborough Sound Images Limited will be exercisable for shares of Motorola common stock upon closing of the merger. 

    The
following table indicates, for the five most highly compensated officers and all current executive officers and directors as a group, the number and value of options for which
exercisability will accelerate upon the merger, based upon the Blue Wave closing price on [      ], 2001.

    Employment and Severance Agreements.
  Blue Wave Systems has entered into employment agreements with
Messrs. Crosbie and Burgess, which provide for the payment of certain severance compensation if the employee terminates his employment after a change of control in Blue Wave Systems. Although
the agreements do not specifically cover a transaction such as the merger, Blue Wave Systems believes that the merger may be deemed to be a change of control by a court of law. Accordingly, each of
the foregoing officers could terminate his employment subsequent to the merger and receive his severance payments, and if Motorola terminates any of the foregoing officers after the merger, it would
be required to make the same severance payments upon such termination, if it occurs within six months of the closing of the merger. 

    In
addition to the current employment agreements, Motorola and Messrs. Burgess, Shaddock and Parslow have entered into employment agreements or offer letters that become
effective upon the closing of the merger. A summary description of those agreements is set forth below. 

    Michael Keith Burgess.
  On March 1, 2001, Motorola entered into an employment agreement with Michael Keith
Burgess effective upon completion of the merger for a term of two years, after which 

time employment with Motorola will be on an "at will" basis. The agreement provides for Mr. Burgess' appointment as the Director of Architecture for the Telecommunications Business Unit of
Motorola Computer Group, and provides for a starting annual base salary of $133,016, to be adjusted based on a scheduled salary review on July 1, 2001. The employment agreement provides that
Mr. Burgess will receive four weeks of vacation per year for the first three years of his employment with Motorola, and then in accordance with regular Motorola policies after such time. 

    Mr. Burgess'
employment agreement provides that Mr. Burgess will be granted an option to purchase 10,000 shares of Motorola common stock at an exercise price equal to
the fair market value at the time of grant, which will be within a reasonable time period after the closing of the merger. 5,000 of the options will be exercisable after two years from the date of
grant, an additional 2,500 will be exercisable after three years, and the final 2,500 will be exercisable after four years. The options will expire, to the extent not exercised, ten years after the
date of grant. The employment agreement also provides that Mr. Burgess will receive a retention bonus equal to $93,100 if he remains employed continuously with Motorola for one year from the
date of closing of the merger, and an additional $172,900 if employed continuously with Motorola for two years from the date of closing of the merger, but will not be eligible to participate in any
other types of bonus plans made available to Motorola employees for the first two years of employment. 

    If
during the two-year term of the employment agreement Mr. Burgess' employment is terminated by Motorola without "cause" or by Mr. Burgess for "good
reason," in addition to any salary owed for the number of days worked, Motorola will pay to Mr. Burgess the greater of (i) a pro rata share of the retention bonuses owed or
(ii) if in the first year, the equivalent of six months salary, and if in the second year, the equivalent of three months salary. If during the two-year term Mr. Burgess'
employment is terminated by Motorola for "cause" or by Mr. Burgess without "good reason," Motorola's obligations will be limited to any salary owed for the number of days worked. "Cause" is
defined to include Mr. Burgess' willful neglect or refusal to perform his duties in any material respect, his performance of any act or failure to act that would justify termination under
Motorola's Human Resource policies, his commission of any willful act having the effect of injuring the reputation, business or business relationships of Motorola, his commission of an act involving
moral turpitude or fraud or his conviction of a felony or other crime involving money or other property of Motorola, his performance of any act or failure to act that would constitute a felony, his
violation of federal or state securities laws, his illegal use of controlled substances, his violation of Motorola's Code of Business Conduct, or the entry of a court or governmental body which
restricts the performance by Mr. Burgess under the agreement. "Good reason" is defined to include Motorola's decision, without Mr. Burgess' consent to relocate him more than 20 miles
from Carrollton, Texas, or Motorola's material breach of the employment agreement. If during the two-year term of the employment agreement Mr. Burgess' employment is terminated by
Motorola because of Mr. Burgess' illness or incapacity, or upon his death, Motorola's obligations will be limited to any salary owed for the number of days worked and a pro rata share of the
retention bonuses owed. 

    Rob Shaddock.
  On February 19, 2001, Motorola entered into an offer letter with Rob Shaddock effective upon
completion of the merger providing for the granting of additional benefits above Mr. Shaddock's current employment agreement with Blue Wave Systems Limited. Other than as expressly varied by
the offer letter, Mr. Shaddock's current terms of employment with Blue Wave Systems Limited under such employment agreement are to continue unchanged after the closing of the merger. The offer
letter provides for Mr. Shaddock's appointment as Director of Strategy, Gateway Operations of Blue Wave Systems Limited, and provides for an annual base salary of 142,534, subject
to annual review. 

    Mr. Shaddock's
offer letter provides that Mr. Shaddock will be granted an option to purchase 25,000 shares of Motorola common stock at an exercise price equal to the
fair market value at the time of grant. 12,500 of the options will be exercisable after two years from the date of grant, an additional 6,250 will be exercisable after three years, and the final 6,250
will be exercisable after four years. The 

options will expire, to the extent not exercised, ten years after the date of grant. The employment agreement also provides that Mr. Shaddock will receive a performance and retention bonus
equal to 99,773.80 if he remains employed continuously with Blue Wave Systems or any other Motorola affiliate for one year from the date of closing of the merger, and an additional
185,294.20 if employed continuously with Blue Wave Systems or any other Motorola affiliate for two years from the date of closing of the merger, but will not be eligible to participate in
any other types of bonus plans made available to Motorola employees for the first two years of employment (although he will be entitled to
receive any bonus payments due in June or July, 2001 under the Blue Wave Systems bonus scheme in which he currently participates.) 

    If
during the first year Mr. Shaddock's employment with Motorola is terminated by Motorola without "cause" or by Mr. Shaddock in circumstances of "fault," Motorola will
pay to Mr. Shaddock a pro rata amount of the first year retention bonus. If during the second year Mr. Shaddock's employment with Motorola is terminated by Motorola without "cause" or by
Mr. Shaddock in circumstances of "fault," Motorola will pay to Mr. Shaddock a pro rata amount of the second year retention bonus. If Mr. Shaddock's employment is terminated by
Motorola for "cause" or by Mr. Shaddock in circumstances that do not constitute "fault," Mr. Shaddock will forfeit any retention bonuses not yet paid. "Cause" is defined to include
Mr. Shaddock's willful neglect or refusal to perform his duties in any material respect, his performance of any act or failure to act which would justify termination under relevant disciplinary
procedures, his failure to improve performance after written warning, his commission of any willful act having the effect of injuring the reputation, business or business relationships of Motorola,
his acts of gross misconduct, his conviction of a criminal offense (other than a motoring offense for which no custodial sentence is made), his commission of an act or omission which in the reasonable
opinion of Motorola may seriously damage the interests of Motorola, his illegal use of controlled substances, or his attempt to improperly secure any personal profit in connection with the business of
Motorola. "Fault" is defined to mean circumstances in which the employer is found by an employment tribunal or court to have acted in repudiatory breach of Mr. Shaddock's contract of
employment. 

    Kevin Parslow.
  On February 19, 2001, Motorola entered into an offer letter with Kevin Parslow effective upon
completion of the merger providing for the granting of additional benefits above Mr. Parslow's current employment agreement with Blue Wave Systems Limited. Other than as expressly varied by the
offer letter, Mr. Parslow's current terms of employment with Blue Wave Systems Limited under such employment agreement are to continue unchanged after the closing of the merger. The offer
letter provides for Mr. Parslow's appointment as Director European TBU Solutions of Blue Wave Systems Limited, and provides for an annual base salary of 113,333, subject to annual
review. 

    Mr. Parslow's
offer letter provides that Mr. Parslow will be granted an option to purchase 15,000 shares of Motorola common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair
market value at the time of grant. 7,500 of the options will be exercisable after two years from the date of grant, an additional 3,750 will be exercisable after three years, and the final 3,750 will
be exercisable after four years. The options will expire, to the extent not exercised, ten years after the date of grant. The employment agreement also provides that Mr. Parslow will receive a
performance and retention bonus equal to 79,333.10 if he remains employed continuously with Blue Wave Systems or any other Motorola affiliate for one year from the date of closing of the
merger, and an additional 147,332.90 if employed continuously with Blue Wave Systems or any other Motorola affiliate for two years from the date of closing of the merger, but will not be
eligible to participate in any other types of bonus plans made available to Motorola employees for the first two years of employment (although he will be entitled to receive any bonus payments due in
June or July, 2001 under the Blue Wave Systems bonus scheme in which he currently participates.) 

    If
during the first year Mr. Parslow's employment with Motorola is terminated by Motorola without "cause" or by Mr. Parslow in circumstances of "fault," Motorola will
pay to Mr. Parslow a pro rata amount of the first year retention bonus. If during the second year Mr. Parslow's employment with 

Motorola is terminated by Motorola without "cause" or by Mr. Parslow in circumstances of "fault," Motorola will pay to Mr. Parslow a pro rata amount of the second year retention bonus.
If Mr. Parslow's employment is terminated by Motorola for "cause" or by Mr. Parslow in circumstances that do not constitute "fault," Mr. Parslow will forfeit any retention bonuses
not yet paid. "Cause" is defined to include Mr. Parslow's willful neglect or refusal to perform his duties in any material respect, his performance of any act or failure to act which would
justify termination under relevant disciplinary procedures, his failure to improve performance after written warning, his commission of any willful act having the effect of injuring the reputation,
business or business relationships of Motorola, his acts of gross misconduct, his conviction of a criminal offense (other than a motoring offense for which no custodial sentence is made), his
commission of an act or omission which in the reasonable opinion of Motorola may seriously damage the interests of Motorola, his illegal use of controlled substances, or his attempt to improperly
secure any personal profit in connection with the business of Motorola. "Fault" is defined to mean circumstances in which the employer is found by an employment tribunal or court to have acted in
repudiatory breach of Mr. Parslow's contract of employment. 

    Each
employment agreement with Messrs. Burgess, Shaddock and Parslow contains non-compete and non-solicitation covenants for the benefit of Motorola. 

Material Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Blue Wave Systems Merger  

    In the opinion of KPMG LLP, tax advisor to Motorola, and Hallett & Perrin, P.C., tax advisor to Blue Wave Systems, the following is a summary of the
material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger to Blue Wave Systems stockholders who exchange their Blue Wave Systems common shares for Motorola common shares and, as applicable,
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Motorola common stock under the merger agreement. This discussion addresses only stockholders who hold their Blue Wave Systems common shares as a capital asset and
does not address all of the United States federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to particular stockholders in light of their individual circumstances or to stockholders who are subject
to special rules (including, without limitation, financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities or foreign currencies, foreign holders,
persons who hold their Blue Wave Systems common shares as a hedge against currency risk, a constructive sale, or conversion transaction, or holders who acquired their shares pursuant to the exercise
of an employee stock option or otherwise as compensation). The following summary is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or a court. It is based upon the Internal Revenue Code, laws,
regulations, rulings, and decisions in effect on the date hereof, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Tax consequences under state, local, and foreign laws are not
addressed. 

    THE
FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OR ANY OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
MERGER. IN ADDITION, THE DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSEQUENCES WHICH MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. BLUE WAVE SYSTEMS STOCKHOLDERS ARE STRONGLY URGED TO
CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS ON
THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES. 

    No
ruling has been, or will be, sought from the Internal Revenue Service as to the United States federal income tax consequences of the merger. It is a condition to the consummation
of the merger that Motorola receive an opinion from its special tax advisor, KPMG LLP, and that Blue Wave Systems 

receive an opinion from its counsel, Hallett & Perrin, P.C., each dated the date of the effective time of the merger, that: 


the
merger will be treated as a reorganization qualifying under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and Motorola, Earth
Acquisition Corporation and Blue Wave Systems will each be a party to the reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Internal Revenue Code;


no
gain or loss will be recognized by Motorola, Earth Acquisition Corporation and Blue Wave Systems as a result of the merger; and


no
gain or loss will be recognized by the holders of Blue Wave Systems common shares who exchange their Blue Wave Systems common shares for Motorola common
stock in the merger (except with respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional share interest). 

    Such
opinions will be conditioned on customary assumptions and representations made by Motorola, Earth Acquisition Corporation and Blue Wave Systems. An opinion of counsel is not
binding on the Internal Revenue Service or a court. As a result, neither Motorola nor Blue Wave Systems can assure you that the tax considerations and opinions contained in this discussion will not be
challenged by the Internal Revenue Service or sustained by a court if challenged by the Internal Revenue Service. 

    Based
upon the opinions that the merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code: 


Blue
Wave Systems stockholders who exchange their Blue Wave Systems shares for Motorola shares will not recognize gain or loss for United States federal
income tax purposes, except with respect to cash, if any, they receive in lieu of fractional shares of Motorola common stock;


the
aggregate tax basis of a Blue Wave Systems stockholder in the Motorola common shares received in exchange for Blue Wave Systems common shares pursuant
to the merger will be the same as such holder's aggregate tax basis in the Blue Wave Systems common shares surrendered in the merger, decreased by the amount of any tax basis allocable to any
fractional share interest for which cash is received; and


the
holding period of the Motorola common shares received in the merger by a Blue Wave Systems stockholder will include the holding period of the Blue Wave
Systems common shares surrendered in the merger. 

    Blue
Wave Systems stockholders who receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Motorola stock in the merger generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the
amount of cash received and their tax basis in Blue Wave Systems shares that is allocable to the fractional shares. The gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss. In the case of an
individual stockholder, capital gain is subject to a maximum tax rate of 20% if the individual held his or her Blue Wave Systems shares for more than one year at the effective time of the merger. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations for both individuals and corporations. 

    Blue
Wave Systems stockholders will be required to attach a statement to their tax returns for the year of the merger that contains the information listed in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.368-3(b). Such statement must include the stockholder's tax basis in the stockholder's Blue Wave Systems stock and a description of the Motorola common stock received
therefor. Blue Wave Systems stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to this statement and any other tax reporting requirements. 

Regulatory Matters  

    Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, the merger may not be consummated until notifications have been furnished to the Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the Department of 

Justice and specified waiting period requirements have been satisfied. Blue Wave Systems and Motorola each filed a pre-merger notification and report form with the FTC and the Antitrust
Division on or about May 7, 2001. In addition, Motorola filed notice filings with the competition law authorities of Germany on May 10, 2001 and Italy on
[            ]. 

    At
any time before the effective time of the merger, the FTC, the Antitrust Division or a private person or entity could seek under antitrust laws, among other things, to enjoin the
merger and, any time after the effective time of the merger, to cause Motorola to divest itself, in whole or in part, of the surviving corporation of the merger or of certain businesses conducted by
the surviving corporation. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if such a challenge is made, Motorola will prevail. 

No Appraisal Rights  

    Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, appraisal rights will be not available to Blue Wave Systems stockholders in connection with the merger. 

Federal Securities Laws Consequences  

    The issuance of the shares of Motorola common stock to Blue Wave Systems stockholders in the merger will have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933.
Upon issuance, these shares may be traded freely and without restriction by those stockholders not deemed to be "affiliates" of Blue Wave Systems as that term is defined for purposes of
Rule 145 under the Securities Act. An "affiliate" of Blue Wave Systems for this purpose is a person or entity that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is
controlled by, or is under common control with, Blue Wave Systems. Any subsequent transfer by an affiliate of Blue Wave Systems must be one permitted by the resale provisions of Rule 145 under
the Securities Act (or Rule 144 under the Securities Act, in the case of any persons who become affiliates of Motorola) or as otherwise permitted under the Securities Act. These restrictions
are expected to apply to the directors, executive officers and holders of 10% or more of the Blue Wave Systems shares (as well as to certain other related individuals or entities). 

    The
merger agreement requires Blue Wave Systems to use reasonable best efforts to cause each of its affiliates to sign a written agreement, in the form attached as an exhibit to the
merger agreement, to the effect that such person will not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the shares of Motorola common stock issued to that affiliate in the merger except under: 


an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act;


Rule 145
under the Securities Act; or


another
applicable exemption under the Securities Act. 

    This
proxy statement/prospectus does not cover resales of Motorola common stock to be received by the stockholders of Blue Wave Systems in the merger, and no person is authorized to
make any use of this proxy statement/prospectus in connection with any such resale. 

Management and Operations of Blue Wave Systems after the Merger  

    After the merger, Motorola plans to operate Blue Wave Systems as part of the Motorola Computer Group within Motorola's Integrated Electronic Systems Sector.
Motorola expects that Rob N. Shaddock, current President and CEO of Blue Wave Systems, and the other members of Blue Wave Systems' current management and Blue Wave Systems' employees will
continue their employment with the business after the merger. 

Delisting and Deregistration of Blue Wave Systems Common Stock  

    If the merger is completed, Blue Wave Systems common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act. 

THE MERGER AGREEMENT    

    The following is a summary, and is qualified in its entirety by, the terms of the merger agreement. The following does not describe all the terms of the merger
agreement. The full text of the merger agreement is attached as Appendix A to this proxy statement/prospectus, and amendment no. 1 to the merger agreement is attached as
Appendix B to this proxy statement/prospectus, and both are incorporated herein by reference. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this proxy statement/prospectus to the merger
agreement refer to the merger agreement as amended by amendment no. 1. We urge you to read the merger agreement in its entirety. 

The Merger  

    Following the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger by Blue Wave Systems stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of the other
conditions to the merger, Earth Acquisition Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Motorola, will merge into Blue Wave Systems. Blue Wave Systems will survive the merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Motorola. If all conditions to the merger are satisfied or waived, the merger will become effective at the time of the filing by the surviving corporation of a duly executed certificate
of merger with the Delaware secretary of state or at such other time as may be specified in the certificate of merger. 

    In
addition, following the merger: 


the
charter and by-laws of Earth Acquisition Corporation will become the charter and by-laws of Blue Wave Systems; and


the
directors and officers of Earth Acquisition Corporation will become the directors and officers of Blue Wave Systems. 

Treatment of Blue Wave Systems Common Stock  

    The merger agreement provides that, at the effective time of the merger, generally, each issued and outstanding share of Blue Wave Systems common stock will be
exchanged for 0.443 of a duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Motorola common stock. 

    All
shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock held in treasury by Blue Wave Systems will be cancelled without exchange. Motorola will adjust the exchange ratio to provide for any
reclassification, stock split, stock dividend, reorganization or other similar exchange with respect to Motorola or Blue Wave Systems common stock occurring before the merger. 

Treatment of Blue Wave Systems Stock Options  

    At the effective time of the merger, Motorola will assume each unexpired and unexercised option to purchase shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock under the
Blue Wave Systems Stock Option Plan and convert it into a fully vested option to purchase shares of Motorola common stock if the holder of the option signs an option conversion agreement consenting to
the terms of the conversion as described more fully below. The options to be converted are referred to in this paragraph as the "Blue Wave Systems options." The expiration date of each converted Blue
Wave Systems option will be identical to the expiration date contained in the applicable Blue Wave Systems option prior to conversion, and the converted Blue Wave Systems option will become
exercisable approximately ten business days after the effective time of the merger, but each converted Blue Wave Systems option will otherwise be subject to the terms and conditions generally
applicable to options granted under the Motorola Omnibus Incentive Plan of 2000. The number of shares of Motorola common stock to be subject to each Blue Wave Systems option assumed by Motorola will
be equal to the number of shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock subject to the Blue Wave Systems option immediately prior to the merger multiplied by 0.443, rounded down to the nearest whole share.
The exercise price per share of 

Motorola common stock issuable under each converted Blue Wave Systems option will equal the per share exercise price of the Blue Wave Systems common stock specified under the Blue Wave Systems option
divided by 0.443. Motorola will adjust the 0.443 exchange ratio to provide for any reclassification, stock split, stock dividend, reorganization or other similar exchange with respect to Motorola or
Blue Wave Systems common stock occurring before the merger. The Blue Wave Systems board of directors will take all necessary action to amend the Blue Wave Systems Stock Option Plan effective at the
effective time of the merger to provide for the conversion of the Blue Wave Systems options as described in this paragraph, and will obtain from each holder of a Blue Wave Systems option an agreement
consenting to the terms of the conversion. The current terms of the Blue Wave Systems Stock Option Plan provide that options issued under the plan will terminate at the effective time of the merger.
Therefore, any such option regarding which the holder does not execute an agreement consenting to the conversion will not be converted into an option to purchase shares of Motorola common stock. 

    At
the effective time of the merger, Motorola will assume each unexpired and unexercised option to purchase shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock that were assumed in 1998 by
Mizar, Inc. from Loughborough Sound Images Limited and convert it into an option to purchase shares of Motorola common stock subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the
option prior to the effective time of the merger. The options to be converted are referred to in this paragraph as the "Mizar options." The number of shares of Motorola common stock to be subject to
each Mizar option assumed by Motorola will be equal to the number of shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock subject to the Mizar option immediately prior to the merger multiplied by 0.443, rounded
down to the nearest whole share. The exercise price per share of Motorola common stock issuable under each converted Mizar option will equal the per share exercise price of the Blue Wave Systems
common stock specified under the Mizar option divided by 0.443. Motorola will adjust the 0.443 exchange ratio to provide for any reclassification, stock split, stock dividend, reorganization or other
similar exchange with respect to Motorola or Blue Wave Systems common stock occurring before the merger. 

    At
the effective time of the merger, each unexpired and unexercised option to purchase shares of Blue Wave Systems common stock issued under the trust deed of the Loughborough Sound
Images Employee Share Trust will be converted into an option to purchase shares of Motorola common stock subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the option prior to the
effective time of the merger. The options to be converted are referred to in this paragraph as the "Trust options." Motorola will not assume the Trust options, but rather the Trust options will
continue to be administered after the effective time of the merger by the trustee of the Employee Share Trust and will be subject to the Motorola common stock held by the Trust after the merger. Blue
Wave Systems will obtain, prior to the effective time of the merger, written confirmation from the trustee that it will permit the Motorola common stock held by the Trust after the merger to be used
to satisfy the exercise of the converted Trust options. The number of shares of Motorola common stock to be subject to each Trust option will be equal to the number of shares of Blue Wave Systems
common stock subject to the Trust option immediately prior to the merger multiplied by 0.443, rounded down to the nearest whole share. The exercise price per share of Motorola common stock issuable
under each converted Trust option will equal the per share exercise price of the Blue Wave Systems common stock specified under the Trust option divided by 0.443. Motorola will adjust the 0.443
exchange ratio to provide for any reclassification, stock split, stock dividend, reorganization or other similar exchange with respect to Motorola or Blue Wave Systems common stock occurring before
the merger. 

    All
options to purchase Blue Wave Systems common stock under the Blue Wave Systems Directors' Stock Option Plan that are not exercised prior to the effective time of the merger will
terminate at the effective time of the merger and will not be converted into options to purchase shares of Motorola common stock. The Blue Wave Systems board of directors will take all necessary
action to 

terminate the Blue Wave Systems Directors' Stock Option Plan and the options outstanding under it effective at the effective time of the merger. 

    As
soon as practicable after the closing of the merger, Motorola will prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act
registering the shares of Motorola common stock subject to the assumed Blue Wave Systems options and Mizar options as specified above. The registration statement will be kept effective (and the
current status of the prospectus required by the SEC shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act) for so long as any assumed Blue Wave
Systems options or Mizar options remain outstanding. 

Fractional Shares  

    Motorola will not issue any fractional shares in the merger. In lieu of any fractional Motorola shares, each Blue Wave Systems stockholder who would otherwise
have been entitled to a fraction of a Motorola share under the merger agreement will be paid an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the fraction of a Motorola share that would have been issued
in the merger multiplied by the closing price of Motorola common stock on the business day immediately prior to the merger. 

Exchange of Certificates  

    Promptly after the merger, Motorola's exchange agent will mail to each holder of record of certificates that immediately prior to the merger represented
outstanding Blue Wave Systems common stock both a letter of transmittal and instructions for surrendering their Blue Wave Systems stock certificates. The letter of transmittal and instructions are for
use by each holder of record in surrendering Blue Wave Systems stock certificates in exchange for certificates representing that number of Motorola shares, and cash for any fractional shares thereof,
to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. We request that you not surrender your Blue Wave Systems stock certificates for exchange until you receive the letter of transmittal and instructions.
At and after the merger and until so surrendered, the Blue Wave Systems stock certificates will represent only the right to receive the consideration described above. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the merger with respect to Motorola shares will be paid to the holder of record of any unsurrendered Blue Wave Systems stock certificates. However, following
surrender of any such Blue Wave Systems stock certificates, the holder of record will be paid, without interest, with respect to each whole share of Motorola common stock which such person is entitled
to receive in the merger, (1) the amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the merger but a payment prior to surrender of such Blue Wave Systems stock
certificates and (2) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or distributions with a record date after the merger but prior to surrender of such Blue Wave Systems stock
certificates and a payment after the surrender of such Blue Wave stock certificates. No transfers of Blue Wave Systems shares shall be made after the merger. 

    If
any Blue Wave Systems stock certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, a Blue Wave Systems stockholder must provide an appropriate affidavit of that fact. Motorola may require a
Blue Wave Systems stockholder to deliver a bond as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Motorola with respect to any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate. 

Listing of Motorola Common Stock  

    Motorola has agreed to prepare and submit to the New York Stock Exchange a listing application covering the shares of Motorola common stock to be issued in the
merger and to use reasonable best efforts to cause such shares to be approved for listing on such exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the effective time of the merger.

Systems and its subsidiaries have agreed to conduct its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and to use its reasonable best efforts to keep available the services of its
current officers and employees and to preserve its current relationships with customers, key technology suppliers and others having significant business relations as is reasonably necessary in order
to preserve substantially intact its business organization. Blue Wave Systems has agreed that prior to the effective time of the merger it will not, in general terms, do any of the following without

plan, severance plan, benefit arrangement, or similar plan or arrangement, or amend, terminate or change the terms of such plans or agreements or any funding policies or assumptions for any such plan
or arrangement in existence if such amendment, termination or change would have the effect of enhancing any benefits thereunder or increasing the cost thereof to Blue Wave Systems or any of its

take
any action to render inapplicable, or exempt any third party from, any takeover statute; or

    No Solicitation.
  The merger agreement provides that Blue Wave Systems and its subsidiaries will not, directly or
indirectly, authorize or permit any of its representatives or affiliates to encourage, solicit, initiate or facilitate any acquisition proposal from a third party, enter into any agreement with
respect to any acquisition proposal, participate in any discussion or negotiation regarding any acquisition proposal or furnish information to any person to facilitate any inquiries or the making of
any proposal that could constitute an acquisition proposal. Blue Wave Systems will as promptly as practicable advise Motorola of its receipt of and of the terms of any acquisition proposal and
inquiries with respect to any acquisition proposal. 

    An acquisition proposal means any inquiry, offer or proposal concerning any: 


direct
or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business of Blue Wave Systems or any of its subsidiaries, that constitutes 15% or more of the consolidated
net revenues, net income or assets of Blue Wave Systems and its subsidiaries;


direct
or indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or more of any class of equity securities of Blue Wave Systems or any of its subsidiaries whose business
constitutes 15% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets of Blue Wave Systems and its subsidiaries;


tender
offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more of the capital stock of Blue Wave Systems; or


merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Blue Wave Systems or any of its
subsidiaries whose business constitutes 15% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets of Blue Wave Systems and its subsidiaries. 

    However,
if, at any time prior to the approval of the merger by Blue Wave Systems stockholders, the Blue Wave Systems board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that it is necessary to do so to discharge properly its fiduciary duties to its stockholders, Blue Wave Systems may, in response to an unsolicited superior proposal and subject
to such party's compliance with the notification requirements as described in the next paragraph: 


furnish
information with respect to Blue Wave Systems and its subsidiaries to the person making the superior proposal pursuant to a customary
confidentiality and standstill agreement; and


participate
in discussions with respect to this superior proposal. 

    The
merger agreement provides that Blue Wave Systems will immediately communicate to Motorola any inquiry received by it relating to any potential acquisition proposal and the
material terms of any proposal or inquiry, including the identity of the person and its affiliates making the same, that it may receive in respect of the proposed transaction, or of any such
information requested from it or of any such negotiations or discussions being sought to be initiated with it. Blue Wave Systems will keep Motorola fully informed on a timely, ongoing basis with
respect to any developments with respect to the foregoing. 

    A
superior proposal means a bona fide written offer made by a third party to acquire all of the Blue Wave Systems common stock outstanding or substantially all the assets of Blue Wave
Systems which Blue Wave Systems, its subsidiaries, representatives or other affiliates did not solicit and which, in the good faith judgment of the Blue Wave Systems board of directors, taking into
account, to the extent deemed appropriate by the Blue Wave Systems board of directors, the various legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal, if
accepted, is reasonably likely to be completed, and, if completed, is materially more favorable to the Blue Wave Systems stockholdersin their capacity as stockholdersfrom a
financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. 

    The
merger agreement further provides that neither the Blue Wave Systems board of directors nor any committee thereof shall: 


withdraw
or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Motorola, the approval or recommendation by the Blue Wave Systems
board of directors or such committee of the adoption and approval of the merger and the matters to be considered at the Blue Wave Systems special meeting; or


other
than the merger, approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any acquisition proposal. 

    However,
nothing contained in this non-solicitation covenant will prohibit Blue Wave Systems (1) from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Securities Exchange Act, or (2) in the event that a superior proposal is made, from withdrawing or modifying its approval or
recommendation of the merger no earlier than five business days following notice to Motorola of its intention to do so, so long as Blue Wave Systems continues to comply with all other provisions of
the merger agreement. 

    The
merger agreement further provides that, as of February 20, 2001, Blue Wave Systems will cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions or
negotiations with any parties with respect to an acquisition proposal. 

    Proxy Statement and Registration Statement.
  Motorola has agreed to, as promptly as practicable, prepare and file with
the SEC the registration statement on Form S-4, of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the Motorola
common stock to be issued upon conversion of the Blue Wave Systems shares. 

    Stockholders' Meeting.
  Blue Wave Systems has agreed to call and hold a meeting of its stockholders relating to the
required stockholder approval of the merger as promptly as possible and to use its best efforts to hold such meeting as soon as practicable after the Motorola registration statement, of which this
proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, becomes effective. 

Indemnification of Directors and Officers  

    Motorola has agreed that it: 


will
cause Blue Wave Systems to maintain, for at least six years, the charter and by-law provisions of Blue Wave Systems as of
February 20, 2001 regarding indemnification of current or former officers and directors of Blue Wave Systems; and


will
cause Blue Wave Systems to maintain, for at least three years, a policy of officers' and directors' liability insurance covering such indemnified
parties for acts and omissions on or before the effective time of the merger at least as favorable to the indemnified parties as the Blue Wave Systems policy in place on February 20, 2001,
subject to a cap on the cost of the policy of 150% of the cost of the last premium Blue Wave Systems paid under the policy in place on February 20, 2001. 

    Appropriate Action; Consents and Filings.
  The merger agreement provides that Blue Wave Systems, Motorola and Earth
Acquisition Corporation will: 


use
their reasonable best efforts promptly to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or appropriate to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as soon as practicable; and


promptly
make all necessary filings with respect to the merger agreement and the merger required under applicable law, and cooperate in the preparation of
such filings. 

    Plan of Reorganization.
  Each of Motorola, Earth Acquisition Corporation and Blue Wave Systems has agreed to use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the merger to qualify, and will not knowingly take any action or cause any action to be taken that could reasonably be expected to prevent the merger from qualifying,
as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code.

to Blue Wave Systems, based upon facts, representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion which are consistent with the state of facts at the effective time of the merger, to the effect that
for federal income tax purposes (1) the merger will be treated as a reorganization qualifying under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code, and Motorola, Earth Acquisition
Corporation and Blue Wave Systems will each be a party to the reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, (2) no gain or loss will be recognized by
Motorola, Earth Acquisition Corporation and Blue Wave Systems as a result of the merger, and (3) no gain or loss will be recognized by the holders of Blue Wave Systems common shares who
exchange their Blue Wave Systems common shares for Motorola common stock in the merger (except with respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional share interest), dated the date of the effective
time of the merger; and


Blue
Wave Systems must have received a comfort letter from KPMG LLP, Motorola's independent public accountants, on the closing date of the merger. 

    Each
of these conditions is waivable by Motorola or Blue Wave Systems, as the case may be, to the extent legally permissible. 

Termination  

    The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time of the merger, whether before or after approval of the merger agreement and the
merger by the Blue Wave Systems stockholders, in any of the following ways, including by mutual written consent of Motorola and Blue Wave Systems: 

    Motorola or Blue Wave Systems Termination Provisions.
  Either Motorola or Blue Wave Systems can terminate the merger
agreement if any of the following occurs: 


there
has been a breach or failure to perform by the other company of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the
merger agreement or any of its representations and warranties becomes untrue and such breach has not been cured or is incapable of being cured within 30 days following receipt by such company
of written notice of its breach;


any
decree, judgment, order or other action by any court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental entity preventing or prohibiting the completion of
the merger is in effect and becomes final and nonappealable, so long as the party seeking termination is not in breach of its obligation to use its reasonable best efforts to take appropriate action,
obtain the necessary consents and make all necessary filings in connection with the merger agreement and the merger; or


the
merger has not been completed before December 31, 2001. 

    Motorola Termination Provisions.
  Motorola can terminate the merger agreement if any of the following occurs: 


Blue
Wave Systems' board of directors or any committee thereof withdraws or modifies in a manner adverse to Motorola its approval or recommendation of the
merger;


Blue
Wave Systems fails to include in this proxy statement/prospectus the recommendation of the board of directors of Blue Wave Systems in favor of the
merger and the merger agreement;


Blue
Wave Systems' board of directors or any committee thereof recommends any alternative acquisition proposal to Blue Wave Systems' stockholders;


Blue
Wave Systems or any of its officers or directors enters into discussions or negotiations in violation of its obligation to refrain from solicitation
of any alternative acquisition proposal, unless such violation is inadvertent or unintentional and does not adversely affect the consummation of the merger;


Blue
Wave Systems enters into an agreement to consummate an acquisition transaction with a party other than Motorola or Earth Acquisition Corporation;


Blue
Wave Systems' board of directors or any committee thereof resolves to do any of the foregoing; or


any
acquisition transaction with a party other than Motorola or Earth Acquisition Corporation is consummated. 

    Effect of Termination.
  The merger agreement provides that no termination of the merger agreement will release any party
of any liabilities under the merger agreement for any breaches of the merger agreement prior to the termination or intentional or knowing misrepresentations made in the merger agreement. If the merger
agreement is terminated because of certain prohibited conduct by Blue Wave Systems, Blue Wave Systems may have to pay a termination fee to Motorola equal to 3.9% of the amount calculated by
multiplying 7,250,000 by the average daily closing price of Motorola 

common stock for the 20-day period ending on the date on which the merger agreement was terminated, as well as Motorola's out-of-pocket costs and expenses in
connection with the merger agreement, as described under "Termination Fee" immediately below. 

Termination Fee  

    Blue Wave Systems has agreed to pay Motorola a termination fee, plus all of Motorola's out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection
with the merger agreement, if: 


the
merger agreement is terminated by Motorola as described above in "Termination-Motorola Termination Provisions"; or


following
the announcement by any third person of its intention to make an acquisition proposal for Blue Wave Systems, Motorola or Blue Wave Systems
terminates the merger agreement due to the merger not being consummated by December 31, 2001 or due to the failure of the Blue Wave Systems stockholders to approve the merger and, within twelve
months following the termination, Blue Wave Systems enters into an acquisition transaction.


The
termination fee will be an amount equal to 3.9% of the amount calculated by multiplying 7,250,000 by the average daily closing price of Motorola common
stock for the 20-day period ending on the date on which the merger agreement was terminated. 

Fees and Expenses  

    Whether or not the merger is completed, each of Motorola and Blue Wave Systems will pay its own fees, expenses and disbursements incurred by it in connection
with the negotiation and preparation of the merger agreement and its performance and compliance thereunder. Motorola, however, will be solely responsible for certain filing fees and costs in
connection with the registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, and federal antitrust law filings. 

Amendment  

    The merger agreement may be amended, either before or after the stockholders of Blue Wave Systems vote on the merger, by an instrument in writing signed by the
parties and upon approval of the parties' respective board of directors. However, after the stockholders of Blue Wave Systems approve the merger, any later amendment which by law requires stockholder
approval may only be made with such approval. 

Waiver  

    The merger agreement provides that, at any time prior to the effective time of the merger, Motorola, Earth Acquisition Corporation or Blue Wave Systems may
waive in whole or in part to the extent allowed by applicable law any conditions that are for their sole benefit. 

Stock Option Agreement  

    In connection with the merger agreement, Motorola and Blue Wave Systems entered into a stock option agreement under which Blue Wave Systems granted to Motorola
an option to purchase 19.9% of Blue Wave Systems' outstanding common stock, at a price of $7.25 per share, which is adjustable in the event of changes in the outstanding Blue Wave Systems common
stock. A copy of the stock option agreement, and amendment no. 1 to the stock option agreement, are attached as Appendix E to this proxy statement/prospectus. The option is exercisable
upon the occurrence of any of the events that would result in Blue Wave Systems having to pay a termination fee to Motorola. The purpose of the stock option agreement is to effectuate the consummation
of the merger of Motorola and Blue Wave Systems. See "Stock Option Agreement" on pages 56-57. 

Voting Agreement  

    On February 20, 2001, in connection with the merger agreement, Rob Shaddock, John Forrest, Lynn Davis, John Rynearson, Richard Thompson, Malcolm
Brownsell, Keith Burgess, Donald Crosbie and Kevin Parslow entered into a voting agreement with Motorola under which they agreed to vote all of the Blue Wave Systems shares that they will beneficially
own at the record date of the special meeting of Blue Wave Systems stockholders in favor of approval and adoption of the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement. 

    In
the voting agreement, a copy of which is attached as Appendix D to this proxy statement/prospectus, the stockholders agreed to cooperate fully with Motorola and Blue Wave
Systems in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The stockholders also agreed not to initiate, solicit or facilitate any discussions,
inquiries or proposals with any third party that constitute or may reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition of Blue Wave Systems. 

    The
voting agreement also provides that each stockholder that is a party to it will not, and will not agree to, contract to or sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of any of his, her
or its Blue Wave Systems shares, or any interest in those shares, or convertible securities, or any shares obtained upon the exercise of convertible securities, or any other securities convertible
into or exchangeable for Blue Wave Systems common stock or any voting rights with respect thereto, other than: 


in
the merger; or


with
the prior written consent of Motorola. 

    The
voting agreement is intended to bind each stockholder that is a party to it only with respect to the specific matters set forth in the voting agreement, and shall not prohibit
such stockholders from acting in accordance with their fiduciary duties as officers and/or directors of Blue Wave Systems. 

    The
voting agreement is terminable at the option of any party at any time after the earlier of: 


the
termination of the merger agreement; or


the
effective time of the merger. 

STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT    

    The following description of the stock option agreement describes the material terms of the agreement. The complete text of the stock option agreement, as
amended, is attached as Appendix E to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. We urge you to read the stock option agreement in
its entirety. 

    Concurrently
with the execution of the merger agreement, Motorola and Blue Wave Systems entered into a stock option agreement under which Blue Wave Systems granted to Motorola an
option to purchase up to 19.9% of the Blue Wave Systems common stock issued and outstanding at the time of exercise. The option has an exercise price of $7.25 per share, payable in cash. 

Exercise  

    The option becomes exercisable only under circumstances in which a termination fee is payable to Motorola under the merger agreement. See "Termination Fee" on
page 54. Motorola may only exercise the option if there are no governmental restraints prohibiting the exercise of the option and any prior notification or approval of any governmental entity
has been made or obtained. 

    Motorola
may no longer exercise its option after the earlier to occur of: 


the
effective time of the merger; or


the
first anniversary of the date on which the event giving rise to Blue Wave Systems' obligation to pay a termination fee to Motorola occurs. 

    If
Motorola's option becomes exercisable, Motorola may, as to all or part of the option shares subject to the option, elect to request Blue Wave Systems to repurchase the option, in
whole or in part. To the extent Motorola elects to receive a cash payment in lieu of option shares, Motorola's right to purchase such option shares will terminate. The cash to be paid to Motorola
would be equal to the spread multiplied by such number of option shares as Motorola specifies in its election. 

    The
spread is the excess over the exercise price of the greater of: 


the
highest price per share of Blue Wave Systems common stock paid or proposed to be paid by any person or entity in connection with an acquisition
proposal; or


the
average of the closing prices of Blue Wave Systems common stock for the ten days preceding the notice of the election to receive cash. 

Maximum Amount Realizable by Motorola  

    Notwithstanding any other provision of the stock option agreement or the merger agreement, the total profitas defined belowthat
Motorola is permitted to receive will not exceed the termination fee payable to Motorola under the merger agreement. If the total profit of Motorola would otherwise exceed this amount, Motorola may,
at its sole election: 


reduce
the number of shares of common stock subject to the option;


pay
cash to Blue Wave Systems or refund in cash all or a portion, as appropriate, of the termination fee previously paid under the merger agreement;


upon
return of the purchase price paid by Motorola for such option shares, deliver to Blue Wave Systems for cancellation option shares previously acquired;


waive
payment of any portion of the termination fee payable under the merger agreement; or


any
combination of the above, 

so
that Motorola's actually realized total profit does not exceed the termination fee payable to Motorola under the merger agreement after taking into account the foregoing actions. 

    Total
profit means the aggregate amount, before taxes, of the following: 


the
amount received by Motorola as a result of Blue Wave Systems' repurchase of the option and;


the
amounts received by Motorola from the sale of option shares, less Motorola's purchase price for those option shares. 

    The
stock option agreement also provides that Motorola may not exercise the option for a number of option shares that would, as of the date of exercise, result in a notional total
profitas defined belowwhich, together with any termination fee previously paid or payable would exceed the termination fee payable to Motorola under the merger agreement. For
purposes of the stock option agreement the notional total profit with respect to the option shares for which Motorola may propose to exercise the option granted to it means the total profit received
by it determined as of the date Motorola notifies Blue Wave Systems of its intent to exercise the option and assuming that the option shares, together with all other option shares previously acquired
upon exercise of the option and held by Motorola or its affiliates as of such date, were sold for cash at the closing price on the Nasdaq National Market on the preceding trading day, less customary
brokerage commissions. 

Listing and Registration Rights  

    If Motorola's option becomes exercisable, and the option shares are then listed on the Nasdaq National Market or any other securities exchange or market, at
Motorola's request, Blue Wave Systems will apply to list the option shares subject to the option on the Nasdaq National Market or such other securities exchange or market and will use reasonable best
efforts to have those shares listed as soon as practicable. If Motorola exercises the option, it will have certain registration rights, subject to the restrictions described in the stock option
agreement, with respect to the option shares for a period of two years. The registration rights allow Motorola to require that Blue Wave Systems use its reasonable best efforts to register the shares
Motorola receives by exercising its option. 

Effect of the Stock Option Agreement  

    The stock option agreement is intended to increase the likelihood that the merger will be completed in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. The
stock option agreement may have the effect of making an acquisition or other business combination involving Blue Wave Systems by or with a third party more costly because of the need in any
transaction to acquire the shares of Blue Wave Systems
common stock held under the stock option agreement. In addition, should the option granted to Motorola become exercisable, it could preclude any other party from using the pooling of interests method
in any merger or business combination transaction with Blue Wave Systems during the two-year period following the exercise of the option. 

DESCRIPTION OF MOTOROLA CAPITAL STOCK    

    The following description of Motorola's capital stock is subject to the detailed provisions of Motorola's restated certificate of incorporation, as amended,
and by-laws, as amended, and to the rights agreement described below. The following description of certain terms of the capital stock of Motorola does not purport to be complete and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the restated certificate of incorporation, the by-laws and the rights agreement, which are filed as exhibits to the registration statement. See
"Where You Can Find More Information" on page 66. 

Motorola Common Stock  

    The Motorola charter authorizes Motorola to issue up to 4.2 billion shares of Motorola common stock, par value $3.00 per share. Each Motorola share is
entitled to one vote, in person or by proxy, at any and all meetings of the Motorola stockholders on all propositions before such meetings and on all elections of directors of Motorola. The Motorola
charter does not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors. The shares of Motorola common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights, redemption provisions or sinking fund
provisions. Subject to any preferential rights of any outstanding series of Motorola preferred stock created by the Motorola board of directors from time to time, the holders of Motorola common stock
are entitled to dividends only if, when and as the dividends are declared by the Motorola board of directors and as may be permitted by law, and, upon liquidation, will be entitled to receive pro rata
all assets of Motorola available for distribution to such holders. As of [            ], 2001, approximately [      ] Motorola shares
were issued and outstanding, held by approximately [      ] holders of record. For a description of voting requirements and change of control restrictions, see
"Motorola Rights Plan" on pages 59-60 and "Comparison of Certain Rights of Common Stockholders of Motorola and Stockholders of Blue Wave Systems" on pages 61-64. 

Motorola Preferred Stock  

    Motorola is also authorized to issue up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $100 per share, from time to time in one or more series and with such
designation for each such series as determined by the Motorola board of directors. The Motorola board of directors may, without further action by the
Motorola stockholders, issue a series of Motorola preferred stock and state and fix the rights and preferences of those shares, including: 


the
voting powers, if any, of the holders of stock of such series;


the
rate per annum and the times at and conditions upon which the holders of stock of such series will be entitled to receive dividends, and whether such
dividends will be cumulative or noncumulative and, if cumulative, the terms upon which such dividends will be cumulative;


the
price or prices and the time or times at and the manner in which the stock of such series will be redeemable;


the
right to which the holders of the shares of stock of such series shall be entitled upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up of Motorola;


the
terms, if any, upon which shares of stock of such series shall be convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any stock of any other class or
classes or of any other series of the same or any other class or classes, including the price or prices or the rate or rates of conversion or exchange and the terms of adjustment, if any; and


any
other designations, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof
so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Motorola certificate of incorporation, as amended, and to the full extent now or hereafter permitted by the laws of Delaware. 

    On
November 5, 1998, the Motorola board of directors designated a series of Motorola preferred stock, Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series B (the "Motorola
Series B Preferred Stock") and authorized 250,000 shares for issuance in connection with the adoption of the Motorola rights plan. As of [            ], 2001, no
shares of Motorola preferred stock of any series were outstanding. 

Motorola Rights Plan  

    On November 5, 1998, the Motorola board of directors authorized the issuance of one preferred share purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding
Motorola share, pursuant to a Rights Agreement between Motorola and Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as Rights Agent. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from Motorola one
thirty-thousandth of a share of Motorola Series B Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $66.66 per one thirty-thousandth of a share of Motorola Series B Preferred Stock, subject to
adjustment. The Rights become exercisable on the earlier of: 


the
tenth day after a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired or obtained the right to acquire 10% or
more of the outstanding Motorola shares (thereby becoming an "Acquiring Person"); and


the
tenth business day after the commencement or public disclosure of an intention to commence a tender offer or exchange offer by a person other than an
exempt person if, upon completion of the offer, such person could become an Acquiring Person. 

    A
majority of the Motorola board of directors may elect to defer the date on which the Rights become exercisable. The Rights expire on November 20, 2008 unless earlier redeemed
or exchanged by Motorola as described below. 

    If
a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right (except those held by the Acquiring Person and its affiliates and associates) will have the right to purchase,
upon exercise, Motorola shares (or, in certain circumstances, shares of Motorola Series B Preferred Stock, common stock equivalents or cash) having a value equal to two times the exercise price
of the Right. In addition, in the event that, at the time or after a person becomes an Acquiring Person, Motorola is involved in a merger or other business combination in which (1) Motorola is
not the surviving corporation, (2) Motorola common stock is changed or exchanged, or (3) 50% or more of Motorola's consolidated assets or earning power are sold, then each Right (other
than Rights that are or were owned by the Acquiring Person and certain related persons and transferees, which will thereafter be void) will thereafter be exercisable for a number of shares of common
stock of the acquiring company having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. In addition, at any time after any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person and before any person
acquires 50% or more of the outstanding Motorola shares and before a business combination occurs, the Motorola board of directors may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by the Acquiring
Person which will have become void), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one Motorola share, or one thirty-thousandth of a share of Motorola Series B Preferred Stock (or a common stock
equivalent), per Right (subject to adjustment). 

    The
Motorola board of directors may redeem all, but not less than all, Rights at a redemption price of $.0033 per Right at any time prior to the time that a person or a group has
become an Acquiring Person. Immediately upon redemption, the right to exercise will terminate, and the only right of holders
will be to receive the redemption price. As long as the Rights are redeemable, the terms of the Rights may be amended by the Motorola board of directors in its discretion without the consent of the
Rights holders. After that time, no amendment may adversely affect the interests of the Rights holder (other than the Acquiring Person). 

    The
Rights will not prevent a takeover of Motorola. The Rights, however, may have certain antitakeover effects. The Rights may cause substantial dilution to a person or group that
attempts to 

acquire Motorola on terms not approved by the Motorola board of directors or make the acquisition of Motorola substantially more costly, unless the Motorola board of directors redeems the Rights prior
to the person becoming an Acquiring Person. The Rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the Motorola board of directors because of the board's ability to
redeem the Rights or amend the Motorola rights plan. A description of the Motorola rights plan specifying the terms of the Rights and the Motorola Series B Preferred Stock has been included in
reports filed by Motorola under the Securities Exchange Act. See "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 66. This summary description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Motorola
rights plan. 

    Each
share of Motorola common stock issued in the merger will have a corresponding Right attached to it. 

Transfer Agent; Registrar and Exchange Agent  

    Computershare Investor Services LLC is the transfer agent and registrar for the Motorola common stock. Mellon Investor Services is the exchange agent.

Systems' charter provides that if an indemnitee is successful, on the merits or otherwise, of a suit, he shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf and sets forth the

accountants, as indicated in their report with respect thereto, and are included herein in reliance upon the authority of said firm as experts in giving said report. 

LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS    

    The validity of the Motorola shares to be issued in connection with the merger is being passed upon for Motorola by Michelle M. Warner, Esq., Senior Counsel,
Motorola Corporate Law Department. As of May 14, 2001, Ms. Warner owned 1,374.3183 Motorola shares and held options to purchase an additional 35,200 Motorola shares (of which 5,076 were
exercisable). 

    Certain
of the tax consequences of the merger will be passed upon at the effective time of the merger, as a condition to the merger, by KPMG LLP, tax advisor to Motorola, and by
Hallett & Perrin, P.C., counsel to Blue Wave Systems. See "The Merger AgreementConditions to the Merger" on page 51. 

SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS    

    In
the event that we do not complete the merger, there will be an annual meeting of the Blue Wave Systems stockholders in 2001. Stockholders who intend to present proposals at the
2001 annual
meeting, and who wish to have such proposals included in the proxy statement for such meeting, must submit such proposals in writing by notice delivered or mailed by first-class United States mail,
postage prepaid, to Blue Wave Systems Inc., 2410 Luna Road, Carrollton, Texas 75006, Attention: Secretary, and such notice must be received no later than June 16, 2001. Such proposals must meet
the requirements set forth in the rules and regulations of the SEC in order to be eligible for inclusion in Blue Wave Systems' proxy statement for its 2001 annual meeting. 

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS    

    This proxy statement/prospectus includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of
the Securities Exchange Act. Such statements are identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases including, but not limited to, "intended," "will be positioned," "expects," "expected,"
"anticipates," and "anticipated." These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of Motorola or Blue Wave Systems, as the case may be. All statements other than statements of
historical facts included in this proxy statement/prospectus, including those regarding the financial position, results of operations, cash flows, business strategy, projected costs, growth
opportunities for existing products, benefits from new technology and plans and objectives of management for future operations of Motorola or Blue Wave Systems, as the case may be, are forward-looking
statements. Although Motorola or Blue Wave Systems believes that the expectations of Motorola or Blue Wave Systems, as the case may be, reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable,
there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, the actual results of Motorola and Blue Wave
Systems, as the case may be, could differ materially. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations of Motorola or Blue Wave Systems, as the case may be
("Cautionary Statements"), are disclosed under "Risk Factors Relating to the 

Merger," "Reasons for the Merger," and elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus and in the SEC filings by Motorola and Blue Wave Systems listed on pages 67-68. These forward-looking
statements represent the judgment of Motorola or Blue Wave Systems, as the case may be, as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements
attributable to Motorola or Blue Wave Systems or persons acting on behalf of Motorola or Blue Wave Systems are expressly qualified in their entirety by the Cautionary Statements. Motorola and Blue
Wave Systems disclaim, however, any intent or obligation to update their respective forward-looking statements.

each Converted Blue Wave Option will be the exercise price of the option before conversion, divided by the Exchange Ratio, and the expiration date of each Converted Blue Wave Option will be identical
to the expiration date contained in the Blue Wave Employee Option prior to conversion. Each Converted Blue Wave Option will be fully vested from and after the Effective Time, and will be exercisable
approximately ten (10) business days after the Effective Time, but will be subject to the terms regarding ability, time and conditions of exercise after termination due to death, disability,
retirement, cause or other reasons; manner of exercise; the effect of a change in control; transferability; and other terms and conditions of the option as are generally applicable to options granted
under the Motorola Omnibus Incentive Plan of 2000. The Company affirms that, because the plan amendment will not apply to an option that is not subject to an agreement consenting to the terms of
conversion described above, any Blue Wave Employee Option regarding which the holder does not sign such an agreement will, in accordance with the terms of the Blue Wave Systems Inc. Stock
Option Plan, terminate at the Effective Time and be of no further force and effect. The Company will prepare the necessary agreements consenting to the terms of the conversion described in this 

Section 4.1(e)(i)

; 

provided
, 
however
, such agreements shall be subject to Parent's approval. The Company will be
responsible for seeing that the agreements consenting to the terms of the conversion are distributed and signed by Blue Wave Employee Option holders, and that copies of the signed agreements are
received by Parent prior to the Effective Time. 

    (ii) Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors will adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions necessary (including obtaining the
written consent of any option holder as contemplated by 
Section 7.3(i) hereof
) to terminate the Blue Wave Systems Inc. Directors'
Stock Option Plan effective at the Effective Time, so that all options under the Blue Wave Systems Inc. Directors' Stock Option Plan that are not exercised prior to the Effective Time will
terminate effective at the Effective Time. 

    (iii) Each
option assumed by Mizar, Inc. from Loughborough Sound Images Limited in connection with the transactions contemplated by that certain share purchase
agreement dated November 17, 1997 between Mizar, Inc. and Loughborough Sound Images Limited, as amended by that certain letter agreement dated March 24, 1998 (the
"
LSI Options
"), and each option issued pursuant to the Trust Deed of the LSI Employee Share Trust (the "
Eagle Trust
Options
") will be converted into an option to purchase Parent Shares, according to the terms described in the remainder of this 

Section 4.1(e)(iii)
. From and after the
Effective Time, each LSI Option or Eagle Trust Option will entitle its holder to purchase a number of
Parent Shares equal to the number of Company Shares that were subject to the option before conversion, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and rounded down to the next whole number. The
per-share exercise price of the LSI Option or Eagle Trust Option after conversion will equal the option's per-share exercise price before conversion, divided by the Exchange
Ratio. 

    (iv) Any
other plan, program, agreement or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any
Affiliate will terminate as of the Effective Time, and no individual will have any rights under any such plan, program, agreement or arrangement. 

    (f)  
Reservation of Parent Shares.
 Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient
number of Parent Shares for delivery upon exercise of any Converted Blue Wave Options or LSI Options in accordance with 
Section 4.1(e)
. As soon
as practicable after the Closing Date, to the extent required to effect registration of the Parent Shares subject to each Converted Blue Wave Option or LSI Option, Parent shall file a
registration statement, or an amendment to an existing registration statement, under the Securities Act on Form S-8 (or other successor form) with respect to the Parent Shares
subject to such Converted Blue Wave Options or LSI Options and shall use its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration 

A4

statement for so long as such Converted Blue Wave Options or LSI Options remain outstanding. In addition, Parent will cause such shares to be listed on the NYSE. 

    (g) 
Certain Adjustments.
 If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Company Shares
or Parent Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or
exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other securities shall be declared with a record date within such period, or any similar event shall have occurred, (i) the
Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event, and (ii) any
references to the Parent Market Price relating to a party's termination rights hereunder shall also be approximately adjusted. 

    4.2
  Payment for Shares in the Merger.
  The manner of making payment for Shares in the Merger shall be as
follows: 

    (a) 
Exchange Agent.
 On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company having net
capital of not less than $300,000,000 or a wholly-owned subsidiary thereof to act as exchange agent hereunder for the purposes of exchanging Certificates for Company Shares (the
"
Exchange Agent
"). At or prior to the Effective Date, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company
Shares, a sufficient number of certificates representing the Parent Shares required to effect the delivery of the aggregate consideration in Parent Shares and cash for the fractional Parent Shares
required to be delivered pursuant to 
Sections 4.1
 and 
4.3
 (the certificates representing the Parent
Shares comprising the Merger Consideration being referred to hereinafter as the "
Stock Merger Exchange Fund
"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration out of the Stock Merger Exchange Fund and the Fractional Securities Fund. The Stock Merger Exchange Fund and the Fractional Securities Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose than as set forth herein. 

    (b) 
Exchange Procedures.
 Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of outstanding Company Shares (i) a form of letter of transmittal, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Parties and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates for payment therefor. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and any other documents as may be required by the Exchange Act, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange for each of the Company Shares represented
by the Certificates held of record by such holder one (1) or more Parent Shares (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of Parent Shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to 
Section 4.1(a)
 and
(2) a check in the amount equal to the cash that such holder has the right to receive in lieu of any fractional Parent Shares pursuant to 
Sections
4.1
 and 
4.3.
 No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to 
Sections
4.1
 and 
4.3.
 The Certificates so surrendered pursuant to this 

Section 4.2(b)
 shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered,
 such Certificates shall represent solely the right to receive the Merger
Consideration allocable to such Certificates. 

    (c) 
Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.
 No dividends or other distributions that are declared or made with
respect to Parent Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the Parent Shares that such holder
would be entitled to receive by reason of the Merger upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional Parent Shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to 

Sections 4.1

and 
4.3
 until such holder shall surrender such Certificate. Subject 

A5

to the effect of applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of Parent Shares issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly
after the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional Parent Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to 
Sections
4.1
 and 
4.3
 and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
prior to the time of such surrender with respect to such whole Parent Shares, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such Parent Shares. Any dividends or other distributions that are payable with
respect to Parent Shares deliverable upon surrender of unexchanged Certificates shall be deposited by Parent in the Stock Merger Exchange Fund. 

    (d) 
Transfers of Ownership.
 If any certificate representing Parent Shares is to be issued in a name other than that in
which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates for such Parent Shares in
a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

    (e) 
No Liability.
 Neither the Exchange Agent nor any of the Parties shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares for
any Parent Shares or dividends thereon, or, in accordance with 
Sections 4.1
 and 
4.3
, cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Shares, delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of
ownership with respect to the Parent Shares held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such
Parent Shares for the account of the Persons entitled thereto. 

    (f)  
Termination of Funds.
 Subject to applicable law, any portion of the Stock Merger Exchange Fund and the Fractional
Securities Fund which remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or as otherwise directed by Parent, and any
former stockholder of the Company shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their applicable claim for the Merger Consideration for their Company Shares. Any such portion of the Stock Merger
Exchange Fund and the Fractional Securities Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Shares five years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction thereover) shall, to the extent permitted by law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

    (g) 
No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares.
 All Parent Shares issued and cash paid upon conversion of Company
Shares in accordance with the terms of this 
Article IV
 (including any cash paid pursuant to 
Sections
4.1
 and 
4.3
) shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Shares. 

    4.3
  Cash For Fractional Parent Shares.
  No certificates or scrip or shares of Parent Shares representing
fractional Parent Shares or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of Parent Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Company Shares exchanged pursuant
to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional Parent Share (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, a cash 

A6

payment (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the fractional interest of a Parent Share to which such holder otherwise would have been entitled multiplied by
(ii) the closing price of a Parent Share on the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape on the trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time (the cash comprising such aggregate payments in lieu
of fractional Parent Shares being hereinafter referred to as the "
Fractional Securities Fund
"). 

    4.4
  Transfer of Shares after the Effective Time.
  No transfers of Company Shares shall be made on the
stock transfer books of the Company after the close of business on the day prior to the date of the Effective Time. 

    4.5
  Investment of the Stock Merger Exchange Fund and Fractional Securities Fund.
  The Exchange Agent
shall invest any cash included in the Stock Merger Exchange Fund and the Fractional Securities Fund in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investor Services or Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively, in each case with maturities not exceeding seven days; provided,
that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to Company stockholders pursuant to 
Article IV
 and the other provisions
of this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to Parent. 

    4.6
  Lost Certificates.
  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation (or Parent, as applicable), the posting by such Person
of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation (or Parent, as applicable) may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Company Shares formerly represented thereby and unpaid
dividends
and distributions on Parent Shares deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

    4.7
  Further Assurances.
  At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, as applicable, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger. 

    4.8
  Affiliates.
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, no certificates representing Parent Shares or cash shall be delivered to a Person who may be deemed a Company Affiliate in accordance with 

Section 6.9
 hereof until such Person has executed and
delivered a Company Affiliate Agreement to Parent.

    (ii) Each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction (including any foreign country) in
which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or

    (iii) The
Company has heretofore furnished or made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or the equivalent
organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries listed on

amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement or of the Closing Date, then on the date of such filing), did not, and any Company SEC Reports filed with the SEC subsequent to
the date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated (or incorporated by reference) therein or necessary to make the

incorporated by reference into, the Company SEC Reports present or will present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of
the respective dates or for the respective periods set forth therein, all in conformity with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved except as otherwise noted therein, and subject, in

Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (as in effect on the dates on which such Company SEC Reports were filed). 

    (ii) Except
as set forth in the Company SEC Reports filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, and except for liabilities and obligations
incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business since September 30, 2000 (none of which has had or could be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company), the Company does not have any undisclosed liabilities or obligations of any nature required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company or which have had or
are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. 

    (iii) The
Company has delivered to Parent a complete and correct copy of any amendments or modifications, which have not yet been filed with the SEC, to all agreements,
documents or other instruments which previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act.

A11

order to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) in the case of the Proxy Statement, and at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement, at the time of the Company Stockholder
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event with respect to the Company, its officers and directors or any of its Subsidiaries should
occur which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement or the S-4 Registration Statement, the Company shall promptly inform Parent, such event

    (h) 
Events Subsequent to Most Recent Fiscal Period End.
 Since June 30, 2000 (the "
Most
Recent Fiscal Period End
") to the date hereof, there has not been any Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,

Schedule 5.1(h)

  No Solicitation.

    (a) The
Company shall immediately cease and terminate any existing solicitation, initiation, encouragement, activity, discussion or negotiation with any Persons
conducted heretofore by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives with respect to any proposed, potential or contemplated Acquisition Proposal. 

    (b) From
and after the date hereof, without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company will not, will not authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause all of its and their respective officers, directors, employees, financial advisors, agents or representatives (each a
"
Representative
") not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information) or take any other action
to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal which constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal from any
Person (a "
Third Party
"), or engage in any discussion or negotiations relating thereto or accept any Acquisition Proposal. 

    (c) Notwithstanding
the provisions of paragraph (b) above, (i) the Company may, in response to an unsolicited written offer or proposal with respect to a
potential or proposed Acquisition Proposal engage in negotiations or discussions with, or provide information or data to, any Third Party relating to any Acquisition Proposal if (i) the
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and (ii) the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company, that such action is
required to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Any information furnished to any Third Party in connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal shall be provided pursuant to a
confidentiality and standstill agreement on customary terms (including prohibitions on unsolicited tender offers, acquisitions of equity interests in the Company, proposals to acquire stock or assets,
formation of Section 13(d) groups, public requests for release from the standstill, actions that would require the Company to make a public announcement and engaging in proxy contests). Subject

is made, or any information is requested by any Third Party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or which could lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (y) immediately notify Parent of all

Party, including immediately reporting any changes to the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including with such notice any documentation relating to such Acquisition Proposal. 

    (d) In
the event the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that any Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (i) the Company shall
promptly notify Parent thereof and (ii) for a period of five business days after delivery of such notice, the Company and its Representatives, if requested by Parent, shall negotiate in good
faith with Parent to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with the Merger on such adjusted terms. After such five business day
period, the Board of Directors of the Company may then (and only then) withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement and recommend such Superior Proposal. 

    (e) The
Company agrees not to release any Third Party from, or waive any provision of, any standstill agreement to which it is a party or any confidentiality agreement
between it and another Person who has made, or who may reasonably be considered likely to make, an Acquisition Proposal or who the Company or any of its Representatives have had discussions with
regarding a proposed, potential or contemplated Company Acquisition Transaction unless the Company's Board of Directors shall conclude, in good faith, that such action will lead to a Superior Proposal 

A36

and that, after receiving advice from outside legal counsel to the Company, such action is required for the Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. 

    (f)  For
purposes of this Agreement: 

     (i) "
Acquisition Proposal
" shall mean, with respect to the Company, any 
bona
fide
 inquiry, proposal or offer from any Third Party relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, that constitutes 15% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (B) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or
more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 15% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 15% or more of the capital stock of the Company, or (D) merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 15% or more of the
consolidated net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. 

    (ii) Each
of the transactions referred to in clauses (A) through (D) of the definition of Acquisition Proposal, other than any such transaction to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, is referred to herein as a "
Company Acquisition Transaction
." 

    (iii) "
Superior Proposal
" means any 
bona fide
 written offer made by a
Third Party to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, all of the Common Shares then outstanding or all or substantially all the assets of the Company
(i) on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and taking into
account all the terms and conditions of the offer deemed relevant by such Board of Directors, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to consummation, and
the ability of the party making such proposal to obtain financing for such offer) are materially more favorable from a financial point of view to its stockholders than the Merger; and (ii) that
constitutes a transaction that, in such Board of Directors' judgment, is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms set forth, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal. 

    (g) Except
as expressly permitted by 
Section 6.2(d)
, neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors of this
Agreement or the Merger or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or Company Acquisition Transaction. Nothing contained in this

Section 6.2(d)
, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall recommend and shall declare advisable such approval (the "
Company Stockholder Approval
"). Unless the Board of Directors of the Company has
withdrawn its recommendation of this Agreement in compliance herewith, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval and adoption
of this Agreement and the Merger and to secure the vote or consent of stockholders required by the DGCL and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws to approve and adopt this Agreement and the
Merger. 

A37

  Parent will, as promptly as practicable, prepare and file
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (the "
S-4 Registration Statement
"), containing a proxy
statement/prospectus, in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the issuance of the Parent Shares upon conversion of the Company Shares and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. The Company and Parent will, as promptly as practicable, prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement that will be the same proxy statement/prospectus contained in the S-4
Registration Statement and a form of proxy, in connection with the vote of the Company's stockholders with respect to the Merger (such proxy statement/prospectus, together with any amendments thereof
or supplements thereto, in each case in the form or forms mailed to the Company's stockholders, is herein called the "

securities laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in the Merger. 

    6.5
  Listing Application.
  Parent shall as soon as practicable prepare and submit to the NYSE a listing
application with respect to the Parent Shares issuable in the Merger, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to the Effective Time, approval for the listing of such Parent Shares
on such exchange, subject to official notice of issuance. 

    6.6
  Access to Information.
  Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) afford to officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives of Parent (the "
Authorized Representatives
")
reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties, assets, books and records and, during such period, shall (and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to such Authorized Representatives all information concerning their business, properties, assets and personnel as may reasonably be requested for purposes of
appropriate and necessary due diligence, provided that no investigation pursuant to this 
Section 6.6
 shall affect or be deemed to modify any of
the representations or warranties made by the Company. The Company acknowledges that Parent may request full and complete access and cooperation of the Company and its personnel for additional due
diligence with
regards to Direct Contracts and Subcontracts of the Company, and agrees to provide any support and to take any actions reasonably requested by Parent in this regard. Parent agrees to treat (and cause
its Authorized Representatives to treat) any and all information provided pursuant to this 
Section 6.6
 in strict compliance with the terms of
that certain Non-Disclosure Agreement, entered by and between the Company and Parent, dated September 22, 1999 (the "
Non-Disclosure
Agreement
"). 

    6.7
  Publicity.
  The Parties agree that they will consult with each other concerning any proposed press
release or public announcement pertaining to this Agreement or the Merger in order to agree upon the text of any such press release or the making of such public announcement, which agreement shall not
be unreasonably withheld, except as may be required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with a national securities exchange or national automated quotation system, in
which case the Party proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with Parent or the Company, as applicable,
before issuing any such press release or making any such public announcement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Board of Directors of the Company withdraws its recommendation of this
Agreement in compliance herewith, neither Party will be required 

A38

to consult with or obtain the agreement of the other in connection with any press release or public announcement. 

    6.8
  Indemnification of Directors and Officers.
  Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect
(i) for a period of six years after the Effective Time, the current provisions regarding indemnification of current or former officers and directors (each an
"
Indemnified Party
") contained in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and in any agreements between an Indemnified Party and the
Company, provided that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim or claims shall continue until final
disposition of any and all such claims; and (ii) for a period of three years, the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained
by the Company (provided that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least substantially the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in
the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured and provided that such substitution shall not result in any gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time)
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time. Parent shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums to the extent such premiums exceed 150% of the
annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (such 150% amount, the "
Maximum Premium
"). If such insurance coverage
cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directors' and officers' insurance
obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. The Company represents that the Maximum Premium is $35,000. This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives. 

    6.9
  Affiliates.
  Not less than 45 days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a letter identifying all persons who may be deemed at the time this Agreement is submitted for adoption by the stockholders of the Company, "affiliates" of the Company for purposes of
Rule 145 under the Securities Act ("
Company Affiliates
"), and such list shall be updated as necessary to reflect changes from the date thereof.
The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each Person identified on such list to deliver to Parent not less than 30 days prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit C hereto (a "
Company Affiliate Agreement
").

the Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses when due pursuant to this

this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which Parent is entitled to receive the Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses, the payment of such
Termination Fee and Parent Expenses shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent, except in the event of (x) a willful breach by the Company of any provision of this Agreement, or
(y) the intentional or knowing misrepresentation in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in which event Parent shall have all rights, powers and remedies
against the Company which may be available at law or in equity. All rights, powers and remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be
