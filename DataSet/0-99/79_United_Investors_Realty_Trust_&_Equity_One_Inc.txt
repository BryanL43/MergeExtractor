                 MERGERS PROPOSED - YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

                                                                   July __, 2001

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:

         The board of trust managers of United Investors Realty Trust, or UIRT,
has approved two mergers that would result in the reorganization of UIRT and the
acquisition of UIRT by Equity One, Inc.

         In connection with the mergers, for each of your UIRT common shares,
you may elect to receive either $7.30 in cash or a number of shares of Equity
One common stock valued at $7.30, subject to proration and the limitations
described below. The value of the Equity One common stock for purposes of the
mergers will be equal to the weighted average trading price of Equity One's
common stock for the 20 trading day period ending on the day immediately prior
to the closing date of the mergers. However, for each common share of UIRT, the
number of shares of Equity One common stock to be issued will not be greater
than 0.646, unless otherwise agreed by Equity One, or less than 0.584. Included
with this proxy statement/prospectus is a form of election by which you may
elect to receive cash or Equity One common stock. Complete and return your form
of election as directed by the enclosed instructions. If you fail to make a
timely election for your UIRT common shares, you will be deemed to have elected
to receive cash.

         In connection with the mergers, you may not receive all of your merger
consideration in the form that you elect. In no event will cash be paid for more
than 50% of the UIRT common shares, and the merger consideration that is not
paid in cash will be paid in shares of Equity One common stock. Accordingly, if
a cash election is made, or is deemed to be made, for more than 50% of the UIRT
common shares, then the actual amount of cash to be paid for such cash elections
would be proportionately reduced, and the remainder of the merger consideration
that is not paid in cash would be paid in Equity One common stock. In addition,
if elections to receive Equity One common stock are made for more than 50% of
the UIRT common shares, then the actual number of shares of Equity One common
stock to be issued may be proportionately reduced, at the election of Equity
One. If such an election is made by Equity One, the remainder of the merger
consideration that is not paid in Equity One common stock would be paid in cash.

         At a special meeting of UIRT's shareholders, you will be asked to
approve and adopt the merger agreements and the mergers which would result in
the reorganization of UIRT and the acquisition of UIRT by Equity One.

         AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, THE BOARD OF TRUST MANAGERS OF UIRT HAS
UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENTS AND THE MERGERS AND UNANIMOUSLY
RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS OF UIRT VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE
MERGER AGREEMENTS AND THE MERGERS.

         We cannot complete the mergers unless they are approved by the holders
of two-thirds of the outstanding common shares of UIRT entitled to vote at the
special meeting. THEREFORE, YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. Whether or not you plan
to attend the special meeting, please take the time to vote by completing and
mailing the enclosed proxy card to us. If you sign, date and mail your proxy
card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be counted as a
vote in favor of the mergers. If you fail to return your proxy card, the effect
will be a vote against the mergers unless you attend the special meeting and
vote in person for the mergers.

         The date, time and place of the special meeting is as follows:

         This proxy statement/prospectus provides you with detailed information
about the special meeting and the proposed mergers. You can also get information
from publicly available documents filed by UIRT and Equity One with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ THIS ENTIRE
DOCUMENT CAREFULLY, INCLUDING THE SECTION ENTITLED "RISK FACTORS" BEGINNING ON
PAGE 14.

                                    By order of the UIRT board of trust managers

                                    Chairman of the Board

         Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities
regulators have approved or disapproved of the shares of common stock to be
issued in the mergers or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this proxy
statement/prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

         This document is also the prospectus of Equity One for the shares that
it will issue in connection with the mergers. Equity One shares are traded on
the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "EQY." On July __, 2001, the last
full trading day for which information was available prior to the printing of
this proxy statement/prospectus, the closing sales price for Equity One shares,
as reported in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL's New York Stock Exchange Composite
Transactions Report, was $_____ per share.

         This proxy statement/prospectus is dated July __, 2001, and is first
being mailed to shareholders on or about July __, 2001.

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGERS

Q:   WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING?

A:   At the special meeting, shareholders will vote to adopt and approve the
     merger agreements and the mergers which would result in the reorganization
     of UIRT and the acquisition of UIRT by Equity One.

Q:   WHY IS UIRT SEEKING TO MERGE WITH EQUITY ONE?

A:   The UIRT board believes that a merger with Equity One would benefit UIRT
     shareholders because the value of the merger consideration represents a
     premium over the pre-announcement trading price of UIRT shares; the merger
     permits shareholders to elect to receive cash or common stock of Equity
     One; the portfolio of the combined companies will provide UIRT shareholders
     with a more stable earnings stream and increased prospects for dividend
     payments; and operating synergies may be created because a majority of the
     properties of the combined company will be in the high-growth states of
     Florida and Texas. To review the reasons for the mergers in greater detail,
     see pages 27 through 29.

Q:   WHY ARE THERE TWO MERGERS?

A:   The acquisition of UIRT by Equity One will be accomplished upon the
     completion of two separate and distinct mergers. The first merger will
     effect a reorganization of UIRT by which UIRT will be merged with and into
     UIRT, L.P., one of its indirect subsidiaries which is a limited partnership
     and also a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of UIRT Holding Corp. The
     purpose of the reorganization merger is to comply with the Equity One
     merger agreement which requires that UIRT contribute the real properties
     owned directly by it to a subsidiary and thereby minimize Equity One's
     exposure to the liabilities that may be associated with those properties.
     In addition, the reorganization merger is expected to reduce, under
     current law, the payment of Texas franchise tax which would otherwise
     result from the acquisition of UIRT by Equity One. The second merger will
     effect the acquisition of UIRT by Equity One.

Q:   WHAT WILL I RECEIVE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGERS?

A.   In connection with the mergers, for each of your UIRT common shares, you
     may elect to receive either $7.30 in cash or a number of shares of Equity
     One common stock valued at $7.30, subject to the proration and limitations
     described below. The value of the Equity One common stock for purposes of
     the mergers will be equal to the weighted average trading price of Equity
     One's common stock for the 20 trading day period ending on the day
     immediately prior to the closing date of the mergers. However, for UIRT
     shareholders who receive Equity One common stock, the number of shares of
     Equity One common stock to be issued per common share of UIRT will not be
     greater than 0.646, unless otherwise agreed by Equity One, or less than
     0.584.

     For a complete discussion of the payment of the merger consideration, the
     terms and conditions regarding payment and some numerical examples, see the
     section entitled "The Merger Agreements - Conversion of Shares" on page 40.

Q:   WHAT ACTIONS AM I BEING ASKED TO TAKE?

A:   First, you are being asked to approve and adopt the merger agreements and
     the mergers which will result in the reorganization of UIRT and the
     acquisition of UIRT by Equity One by completing the proxy card included
     with this proxy statement/prospectus.

     Second, separately you are being asked to make your election to receive
     cash or Equity One common stock by completing the form of election included
     with this proxy statement/prospectus. Whether you vote for or against or
     abstain from voting on the mergers, you should nevertheless complete the
     form of election.

Q:   WILL I RECEIVE THE SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF CASH OR STOCK THAT I ELECT?

A:   Not necessarily. Due to provisions in the Equity One merger agreement, you
     may not receive all of your merger consideration in the form that you
     elect. In no event will cash be paid for more than 50% of the UIRT common
     shares, and the merger consideration that is not paid in cash will be paid
     in shares of Equity One common stock. Accordingly, if a cash election is
     made (or is deemed to be made) for more than 50% of the UIRT common shares,
     then the actual amount of cash to be paid for such cash elections would be
     proportionately reduced, and the remainder of the merger consideration that
     is not paid in cash would be paid in Equity One common stock. In addition,
     if elections to receive Equity One common stock are made for more than 50%
     of the UIRT common shares, then the actual number of shares of Equity One
     common stock to be issued may be proportionately reduced, at the election
     of Equity One. If such an election is made by Equity One, the remainder of
     the merger consideration that is not paid in Equity One common stock would
     be paid in cash.

     M.G.N. (USA), Inc., a company which is an affiliate of Equity One, owns
     approximately 9.8% of UIRT common shares and has agreed to elect to receive
     all Equity One shares in connection with the mergers, which will be subject
     to the proportionate reduction described above.

                                     (iii)

     For a complete discussion of the payment of the merger consideration, the
     terms and conditions regarding payment and some numerical examples, see the
     section entitled "The Merger Agreements - Conversion of Shares" on page 40.

Q:   HOW AND WHEN DO I MAKE MY ELECTION?

A:   Written instructions and a form of election for making your election to
     receive cash or Equity One common stock are included with this proxy
     statement/prospectus. Simply complete, date and sign the form of election
     and submit it as instructed. If your shares are held in book-entry form,
     you need only submit the form of election, or follow the instructions
     provided to you by your broker.

     Your form of election must have been received by Equity One's paying agent
     by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September __, 2001, the day
     immediately preceding the date of the special meeting. You may change your
     election by completing and submitting a later dated form of election prior
     to the above deadline.

Q:   WHAT IF I FAIL TO MAKE A TIMELY ELECTION?

A:   If you fail to make a timely election, you will be deemed to have elected
     to receive cash for your UIRT common shares.

Q:   ASSUMING THAT I ELECT TO RECEIVE EQUITY ONE SHARES IN CONNECTION WITH THE
     MERGERS, WILL MY RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER CHANGE?

A:   Yes. If you elect to receive Equity One common stock in connection with the
     mergers, your rights will change because UIRT is a Texas real estate
     investment trust and both Equity One and UIRT Holding Corp. are Maryland
     corporations. The rights of shareholders and stockholders differ under the
     laws of these states. The charter documents of these companies provide for
     different rights for security holders as well. For a summary of material
     differences between the rights of UIRT shareholders and the rights of
     stockholders of Equity One and UIRT Holding Corp., see pages 50 to 65.

Q:   WHAT HAPPENS IF THE STOCK PRICE OF EQUITY ONE COMMON STOCK CHANGES BEFORE
     THE CLOSING OF THE MERGERS?

A:   With respect to any cash you may receive in the mergers, you will not be
     affected by changes in the stock price of Equity One common stock.

     However, because the number of shares of Equity One common stock to be
     issued in connection with the mergers is based on the 20 trading day
     weighted average trading price as of the day immediately prior to the
     closing date of the mergers, increases or decreases in the trading price of
     Equity One common stock during those 20 days will have an effect on the
     number of shares of Equity One common stock you may receive in the mergers.
     See "The Merger Agreements - Conversion of Shares" on page 40 for more
     complete discussion.

Q:   WILL ANY FRACTIONAL SHARES OF EQUITY ONE COMMON STOCK BE ISSUED IN THE
     MERGERS?

A:   No. If you, based on the conversion formula, would be entitled to receive a
     number of shares of Equity One common stock that is not a whole number,
     then you will receive cash in an amount representing the value of those
     fractional shares.

Q:   WHAT ARE THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATIONS?

A:   The board's recommendations are set forth, together with the description of
     that recommendation, in this proxy statement/prospectus. In summary, the
     board recommends a vote "FOR" the merger agreements and the mergers which
     will result in the reorganization of UIRT and the acquisition of UIRT by
     Equity One. Unless you give other instructions on your proxy card, the
     persons named as proxy holders on the proxy card will vote in accordance
     with the recommendations of UIRT's board of trust managers.

     With respect to any other matter that comes before the meeting, the proxy
     holders will vote as recommended by the board of trust managers or, if no
     recommendation is given, in their own discretion.

                                      (iv)

Q:   WILL THE SHAREHOLDERS OF UIRT WHO ELECT TO RECEIVE COMMON STOCK OF EQUITY
     ONE IN THE MERGERS BE ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY RESELL THEIR SHARES IN THE OPEN
     MARKET?

A:   Shares of Equity One common stock received in the mergers will be freely
     transferable by the recipients of those shares, except for shares of Equity
     One common stock received by persons who are deemed to be "affiliates," as
     such term is defined by Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, of UIRT
     at the time the merger proposal is submitted to UIRT shareholders for
     approval. Shares of Equity One common stock held by such affiliates may be
     resold by them only in compliance with Rule 145 under the Securities Act
     (or Rule 144 for persons who become affiliates of Equity One) or as
     otherwise permitted under the Securities Act.

     Generally, persons deemed to be affiliates include directors, executive
     officers and principal stockholders, and persons that control, are
     controlled by, or are under common control with UIRT or Equity One, as the
     case may be.

Q:   DO I HAVE DISSENTERS' RIGHTS?

A:   No. You are not entitled to dissenters' rights or appraisal rights under
     either the Texas Real Estate Investment Trust Act or under the charter of
     UIRT Holding Corp. See "The Mergers-- Dissenters' Rights" on page 34.

Q:   WHO IS ENTITLED TO VOTE?

A:   You are entitled to vote, in person or by proxy, at the special meeting or
     any postponement or adjournment of the special meeting if you owned common
     shares of beneficial interest of UIRT as of the close of business (5:00
     p.m., New York City time) on July __, 2001, the record date.

Q:   WHO MAY ATTEND THE MEETING?

A:   All shareholders of UIRT as of the record date, or their duly appointed
     proxies, may attend the special meeting.

Q:   WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE MERGER AGREEMENTS AND THE MERGERS?

A:   In order to approve the mergers, there must be an affirmative vote of the
     holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding common shares of
     beneficial interest of UIRT that are entitled to vote at the special
     meeting.

Q:   HOW DO I VOTE IF I AM THE RECORD OWNER OF MY SHARES?

A:   After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this
     proxy statement/prospectus, please complete and sign your proxy and return
     it in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible, so that your shares
     may be represented at the special meeting. If you sign and send in your
     proxy and do not indicate how you want to vote, we will count your proxy as
     a vote in favor of the mergers. If you do not send in your proxy and do not
     attend the special meeting, then your failure to vote will have the effect
     of a vote against the approval of the mergers.

Q:   WHAT IF I AM A RECORD OWNER AND DO NOT VOTE MY SHARES?

A:   If you are a record owner and fail to return your proxy, your shares will
     not be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at the
     special meeting and determining whether we have received the votes required
     to approve the mergers.

          o     If you return your proxy signed but do not indicate how you want
                to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote "FOR" the mergers.

          o     If you return your proxy and abstain from voting, your proxy
                will not be counted as a vote cast on, and therefore will have
                the effect of a vote against, the approval of the mergers.

Q:   IF MY BROKER OR BANK HOLDS MY SHARES IN "STREET NAME," WILL MY BROKER OR
     BANK VOTE MY SHARES?

A:   Your broker or bank will vote your shares in favor of the mergers ONLY if
     you provide them with instructions on how to vote. You should follow the
     directions provided by your broker or bank regarding how to instruct them
     to vote your shares. If you do not provide your broker or bank with
     instructions on how to vote your shares, they will not vote your shares and
     their failure to do so will have the effect of voting your shares against
     the approval of the mergers.

Q:   WHAT ARE THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE MERGERS ON ME?

A:   Whether or not you will recognize any gain or loss from the receipt of the
     merger consideration in exchange for your shares of beneficial interest

                                      (v)

     of UIRT will depend on your election of cash or common stock of Equity One
     and your individual tax situation. You are encouraged to read carefully the
     section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled "Material Federal
     Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers" beginning on page 35 and to consult
     your personal tax adviser.

Q:   HOW WILL THE MERGERS AFFECT MY DIVIDENDS?

A:   Prior to the completion of the mergers, UIRT shareholders will be entitled
     to receive any UIRT regular quarterly dividend, not to exceed $0.13 per
     share as may be authorized by UIRT's board of trust managers and, if
     necessary, a final dividend in an amount equal to the minimum amount
     necessary to maintain UIRT's REIT status under the Internal Revenue Code
     and to avoid the payment by UIRT of any corporate level tax with respect to
     undistributed income or gain, as required by the merger agreements.
     However, there is no assurance that UIRT's board will declare such a
     dividend.

     After the completion of the mergers, former holders of UIRT common shares
     will receive any distributions that may be authorized by Equity One's board
     to all holders of Equity One common stock with a record date after the
     closing.

Q:   CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE MAILED MY SIGNED PROXY?

A:   Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
     special meeting. You can do this in one of three ways. First, you can send
     a written notice stating that you would like to revoke your proxy. Second,
     you can complete and submit a new proxy. If you choose either of these two
     methods, you must submit your notice of revocation or your new proxy to us
     at the address on page __. Third, if you are a record holder, you can
     attend the special meeting and vote in person.

     If your shares are held in "street name" through an account at a brokerage
     firm or bank, you should contact your brokerage firm or bank to change your
     vote or to vote in person at the special meeting.

Q:   WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE MERGERS?

A:   We expect to complete the mergers in the fourth quarter of 2001. We are
     working to complete the mergers as quickly as possible and intend to do so
     shortly after the special meeting, provided that we have satisfied all of
     the conditions that must be met prior to the completion of the mergers.

Q:   WHO WILL PAY FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AND THE
     SOLICITATION OF PROXIES?

A:   UIRT and Equity One will pay the cost of preparing, assembling and mailing
     the proxy statement/prospectus, notice of meeting and enclosed proxy card.
     In addition to the use of mail, employees of UIRT and Equity One may
     solicit proxies personally and by telephone. These employees will receive
     no compensation for soliciting proxies other than their regular salaries.
     We may request banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and
     fiduciaries to forward copies of the proxy material to the beneficial
     owners of UIRT common shares and to request authority for the execution of
     proxies and we may reimburse such persons for their expenses incurred in
     connection with these activities. In addition, UIRT has retained
     ____________ to assist in soliciting proxies, for which services UIRT will
     pay a fee expected to be approximately $_____, plus out-of-pocket expenses.

Q:   WHO CAN HELP ANSWER MY QUESTIONS?

A:   If you have any questions about the mergers or if you need additional
     copies of this proxy statement/prospectus or the enclosed proxy, you should

THE COMPANIES

Equity One, Inc.
1696 N.E. Miami Gardens Drive
North Miami Beach, Florida 33179
(305) 947-1664

         Equity One, a Maryland corporation, is a self-administered,
self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, that principally acquires,
renovates, develops and manages community and neighborhood shopping centers
anchored by national and regional supermarket chains. As of March 31, 2001,
Equity One's portfolio consisted of 33 properties, including 24
supermarket-anchored shopping centers, one drugstore-anchored shopping center,
two other retail-anchored properties, five commercial properties and one
development site. These properties are located primarily in metropolitan areas
of Florida, and contain an aggregate of approximately 3.3 million square feet of
gross leaseable area.

United Investors Realty Trust
5847 San Felipe, Suite 850
Houston, Texas 77057
(713) 781-2860

         UIRT is a real estate investment trust formed under the laws of the
State of Texas to acquire, develop and operate neighborhood and community
shopping centers in the "Sunbelt" region of the United States. As of March 31,
2001, UIRT owned controlling interests in 24 shopping centers and a 50%
non-controlling interest in a limited partnership that owns one other project.
The 24 operating shopping centers comprised approximately 2.3 million square
feet of gross leaseable area. Upon completion of the mergers, the separate
existence of UIRT will cease and it will be succeeded by UIRT, L.P.

UIRT Holding Corp.
5847 San Felipe, Suite 850
Houston, Texas 77057
(713) 781-2860

         UIRT Holding Corp. is a Maryland corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of UIRT. UIRT Holding Corp. will conduct no business prior to the
completion of the mergers and, therefore, will have no assets or liabilities
prior to that time. The officers and directors of UIRT Holding Corp. are the
same as the officers and trust managers of UIRT. No public trading market exists
for the capital stock of UIRT Holding Corp. Upon completion of the Equity One
merger, the separate corporate existence of UIRT Holding Corp. will cease and
Equity One will be the surviving corporation.

UIRT, L.P.
5847 San Felipe, Suite 850
Houston, Texas 77057
(713) 781-2860

         UIRT, L.P. is a Florida limited partnership and is an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of UIRT Holding Corp. UIRT, L.P. will conduct no
business prior to the completion of the mergers and, therefore, will have no
assets or liabilities prior to that time. However, upon completion of the
reorganization merger, UIRT, L.P. will be the surviving entity and thereafter
will conduct UIRT's business in the same manner as was conducted by UIRT prior
to the reorganization merger.

THE SPECIAL MEETING; REQUIRED VOTE (see page 19)

         The special meeting will be held at ___________________ on September
__, 2001 at 10:00 a.m., local time. At the special meeting, holders of common
shares of beneficial interest of UIRT will be asked to vote upon a proposal to
adopt and approve the merger agreements and the mergers which will result in the
reorganization of UIRT and the acquisition of UIRT by Equity One. The
affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding common
shares of beneficial interest of UIRT entitled to vote at the special meeting is
required to approve the merger agreements and the mergers.

VOTING BY THE UIRT TRUST MANAGERS (see page 20)

         On July __, 2001, the trust managers of UIRT and their affiliates owned
and were entitled to vote approximately ______ common shares of UIRT, or
approximately ___% of the common shares of UIRT outstanding on that date.

         The trust managers of UIRT have agreed to vote their and their
affiliates' common shares of UIRT in favor of the merger agreements and the
mergers.

THE MERGERS (see page 21)

         Subject to UIRT shareholder approval, UIRT will merge with and into
UIRT, L.P., with UIRT, L.P. surviving the merger. Upon completion of the
reorganization merger, each outstanding common share of UIRT will automatically
be converted into one share of common stock of UIRT Holding Corp. Thereafter,
subject to UIRT shareholder approval and the effectiveness of the reorganization
merger, UIRT Holding Corp. will merge with and into Equity One, with Equity One
surviving the merger. Upon completion of the mergers, UIRT shareholders will
receive either cash or Equity One common stock for each common share of
beneficial interest of UIRT held by them immediately prior to the mergers.

MERGER CONSIDERATION; ELECTION OF CASH OR STOCK

         In connection with the mergers, for each of your UIRT common shares,
you may elect to receive either $7.30 in cash or a number of shares of Equity
One common stock valued at $7.30, subject to proration and the limitations
described below. The value of the Equity One common stock for purposes of the
mergers will be equal to

     the weighted average trading price of Equity One's common stock for the
     20-trading-day period ending on the day immediately prior to the closing
     date of the mergers. However, for each common share of UIRT, the number of
     shares of Equity One common stock to be issued will not be greater than
     0.646, unless otherwise agreed by Equity One, or less than 0.584. If you
     fail to make a timely election for your UIRT common shares, you will be
     deemed to have elected to receive cash.

         In connection with the mergers, you may not receive all of your merger
consideration in the form that you elect. In no event will cash be paid for more
than 50% of the UIRT common shares, and the merger consideration that is not
paid in cash will be paid in shares of Equity One common stock. Accordingly, if
a cash election is made (or is deemed to be made) for more than 50% of the UIRT
common shares, then the actual amount of cash to be paid for such cash elections
would be proportionately reduced, and the remainder of the merger consideration
that is not paid in cash would be paid in Equity One common stock. In addition,
if elections to receive Equity One common stock are made for more than 50% of
the UIRT common shares, then the actual number of shares of Equity One common
stock to be issued may be proportionately reduced, at the election of Equity
One. If such an election is made by Equity One, the remainder of the merger
consideration that is not paid in Equity One common stock would be paid in cash.

BOARD OF TRUST MANAGERS RECOMMENDATIONS (see page 29)

         The UIRT board of trust managers has unanimously approved the merger
agreements and the mergers and unanimously recommends that UIRT shareholders
vote "FOR" approval and adoption of the merger agreements and the mergers.

         To review the background and reasons for the mergers in greater detail,
as well as certain risks related to the mergers, see pages 21 through 27, 27
through 29 and 14 through 19.

FAIRNESS OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR (see page 29)

         UIRT's financial advisor, First Union Securities, Inc., has delivered a
written opinion to the UIRT board of trust managers as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the consideration to be paid by Equity One in the
mergers. First Union's written opinion, dated May 31, 2001, is attached to this
document as ANNEX C. We encourage you to read this opinion carefully in its
entirety for a description of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken.

THE MERGER AGREEMENTS (see page 40)

         THE MERGER AGREEMENTS ARE ATTACHED AS ANNEX A AND ANNEX B TO THIS PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ THESE AGREEMENTS IN THEIR
ENTIRETY. THEY ARE THE PRINCIPAL DOCUMENTS GOVERNING THE MERGERS.

CONDITIONS TO THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGERS (see page 44)

         UIRT, UIRT, L.P. and UIRT Holding Corp. will complete the
reorganization merger only if the UIRT shareholders approve and adopt the
reorganization merger agreement and the reorganization merger at the special
meeting or any adjournment or postponement of that meeting.

         In addition, Equity One, UIRT and UIRT Holding Corp. will complete the
Equity One merger only if they satisfy or, in some cases, waive, several
conditions, including the following:

     o   the reorganization merger must have been completed;

     o   the UIRT shareholders must approve the Equity One merger agreement and
         the Equity One merger;

     o   the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is
         a part must have been declared effective and must not be the subject of
         any stop order or related proceeding;

     o   no statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree or injunction
         shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by any court
         or governmental authority against Equity One or UIRT and be in effect
         that prohibits or restricts the completion of the Equity One merger or
         makes completion of the Equity One merger illegal; and

     o   other customary closing conditions.

"NO SOLICITATION" PROVISIONS (see page 45)

         The Equity One merger agreement contains provisions prohibiting UIRT
from seeking a competing acquisition transaction. These "no solicitation"
provisions prohibit UIRT and its subsidiaries, and their officers, trust
managers, directors, employees and representatives from taking actions to
solicit a competing acquisition transaction and, subject to some exceptions,
including some exceptions that permit the trust managers of UIRT to comply with
their fiduciary duties, from participating in discussions regarding or
furnishing information with respect to any competing acquisition transaction.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENTS (see page 46)

         Prior to the termination of the Equity One merger agreement, the
reorganization merger agreement may not be modified or terminated without the
written consent of Equity One.

         Equity One, UIRT and UIRT Holding Corp. can jointly agree to terminate
the Equity One merger agreement at any time before the closing date without
completing the Equity One merger. In addition, the Equity One merger agreement
may be terminated and the Equity One merger may be abandoned:

     o   by Equity One or UIRT if the Equity One merger is not completed by
         November 30, 2001;

     o   by Equity One if UIRT's or UIRT Holding Corp.'s representations and
         warranties are untrue in any material respect or if either breaches or
         fails to comply in any material respect with any of its obligations
         under the Equity One merger agreement;

     o   by UIRT if Equity One's representations and warranties are untrue in
         any material respect or if Equity One breaches or fails to comply in
         any material respect with any of its obligations under the Equity One
         merger agreement;

     o   by Equity One or UIRT if any court of competent jurisdiction in the
         United States or other governmental body shall have issued an order,
         decree or ruling, or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or
         otherwise prohibiting the Equity One merger and that order, decree,
         ruling or other action shall have become final and non-appealable;

     o   by Equity One if, prior to the approval of the UIRT shareholders, the
         board of trust managers of UIRT withdraws or modifies its favorable
         recommendation of the Equity One merger or shall have recommended a
         competing acquisition transaction with a party other than Equity One;

     o   by UIRT if, prior to the approval of the UIRT shareholders, UIRT
         receives a written offer with respect to any competing acquisition
         transaction with a party other than Equity One or if a third party has
         commenced a tender offer which, in either case, the UIRT board of trust
         managers believes in its good faith, reasonable judgment is more
         favorable to UIRT's shareholders than the Equity One merger;

     o   by Equity One or UIRT if the Equity One merger agreement and the Equity
         One merger are not approved and adopted by UIRT's shareholders at the
         special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of that meeting;

     o   by UIRT if the weighted average trading price of Equity One's common
         stock is less than $11.30 per share on the third day prior to the
         closing date and UIRT provides notice within one business day
         thereafter of its intent to terminate the merger agreement and Equity
         One does not provide notice to UIRT and elect in

         writing, within one business day following UIRT's termination notice,
         to adjust the exchange price in accordance with the merger agreement;
         or

     o   by UIRT if the weighted average trading price of Equity One's shares at
         any time prior to the completion of the Equity One merger is less than
         $9.50 per share, and UIRT provides notice within seven days of its
         intent to terminate, and, on the date of the notice, the price remains
         below $9.50 per share.

TERMINATION FEES (see page 47)

         UIRT must pay Equity One a termination fee of $2 million if the Equity
One merger agreement is terminated as a result of the following:

     o   UIRT's or UIRT Holding Corp.'s representations or warranties are untrue
         in any material respect;

     o   UIRT or UIRT Holding Corp.'s fails to comply in any material respect
         with its obligations under the Equity One merger agreement;

     o   UIRT's board of trust managers withdraws or modifies its recommendation
         of the Equity One merger in a manner adverse to Equity One;

     o   UIRT receives a proposal with respect to a competing acquisition
         transaction or a third party commences a tender offer that UIRT's board
         of trust managers believes in good faith is more favorable to UIRT
         shareholders than the Equity One merger; or

     o   UIRT's shareholders do not approve the Equity One merger, there exists
         at the time of the special meeting a proposal regarding a competing
         acquisition transaction and within twelve months following the
         termination of the Equity One merger agreement UIRT enters into a
         definitive agreement with respect to a competing acquisition
         transaction.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGERS (see page 35)

         The reorganization merger is structured to qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code, and the UIRT shareholders will
not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in connection
with the reorganization merger.

         The U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Equity One merger to
UIRT shareholders will depend on, among other things, the form of consideration
they receive in the merger of UIRT Holding Corp. into Equity One anf the fair
market value of Equity One stock on the date of the merger.  It is intended that
the Equity One merger qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of the
internal Revenue Code, but the Equity One merger may under certain circumstances
not so qualify.  If the Equity One merger does so qualify and you are a UIRT
shareholder who receives solely Equity One shares in connection with the Equity
One merger, you will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, except with respect to cash received instead of a fractional share.
If you are a UIRT shareholder who receives solely cash, you generally will
recognize gain or loss to the extent of the difference between the amount of
cash you receive and your adjusted basis in your UIRT shares.

         THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGERS TO YOU AS AN UIRT SHAREHOLDER WILL
DEPEND ON YOUR OWN SITUATION. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR PERSONAL TAX ADVISER FOR A
FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGERS TO YOU.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (see page 34)

         The mergers will be accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting with Equity One having acquired UIRT, which means the assets and
liabilities of UIRT, including its intangible assets, will be recorded on Equity
One's books at their fair market values. The results of operations and cash
flows of UIRT will be included in Equity One's financial statements
prospectively as of the closing of the mergers.

DISSENTERS RIGHTS (see page 34)

         Under the Texas Real Estate Investment Trust Act and under the charter
of UIRT Holding Corp., UIRT shareholders are not entitled to dissenters' rights
in connection with the mergers.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OF UIRT TRUST MANAGERS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE
MERGERS (see page 33)

         In determining whether to consent to the principal terms of the
mergers, you should be aware that, as described below, some UIRT trust managers
and executive officers have interests in, and will receive benefits from, the
mergers that differ from, or are in addition to, and, therefore, may conflict
with the interests of UIRT shareholders generally.

         INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE. In the Equity One merger agreement,
Equity One agreed to provide indemnification for trust managers, officers and
employees of UIRT, including for actions taken in connection with the mergers,
to the same extent as the indemnification provided by UIRT as of the date of the
Equity One merger agreement. In addition, Equity One has agreed to either
provide directors' and officers' insurance for the benefit of those individuals
either under UIRT's current insurance policy until the limits of such policy are
exhausted or under a similar policy for a period of three years after the Equity
One merger.

         FORGIVENESS OF LOANS. In connection with the exercise of options to
purchase common shares of UIRT granted at the time of UIRT's initial public
offering in 1998 pursuant to UIRT's 1997 Share Incentive Plan, several trust
managers and officers of UIRT have issued promissory notes payable to UIRT in
the aggregate outstanding amount of approximately $395,000 in order to pay the
exercise price of those options. Upon shareholder approval of the mergers,
a change of control will occur and all outstanding amounts under these loans
will be forgiven pursuant to the terms of the notes. In addition, there are
approximately 254,000 common shares of UIRT reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of additional options issued under the share incentive plan. If those
options are exercised upon the change of control, pursuant to the plan, UIRT
will loan the option holder the money to exercise the options. All amounts
outstanding under these additional loans will also be forgiven upon completion
of the mergers.

         TERMINATION OF THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH FCA CORP. Robert W.
Scharar, UIRT's chief executive officer, president and chairman of the board, is
also the president and controlling shareholder of FCA Corp, the company that
manages UIRT's real properties pursuant to an advisory agreement. In connection
with the Equity One merger agreement, notice of termination has been given under
the advisory agreement which effectively terminates the advisory agreement in
December 2001. Upon termination, FCA Corp will be paid a termination fee,
pursuant to the terms of the advisory agreement, equal to approximately
$__________.

SETTLEMENT OF THE SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LAWSUIT

         UIRT is one of several defendants, including FCA Corp and several of
UIRT's officers and trust managers, named in a shareholder derivative action
brought by Southwest Securities, Inc. The lawsuit was originally filed on August
14, 2000 in Dallas County, Texas to prevent the sale by UIRT of one its real
properties to a UIRT shareholder. In September 2000, Southwest amended its
complaint to allege, among other things, that FCA Corp had charged UIRT
excessive fees and other improper amounts and that FCA Corp had mismanaged UIRT
assets.

         In December 2000, UIRT appointed a special litigation committee to
investigate the allegations of the lawsuit. In March 2001, the special
litigation committee concluded that continuation of the litigation was not in
the best interests of UIRT or its shareholders and UIRT filed a motion with the
Dallas court to dismiss the lawsuit. Although Southwest filed motions with the
Texas Court of Appeals and the Texas Supreme Court, both courts declined to
intervene. In May 2001, the Dallas court granted UIRT's motion to dismiss all of
Southwest's claims.

         Prior to the execution of the Equity One merger agreement, Southwest
agreed with Equity One that upon the completion of the Equity One merger and
payment by Equity One of $750,000, Southwest will not appeal the order
dismissing the lawsuit and will move to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice.
Southwest may elect to be paid either in cash or shares of Equity One common
stock.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

         On May 18, 2001, Equity One announced that it had entered into a
definitive stock exchange agreement pursuant to which it will acquire all of the
outstanding shares of common stock of Centrefund Realty (U.S.) Corporation, or
CEFUS, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Centrefund Realty Corporation, or
Centrefund, a publicly traded Canadian real estate company. As of March 31,
2001, CEFUS owned 28 properties and 9 joint venture interests in Florida and

Texas, which are predominantly supermarket or other retail anchored shopping
centers. As a result of one entity owning a controlling interest in both Equity
One and Centrefund, Equity One and Centrefund are deemed to be affiliates. In
addition, certain board members of Equity One serve on the board of directors
of Centrefund, and the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of
Equity One serves as chairman of the board of centrefund.

         The acquisition will more than double Equity One's total assets to $523
million and will cost Equity One approximately $280 million, including
transaction costs, the assumption of approximately $157 million in debt and the
issuance of approximately 10.5 million shares of Equity One common stock. The
transaction is subject to the approval of the stockholders of Equity One and of
the minority shareholders of Centrefund, as well as other customary conditions.
The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2001.

         Under the terms of the stock exchange agreement, all of the outstanding
shares of CEFUS will be exchanged for 10.5 million shares of Equity One common
stock. The share exchange is structured to qualify as a tax-free transaction,
and it is a condition to closing that each party receives an acceptable tax
opinion to that effect. There is no adjustment to the share exchange in the
event of any change in the price of Equity One's common stock.

         Following the acquisition of CEFUS, without giving effect to the
acquisition of UIRT by Equity One, Centrefund will own approximately 45.2% of
Equity One's common stock on a primary basis and 42.2% on a fully diluted basis.

(1)  Base rent was lower in 1996 as a result of the conveyance of the One West
     Hills building on January 1, 1996 to Ivy Realty Trust, a privately held
     office REIT, 100% owned by UIRT and managed by the Investment Manager. All
     shares of Ivy Realty Trust were distributed to UIRT shareholders in 1995,
     1996 and 1997.

(2)  For 1997 and 1996, UIRT distributed Ivy shares to UIRT shareholders with a
     value of $0.38 and $0.40 per common share, respectively.

   UIRT HOLDING CORP. AND UIRT, L.P.

         Neither UIRT Holding Corp. nor UIRT, L.P. will conduct any business
prior to the completion of the mergers. Therefore, neither entity will have any
results from operations or any assets or liabilities that would be required to
be reported under generally accepted accounting principles.

SUMMARY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL DATA

         The following summary unaudited pro forma financial data reflect the
proposed combination of Equity One with UIRT and the proposed combination of
Equity One and UIRT with CEFUS. The unaudited pro forma combined operations data
for the year ended December 31, 2000 and the three months ended March 31, 2001
have been presented as if the transactions occurred on January 1, 2000. The
unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet information as of March 31, 2001 has
been presented as if the transactions occurred on March 31, 2001.

         The proposed combination of Equity One and UIRT is being accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting.

         The summary unaudited pro forma financial information for Equity One
and UIRT with CEFUS accounts for the proposed combination of Equity One and
CEFUS as a combination of entities under common control. Gazit-Globe (1982)
Ltd., a 63.4% stockholder of Equity One through the ownership of affiliated
entities, acquired, for accounting purposes, a 68.1% interest in Centrefund
Realty Corporation, the 100% indirect owner of CEFUS, in August 2000. The
summary unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the push-down of
Gazit-Globe's basis in CEFUS, to the extent of its 68.1% ownership. The
remaining 31.9% was recorded in a manner similar to a pooling of interests and
the basis in the assets, liabilities and results of operations of CEFUS are
reflected at their historical amounts.

         The information is only a summary and you should read it together with
Equity One's and UIRT's historical financial statements incorporated in this
proxy statement by reference, CEFUS' historical financial statements beginning
on page F-2 and Equity One's unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements included in this proxy statement beginning on page 67.

COMPARATIVE MARKET AND PER SHARE DATA

         Set forth below are net income, book value and cash dividends per
common share data for Equity One and UIRT on a historical basis, for Equity One
and UIRT on a pro forma basis and on a pro forma basis per UIRT equivalent
share.

         The pro forma data were derived by combining the historical
consolidated financial information of Equity One and UIRT using purchase
accounting.

         The UIRT equivalent per share pro forma information shows the effect of
the mergers from the perspective of an owner of UIRT common shares. The
information was computed by multiplying the Equity One per share pro forma
information by the exchange ratio of .60231 Equity One shares for 50% of the
approximately 9,143,000 fully diluted outstanding UIRT shares which represent
(i) approximately 8,561,000 outstanding common shares of beneficial interest,
(ii) approximately 254,000 UIRT common shares reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of outstanding stock options, and (iii) approximately 239,000 operating
partnership units which are convertible into UIRT common shares. The exchange
ratio is based on Equity One's stock price of $12.12 on the date of the
announcement.

         You should read the information below together with Equity One's and
UIRT's historical financial statements and related notes contained in the annual
reports and other information that both companies have filed with the SEC and
which have been incorporated by reference. The unaudited pro forma combined data
below is for illustrative purposes only. The companies might have performed
differently had they always been combined. You should not rely on this
information as being indicative of the historical results that would have been
achieved had the companies always been combined or the future results that the
combined company will experience after the mergers.

                                  RISK FACTORS

         IN CONSIDERING WHETHER TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE ADOPTION AND APPROVAL OF
THE MERGERS AND WHETHER TO ELECT TO RECEIVE CASH OR EQUITY ONE COMMON STOCK IN
CONNECTION WITH THE MERGERS, YOU SHOULD CONSIDER ALL OF THE INFORMATION INCLUDED
IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, INCLUDING THE MATTERS ADDRESSED IN "SPECIAL
NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS" ON PAGE 18. IN ADDITION, YOU SHOULD
CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS CONSIDERED BY US, BASED ON THE
INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US, TO BE MATERIAL TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MERGER
AGREEMENTS AND THE MERGERS. THESE FACTORS ARE IMPORTANT, AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN
ABLE TO QUANTIFY THEIR POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON THE COMBINED COMPANY THAT WILL
RESULT FROM THE MERGERS.

YOU MAY NOT RECEIVE THE FORM OF MERGER CONSIDERATION THAT YOU ELECT

         In connection with the mergers, you may not receive all of your merger
consideration in the form that you elect. In no event will cash be paid for more
than 50% of the UIRT common shares, and the merger consideration that is not
paid in cash will be paid in shares of Equity One common stock. Accordingly, if
a cash election is made, or is deemed to be made, for more than 50% of the UIRT
common shares, then the actual amount of cash to be paid for such cash elections
would be proportionately reduced, and the remainder of the merger consideration
that is not paid in cash would be paid in Equity One common stock. In addition,
if elections to receive Equity One common stock are made for more than 50% of
the UIRT common shares, then the actual number of shares of Equity One common
stock to be issued may be proportionately reduced, at the election of Equity
One. If such an election is made by Equity One, the remainder of the merger
consideration that is not paid in Equity One common stock would be paid in cash.

THE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION THAT UIRT SHAREHOLDERS RECEIVE MAY VARY AS A RESULT
OF STOCK-PRICE FLUCTUATIONS PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGERS

         Although UIRT shareholders will be able to elect to receive either cash
or Equity One shares, subject to proration, the opportunity to make that
election will occur prior to the time of the shareholder vote on the mergers.
The cash price to be paid per each share of UIRT common shares is fixed at
$7.30. This cash price will not be adjusted based on changes in market prices.
The value of Equity One shares delivered to former UIRT shareholders will equal
$7.30 if the weighted average trading price of an Equity One share over the 20
trading day period ending on the day immediately prior to the closing date of
the mergers is between $11.30 and $12.50. However, if the average closing price
of an Equity One share over such period is more than $12.50, then the value of
the Equity One shares delivered to UIRT shareholders will be more than $7.30 for
each UIRT common share. In addition, unless Equity One chooses to pay additional
merger consideration to prevent UIRT from terminating the Equity One merger
agreement, if the average closing price of an Equity One share over such period
is less than $11.30, then the value of the Equity One shares delivered to UIRT
shareholders will be less than $7.30 for each UIRT common share.

         There may be a time delay between the date when UIRT shareholders vote
on the mergers at the special meeting and the date of the completion of the
mergers. The market value of Equity One shares may fluctuate during that period.
These variations may be caused by changes in the businesses, operations, results
and prospects of both companies, market expectations of the likelihood that the
mergers will be completed and the timing of completion, the effect of any
conditions or restrictions imposed on or proposed with respect to the combined
company by regulatory agencies, general market and economic conditions, or other
factors.

         For example, from June 1, 2000 to May 31, 2001 the closing sales price
of an Equity One share ranged from a high of $12.53 to a low of $9.38 per
share, and the closing price of a UIRT share during the same period ranged from
a high of $6.00 to a low of $4.03 per share. On June 28, 2001, the most recent
date for which it was practicable to obtain market price data, the closing sales
price of Equity One shares was $11.50 per share, and the closing sales price of
UIRT shares was $6.50 per share, as reported in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL's New
York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions. We urge you to obtain current market
quotations for Equity One's shares. In addition, the stock market generally has
experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These market fluctuations
could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, Equity
One's shares.

         It is impossible to predict accurately the market price of Equity One
shares immediately after the effective time of the mergers and, therefore,
impossible to predict accurately the value of the stock consideration that UIRT
shareholders will receive. The value of the stock consideration may be
significantly higher or lower than the value of the cash consideration.

THE MERGERS MAY NOT QUALIFY AS A TAX-FREE REORGANIZATION UNDER THE INTERNAL
REVENUE CODE AND THEREFORE YOU MAY RECOGNIZE GAIN ON THE SHARES OF EQUITY ONE
COMMON STOCK YOU RECEIVE

         It is possible that a significant reduction in the fair market value
of the Equity One common stock, as of the date of the mergers, could cause the
Equity One merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
section 368(a) to the Internal Revenue Code.

         Equity One and UIRT believe that the mergers will qualify as tax-free
reorganizations under the Internal Revenue Code. However, the Internal Revenue
Service could assert that either the reorganization merger or the Equity One
merger fails to qualify as a tax-free reorganization. If the IRS were successful
in such contention, or if for any other reason the mergers were to fail to
qualify as tax-free reorganizations, each UIRT shareholder would recognize gain
or loss equal to the difference between the shareholder's tax basis in his UIRT
common shares and the fair market value of Equity One common stock he receives
in the Equity One merger. See "Material Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Mergers."

EQUITY ONE'S PENDING ACQUISITION OF CEFUS MAY NOT BE COMPLETED OR, IF COMPLETED,
MAY HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON EQUITY ONE

         Equity One has entered into an agreement pursuant to which it may
acquire CEFUS. The acquisition will cost Equity One approximately $280 million
including transaction costs, the assumption of approximately $157 million in
debt and the issuance of approximately 10.5 million shares of Equity One common
stock. The transaction is subject to the approval of the stockholders of Equity
One and of the minority shareholders of Centrefund, as well as other customary
conditions. The acquisition of CEFUS will increase the outstanding indebtedness
of Equity One and may have adverse effects on the financial performance and
operations of Equity One and the market price of Equity One's common stock.

UIRT'S OPERATIONS MAY NOT BE INTEGRATED SUCCESSFULLY WITH THOSE OF EQUITY ONE
AND, IF THE CEFUS ACQUISITION IS COMPLETED, THOSE OF CEFUS, AND THE INTENDED
BENEFITS OF THE EQUITY ONE MERGER MAY NOT BE REALIZED, WHICH COULD HAVE A
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF EQUITY ONE'S COMMON STOCK AFTER THE
MERGER

         Based on anticipated savings in expenses and other factors, the Equity
One merger is expected to have an accretive, rather than a dilutive, effect on
Equity One's funds from operations on a pro forma basis for the next twelve
months. The Equity One merger is also expected to have an accretive effect on
Equity One's funds from operations for future periods. However, no assurance can
be given that the anticipated expense reductions or other operating synergies
will be realized or that unanticipated costs will not arise as a result of the
merger. For example, although we believe that we have reasonably estimated the
likely costs of integrating the operations of Equity One and UIRT and, if the
CEFUS acquisition is completed, those of CEFUS, as well as the incremental costs
of operating as a combined company, it is possible that unexpected transaction
costs, such as transfer taxes, consent fees or professional expenses, or
unexpected future operating expenses, such as increased personnel costs,
increased property taxes or increased travel expenses, could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition after the
Equity One merger. If the expected savings are not realized or unexpected costs
are incurred, the Equity One merger could have a significant dilutive effect on
Equity One's funds from operations.

         In addition, the completion of the mergers poses risks for the ongoing
operations of our combined company, including:

         o   the diversion of our management's attention to the integration of
             the operations of UIRT and, if the CEFUS acquisition is completed,
             those of CEFUS, could have an adverse effect on our revenues,
             expenses and operating results; and

         o   the UIRT portfolio may not perform as well we anticipate due to
             various factors, including changes in macro-economic conditions and
             the demand for leasing space in Florida and Texas.

TRUST MANAGERS OF UIRT MAY HAVE INTERESTS IN THE MERGERS THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM
THOSE OF THE SHAREHOLDERS OF UIRT

         A number of trust managers of UIRT who recommended that you vote in
favor of the mergers have outstanding loans which will be forgiven upon
completion of the Equity One merger and other benefit arrangements that provide
them with interests in the mergers that may be different than yours. The
forgiveness of loans, receipt of compensation and other benefits in connection
with the mergers or the continuation of indemnification arrangements for current
trust managers of UIRT following completion of the mergers, may influence these
trust managers in making their recommendation that you vote in favor of the
mergers.

YOU WILL LIKELY EXPERIENCE A REDUCTION IN OWNERSHIP AND VOTING POWER WITH
RESPECT TO YOUR COMMON SHARES OF UIRT AS A RESULT OF THE MERGERS

         Those UIRT shareholders who receive Equity One common stock will
experience a substantial reduction in their respective percentage ownership
interests and effective voting power relative to their respective percentage
ownership interests in UIRT prior to the mergers. In addition, Equity One may
issue an additional 10.5 million shares of its common stock in connection with
the completion of its acquisition of CEFUS. In the future, Equity One may issue
additional shares of common stock in public offerings, in connection with
share-for-share mergers and acquisitions, redemptions of operating partnership
units, or otherwise, which would further reduce your percentage ownership of
Equity One.

WITH THE MERGERS, EQUITY ONE'S BUSINESS IS ENTERING NEW MARKETS AND IT MAY NOT
BE SUCCESSFUL OPERATING IN THOSE MARKETS

         UIRT owns shopping centers in the states of Texas, Arizona and
Tennessee. Equity One does not currently own any properties outside of the State
of Florida and, therefore, as a result of the mergers, Equity One will enter new
markets. In addition, following the mergers, Equity One may make other selective
investments in these markets from time to time and may also make other selective
investments in markets outside of its current market if appropriate
opportunities arise. Although Equity One has significant management expertise in
Florida, this expertise may not assist them in the management of UIRT's Texas
properties and its expansion into new markets. Like the risks associated with
the addition of a substantial number of new shopping centers, its entry into new
market areas will require, among other things, that Equity One successfully
applies its experience to these new market areas. Because of Equity One's
expansion into new market areas, it may be exposed to risks associated with,
among other things:

         o   a lack of market knowledge and understanding of the local economy;

         o   an inability to attract new tenants or maintain relationships with
             existing tenants;

         o   an inability to identify property acquisition opportunities;

         o   sudden adverse shifts in supply and demand factors; and

         o   an unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures.

UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, UIRT IS OBLIGATED TO PAY EQUITY ONE A TERMINATION
FEE UPON TERMINATION OF THE EQUITY ONE MERGER AGREEMENT

         No assurance can be given that the mergers will be completed. The
Equity One merger agreement provides for the payment by UIRT of a termination
fee of up to $2 million if the Equity One merger is terminated by UIRT under
certain circumstances. The obligation to make that payment may adversely affect
the ability of UIRT to engage in another transaction in the event the Equity One
merger is not consummated and may have an adverse impact on the financial
condition of UIRT. See "The Merger Agreements -- Termination Fees."

IF EQUITY ONE FAILS TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, AS A RESULT OF MERGERS OR OTHERWISE,
IT COULD INCUR MATERIAL TAX LIABILITIES

         Prior to the consummation of the mergers, each of the companies has
operated in a manner that allows it to qualify as a REIT under the Internal
Revenue Code. It is intended that after the mergers, Equity One will operate the
combined business in a manner so that it will continue to qualify as a REIT.
Although we believe that Equity One and UIRT are organized and operate in such a
manner, no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a REIT
following the mergers. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of
highly technical and complex provisions of the Code for which there are only
limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the
determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within
our control. If after the mergers Equity One fails to qualify as a REIT, it will
be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. In that event,
Equity One could be subject to potentially significant tax liabilities, and the
amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders would be reduced and
possibly eliminated. Unless entitled to relief under certain statutory
provisions, the combined company would also be disqualified from treatment as a
REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification
was lost.

               SPECIAL NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

         This proxy statement/prospectus contains statements about future events
and expectations which are "forward-looking statements." Any statement in this
proxy statement/prospectus that is not a statement of historical fact may be
deemed to be a forward-looking statement. These forward-looking statements
include:

         o   statements regarding possible or assumed future results of
             operations of Equity One, UIRT and the combined company contained
             in "Questions and Answers about the Mergers," "Summary," "The
             Mergers-- Background of the Mergers," "The Mergers-- UIRT's reasons
             for the Mergers-- Recommendations of UIRT's Board of Trust
             Managers," and "The Mergers-- Opinion of First Union Securities,
             Inc.," including any forecasts, projections and descriptions of
             anticipated cost savings or other synergies referred to in those
             sections, and any similar statements incorporated by reference from
             documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by
             Equity One and UIRT, including any statements regarding the
             development or possible or assumed future results of operations of
             Equity One's, UIRT's and the combined company's businesses, the
             markets for Equity One's and UIRT's and the combined company's
             services and properties, anticipated capital expenditures,
             competition or the effects of the mergers.

         o   any statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words
             "may," "might," "could," "would," "believes," "expects,"
             "anticipates," "plans," "estimates," "projects," "intends" or
             similar expressions; and

         o   other statements contained or incorporated by reference in this
             proxy statement/prospects regarding matters that are not historical
             facts.

         Because these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual
results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the
forward-looking statements. UIRT's shareholders are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on those statements, which speak only as of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

         Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
are:

         o   general economic conditions, competition and the supply of and
             demand for shopping center properties in the combined company's
             markets;

         o   interest rate levels and the availability of financing

         o   potential environmental liability and other risks associated with
             the ownership, development and acquisition of shopping center
             properties;

         o   risks that tenants will not take or remain in occupancy or pay
             rent;

         o   that construction or operating costs may be greater than
             anticipated;

         o   inflationary and other general economic trends;

         o   risks associated with the proposed acquisition of CEFUS; and

         o   other risks detailed from time to time in the reports filed with
             the Securities and Exchange Commission by Equity One and UIRT.

         Except for their ongoing obligations to disclose material information
as required by the federal securities laws, neither Equity One nor UIRT
undertakes any obligation to release publicly any revisions to any
forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date
hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

                               THE SPECIAL MEETING

DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF SPECIAL MEETING

         This proxy statement/prospectus is being delivered to shareholders of
UIRT in connection with the solicitation by its board of trust managers of
proxies to be voted at a special meeting to be held on September __, 2001 at
10:00 a.m., local time, at ______________________________________. This proxy
statement/prospectus and the accompanying proxy card are being mailed to UIRT
shareholders on or about July __, 2001.

PURPOSE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING; THE MERGERS

         At the special meeting, you will be asked to adopt and approve the
merger of UIRT with and into UIRT, L.P. pursuant to the terms of the agreement
and plan of merger, dated as of June 29, 2001, a copy of which is attached to
this proxy statement/prospectus as ANNEX A.

         In addition, you will be asked to adopt and approve the merger of UIRT
Holding Corp. with and into Equity One pursuant to the terms of the amended and
restated agreement and plan of merger, dated as of June 29, 2001, a copy of
which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as ANNEX B.

         We know of no other business to be brought before the special meeting
other than the approval and adoption of the merger agreements and the mergers.
If any other business should properly come before the special meeting, the
persons named in the proxy will vote on those matters in their discretion.

         THE BOARD OF TRUST MANAGERS OF UIRT HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER
AGREEMENTS AND THE MERGERS, AND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS OF
UIRT VOTE "FOR" THE MERGER AGREEMENTS AND THE MERGERS.

RECORD DATE AND QUORUM REQUIREMENT

         The board of trust managers has fixed the close of business on July __,
2001 as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice
of, and to vote at, the special meeting. Each holder of record of UIRT common
shares at the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote for
each share then held on each matter submitted to a vote of shareholders. At the
close of business on the record date, there were __________ common shares of
beneficial interest of UIRT issued and outstanding held by _____ holders of
record and by approximately _____ persons or entities holding in nominee name.

         Prior to the special meeting, UIRT will select one or more inspectors
of election for the meeting. Such inspectors shall determine the number of
common shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum and the
validity and effect of proxies, and shall receive, count and tabulate ballots
and votes and determine the results thereof.

         The holders of majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at
the special meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy to
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting.
Abstentions and shares referred to as "broker or nominee non-votes" that are
represented at the special meeting (shares held by brokers or nominees as to
which instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or other
persons entitled to vote and the broker or nominee does not have discretionary
voting power on a particular matter) are counted for purposes of determining the
presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business. If less than a
majority of outstanding shares of common stock are represented at the special
meeting, holders of a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the
meeting to another date, time or place, and notice need not be given of the new
date or time.

VOTING PROCEDURES; REQUIRED VOTE

         Under the Texas Real Estate Investment Trust Act and as required by the
board of trust managers of UIRT, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
two-thirds of the outstanding common shares of beneficial interest of UIRT
entitled to vote at the special meeting is required to approve the merger
agreements and the mergers.

         After carefully reading and considering the information contained in
this proxy statement/prospectus, please complete and sign your proxy and return
it in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible, so that your shares may
be represented at the special meeting. If you sign and send in your proxy and do
not indicate how you want to vote, we will count your proxy as a vote in favor
of the merger. Brokers and, in many cases, nominees will not have discretionary
power to vote on the proposal to be presented at the special meeting. Failures
to vote, votes to abstain and broker or nominee non-votes could have the same
legal effect as votes cast against approval if they should cause the total votes
cast on the matter to be less than the two-thirds requirement described above.
Accordingly, beneficial owners of shares should instruct their brokers or
nominees how to vote.

         Shareholders, including members of management and board of trust
managers of UIRT and certain affiliates of management and the board, who as of
the record date held of record _________, or approximately __%, of the
outstanding common shares of UIRT have agreed to vote their shares for approval
of the mergers.

REVOCATION OF PROXIES

         The giving of a proxy does not preclude the right to vote in person
should any shareholder giving the proxy so desire. Shareholders have an
unconditional right to revoke their proxy at any time prior to the exercise
thereof, either in person at the special meeting or by filing with UIRT's
secretary at its headquarters a written revocation or duly executed proxy
bearing a later date; however, no such revocation will be effective until
written notice of the revocation is received by UIRT at or prior to the special
meeting. Subject to such revocation, all shares represented by each properly
executed proxy received by UIRT's secretary will be voted in accordance with the
instructions indicated thereon, and if no instructions are indicated, will be
voted to approve and adopt the merger agreements and the mergers and in such
manner as the persons named on the enclosed proxy card in their discretion
determine upon such other business as may properly come before the special
meeting.

COST OF THIS PROXY SOLICITATION

         All expenses incurred in connection with solicitation of the enclosed
proxy will be paid by UIRT and Equity One. Our officers, directors and regular
employees, who will receive no additional compensation for their services, may
solicit proxies by telephone or personal call. We may request banks, brokers and
other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward copies of the proxy
material to their principals and to request authority for the execution of
proxies. We may reimburse such persons for their expenses in doing so.

         In addition, UIRT has retained ______________ to help with the
solicitation of proxies. UIRT will pay ______________ a fee expected to be
approximately $_____ and out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the provision
of those services.

                                   THE MERGERS

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

         Since the UIRT initial public offering, or IPO, in March 1998 through
approximately the third quarter of 1999, UIRT's primary business strategy was to
maximize shareholder value by acquiring and operating neighborhood shopping
centers in the "Sunbelt" region of the United States. UIRT used proceeds from
its IPO, along with borrowings under its revolving line of credit and fixed rate
mortgage debt, to invest approximately $140 million in the acquisition of
shopping centers.

         Soon after the UIRT IPO, market prices for shares in publicly traded
REITs experienced significant declines. Members of the UIRT board of trust
managers, along with many equity analysts and other REIT experts, believed these
declines to be temporary because the shares of many REITs, including UIRT's
shares, were trading at prices significantly below the net value of their
underlying assets. Accordingly, during most of 1999, UIRT continued to focus on
acquiring shopping centers to generate funds from operations.

         During the fourth quarter of 1999, however, the UIRT board concluded
that the decline in REIT share prices might persist, that affordable equity
capital would not likely be available to UIRT in the foreseeable future and that
UIRT's use of debt capital would be limited by market constraints on corporate
leverage. The board began considering alternative strategies to maximize
shareholder value. These alternatives included soliciting private equity
investments, seeking joint venture arrangements, development of new, higher
yielding shopping centers, repurchase of UIRT shares and sales of existing
properties.

         From October 1999 through early January 2000, UIRT repurchased
approximately 475,000 UIRT common shares. These repurchases were part of the
board's strategy to maximize shareholder value through recycling UIRT capital,
primarily by selling selected assets and investing the sale proceeds in higher
yielding assets, including UIRT common shares. In addition, as part of this
strategy, in late 1999 the board directed UIRT management to identify properties
for sale that might no longer have the investment characteristics sought by
UIRT.

         The UIRT board also considered the possibility of accessing private
equity capital. During December 1999 and January 2000, UIRT provided
confidential information to and had discussions with a private investment group
about that group's possible investment in UIRT. The investment group already
owned shares of UIRT but elected not to pursue such an additional investment. In
January 2000, however, the investment group indicated to UIRT that its
principals would be willing to discuss providing capital for a transaction that
would result in privatizing UIRT. Based on numerous discussions between
management and principals of the investment group, the UIRT board concluded that
the proposed equity capital would be dilutive in the long and short term to the
existing shareholders of UIRT.

         At a regularly scheduled meeting of the board on March 2, 2000
management presented to the board a series of analyses. These analyses indicated
that, in order to continue payment of a $0.215 quarterly dividend and to meet
the capital requirements for tenant improvements, leasing commissions, property
maintenance and construction commitments, UIRT would be required to sell
properties and increase debt levels. In addition, management estimated that the
aggregate net asset value per share was significantly higher than the market
value of the UIRT shares at that time. At this meeting, the board approved the
sale, conditioned on obtaining acceptable prices, of five properties previously
identified by management as being appropriate for sale.

         In March 2000, UIRT provided confidential information to a private real
estate company that had indicated an interest in exploring investment
opportunities with UIRT. UIRT had a series of discussions with this real estate
company. Management reported to the board periodically in April and May the
substance of these discussions.

         On April 14, 2000, UIRT received a proposal from the investment group
mentioned above indicating that it was willing to acquire all of the outstanding
UIRT shares for a price of $6.50 per share. UIRT engaged the real estate
consulting group of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or PWC, to assist the board in
evaluating the offer. Based on management's estimates of property values and
PWC's report, the board considered the investment group's offering price to be
inadequate and publicly announced that it had declined to pursue the offer.

         At the regularly scheduled May 16, 2000 meeting of the UIRT board,
management again presented financial analyses to the board confirming that
property sales and additional borrowing would be necessary to fund UIRT's
capital requirements and a quarterly dividend of $0.215. The management
presentations stated that unless a substantial number of shares could be
repurchased promptly upon receipt of sale or financing proceeds, the capital
recycling strategy as then implemented would decrease net asset value per share.
Management also reported that the UIRT credit line lender intended to assert its
right under the credit agreement to prohibit UIRT from repurchasing shares.

         Also at the May 16, 2000 meeting, two investment banking firms made
separate presentations to the board concerning the process that the board might
consider to maximize shareholder value. The board elected not to engage a
financial advisor at that time and authorized management to continue its efforts
to sell the previously identified properties at acceptable prices.

         On May 25, 2000, UIRT received a proposal from the private real estate
company to create a joint venture that would acquire 22 of the UIRT properties
for approximately $5.65 per share and a preferred interest in the joint venture.
The real estate company asserted that the preferred joint venture interest had a
value of approximately $1.35 per share. After consideration of the offer, the
UIRT board elected not to pursue it because of its complexity, the illiquidity
of the retained joint venture interest and the uncertainty of the joint venture
interest value and because the price was inadequate.

         Pursuant to the UIRT's board's capital recycling strategy to maximize
shareholder value, UIRT sold one property in late May 2000, and in June 2000
UIRT signed a letter of intent to sell another property to the investment group,
partially in return for the UIRT shares the investment group still owned. The
UIRT credit line lender had approved the terms of this transaction to allow UIRT
to reacquire the shares. Prior to the closing of this sale, Southwest
Securities, Inc. filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit seeking to enjoin the
sale. At an injunction hearing on August 28, 2000, the Dallas County court
denied Southwest's plea for injunction, and UIRT closed the sale on September
30, 2000. The lawsuit was amended in September, generally adding allegations of
mismanagement and self-dealing against UIRT, its board of trust managers and FCA
Corp.

         Southwest Securities was also a member of a group of UIRT institutional
shareholders that had announced in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that it was dissatisfied with the performance of UIRT's share price
and with the performance and activities of management and the board. In this
filing, the shareholder group also noted that it was considering various
alternatives to increase shareholder value, including attempts to replace
management and the board of trust managers.

         On September 8, 2000, management updated the board concerning the
availability of resources for capital requirements, including the previously
declared October 21 dividend. During a telephonic board meeting on September 11,
the board discussed alternatives for meeting short-term capital requirements and
instructed management to pursue the sale of an undivided interest in one of the
UIRT properties to an unrelated buyer. At a regularly scheduled meeting of the
board on October 4, the board approved the terms of the sale of the undivided
interest, and that sale closed in October 2000. Also at this meeting, UIRT's
president, Robert M. Scharar, reported to the board the substance of informal
discussions he had recently had with representatives of several investment
banking firms. Mr. Scharar relayed to the board that these firms reported that
other publicly traded REITs were also exploring strategic alternatives, some for
many of the same reasons as UIRT.

         At a meeting of the UIRT board on October 17, 2000, management again
updated the board regarding the projected availability of resources with which
to satisfy UIRT's capital requirements and a quarterly dividend of $0.215. The
board decided to reevaluate its capital recycling strategies, including its
dividend policy, and to consider additional strategies for maximizing
shareholder value. The board generally agreed at this meeting to commence the
process of engaging a financial advisor.

         Also at the October 17 meeting, Mr. Scharar reported to the board the
substance of recent discussions he had with Chaim Katzman, the chairman and
chief executive officer of Equity One. In a public filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, an affiliate of Equity One, M.G.N. (USA), Inc., had
reported its acquisition of approximately 5% of UIRT's outstanding shares. Mr.
Scharar reported to the UIRT board that Mr. Katzman had expressed interest in
evaluating UIRT for possible additional investments, but at that time did not
intend to attempt to acquire control of UIRT. Based on Mr. Scharar's report, and
with the advice of UIRT's corporate counsel, Andrews & Kurth L.L.P., the board
authorized management to negotiate a confidentiality and standstill agreement
with M.G.N. (USA). M.G.N. (USA) executed such an agreement with UIRT on October
31, although M.G.N. (USA) did not at that time request that UIRT provide any
confidential information. On November 30, 2000, UIRT agreed to waive the
restrictions on purchases of UIRT common shares by M.G.N. (USA) for a period of
three weeks for up to 218,266 additional UIRT common shares.

         A meeting of the UIRT board was held on December 27, 2000, at which
time representatives of First Union and another investment banking firm made
proposals to the board. The board authorized management to negotiate an advisory
contract with First Union to study and report on available alternatives to
maximize shareholder value and to advise the board on an appropriate dividend
policy.

         At a January 12, 2001 meeting of the board, representatives from
Andrews & Kurth and First Union described the advantages to the UIRT
shareholders of implementing a shareholder rights plan. In general, because the
UIRT shares were trading at prices UIRT believed were substantially below the
net value of the UIRT assets, the UIRT board believed there was a risk that an
outsider could acquire control of UIRT without paying the UIRT shareholders a
fair price. The UIRT board met again on January 17 and 18, 2001 to further
discuss the plan. After careful consideration of the relative advantages and
disadvantages of such a plan, and after review of documents prepared by Andrews
& Kurth, at a meeting on January 25, 2001, the UIRT board elected to implement a
shareholder rights plan.

         Also at the January 17 and 18 meeting, First Union presented its report
on the UIRT dividend policies. First Union's report confirmed the findings
included in the previous reports to the board by management regarding the
limited resources available to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.215. Based on
First Union's report and information reported by management, the board elected
to reduce the UIRT quarterly dividend to $0.13 per share.

         First Union next reported to the UIRT board on February 8, 2001. At
this board meeting, First Union described a range of possible strategic
alternatives available to maximize shareholder value. These possibilities
included continuing to operate UIRT for the long term with the reduced dividend,
accelerating the capital recycling process, accessing joint venture capital,
selling UIRT to publicly traded or private companies, selling UIRT to a
management led group and liquidating the UIRT assets in an orderly process.
First Union expressed its opinion that the most likely alternative to result in
maximum shareholder value was a sale of UIRT or substantially all of its assets.
After discussing in detail the relative advantages and disadvantages of each
alternative, the board agreed that the most likely alternative to result in
maximum shareholder value was a sale of UIRT or substantially all of its assets.

         Accordingly, the board directed First Union to begin exploring the sale
of UIRT or substantially all of its assets. First Union, using information
provided by management, immediately began the preparation of a detailed
confidential offering memorandum containing property-by-property information,
which would be distributed to potential acquirors on a confidential basis, in
order to assess the market interest in a strategic transaction with UIRT.

         In late January, Mr. Katzman and Mr. Scharar resumed communications and
UIRT delivered to Equity One confidential information about properties and
operations of UIRT. Equity One's affiliate, M.G.N. (USA), also reported that it
had increased its ownership of UIRT's common shares to approximately 9.8%. One
of the principals of the investment group mentioned above had also maintained
contact with management, and expressed his interest in receiving updated
confidential information in order to evaluate a potential offer for UIRT. Two
other parties who had prior contact with management also contacted UIRT to
express their interest in making offers. First Union advised the board that
these four parties were the most interested parties and therefore most likely to
offer a premium price in the sale process. While management and First Union
continued to prepare the confidential offering document for possible broader
dissemination to other interested parties, the UIRT board authorized

management and First Union to provide preliminary information to these four
parties and obtain indications of interest from them.

         The UIRT board met on five occasions between March 12 and March 27 in
order for First Union to provide progress reports on the negotiations with the
four parties and completion of the confidential offering document. During these
meetings, the board considered, in light of the status of the negotiations with
the four parties, whether and when to disseminate the confidential offering
document to additional prospective purchasers. In addition, during the meeting
held on March 27, members of the board discussed in detail First Union's
estimates of future net operating income, individual asset valuations and the
per share net asset value of UIRT.

         Between March 16 and March 21, 2001, the four parties to whom UIRT had
provided confidential information presented proposals stating the prices and key
terms pursuant to which they would be willing to pursue negotiations to acquire
UIRT. One of the proposals was an oral indication of interest in a potential
transaction. These preliminary proposals were evaluated by management and First
Union and ranged in value from approximately $5.25 to $6.25 per share. Equity
One offered .572 shares of Equity One stock for each share of UIRT; on the day
UIRT received Equity One's offer, Equity One's common stock closed at $10.08 per
share. The investment group's offer was for $6.25 in cash for each common share
of UIRT. All of the offers included significant conditions and were subject to
negotiation of definitive agreements. The board considered each of these offers
and believed they were inadequate.

         As a result of the preliminary prices indicated and terms proposed by
the four parties and the board's assessment of UIRT's per share net asset value,
the board directed First Union to distribute the confidential offering document
to other qualified recipients who had signed an appropriate confidentiality
agreement. First Union distributed copies to approximately 30 prospective
purchasers. Recipients were instructed to forward proposed term sheets for the
acquisition of all outstanding shares, or all of UIRT's assets, or one of two
portfolios (Florida and Tennessee properties and Texas and Arizona properties)
by April 20, 2001.

         On April 2, 2001, Southwest Securities initiated a proxy contest for
control of the UIRT board of trust managers. Members of the UIRT board
considered whether the possibility of a change in control of UIRT would affect
the willingness of prospective purchasers to invest the considerable resources
necessary to perform appropriate diligence. On April 6, 2001, Mr. Scharar and
Mr. Barfield, one of UIRT's independent trust managers, met with the president
of Southwest Securities to discuss possible settlement of the shareholder
derivative lawsuit filed in August 2000. Based on those discussions, the UIRT
board concluded that, although the Southwest Securities shareholder litigation
would need to be resolved in order to facilitate the process of attracting
prospective purchasers, the terms under which the litigation could then be
settled were not in the best interests of UIRT shareholders.

         On or about April 20, 2001, eight prospective purchasers submitted
preliminary indications of interest. The board, with the assistance of First
Union, considered key criteria in each indication of interest. These criteria
included the indicated per share net proceeds to shareholders, the form of
consideration, the prospective purchaser's financial condition and source of
transaction financing, various risks that the prospective purchaser might be
unable to consummate the proposed transaction, potential tax effects on the UIRT
shareholders, diligence and other conditions, need for corporate and other
approvals and time necessary to close the transaction. The board also considered
the fact that the indications of interest came from parties with diverse
ownership and investment strategies. Based on the board's evaluation of the
preliminary indications of interest, the board directed First Union to ask five
of the prospective purchasers to conduct the additional procedures necessary to
present a final proposed term sheet by May 18, 2001. The deadline was
subsequently extended to May 21, 2001. The board also directed Andrews & Kurth
to prepare a form of merger agreement to distribute to the five prospective
purchasers.

         On May 21, UIRT received proposed final term sheets from the five
prospective purchasers, including Equity One and the investment group. On May 22
and 23, the board met to consider, with the assistance of First Union and
Andrews & Kurth, the terms of each of the proposals. First Union estimated the
value of the proposals to range from $6.35 to $7.18 per share. In addition to
pricing, the proposals differed from each other with respect to deal structure,
conditions, necessary approvals, and estimated time to closing. The board
considered the presentations by First Union and Andrews & Kurth and other
factors in determining which of the proposals to pursue.

         The board chose not to pursue two of the proposals because the
purchasers had lowered the price per share they were prepared to pay as compared
to the indications of interest they had submitted on April 20. In addition,
these proposals included a lengthy diligence period that the board believed
substantially increased the risk that UIRT would not be able to close a
transaction, even at the lower price included in the proposal. The board also
considered the additional time to closing that could result from such a
condition.

         Another of the proposed purchasers the board elected not to pursue
offered a price of $7.18 per share, which was nominally higher than the other
offers. However, this proposal provided that the price was subject to downward
adjustment after a lengthy diligence period. Once again, the board believed such
a condition substantially increased the likelihood that the prospective
purchaser might reduce its offer prior to executing a binding agreement and
would result in delays. Moreover, this bid was subject to equity and debt
financing contingencies, and its proposal would have allowed the prospective
purchaser to terminate the offer if it did not obtain satisfactory financing.
The UIRT board also considered this offer to be relatively less favorable
because it was for the assets of UIRT rather than the UIRT shares, and as such
precluded the possibility of a tax advantaged stock for stock transaction,
required UIRT to retain and liquidate other assets and liabilities and required
additional costs and delays associated with the transfer of assets.

         The UIRT board considered the offers from Equity One and the investment
group as being worthy of additional consideration. Equity One initially offered
$7.10 per share in equal portions of cash and stock, and the investment group
initially offered $6.86 per share in cash. The board considered the Equity One
offer relatively more attractive than the investment group's offer for several
reasons. First, the nominal value of the Equity One offer was higher than the
investment group's offer. Second, the stock portion of the consideration might
offer the UIRT shareholders tax advantages. Also, the stock portion of the
consideration would float within a predetermined range of Equity One's share
price, and the UIRT board would retain the right to terminate the agreement if
Equity One's stock price fell below that range. The board considered this to be
an attractive feature that mitigated market risks that might otherwise result in
a discounted valuation of the stock portion of the merger consideration. The
board also considered that some of the UIRT shareholders would prefer to receive
equity in a REIT, such as Equity One, that has an investment focus on grocery
anchored retail shopping centers similar to the properties owned by UIRT.

         The Equity One offer also provided that Equity One would acquire all of
the outstanding shares of UIRT without regard to any potential adverse effects
of the Southwest Securities lawsuit. The investment group's offer initially
required UIRT to resolve the lawsuit prior to closing. The board considered the
effect on the ultimate ability to resolve the litigation, the relative price of
the investment group's offer, and timing to closing of the transaction. The
board also considered the fact that Equity One's affiliate owned approximately
9.8% of UIRT shares and that a 66 2/3% vote of the outstanding shares would be
required to approve a transaction. The board considered the enhanced likelihood
that a transaction with Equity One would be approved by Equity One's affiliate.

                  The UIRT board then directed management and First Union to
communicate to Equity One UIRT's interest in pursuing a merger, provided that
Equity One would increase the value of its offer while offering consideration of
at least 50% cash. The board also directed First Union communicate to other
prospective purchasers that UIRT had not yet made a definitive decision and that
UIRT was continuing to consider various proposals. On May 25, 2001, the investor
group increased its offer to $7.15 per share, subject to certain conditions that
could reduce the price. The investment group also indicated its willingness to
assume any liabilities resulting from the Southwest Securities lawsuit on the
same terms proposed by Equity One. On May 25, Equity One increased its offer to
$7.30 per share in equal portions of cash and stock. Also on May 25, a third
group increased its offer to an amount that First Union estimated to be equal to
$7.24 per share in cash. The offer was subject to resolution of the shareholder
derivative suit and the approval of the financing partner for the group. The
board determined that the contingencies in the offer made the offer less
attractive than the other two offers.

         On May 25, 2001, the UIRT board met and authorized management, with the
assistance of Andrews & Kurth, to negotiate with Equity One a draft merger
agreement based on the existing understanding of management and the board of the
proposed terms submitted by Equity One. The board also considered the investment
group's expressed willingness to increase its offer, and directed First Union to
obtain a complete explanation from the investment group of the limiting
conditions to its proposal. In accordance with UIRT's bylaws, the board at this

meeting also named Lowry Barfield, Rhett Buck and William Nolen to a special
committee of independent trust managers for the purpose of evaluating the draft
agreement and making a recommendation to the full board concerning acceptance of
the agreement.

         The special committee convened on the afternoon of May 26, 2001 to
commence its review of the draft agreement. All of the members were in
attendance for the entire meeting, and a representative of Andrews & Kurth also
attended portions of the meeting. The Andrews & Kurth representative described
the role of the special committee and the duties and responsibilities of the
committee to UIRT and its shareholders. Also at this meeting, the committee
reviewed the draft merger agreement in detail and consulted with Andrews &
Kurth, First Union and management. The committee directed management and Andrews
& Kurth to continue negotiating acceptable terms with respect to certain
unresolved matters and scheduled a meeting for the following afternoon, May 27,
2001.

         At the May 27 meeting, the members of the special committee reviewed a
revised draft of the merger agreement, and after further consultations with
Andrews & Kurth, First Union, and management, elected unanimously to recommend
acceptance of the Equity One offer to UIRT's full board. On May 28, 2001, the
investment group contacted a representative of management and of First Union to
express its willingness to increase its all cash offer to $7.20 per share,
conditioned upon UIRT having at least $1,000,000 in net liquid assets at
closing.

         At a meeting of the board on May 29, 2001, First Union reported the
revised offer from the investment group and described the conditions of that
offer. The board considered the effect that the $1,000,000 in required net
liquid assets might have on UIRT's ability to pay another $0.13 dividend prior
to closing, and the effect that resolution of the lawsuit might have on the
ultimate price to be received by the UIRT shareholders at closing. The board
then reconsidered the possibility that UIRT might not obtain approval, by the
required vote of 66 2/3% of the UIRT outstanding shares, of a transaction with a
purchaser other than Equity One. Based on these considerations, the board
accepted the recommendation of the special committee and voted unanimously to
accept the Equity One offer, conditioned on UIRT's ability to maintain the
existing UIRT dividend policy prior to closing. The board directed management to
continue negotiating with Equity One to resolve these matters.

         On May 29, the 44th District Court in Dallas, Texas, granted UIRT's
motion to dismiss all claims asserted by Southwest Securities against the
defendants in the derivative lawsuit. Throughout the evening of May 29 and into
the morning of May 30, management continued negotiations with Equity One, but
was unable to reach agreement.

         UIRT held the UIRT annual shareholders' meeting beginning at 9:00 a.m.
on May 30, 2001. Immediately after Mr. Scharar called the meeting to order,
Southwest Securities moved to adjourn the meeting and M.G.N. (USA) seconded the
motion. After two additional motions to adjourn the meeting on May 30, Mr.
Scharar adjourned the meeting until 10:00 a.m. on May 31. The board met on the
afternoon of May 30 to evaluate the status of negotiations and concluded that
all other terms of the draft agreement remained satisfactory. First Union orally
delivered its fairness opinion to the board. After extensive consultation with
counsel, the board authorized management to again attempt to resolve the
remaining issues through further negotiation with Equity One.

         Early in the morning of May 31, management negotiated what it believed
to be satisfactory resolutions to the remaining issues, and a board meeting was
convened at 8:00 a.m. Management informed the board that all remaining issues
had been resolved, and representatives of Andrews & Kurth explained that Equity
One and Southwest Securities had separately agreed to resolve the litigation
issues in connection with closing of the merger. First Union confirmed its
fairness opinion. Based on the resolution of these issues and the other terms of
the merger agreement, the board unanimously voted to accept the merger offer
from Equity One and instructed management to execute the definitive agreement as
soon as practicable and to amend the shareholder rights plan to permit the
merger. The annual meeting commenced and was adjourned once again the morning of
May 31. Management executed the merger agreement later that morning. The annual
meeting was held later on May 31. UIRT and Equity One each issued press releases
after the close of business on May 31 announcing the execution of the Equity One
merger agreement.

         On June 27, 2001, the UIRT board met to consider amending the Equity
One merger agreement and effecting a reorganization of UIRT. At the meeting, the
UIRT board recommended entering into an amended and

restated merger agreement with Equity One and UIRT Holding Corp. which would
effect the combination of Equity One and UIRT, but would not alter or change the
amount or kind of consideration to be received by the UIRT shareholders.
Changing the method of combining Equity One and UIRT was contemplated in the
original Equity One merger agreement. On June 29, 2001, UIRT, UIRT Holding Corp.
and Equity One executed an amended and restated merger agreement, pursuant to
which UIRT Holding Corp. agreed to merge with and into Equity One on
substantially the same terms as the original merger between UIRT and Equity One.
In addition, UIRT, UIRT Holding Corp. and UIRT, L.P., an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of UIRT Holding Corp., entered into a reorganization merger
agreement, pursuant to which UIRT would merge with and into UIRT, L.P. and the
shareholders of UIRT would become stockholders of UIRT Holding Corp. The purpose
of the reorganization merger is to comply with the Equity One merger agreement
which requires that UIRT contribute the real properties owned directly by it to
a subsidiary and thereby minimize Equity One's exposure to the liabilities that
may be associated with those properties. In addition, the reorganization merger
is expected to reduce, under current law, the payment of Texas franchise tax
which would otherwise result from the acquisition of UIRT by Equity One.

UIRT'S REASONS FOR THE MERGERS

         The UIRT board of trust managers has approved and recommends to the
UIRT shareholders the two merger agreements, the merger of UIRT with and into
UIRT, L.P., and the merger of UIRT Holding Corp. with and into Equity One. The
UIRT board sought and received the advice of its management, financial advisors
and legal counsel throughout its consideration of the merger agreements and the
mergers. In making its determinations, the UIRT board considered the following
positive factors:

         o    STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES. The UIRT board considered the opinion of
              First Union that a sale of UIRT was the most likely strategic
              alternative to result in maximum shareholder value. UIRT's ability
              to grow to a size that would be sufficient to spread its overhead
              more efficiently was unlikely according to management and First
              Union, and financing for such growth would be expensive. An
              orderly liquidation was also determined to be impractical and
              unlikely to derive maximum value for shareholders.

         o    PRICING. The value of the merger consideration is calculated to be
              $7.30 per share to the UIRT shareholders, subject to restrictions
              on the maximum and minimum number of Equity One shares to be
              issued. This value represents a premium of approximately 22% to
              the closing price of UIRT shares on the date immediately
              proceeding the execution of the Equity One merger agreement and a
              premium of approximately 69% to the UIRT share price immediately
              prior to UIRT's announcement on January 18, 2001 that UIRT had
              engaged First Union to explore strategic alternatives.

         o    BENEFITS OF STOCK AND CASH CONSIDERATION. The UIRT board
              considered the fact that shareholders who wished to retain an
              equity investment in a REIT focused on shopping centers could
              elect to receive Equity One common stock. The UIRT board believes
              that the option to receive stock consideration will make
              relatively more cash available to shareholders who prefer to
              receive cash consideration.

         o    EQUITY ONE'S PROPERTIES AND TENANTS. The UIRT board considered the
              physical qualities, location and tenant base of Equity One's
              properties. The UIRT board believes the higher portion of
              supermarket anchor tenants on long-term leases in Equity One's
              portfolio will provide UIRT shareholders with a more stable
              earnings stream and prospects for dividend payments. The UIRT
              board also believes that operating synergies may be created
              because a substantial majority of the properties of the combined
              company will be in the high-growth states of Florida and Texas.

         o    OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE GROWTH OF EQUITY ONE. The UIRT board
              considered the record of the Equity One management team in growing
              its property portfolio and in attracting attention that may be
              expected to lead to increased institutional ownership, research
              coverage, liquidity and float and other growth opportunities. The
              UIRT board also considered the announced acquisition by Equity One
              of all of the outstanding common stock of Centrefund Realty (U.S.)
              Corporation, and the potential growth represented by that
              transaction.

         o    BENEFITS OF GREATER MARKET CAPITALIZATION. The combined equity
              market capitalization of UIRT and Equity One, excluding
              Centrefund, is estimated to be approximately $200 million or
              almost four times the recent equity market capitalization of UIRT.
              The UIRT board also considered the possible increased equity
              market capitalization that would result if the proposed Centrefund
              acquisition is completed. The UIRT board considered that larger
              REITs generally have greater access to capital than smaller REITs,
              and that increased capitalization generally provides increased
              liquidity for shareholders.

         o    FAIRNESS OPINION OF FIRST UNION SECURITIES, INC. The UIRT board
              considered the opinion, analyses and presentations of First Union
              described below under "Opinion of First Union Securities, Inc.,"
              including their opinion to the effect that, based on and subject
              to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth in
              such opinion, the Equity One merger consideration was fair from a
              financial point of view to the UIRT shareholders. A copy of First
              Union's written opinion to the UIRT board dated as of May 31, 2001
              is attached as ANNEX C to this proxy statement.

         o    TERMS OF THE EQUITY ONE MERGER AGREEMENT. The UIRT board
              considered the terms of the Equity One merger agreement, including
              the Equity One exchange ratio and the restrictions on the maximum
              and minimum number of Equity One shares to be issued. In addition,
              the UIRT board considered the provision in the agreement that,
              subject to the discretion of the UIRT board, UIRT would be able to
              pay a regular quarterly dividend in August.

         o    LIKELIHOOD OF APPROVAL. The UIRT board considered the enhanced
              likelihood that the merger could receive the required vote of
              holders of 66 2/3% of UIRT's outstanding shares, in view of the
              agreement of Equity One's affiliate to vote its interest of
              approximately 9.8% in favor of the mergers.

         The UIRT board also considered the following possibly negative factors
in its deliberations concerning the merger agreements and the mergers:

         o    CHALLENGES OF EXECUTING THE MERGERS. The UIRT board considered the
              challenges inherent in the combination of two business enterprises
              the size of UIRT and Equity One, including the likely diversion of
              management attention from daily operating matters for an extended
              period of time. In addition, the UIRT board considered the fact
              that Equity One has also announced its intention to acquire CEFUS,
              another company similar in size to Equity One and UIRT, and
              considered the complexities of Equity One's acquisition of two
              companies simultaneously.

         o    UNCERTAINTY OF MARKET PERCEPTION. The UIRT board considered the
              uncertainty of the financial market's perception of the
              transaction, and the potential effect of this uncertainty on the
              trading prices of the shares of UIRT and Equity One.

         o    RESTRICTIONS ON UNITED INVESTORS' ABILITY TO PURSUE ALTERNATIVE
              TRANSACTIONS. The UIRT board considered the fact that the Equity
              One merger agreement prohibits UIRT and its representatives from
              soliciting or otherwise facilitating a proposal of a competing
              acquisition by or business combination with any other party except
              in response to a bona fide unsolicited proposal that, among other
              things, the UIRT board believes in good faith, following
              consultation with its financial and legal advisors, is or is
              likely to result in an offer that is more favorable to the UIRT
              shareholders.

         o    POTENTIAL BREAK-UP FEE. The UIRT board considered the fact that
              Equity One the merger agreement requires UIRT to pay Equity One a
              break-up fee of $2 million if the Equity One merger agreement is
              terminated in certain circumstances. These circumstances include
              the possibility that the UIRT board could recommend to the
              shareholders of UIRT that they vote in favor of a competing
              proposal, and the possibility that UIRT might terminate the Equity
              One merger agreement in order to enter into an alternative
              acquisition transaction. The UIRT board recognized that the
              inclusion of these provisions in the Equity One merger agreement
              would make it less likely that a more attractive offer for the
              acquisition of UIRT would be presented to UIRT and its
              shareholders. However, the UIRT board

              believed, based on consultation with its financial and legal
              advisors and after negotiations with Equity One, that inclusion of
              the break-up fee provisions was necessary to induce Equity One to
              enter into the Equity One merger agreement, and that the terms of
              the break-up provisions were generally comparable to those
              contained in similar acquisition agreements.

         o    RESTRICTIONS ON BUSINESS OPERATIONS BEFORE THE MERGERS. The UIRT
              board considered the restrictions the Equity One merger agreement
              places on UIRT's ability to operate its business before the
              mergers in a manner that is inconsistent with past practice or
              outside of the ordinary course of business. The UIRT board also
              considered the other significant restrictions the Equity One
              merger agreement places on UIRT's ability to buy and sell
              properties and to borrow money.

         o    RISK THAT THE MERGERS WILL NOT BE COMPLETED. The UIRT board
              considered the various conditions to Equity One's obligations to
              complete the Equity One merger and the possibility that the
              mergers would not be completed. In evaluating this risk, the board
              considered the particular circumstances under which Equity One
              could terminate the Equity One merger agreement. The UIRT board
              also considered the possible adverse effects on the market for the
              UIRT shares and upon UIRT's ability to raise capital in both the
              public and private markets that might result if the Equity One
              merger were announced and not completed.

         o    POTENTIAL FAILURE TO ACHIEVE BENEFITS OF THE MERGER. The UIRT
              board considered the risk that the anticipated benefits of the
              mergers may not be realized.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF UIRT'S BOARD OF TRUST MANAGERS

         The UIRT board of trust managers has unanimously approved the merger
agreements and the mergers which would result in the reorganization of UIRT and
the acquisition of UIRT by Equity One and recommends that you vote to approve
and adopt the merger agreements and the mergers.

OPINION OF FIRST UNION SECURITIES, INC.

         Pursuant to an engagement letter dated January 12, 2001, UIRT formally
retained First Union Securities, Inc. to serve its financial advisor to conduct
a review of its strategic alternatives. On May 30, 2001, First Union delivered
its oral opinion to the UIRT board of trust managers that, as of that date, the
merger consideration contemplated pursuant to the Equity One merger agreement,
which results in the payment of merger consideration of at least $7.30 for each
outstanding UIRT common share, was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
UIRT common shareholders. This opinion was confirmed in writing on May 31, 2001.

         The full text of the First Union opinion dated May 31, 2001 is set
forth as ANNEX C to this proxy statement/prospectus and sets forth certain
important qualifications, assumptions made, matters considered, areas of
reliance on others and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with
such opinion. The First Union opinion was directed to UIRT's board of trust
managers for its consideration in connection with the mergers and is not a
recommendation to any holder of UIRT common shares as to whether the mergers are
in that holder's best interests or as to whether any holder should vote for or
against the mergers.

         In arriving at its opinion, First Union, among other things:

         o    reviewed the financial terms and conditions of the Equity One
              merger agreement;

         o    reviewed business, financial and other information, including
              financial forecasts, regarding UIRT and Equity One that was
              publicly available or furnished to First Union by members of
              UIRT's or Equity One's management, and discussed with the
              management teams their respective company's business and
              prospects;

         o    considered financial data related to UIRT and Equity One and
              compared that data with similar data for publicly held companies
              in businesses similar to those of UIRT and Equity One and compared
              UIRT's and Equity One's data relative to one another;

         o    considered the financial terms of other business combinations and
              other transactions that have recently been effected; and

         o    considered such other information, financial studies, analyses and
              investigations as well as financial and economic and market
              criteria that First Union deemed relevant.

         In connection with its review, First Union relied upon the accuracy and
completeness of the foregoing financial and other information and did not assume
any responsibility for any independent verification of such information. With
respect to UIRT's and Equity One's financial forecasts, First Union assumed that
they have been reasonably prepared and reflect the best current estimates and
judgments of UIRT's and Equity One's management teams as to the future financial
performance of their respective companies. First Union has discussed UIRT's and
Equity One's financial projections with the respective management teams of UIRT
and Equity One, but First Union assumes no responsibility for and expresses no
view as to UIRT's and Equity One's financial projections or the assumptions upon
which they are based. In arriving at its opinion, First Union conducted limited
physical inspection of the properties or facilities of UIRT or Equity One, but
did not make or was not provided with any evaluations or appraisals of the
assets or liabilities of UIRT or Equity One. UIRT imposed no limitations on
First Union with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by
First Union.

         First Union's opinion is necessarily based on economic, market,
financial and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the
date of its opinion, and the information made available to First Union as of the
date of the mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus. Accordingly, although
subsequent developments may affect this opinion, First Union does not have any
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.

         In rendering its opinion, First Union assumed that the mergers will be
consummated on the terms described in the merger agreements that First Union
reviewed, without any waiver of any of its material terms or conditions and that
the merger consideration will not be less than $7.30. The First Union opinion
does not address the relative merits of the mergers and any other business
strategies considered by UIRT's board of trust managers, nor does it address
UIRT's board of trust managers' decision to proceed with the mergers.

         The merger agreements are filed as ANNEX A and ANNEX B to this proxy
statement/prospectus and their terms and the conditions to UIRT's obligations to
complete the mergers should be reviewed and understood by holders of UIRT's
common shares in connection with their consideration of the mergers.

         Set forth below is a brief summary of selected analyses presented by
First Union to the UIRT board of trust managers on May 30, 2001 in connection
with the First Union opinion.

         COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES ANALYSIS. First Union compared financial
information and measurements for UIRT with the corresponding financial
information and measurements for a group of publicly traded retail real estate
investment trusts, or REITs, that First Union deemed to be comparable to UIRT.
For the purpose of its analyses, the following retail REITs were used:

                 Agree Realty Corporation                    Equity One, Inc.
                 Federal Realty Investment Trust             Glimcher Realty Trust
                 IRT Property Company                        Kimco Realty Corporation
                 Kramont Realty Trust                        Mid-Atlantic Realty Trust
                 New Plan Excel Realty Trust                 Pan Pacific Retail Properties, Inc.
                 Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust           Regency Centers Corporation
                 Saul Centers, Inc.                          Weingarten Realty Investors

         The financial information and valuation measurements reviewed by First
Union included equity market capitalization, total market capitalization and the
ratios of price per share to projected 2001 and 2002 funds from operations per
share. Funds from operations per share estimates of the comparable companies
were provided by

First Call, a national data service that monitors and publishes compilations of
earnings estimates by selected research analysts regarding companies of interest
to institutional investors. All multiples were based on closing stock prices on
May 30, 2001. This analysis indicated multiples as follows:

     RATIO OF PRICE TO:              RANGE              MEAN         MEDIAN
 --------------------------       ------------          ----         ------

 2001 funds from operations       5.4x to 9.6x          8.2x          8.5x
          estimate
 2002 funds from operations       5.1x to 8.9x          7.8x          8.0x
          estimate

         First Union observed that the implied price for UIRT's common shares
based on the range of funds from operations multiples for the comparable
companies was $4.03 to $8.85 per share.

         None of the comparable companies is identical to UIRT. Accordingly, a
complete analysis of the results of the foregoing calculations cannot be limited
to a quantitative review of the results and involves complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of
the comparable companies and other factors that could affect the public trading
volume of the comparable companies, as well as that of UIRT.

         COMPARABLE PRECEDENT TRANSACTIONS ANALYSIS. Using publicly available
information, First Union considered selected transactions involving shopping
center and retail REITs that First Union deemed to be comparable. Specifically,
First Union reviewed the following transactions:

                           ACQUIROR                                     TARGET
          -----------------------------------         -----------------------------------

          CALPERS                                     First Washington Realty Trust, Inc.
          Rodamco North America N.V.                  Urban Shopping Centers, Inc.
          Pan Pacific Retail Properties, Inc.         Western Properties Trust
          Heritage Property Investment Trust          Bradley Real Estate, Inc.
          New Plan Realty Trust                       Excel Realty Trust, Inc.
          Kimco Realty Corporation                    The Price REIT, Inc.

         First Union analyzed purchase price and transaction multiples for these
transactions based on the targets' estimated funds from operations for the year
in which the transactions were announced. The multiples for these transactions
were as follows:

            RATIO OF OFFER PRICE TO:              RANGE                  MEAN                 MEDIAN
          -----------------------------       -------------             ------                ------

          Forward funds from operations       8.6x to 12.9x             10.3x                  10.2x
                    estimate:

         First Union observed that the implied price for UIRT's common shares
based on the range of estimated funds from operations multiples paid in the
these transactions was $6.46 to $9.70 per share.

         None of the transactions considered by First Union was identical to the
contemplated transaction between UIRT and Equity One. An analysis of the
results, therefore, requires complex considerations and judgments regarding the
financial and operating characteristics of UIRT and the companies involved in
the comparable precedent transactions analysis, as well as other facts that
could affect their transaction values.

         PREMIUMS PAID ANALYSIS. For each of the transactions described above,
First Union calculated the premium of the offer price per share relative to the
target company's stock price one day prior to the announcement of the
transaction and the target company's estimated net asset value per share at the
time of the transaction.

                PREMIUM TO:                     RANGE                MEAN                  MEDIAN
     --------------------------------       -------------           ------                 ------

     Target stock price one day prior       0.5% to 39.4%           15.7%                   13.2%
     Target estimated net asset value      (3.8%) to 20.0%          10.3%                   11.1%

         In comparing the premiums paid in the transactions considered by First
Union to the implied price for UIRT, First Union utilized UIRT's closing stock
price of $5.98 on May 30, 2001 and a net asset value per share of $7.09, based
on calculations performed by First Union. First Union observed that the implied
price of UIRT's common shares based on the range of premiums paid to stock price
of these transaction was $6.01 to $8.33 per share. Based on the ranges of
premiums to target net asset value for the these transactions, First Union
observed that the implied price for UIRT's common shares was $6.82 to $8.51.

         NET ASSET VALUE ANALYSIS. First Union performed a net asset valuation
analysis of UIRT by calculating the gross estimated value of UIRT's properties
and other assets and subtracting its outstanding debt and other liabilities and
assumed transaction costs. The gross asset value for UIRT was estimated by
capitalizing 2001 net operating income as projected by the Company. First Union
used a range of capitalization rates from 10.50% to 11.10% based on its judgment
of market capitalization rates for assets of similar quality to UIRT's assets.
The net asset valuation analysis produced a range of values between $6.69 and
$7.51 per UIRT common share.

         PRO FORMA MERGER CONSIDERATIONS. First Union analyzed the pro forma
effects resulting from the mergers, including the anticipated per share funds
from operations accretion to the Equity One common stock resulting from the
mergers. First Union observed that, after giving effect to anticipated
synergies, the mergers would be accretive to the projected funds from operations
per share of the Equity One common stock in 2001 and 2002.

         The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete
description of the analysis performed by First Union in arriving at its opinion.
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and not necessarily
susceptible to partial or summary description. First Union believes that its
analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its
analyses and of the factors considered by it, without considering all factors
and analyses, could create a misleading view of the process underlying the First
Union opinion. In performing its analyses, First Union made numerous assumptions
with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions
and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of UIRT and Equity One.
The analyses performed by First Union are not necessarily indicative of actual
values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by such analyses. The analyses were prepared
solely as part of First Union's analysis for the UIRT board of trust managers of
the fairness of the merger consideration received by the holders of UIRT common
shares from a financial point of view, and were provided solely to the UIRT
board of trust managers in connection with its consideration of the mergers. The
analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a
company might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities may trade
at any time in the future. First Union used in its analyses the projections of
future performance prepared by the management of UIRT or Equity One. The
projections are based on numerous variables and assumptions which are inherently
unpredictable and must not be considered certain or accurate as projected.
Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in the
projections.

         The First Union opinion and the presentation to the UIRT board of trust
managers summarized above were among the many factors taken into consideration
by the UIRT board of trust managers in making its determination to approve, and
to recommend that UIRT shareholders approve, the acquisition of UIRT by Equity
One. First Union does not, however, make any recommendation to holders of UIRT
common shares, or to any other person or entity, as to whether such shareholders
should vote for or against the mergers.

         Pursuant to a letter agreement dated January 12, 2001, UIRT agreed to
pay First Union the following fees:

         o    a fee of $250,000, payable in cash on the date of First Union's
              review of UIRT's strategic alternatives;

         o    a fee of $250,000, payable in cash upon First Union's rendering of
              its opinion; and

         o    on the date the mergers are consummated, 1.2% of the aggregate
              consideration paid to UIRT and its stockholders in connection with
              the mergers including amounts paid in respect of stock options and
              all assumed indebtedness, against which the fees described in the
              prior two clauses will be credited.

The opinion fee was not conditioned on the outcome of the First Union opinion or
whether UIRT or its board of trust managers deemed such opinion favorable or
unfavorable. The engagement letter also calls for UIRT to reimburse First Union
for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and for UIRT to indemnify First Union,
its affiliates, directors, agents, employees and controlling persons against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws,
relating to or arising out of First Union's engagement. First Union and its
affiliates may maintain business relationships with UIRT and its affiliates.

         First Union Securities, Inc., a subsidiary of First Union Corporation,
is a nationally recognized investment banking firm and an affiliate of First
Union Corporation. First Union and its affiliates, as part of their investment
banking activities, are regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and
their securities in connection with merger transactions and other types of
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other
purposes. UIRT selected First Union as its financial advisor on the basis of
First Union's experience and expertise in mergers and acquisitions transactions.
In the ordinary course of business, First Union or its affiliates may actively
trade the debt and equity securities of UIRT and Equity One for its or any such
affiliate's own account or for the account of customers and, accordingly, may
hold a long or short position in such securities.

INTEREST OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGERS; CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         In determining whether to consent to the principal terms of the
mergers, you should be aware that, as described below, some UIRT trust managers
and executive officers have interests in, and will receive benefits from, the
mergers that differ from, or are in addition to, and, therefore, may conflict
with the interests of UIRT shareholders generally.

         INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE. In the Equity One merger agreement,
Equity One agreed to provide indemnification for trust managers, officers and
employees of UIRT, including for actions taken in connection with the mergers,
to the same extent as the indemnification provided by UIRT as of the date of the
Equity One merger agreement. In addition, Equity One has agreed to either
provide directors' and officers' insurance for the benefit of those individuals
either under UIRT's current insurance policy until the limits of such policy are
exhausted or under a similar policy for a period of three years after the Equity
One merger.

         FORGIVENESS OF LOANS. In connection with the exercise of options to
purchase common shares of UIRT granted at the time of UIRT's initial public
offering in 1998 pursuant to UIRT's 1997 Share Incentive Plan, several trust
managers and officers of UIRT have issued promissory notes payable to UIRT in
the aggregate outstanding amount of approximately $395,000 in order to pay the
exercise price of those options. Upon shareholder approval of the mergers, a
change of control will occur and all outstanding amounts under these loans will
be forgiven pursuant to the terms of the notes. In addition, there are
approximately 254,000 common shares of UIRT reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of additional options issued under the share incentive plan. If those
options are exercised upon the change of control, pursuant to the plan, UIRT
will loan the option holders the money to exercise the options. All amounts
outstanding under these additional loans will also be forgiven upon completion
of the mergers.

         TERMINATION OF THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH FCA CORP. Robert W.
Scharar, UIRT's chief executive officer, president and chairman of the board, is
also the president and controlling shareholder of FCA Corp, the company that
manages UIRT's real properties pursuant to an advisory agreement. In connection
with the Equity One merger agreement, notice of termination has been given under
the advisory agreement which effectively terminates the advisory agreement in
December 2001. Upon termination, FCA Corp will be paid a termination fee,
pursuant to the terms of the advisory agreement, equal to approximately
$__________.

FINANCING THE MERGER

         Equity One intends to finance the estimated $155 million of merger
costs, including the approximately $33 million cash portion of the merger
consideration to be paid in connection with the mergers, by using a combination
of its available cash and available borrowing capacity and through the issuance
of its common stock.

REGULATORY AND THIRD PARTY APPROVALS

         In connection with the mergers, the following filings with, or
approvals of, governmental authorities are required:

         o    the Securities and Exchange Commission's declaring effective the
              registration statement containing this proxy statement/prospectus;

         o    approvals in connection with compliance with applicable Blue Sky
              or state securities laws;

         o    the filing of the articles of merger with the office of the County
              Clerk's Office in Harris County, Texas and with the State
              Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland;

         o    the filing of such reports under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act
              as may be required in connection with the merger agreements and
              other related transactions; and

         o    such filings as may be required in connection with the payment of
              any transfer or other taxes.

         Other than these approvals and filings, we are not aware of any
material license, regulatory permit or other material third party approval which
is required in connection with the mergers or of any approval or other action by
any state, federal or foreign government or governmental agency that would be
required prior to completion of the mergers.

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

         UIRT is organized as a real estate investment trust under the laws of
Texas. Under the Texas Real Estate Investment Trust Act, since the common shares
of beneficial interest of UIRT are designated as a national market security on
the Nasdaq National Market, UIRT shareholders have no right to dissent and
receive the appraised value of their common shares in connection with the
reorganization merger. In addition, the charter of UIRT Holding Corp. does not
permit any objecting stockholder to exercise rights to the fair value of its
stock.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

         The merger will be accounted for as a "purchase," as such term is used
under generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, from and after the
closing of the mergers, UIRT's consolidated results of operations will be
included in Equity One's consolidated results of operations. For purposes of
preparing Equity One's consolidated financial statements, Equity One will
establish a new accounting basis for UIRT's assets and liabilities based upon
their estimated fair market values and Equity One's purchase price, including
the costs of the acquisition. Accordingly, the purchase accounting adjustments
made in connection with the development of the unaudited pro forma combined
financial information appearing elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus are
preliminary and have been made solely for purposes of developing such pro forma
combined financial information to comply with disclosure requirements of the
SEC. Although the final purchase price allocation may differ, the pro forma
combined financial information reflects Equity One's management's best estimate
based upon currently available information. For more information regarding the
pro forma allocation of the purchase price, see "Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Financial Information."

THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING

         The Equity One shares of common stock to be issued in connection with
the mergers are required to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or the
NYSE. The NYSE's approval to list these shares of common stock is expected to be
obtained prior to the completion of the mergers, subject to official notice of
issuance.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

GENERAL

      The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the mergers to UIRT shareholders. This discussion is for
general information only and does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S.
federal income taxation that may be relevant to a UIRT shareholder. For example,
this discussion does not address the effect, if any, of the Foreign Investment
in Real Property Tax Act on UIRT shareholders that are not United States persons
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This discussion is based on the Internal
Revenue Code, the legislative history of the Internal Revenue Code, the Treasury
regulations, including temporary and proposed regulations, current
administrative interpretations and practices of the Internal Revenue Service,
including its practices and policies as endorsed in private letter rulings,
which are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service, and existing court
decisions, all as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus.
Future legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations and court
decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations
of current law. Any change could apply retroactively. This discussion applies
only to a UIRT shareholder who holds his UIRT shares as capital assets within
the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code. This discussion does
not apply to:

         o    a UIRT shareholder who received his UIRT shares pursuant to the
              exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation;

         o    a shareholder who holds his UIRT shares as part of a "straddle,"
              "hedge," "conversion transaction," "synthetic security" or other
              integrated investment;

         o    a shareholder, including a financial institution, insurance
              company, tax-exempt organization, a broker or dealer in
              securities, a regulated investment company, a U.S. expatriate, a
              trader in securities that elects mark to market treatment or a
              shareholder subject to the alternative minimum tax, who may be
              subject to special rules;

         o    a shareholder whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; or

         o    a shareholder who, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is a
              non-resident alien individual, foreign corporation, foreign
              partnership, or foreign estate or trust.

  This  discussion  also does not consider the effect of any  foreign,  state
or local laws or any U.S.  federal laws other than U.S. federal income tax law.

          The individual circumstances of each UIRT shareholder may affect the
tax consequences of the mergers to that UIRT shareholder. Accordingly, you
should consult your own tax adviser to determine the tax effect to you of the
mergers, including the application and effect of U.S. federal, state, local,
foreign or other tax laws. A shareholder that is not a United States person and
who holds or has held, directly and constructively, more than five percent of
the outstanding UIRT common shares should consult his own tax adviser regarding
the consequences to him of the mergers under the Foreign Investment in Real
Property Tax Act, including any tax filing requirements that may apply.

         In connection with the completion of the mergers, Greenberg Traurig,
P.A., counsel to Equity One, and Andrews & Kurth, counsel to UIRT, will each
deliver an opinion to Equity One and UIRT, respectively, as to whether the
mergers will qualify as a reorganizations within the meaning of section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code. It is possible that a significant reduction in the
fair market value of the Equity One stock, as of the date of the mergers, could
cause the Equity One merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The opinions of counsel
will rely on customary representations made by Equity One and UIRT and
applicable factual assumptions. If any of the factual assumptions or
representations relied upon in the opinions of counsel are inaccurate, the
opinions may not accurately describe the U.S. federal income tax treatment of
the mergers, and this discussion may not accurately describe the tax
consequences of the mergers. The opinions of counsel are not binding on the
Internal Revenue Service. No ruling has been or will be sought from the Internal
Revenue Service regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
mergers. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the Internal Revenue Service
will not contest the conclusions expressed in this discussion or that a court
will not sustain that contest.

    Except as otherwise indicated, the following discussion of U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the mergers to UIRT shareholders assumes that the
mergers will qualify as "reorganizations" within the meaning of section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code. As discussed below, the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Equity One mergers to a UIRT shareholder depend on the type
of consideration received by the shareholder and on whether the shareholder is
deemed to own UIRT shares constructively under section 318 of the Internal
Revenue Code, which for certain purposes treats a person as owning stock that is
owned, or, in some cases, treated as owned, by certain family members or related
entities or that is the subject of an option or series of options owned by that
person.

STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER TRANSACTIONS.

         The acquisition of UIRT by Equity One will be accomplished upon the
completion of two separate and distinct mergers.

         The first merger will effect a reorganization of UIRT in by which UIRT
will be merged with and into UIRT, L.P., one of its indirect subsidiaries which
is a limited partnership and also a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of UIRT
Holding Corp. UIRT, L.P. will be the surviving entity of the reorganization
merger.  UIRT Holding Corp., upon completion of the reorganization merger, will
be the ultimate parent entity of UIRT, L.P.  The reorganization merger is
subject to UIRT shareholder approval and to the satisfaction of conditions set
forth in the reorganization merger agreement.

         The second merger will involve the merger of UIRT Holding Corp. with
and into Equity One. Equity One will be the surviving entity of the Equity One
Merger. The Equity One Merger is subject to UIRT shareholder approval and to the
satisfaction of conditions set forth in the Equity One merger agreement. Upon
completion of the Equity One merger, shares of common stock UIRT Holding Corp.,
which were received by UIRT shareholders upon the conversion of common shares of
UIRT in the reorganization merger, will automatically be converted into either
cash or Equity One common stock or both.

TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REORGANIZATION MERGER.

         In the reorganization merger, a UIRT shareholder will exchange common
shares of UIRT for shares of common stock of UIRT Holding Corp. in a transaction
intended to qualify as a reorganization for federal tax purposes as a mere
change in identity, form or place of organization of one corporation, however
effected. In the reorganization merger, a UIRT shareholder will recognize no
gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the shares of UIRT
Holding stock deemed received will have the same adjusted tax basis and holding
period as the UIRT shares deemed exchanged therefor.

TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE EQUITY ONE MERGER

         BECAUSE A UIRT SHAREHOLDER WILL NOT RECOGNIZE ANY GAIN OR LOSS PURSUANT
TO THE REORGANIZATION MERGER, BECAUSE THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF UIRT HOLDING
CORP. WILL HAVE THE SAME ADJUSTED TAX BASIS AND HOLDING PERIOD AS THE
CORRESPONDING UIRT COMMON SHARES, AND BECAUSE A UIRT SHAREHOLDER WILL NOT
ACTUALLY RECEIVE A CERTIFICATE REPRESENTING UIRT HOLDING CORP. SHARES, WHICH
WILL BE TREATED AS IMMEDIATELY EXCHANGED FOR CASH OR EQUITY ONE COMMON STOCK OR
BOTH, PURSUANT TO THE EQUITY ONE MERGER AGREEMENT, THEN, NOTWITHSTANDING THE
ACTUAL INTERMEDIATE STEPS OF THE TRANSACTION ,FOR EASE OF UNDERSTANDING THE
FOLLOWING DISCUSSION DESCRIBES THE MERGERS AS IF A UIRT SHAREHOLDER EXCHANGED
HIS UIRT STOCK DIRECTLY FOR EQUITY ONE STOCK EVEN THOUGH FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX
PURPOSES EACH MERGER IS A SEPARATE AND DISTINCT REORGANIZATION.

         SHAREHOLDERS WHO RECEIVE SOLELY EQUITY ONE SHARES. A UIRT shareholder
who exchanges UIRT shares solely for Equity One shares pursuant to the Equity
One merger will not recognize any gain or loss on that exchange, except to the
extent the shareholder receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of Equity
One, as discussed below. The aggregate adjusted tax basis of the Equity One
shares received will be equal to the UIRT shareholder's aggregate adjusted tax
basis in the UIRT shares surrendered, reduced by the tax basis allocable to any
fractional share of Equity One for which cash is received pursuant to the Equity
One merger. The holding period of Equity One shares received pursuant to the
Equity One merger will include the holding period of the UIRT shares surrendered
therefor.

         SHAREHOLDERS WHO RECEIVE CASH AND EQUITY ONE SHARES. If a UIRT
shareholder receives consideration for his UIRT shares surrendered in the Equity
One merger consisting of part cash and part Equity One shares, and if the
shareholder realizes a gain on that exchange, the shareholder will include in
gross income an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of the gain realized
and the amount of the cash received. The amount of gain realized will equal any
excess of the sum of the fair market value of the Equity One shares, as of the
date of the mergers, and the amount of cash that the shareholder receives less
the shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the UIRT shares surrendered in the
exchange. On the other hand, if the shareholder realizes a loss on the exchange,
that loss will not be currently allowed or recognized for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. A shareholder will realize a loss if the shareholder's adjusted
tax basis in the UIRT shares surrendered in the exchange exceeds the sum of the
fair market value of the Equity One shares as of the date of the mergers and the
amount of cash that the shareholder receives pursuant to the Equity One merger.
These rules assume that a UIRT shareholder has the same tax basis in each UIRT
share owned. A UIRT shareholder that bought UIRT shares at different prices or
otherwise owns UIRT shares with different bases must make the calculations above
separately for each UIRT share surrendered in the mergers. A loss realized on
one UIRT share may not be used to offset a gain realized on another UIRT share.

         In the case of a UIRT shareholder who recognizes gain on the exchange,
if the exchange sufficiently reduces the shareholder's proportionate stock
interest, as discussed below, the gain will be capital gain. That gain will be
capital gain and will be long-term capital gain with respect to UIRT shares
surrendered in the exchange that the UIRT shareholder has a holding period of
more than one year as of the date of the mergers. If the exchange does not
sufficiently reduce the shareholder's proportionate stock interest, the gain
will be taxable as a dividend to the extent of the shareholder's share of UIRT's
available earnings and profits, and the remainder, if any, of the recognized
gain will be capital gain.

         The determination of whether the exchange sufficiently reduces a UIRT
shareholder's proportionate stock interest will be made in accordance with
Section 302 of the Internal Revenue Code, taking into account the stock
ownership rules of Section 318 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under those rules,
a UIRT shareholder is treated as if (1) all of the shareholder's UIRT shares
first were exchanged in the mergers for Equity One shares and (2) a portion of
those Equity One shares then were redeemed for the cash actually received in the
Equity One merger. The UIRT shareholder's resulting actual and constructive
stock interest in Equity One is then compared to the UIRT shareholder's actual
and constructive stock interest in Equity One prior to the deemed redemption.
Dividend treatment will apply unless the shareholder's stock interest in Equity
One has been completely terminated, unless there has been a "substantially
disproportionate" reduction in the shareholder's stock interest in Equity One,
that is, that the resulting percentage after hypothetical step (2) is less than
80 percent of the percentage interest prior to the deemed redemption or unless
the exchange is not "essentially equivalent to a dividend." Although the third
determination is based on a UIRT shareholder's particular facts and
circumstances, the Internal Revenue Service has indicated in a published ruling
that a distribution is not "essentially equivalent to a dividend" and therefore
will result in capital gain treatment in the case of a minority shareholder with
a small stock interest in a publicly held corporation if the distribution
results in any actual reduction in the shareholder's stock interest and if the
shareholder exercises no control with respect to corporate affairs.

         BECAUSE THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER A PAYMENT WILL BE TREATED AS
HAVING THE EFFECT OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF A DIVIDEND GENERALLY WILL DEPEND UPON
THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH UIRT SHAREHOLDER, UIRT SHAREHOLDERS ARE
STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISERS REGARDING THE TAX TREATMENT OF
ANY CASH RECEIVED IN THE EQUITY ONE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF THE
CONSTRUCTIVE OWNERSHIP RULES OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE AND THE EFFECT OF ANY
TRANSACTIONS IN EQUITY ONE SHARES OR UIRT SHARES BY THE UIRT SHAREHOLDER.

         The adjusted tax basis in the Equity One shares received by a UIRT
shareholder who receives both Equity One shares and cash in the Equity One
merger will be equal to that shareholder's adjusted basis in the UIRT shares
surrendered increased by any gain recognized pursuant to the Equity One merger
and reduced by the amount of cash received in the Equity One merger. The holding
period of the Equity One shares received will include the holding period of the
UIRT shares surrendered.

         SHAREHOLDERS WHO RECEIVE SOLELY CASH. A UIRT shareholder who exchanges
his UIRT shares solely for cash pursuant to the Equity One merger generally will
recognize gain or loss, on a share-by-share basis, in an amount equal to the
difference between the amount of cash received for a UIRT share and the
shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the UIRT share. That gain or loss will be
capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss with respect to
UIRT shares that the shareholder held for more than one year as of the date of
the mergers. Limitations apply to the deductibility of capital losses. A UIRT
shareholder who receives only cash in exchange for all of his UIRT shares
surrendered in the mergers but who owns Equity One shares, actually or
constructively, after the mergers should consult his own tax adviser to
determine the amount and character of any gain recognized in the mergers.

         CASH RECEIVED IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL SHARES. A UIRT shareholder who
receives cash in lieu of a fractional Equity One share will be treated as having
first received that fractional share pursuant to the Equity One merger and then
as having received cash in exchange for that fractional share. Thus, the UIRT
shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the
difference between the amount of cash received in lieu of the fractional Equity
One share and the portion of the basis in the UIRT shares allocable to that
fractional interest.

         BACKUP WITHHOLDING. A payment received in connection with the mergers
may be subject to "backup withholding" at a rate of 31%, unless the UIRT
shareholder receiving that payment provides to the paying agent a correct
taxpayer identification number, which, for an individual shareholder, is the
shareholder's social security number, and all other required information, or
unless the UIRT shareholder is a corporation or otherwise is exempt from the
backup withholding rules and, when required, demonstrates that fact and
otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules.
A UIRT shareholder that is a United States person may prevent backup withholding
by properly completing a substitute IRS Form W-9 (which is included with this
proxy statement/prospectus) and submitting it to the paying agent for the
mergers when he submits his UIRT share certificates. A UIRT shareholder who is
required to and does not provide a correct taxpayer identification number may be
subject to penalties imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. Any amount paid as
backup withholding does not constitute an additional tax but will be refundable
or creditable against the shareholder's U.S. federal income tax liability
provided the appropriate information is furnished to the Internal Revenue
Service.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO EQUITY ONE AND EQUITY ONE SHAREHOLDERS.

         Equity One and its shareholders will not recognize any gain or loss as
a result of the mergers, whether or not either merger fails to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO UIRT, UIRT HOLDING CORP. AND UIRT, L.P.

         If each merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of
section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and UIRT qualifies as a "real estate
investment trust" or "REIT," at the time of the mergers, UIRT, UIRT Holding
Corp. and UIRT, L.P. will not recognize any gain or loss as a result of the
mergers.

         If the reorganization merger failed to qualify as a reorganization but
UIRT qualified as a REIT at the time of that merger, UIRT would incur a tax
liability only to the extent that UIRT's net gain, if any, recognized on the
deemed transfer of its assets pursuant to that merger were to exceed the fair
market value of the UIRT Holding Corp. stock issued pursuant to that merger.
Equity One would succeed to the liability for any tax attributable to any net
gain recognized.

         If the reorganization merger failed to qualify as a reorganization and
if UIRT did not qualify as a REIT at the time of that merger, UIRT would
recognize gain or loss on each of its assets for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as if it sold all of its assets to UIRT Holding Corp. in a fully
taxable transaction. In general, if losses were recognized on some assets and
gains were recognized on other assets, the losses would offset the gains. Equity
One would succeed to the liability for any tax attributable to any net gain
recognized. If both the reorganization merger and the Equity One merger were to
qualify as reorganizations, but if UIRT were to fail to qualify as a REIT,
Equity One would be subject to tax if during the ten years following the mergers
Equity One were to dispose of any appreciated asset that it acquired from UIRT
Holding Corp. in the mergers. In that event, Equity One would generally be
subject to tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate on the built-in gain,
if any, that existed with respect to the asset at the time of the merger.

         If the reorganization merger qualified as a reorganization, but if the
Equity One merger failed to qualify as a reorganization and UIRT qualified as a
REIT at the time of that merger, UIRT Holding Corp. would incur a tax liability
only to the extent that UIRT Holding Corp.'s net gain, if any, recognized on the
deemed transfer of its assets pursuant to that merger were to exceed the fair
market value of the Equity One stock and cash issued pursuant to that merger.
Equity One would succeed to the liability for any tax attributable to any net
gain recognized.

         If the reorganization merger qualified as a reorganization, but if the
Equity One merger failed to qualify as a reorganization and UIRT did not qualify
as a REIT at the time of that merger, UIRT Holding Corp. would recognize gain or
loss on each of its assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes as if it sold
all of its assets to Equity One in a fully taxable transaction. In general, if
losses were recognized on some assets and gains were recognized on other assets,
the losses would offset the gains. Equity One would succeed to the liability for
any tax attributable to any net gain recognized. If both the reorganization
merger and the Equity One merger were to qualify as reorganizations, but if UIRT
Holding Corp. were to fail to qualify as a REIT, Equity One would be subject to
tax if during the ten years following the mergers Equity One were to dispose of
any appreciated asset that it acquired from UIRT Holding Corp. in the mergers.
In that event, Equity One would generally be subject to tax at the highest
regular corporate tax rate on the built-in gain, if any, that existed with
respect to the asset at the time of the merger.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO UIRT SHAREHOLDERS IF EITHER MERGER OR BOTH
MERGERS FAILED TO QUALIFY AS A REORGANIZATION OR UIRT FAILED TO QUALIFY AS A
REIT.

         If the reorganization merger failed to qualify as a reorganization, a
UIRT shareholder would recognize, on a share-by-share basis, gain or loss, as
applicable, equal to the difference between the aggregate fair market value of
the UIRT Holding Corp. stock that the UIRT shareholder would be treated as
receiving in that merger and the shareholder's adjusted tax basis in his UIRT
stock. A UIRT shareholder would acquire a tax basis in UIRT Holding Corp. stock
he would be treated as receiving equal to its fair market value on the date of
the reorganization merger, and his holding period in that stock would not
include the period he held the UIRT stock exchanged therefor.

    If the Equity One merger then qualified as a reorganization, the U.S.
federal income tax consequences to a UIRT shareholder would be as set forth
above in "-Tax Consequences of the Equity One Merger", except that the tax basis
and holding period of the Equity One stock received pursuant to that merger
would reflect the new tax basis and holding period of the UIRT Holding Corp.
stock rather than the tax basis and holding period the shareholder had in his
UIRT stock.

         If the reorganization merger qualified as a reorganization but the
Equity One merger did not, a UIRT shareholder would recognize, on a
share-by-share basis, gain or loss, as applicable, equal to the difference
between the shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the UIRT stock surrendered
pursuant to the mergers and the cash and the fair market value on the date of
the Equity One merger of the Equity One stock received therefor. A UIRT
shareholder's tax basis in his Equity One stock would be equal to its fair
market value on the date of the Equity One merger, and his holding period in
that stock would not include the period he held the UIRT stock exchanged
therefor.

         If the reorganization merger and the Equity One merger both failed to
qualify as a reorganization, a UIRT shareholder first would recognize with
respect to the reorganization merger, on a share-by-share basis, gain or loss,
as applicable, equal to the difference between the aggregate fair market value
of the UIRT common stock that the UIRT shareholder would be treated as receiving
in that merger and the shareholder's adjusted tax basis in his UIRT stock. A
UIRT shareholder's tax basis in the UIRT Holding Corp. stock he would be treated
as receiving would be equal to its fair market value on the date of the
reorganization merger, and his holding period in that stock would not include
the period he held the UIRT stock exchanged therefor. Upon the Equity One
merger, a UIRT shareholder also would recognize, on a share-by-share basis, gain
or loss, as applicable, equal to the difference between the shareholder's
adjusted tax basis in the UIRT Holding Corp. stock treated as surrendered
pursuant to that merger and the cash and the fair market value on the date of
the Equity One merger of the Equity One stock received therefor. That gain or
loss would be short-term capital gain or loss. Short-term capital gain does not
receive a preferential rate of tax, and the deductibility of short-term capital
losses is subject to limitations. A UIRT shareholder's tax basis in his Equity
One stock would be equal to its fair market value on the date of the Equity One
merger, and his holding period in that stock would not include the period he
held the UIRT shares, or the UIRT Holding Corp. stock treated as previously
held, by that shareholder.

REIT QUALIFICATION OF UIRT AND EQUITY ONE.

         As a condition to the merger, Andrews & Kurth, special tax counsel to
UIRT, will deliver an opinion to Equity One that UIRT has qualified to be
treated as a REIT for each of UIRT's taxable years from December 31, 1995 to
December 31, 2000 and the short taxable year beginning January 1, 2001 and
ending at the time of the merger. This opinion, however, will not be binding on
the Internal Revenue Service or the courts. This opinion will rely on customary
representations made by UIRT about factual matters relating to the organization
and operation of UIRT and the partnerships and corporations in which it owns an
interest. In addition, this opinion will be based on factual representations of
UIRT concerning its business and properties as set forth in this proxy
statement/prospectus and the other documents incorporated by reference in this
proxy statement/prospectus. If UIRT did not qualify as a REIT in any of its
prior tax years, UIRT would be liable for (and, as successor to UIRT in the
mergers, Equity One would be obligated to pay) any federal income tax on its
income earned in any year that it did not qualify as a REIT.

         As a condition to the merger, Greenberg Traurig, P.A., counsel to
Equity One, will deliver an opinion to Equity One and UIRT that commencing with
Equity One's taxable year ended December 31, 1995, Equity One was organized and
has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT.
This opinion will rely upon customary representations made by Equity One about
factual matters relating to the organization and operation of Equity One and the
partnerships and corporations in which it owns an interest.

In addition, this opinion will be based upon factual representations of Equity
One concerning its business and properties as set forth in this proxy statement/
prospectus and the other documents incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus. If UIRT did not qualify as a REIT at the time of the
mergers, Equity One could fail to qualify as a REIT after the mergers.

         Equity One intends to continue to operate in a manner to qualify as a
REIT following the mergers, but there is no guarantee that Equity One will
qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. Qualification and taxation as a REIT
depend upon Equity One's ability to meet, through actual annual (or, in some
cases, quarterly) operating results, requirements relating to income, asset
ownership, distribution levels and diversity of share ownership, and the various
REIT qualification requirements imposed under the Internal Revenue Code.
Greenberg Traurig, P.A. will not review Equity One's compliance with these tests
on a continuing basis. Given the complex nature of the REIT qualification
requirements, the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the
possibility of future changes in the circumstances of Equity One, Equity One
cannot guarantee that its actual operating results will satisfy the requirements
for taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code for any particular year.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENTS

         THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE MERGERS
DESCRIBED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, INCLUDING THE MERGER AGREEMENTS.
THE DESCRIPTION OF EACH OF THE MERGER AGREEMENTS IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY
REFERENCE TO THE COMPLETE TEXT OF THE RESPECTIVE MERGER AGREEMENT WHICH IS
ATTACHED AS AN ANNEX TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. WE URGE YOU TO READ THE
FULL TEXT OF EACH OF THE MERGER AGREEMENTS.

THE MERGER TRANSACTIONS

         The acquisition of UIRT by Equity One will be accomplished upon the
completion of two separate and distinct mergers. The first merger will effect a
reorganization of UIRT by which UIRT will be merged with and into UIRT, L.P.,
one of its indirect subsidiaries which is a limited partnership and also a
wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of UIRT Holding Corp. The purpose of the
reorganization merger is to comply with the Equity One merger agreement which
requires that UIRT contribute the real properties owned directly by it to a
subsidiary and thereby minimize Equity One's exposure to the liabilities that
may be associated with those properties. In addition, the reorganization merger
is expected to reduce, under current law, the payment of Texas franchise
tax which would otherwise result from the acquisition of UIRT by Equity One. The
second merger will effect the acquisition of UIRT by Equity One.

         REORGANIZATION MERGER. Subject to UIRT shareholder approval, UIRT will
merge with and into UIRT, L.P., a Florida limited partnership and wholly owned
indirect subsidiary of UIRT. UIRT, L.P. will be the surviving entity of the
reorganization merger. Upon completion of the reorganization merger, each
outstanding common share of UIRT will automatically be converted into one share
of common stock of UIRT Holding Corp. UIRT Holding Corp., upon completion of the
reorganization merger, will be the ultimate parent entity of UIRT, L.P.

         EQUITY ONE MERGER. Subject to UIRT shareholder approval and to the
satisfaction of conditions set forth in the Equity One merger agreement, and
following the completion of the reorganization merger, UIRT Holding Corp. will
merge with and into Equity One. Equity One will be the surviving entity of the
merger. In connection with the Equity One merger, former holders of UIRT common
shares will exchange their shares of common stock of UIRT Holding Corp. for
either cash or Equity One common stock as described below.

CONVERSION OF SHARES

         MERGER CONSIDERATION. At the effective time of the mergers, all
outstanding common shares of beneficial interest of UIRT, other than those that
are held by UIRT as treasury stock, will ultimately be converted into the right
to receive the merger consideration. Each UIRT shareholder has a right to make
an election as to the form in which he or she would like to receive the merger
consideration, which may be subject to proration. UIRT shareholders can elect to
receive cash or shares of Equity One common stock. The cash consideration is
$7.30, without interest, per UIRT common share. The stock consideration is a
number of Equity One shares per UIRT common share that will vary depending on
the weighted average trading price of Equity One common stock for the

20 trading day period ending on the day immediately prior to the closing date of
the mergers. If the weighted average trading price is equal to or more than
$11.30 per share and equal to or less than $12.50 per share, then each UIRT
common share will be exchanged for $7.30 worth of Equity One shares. If the
weighted average trading price is equal to or greater than $12.50, then each
UIRT share will be exchanged for 0.584 Equity One shares, irrespective of the
value of those shares. Finally, if the weighted average trading price is equal
to or less than $11.30 per share, then each UIRT share will be exchanged for
0.646 Equity One shares, again irrespective of the value of those shares.
However, if the weighted average trading price is less than $11.30 per share,
then Equity One may pay those UIRT shareholders who have elected to receive its
common stock an additional amount of merger consideration, payable at Equity
One's election in cash or more shares of Equity One common stock, equal to the
difference between the value of the Equity One shares received and $7.30. If
Equity One elects not to pay the additional amount, then UIRT may terminate the
Equity One merger agreement.

         As of the effective time of the mergers, no UIRT shares will be
outstanding; they will all be automatically canceled and retired. Each UIRT
shareholder will cease to have any shareholder rights, except the right to
receive the merger consideration of cash or shares of Equity One common stock.

         PRORATION. In connection with the mergers, you may not receive all of
your merger consideration in the form that you elect. In no event will cash be
paid for more than 50% of the UIRT common shares, and the merger consideration
that is not paid in cash will be paid in shares of Equity One common stock.
Accordingly, if a cash election is made, or is deemed to be made, for more than
50% of the UIRT common shares, then the actual amount of cash to be paid for
such cash elections would be proportionately reduced, and the remainder of the
merger consideration that is not paid in cash would be paid in Equity One common
stock. In addition, if elections to receive Equity One common stock are made for
more than 50% of the UIRT common shares, then the actual number of shares of
Equity One common stock to be issued may be proportionately reduced, at the
election of Equity One. If such an election is made by Equity One, the remainder
of the merger consideration that is not paid in Equity One common stock would be
paid in cash.

         In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, M.G.N. (USA),
Inc., an affiliate of Equity One and owner of approximately 9.8% of the
outstanding shares of UIRT, agreed in writing that it would elect to receive
Equity One common stock for each common share of UIRT that it owns. If
shareholders of UIRT oversubscribe for Equity One shares, M.G.N.'s consideration
will be adjusted in the same manner as the other UIRT Shareholders.

         NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fractional shares of Equity One common stock
will be issued in the mergers. UIRT shareholders will receive a cash payment in
lieu of fractional Equity One shares.

         PAYING AGENT. Promptly after the effective time of the mergers, Equity
One will deposit with a paying agent cash and certificates evidencing shares of
Equity One common stock sufficient to pay the merger consideration pursuant to
the merger agreements.

         ELECTION PROCEDURES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES. Copies of the form of
election have been included with the mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus
and will be made available to persons who become record holders after this
mailing prior to the effective time of the merger. To be effective, a form of
election must be:

         o    properly completed, signed and submitted to the paying agent; and

         o    received by the paying agent before the election deadline, which
              is 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the _______ __, 2001, the day
              immediately preceding the special meeting.

         The paying agent has the discretion to determine whether a UIRT
shareholder has properly completed, signed, and submitted, or revoked, a form of
election and to disregard immaterial defects in the form of election. Neither
Equity One nor the paying agent is under any obligation to notify any person of
any defect in a form of election submitted to the paying agent. The paying agent
will also make all computations in respect of the payment of the merger
consideration, and all such computations will be conclusive and binding on UIRT
shareholders. An election may be changed by any UIRT shareholder by completing
and submitting a later dated form of election prior to the election deadline.

         A UIRT shareholder who submits an untimely or improperly completed form
of election will be deemed not to have made an election. That shareholder's UIRT
shares will be treated as shares that the shareholder elected to exchange for
cash.

EXCHANGE AND PAYMENT PROCEDURES

         After a UIRT shareholder submits his or her UIRT share certificates, a
letter of transmittal and other documents that may be required, the UIRT
shareholder will be entitled to receive cash or a certificate representing
Equity One shares. The merger consideration may be delivered to someone who is
not listed in UIRT's transfer records if he or she presents a UIRT share
certificate to the paying agent along with all documents required to evidence
that a transfer of the UIRT share certificate has been made to him or her and
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrender, each
UIRT share certificate will be deemed at any time after the effective time of
the mergers to represent only the right to receive the merger consideration upon
surrender.

         PAYMENTS FOLLOWING SURRENDER. Until they have surrendered their UIRT
share certificates, holders of UIRT share certificates who elect to receive
Equity One shares will not receive:

         o    dividends and other distributions with respect to Equity One
              shares that they are entitled to pursuant to the mergers and that
              are declared or made with a record date after the effective time;
              or

         o    cash instead of fractional Equity One shares payable pursuant to
              the merger agreements.

         At the time of surrender, UIRT shareholders will receive the cash
payable in place of fractional Equity One shares to which the UIRT shareholders
are entitled under the merger agreements and the dividends or other
distributions that have been paid to Equity One shareholders if such
distributions had a record date after the effective time. These UIRT
shareholders will also be paid on the appropriate payment date the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time,
but prior to surrender, and a payment date subsequent to surrender.

         SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD NOT RETURN CERTIFICATES WITH THE ENCLOSED PROXY.
COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPERLY MAKING AN ELECTION TO RECEIVE CASH OR SHARES
OF EQUITY ONE COMMON STOCK ARE INCLUDED IN THIS MAILING TO UIRT SHAREHOLDERS AND
SHOULD BE FOLLOWED IN ORDER TO MAKE A TIMELY ELECTION OF CASH OR SHARES OF
EQUITY ONE COMMON STOCK.

CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME OF MERGERS

         If the merger agreements and the mergers are approved at the special
meeting, Equity One and UIRT currently expect to complete the mergers as soon as
practicable following receipt of shareholder approval, but in no event later
than the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
under the merger agreements. However, the Equity One merger agreement provides
that the Equity One merger cannot be completed prior to September 16, 2001.

         Once all conditions to the completion of the mergers are satisfied,
Equity One and UIRT will execute and file articles of merger with the County
Clerk's Office in Harris County, Texas and with the State Department of
Assessments and Taxation of Maryland relating to the mergers. The effective time
of the mergers will be the time specified in the articles of merger.

NO SOLICITATION

         The Equity One merger agreement contains detailed provisions
prohibiting UIRT from taking actions with respect to a competing acquisition
transaction as an alternative to the mergers. Under these "no solicitation"
provisions, UIRT has agreed that it and its representatives will:

         o    terminate any existing discussions or negotiations with any
              persons or entities conducted before the merger agreement with
              respect to any competing acquisition transaction;

         o    not enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations
              with, furnish any non-public information relating to UIRT or any
              of its subsidiaries or otherwise provide assistance to any
              corporation, partnership, person or other entity or group, other
              than Equity One or any affiliate or representative of Equity One,
              concerning any competing acquisition transaction;

         o    not knowingly encourage, solicit, or initiate the submission of a
              proposal related to a competing acquisition transaction; and

         o    not enter into any agreement requiring it to abandon, terminate or
              fail to consummate the mergers or any other transactions
              contemplated by the merger agreements.

         However, the Equity One merger agreement does permit UIRT and it board
of trust managers to comply with certain takeover provisions of the federal
securities laws and to take actions with respect to competing acquisition
transaction in order to fulfill their fiduciary duties, based on the advice of
counsel, even if these actions violate the "no solicitation" covenants.

OTHER AGREEMENTS

         ACCESS TO INFORMATION. UIRT agreed for the period between the execution
of the Equity One merger agreement and the completion of the mergers to give
Equity One and its representatives access, subject to reasonable restrictions
imposed by an executive officer of UIRT, to all key employees, property
managers, offices, real estate properties and other facilities and to all books
and records of UIRT and its subsidiaries and to seek to cause UIRT's and its
subsidiaries' independent public accountants to provide access to their work
papers and such other information as Equity One may reasonably require. In
addition, UIRT agreed to cause its officers and those of its subsidiaries to
furnish Equity One with such financial and operating data and other information
with respect to the business, properties and personnel of UIRT and its
subsidiaries as Equity One may reasonably require.

         REASONABLE EFFORTS. Both Equity One and UIRT agreed to use all
reasonable efforts to take all appropriate action, and to do all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to complete
the mergers as soon as practicable, including:

         o    respond to all inquiries received from any governmental
              authorities in connection with antitrust matters;

         o    use all reasonable efforts to have the registration statement, of
              which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part, declared
              effective with the SEC; and

         o    use all reasonable efforts to obtain consents of all third parties
              and governmental bodies necessary or advisable to complete the
              mergers.

         NOTICE. UIRT shall give prompt notice to Equity One, and Equity One
shall give prompt notice to UIRT, of the following:

         o    the occurrence of any event which is likely to cause any
              representation or warranty of either party to be untrue or
              inaccurate in any material respect;

         o    any material failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any
              covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
              by it; and

         o    the submission to UIRT, by any person, of an inquiry or proposal
              related to a competing acquisition transaction.

         STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING. Equity One shall submit an application to the
New York Stock Exchange requesting the listing of the shares of Equity One
common stock to be issued to UIRT shareholders in the mergers. UIRT will
cooperate with Equity One to gain approval for the listing.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENTS

         Prior to the termination of the Equity One merger agreement, the
reorganization merger agreement may not be modified or terminated without the
written consent of Equity One.

         The Equity One merger agreement may be terminated at any time before
the completion of the Equity One merger, including after the approval of UIRT
shareholders, as follows:

         o    by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Equity One board
              of directors and the board of trust managers of UIRT;

         o    by either Equity One or UIRT if the Equity One merger is not
              completed on or before November 30, 2001;

         o    by either Equity One or UIRT if any order, decree or ruling of any
              court restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
              completion of the merger becomes final and non-appealable;

         o    by Equity One, prior to UIRT shareholder approval, if the board of
              trust managers of UIRT withdraws or modifies, in a manner adverse
              to Equity One, its favorable recommendation of the Equity One
              merger or shall have recommended a competing acquisition
              transaction with a party other than Equity One or any of its
              affiliates;

         o    by Equity One if (i) any of the representations and warranties of
              UIRT or UIRT Holding Corp. contained in the Equity One merger
              agreement were untrue in any material respect when made or have
              since become, and at the time of termination remain, untrue in any
              material respect, or (ii) UIRT or UIRT Holding Corp. shall have
              breached or failed to comply in any material respect with any of
              its obligations under the merger agreement, and, in either
              circumstance, the failure of such representation and warranty to
              be true or the breach or failure shall continue unremedied for ten
              business days after

              UIRT has received written notice from Equity One of the occurrence
              of such failure to be true, breach or failure;

         o    by UIRT if (i) any of the representations and warranties of Equity
              One contained in the Equity One merger agreement were untrue in
              any material respect when made or have since become, and at the
              time of termination remain, untrue in any material respect, or
              (ii) Equity One shall have breached or failed to comply in any
              material respect with any of its obligations under the agreement,
              and, in either circumstance, the failure of such representation
              and warranty to be true or the breach or failure shall continue
              unremedied for ten business days after Equity One has received
              written notice from UIRT of the occurrence of such failure to be
              true, breach or failure;

         o    by UIRT, prior to its shareholder approval, if it receives a
              written offer with respect to any competing acquisition with a
              party other than Equity One or its affiliates or such other party
              has commenced a tender offer which, in either case, the board of
              trust managers of UIRT believes is more favorable to UIRT's
              shareholders than the Equity One merger;

         o    by Equity One or UIRT if the Equity One merger shall not have been
              approved and adopted by UIRT's shareholders at the special
              meeting;

         o    by UIRT if the 20-day weighted average trading price of Equity
              One's common stock is less than $11.30 per share on the third day
              prior to the closing date and UIRT provides notice within one
              business day thereafter of its intent to terminate the Equity One
              merger agreement and Equity One does not provide notice to UIRT
              and elect in writing, within one business day following UIRT's
              termination notice, to adjust the exchange price in accordance
              with the Equity One merger agreement; or

         o    by UIRT if the 20-day weighted average trading price of Equity
              One's shares is at any time prior to the completion of the Equity
              One merger less than $9.50 per share, and UIRT provides notice
              within seven days of its intent to terminate, and, on the date of
              the notice, the price remains below $9.50 per share.

         If the Equity One merger agreement is terminated and the Equity One
merger is abandoned, the merger agreement shall become void and have no effect,
without any liability on the part of any party or its trust managers, directors,
officers or shareholders.

TERMINATION FEES

         UIRT will pay to Equity One a termination fee in the amount of $2
million if the Equity One merger agreement is terminated:

         o    by Equity One if (i) any of the representations and warranties of
              UIRT or UIRT Holding Corp. contained in the Equity One merger
              agreement were untrue in any material respect when made or have
              since become, and at the time of termination remain, untrue in any
              material respect, or (ii) UIRT or UIRT Holding Corp. shall have
              breached or failed to comply in any material respect with any of
              its obligations under the Equity One merger agreement, and, in
              either circumstance, the failure of such representation and
              warranty to be true or the breach or failure shall continue
              unremedied for ten (10) business days after UIRT has received
              written notice from Equity One of the occurrence of such failure
              to be true, breach or failure;

         o    by Equity One if the board of trust managers of UIRT withdraws or
              modifies, in a manner adverse to Equity One, its favorable
              recommendation of the Equity One merger or shall have recommended
              a competing acquisition transaction with a party other than Equity
              One or any of its affiliates; or

         o    by Equity One if UIRT's shareholders fail to approve and adopt the
              Equity One merger and the Equity One merger agreement and at the
              time of the failure there shall exist a bona fide proposal for a

              competing acquisition transaction and within twelve months after
              the date of termination UIRT enters into a definitive agreement
              with any third party with respect to an acquisition transaction.

EXPENSES

         Whether or not the mergers are completed, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreements shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, except as
provided expressly to the contrary.

INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INSURANCE

         Under the merger agreement, Equity One will provide indemnification for
each person who has been at any time on or before the date of the Equity One
merger agreement, an officer, employee or trust manager of UIRT or any UIRT
subsidiary as provided in the charter and bylaws of UIRT or its subsidiaries or
as provided in any indemnification agreement between UIRT and its employees,
officers and trust managers. Equity One will provide this indemnification to
these persons without modification for a period at least as long as the
applicable statute of limitations. This indemnification covers actions only on
or before the completion of the Equity One merger, including all transactions
contemplated by the Equity One merger agreement. In order to comply with its
indemnification obligations, Equity One will periodically advance expenses as
incurred by the indemnified parties with respect to any action to enforce rights
to indemnification.

         In addition, Equity One agreed, subject to the approval of UIRT prior
to the completion of the Equity One merger, to either obtain continuation
coverage for runoff liability with respect to UIRT's existing officers' and
trust managers' or fiduciary liability insurance policies with premiums not to
exceed $135,000 in the aggregate or, in lieu of providing that run-off coverage,
to provide officers' and trust managers' and fiduciary liability insurance with
limits not less than existing policies for a period of three years and premiums
not in excess of $45,000 per year.

PRE-MERGER DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

         UIRT agreed that, prior to the completion of the mergers, it will not
declare, set aside, make or pay any dividend or distribution, whether in cash,
stock or property, on any of its shares of beneficial interest or capital stock
or the capital stock of any of its subsidiaries, other than cash dividends paid
to UIRT wholly owned subsidiaries with regard to their capital stock, other than
its regular dividend payable to its shareholders in the third quarter of 2001 of
$0.13 per share. In addition, UIRT may also pay, if necessary, a final dividend
in an amount equal to the minimum amount necessary to maintain UIRT's REIT
status under the Internal Revenue Code and to avoid the payment of any corporate
level tax with respect to undistributed income or gain as required by the merger
agreements. After the completion of the mergers, former holders of UIRT common
shares will receive the distributions payable to all holders of Equity One
common stock with a record date after the closing.

WAIVER AND AMENDMENT OF THE MERGER AGREEMENTS

         At any time before the completion of the Equity One merger, the board
of trust managers of UIRT and the board of directors of Equity One, may:

         o    extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
              other acts of the other party;

         o    waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
              contained in the Equity One merger agreement by any other
              applicable party or in any document, certificate or writing
              delivered pursuant to the Equity One merger agreement by any other
              applicable party; or

         o    waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
              contained in the Equity One merger agreement.

         Any agreement on the part of any party to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party.

         To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Equity One merger
agreement may be amended by action taken by or on behalf of the board of trust
managers of UIRT and the boards of directors of Equity One at any time before or
after adoption of the Equity One merger agreement by the shareholders of UIRT
but, after any such shareholder approval, no amendment shall be made which
decreases the merger consideration or which adversely affects the rights of
UIRT's shareholders under the Equity One merger agreement without the approval
of UIRT's shareholders. The Equity One merger agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties.

TERMINATION OF ADVISORY AGREEMENT

         Pursuant to the Equity One merger agreement, on June 15, 2001, UIRT
gave notice to FCA Corp of its intention to terminate the advisory agreement
with respect to the management of UIRT's properties. The termination shall be
effective on December 15, 2001. Under the terms of the advisory agreement, upon
termination UIRT, or Equity One if after the merger, is required to pay FCA Corp
a termination fee equal to approximately $_______.

UIRT SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

         Pursuant to the merger agreement, UIRT and its board of trust managers
agreed to enter into an amendment to UIRT's rights plan which would make that
plan inapplicable to the mergers and to Equity One and its affiliates and exempt
the completion of the mergers from the terms of that plan.

SETTLEMENT OF SOUTHWEST SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION

         Prior to the execution of the Equity One merger agreement, Southwest
agreed with Equity One that upon the completion of the Equity One merger and
payment by Equity One of a amount equal to $750,000, Southwest will not appeal
the order dismissing the lawsuit and will move to dismiss the lawsuit with
prejudice. Southwest may elect to be paid either in cash or shares of Equity One
common stock.

                COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER AND SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS

         The following is a summary of the material differences between the
rights of Equity One and UIRT Holding Corp. stockholders and rights of UIRT
shareholders. As Maryland corporations, Equity One and UIRT Holding Corp. are
subject to the Maryland General Corporation Law, or MGCL. As a Texas real estate
investment trust, UIRT is subject to the Texas Real Estate Investment Trust Act,
or the Texas REIT Act.

         The following discussion is not intended to be complete and is
qualified by reference to the charter and bylaws of Equity One and UIRT Holding
Corp., the declaration of trust and bylaws of UIRT and the applicable state law.
The charter and bylaws of Equity One and UIRT Holding Corp. and the declaration
of trust and bylaws of UIRT are incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus, and will be sent to shareholders of UIRT upon request. See
"Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 74.

         Except as specifically identified below, the rights of stockholders of
UIRT Holding Corp. are the same as the rights of stockholders of Equity One.

AUTHORIZED SHARES

         EQUITY ONE. Equity One is authorized to issue 45,000,000 shares of
stock, consisting of 40,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per
share, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share.

         Pursuant to the Equity One charter, the board of directors may amend
the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or
the number of shares of stock of any class or series without shareholder
approval. In addition, the Equity One charter authorizes the board of directors
to reclassify authorized but unissued common stock into preferred stock, and
authorized but unissued preferred stock into common stock, without shareholder
approval.

         On June 29, 2001, there were 13,011,901 shares of Equity One common
stock issued and outstanding and no shares of Equity One preferred stock issued
and outstanding.

         UIRT HOLDING CORP. UIRT Holding Corp. is authorized to issue
500,000,000 common shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share, and
50,000,000 preferred shares of beneficial interest, of which 20,000 shall be of
$100 par value per share and 49,980,000 shall be $0.01 par value per share.

         On June 29, 2001, there were 1,000 shares of UIRT Holding Corp. common
stock issued and outstanding and no shares of UIRT Holding Corp. preferred stock
issued and outstanding.

         UIRT. UIRT is authorized to issue 500,000,000 common shares of
beneficial interest, no par value per share, and 50,000,000 preferred shares of
beneficial interest, of which 20,000 shall be of $100 par value per share and
49,980,000 shall be of no par value per share.

         UIRT's declaration of trust authorizes the board of trust managers to
issue one or more series of preferred shares by adopting a resolution specifying
the number of shares to be issued. The number of shares set forth in such
resolution may be increased or decreased, but not below the number of shares of
such series then outstanding, by a resolution or resolutions likewise adopted by
the board of trust managers.

         On June 29, 2001, there were 8,650,602 common shares of beneficial
interest of UIRT issued and outstanding and no preferred shares of beneficial
interest of UIRT issued and outstanding.

VOTING RIGHTS

         EQUITY ONE. Each holder of Equity One common stock is entitled to one
vote per share and to the same and identical voting rights as other holders of
Equity One common stock. Holders of Equity One common stock do not have
cumulative voting rights. Except as provided by law or in the articles
supplementary establishing the series of Equity One preferred stock, holders of
Equity One preferred stock do not have voting rights.

         UIRT. Each holder of UIRT common stock is entitled to one vote per
share and to the same and identical voting rights as other holders of UIRT
common shares. Holders of UIRT common shares do not have cumulative voting
rights. Except as provided by law, or as specifically provided in any resolution
of the trust managers, holders of UIRT preferred shares do not have any voting
rights.

CLASSIFICATION OF THE BOARD

         EQUITY ONE. The MGCL permits a Maryland corporation to divide its board
of directors into classes with staggered terms of office so long as the term of
office of at least one class expires each year. The Equity One charter divides
the Equity One board of directors into three classes, as nearly equal in number
as possible, with classes being elected to three-year terms on a rotating basis.

         UIRT. The UIRT bylaws provide that each trust manager is elected or
re-elected by a vote of the majority of outstanding shares at each annual
meeting and remains in office until his successor is elected and qualified, or
until his death, resignation, or removal.

NUMBER OF DIRECTORS/TRUST MANAGERS; REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS/TRUST MANAGERS;
VACANCIES

         EQUITY ONE. The Equity One charter provides that the board of directors
may increase or decrease the number of directors provided that the number
thereof shall never be less than the minimum number required by the MGCL nor
more than 15.

         Pursuant to the Equity One charter, subject to the rights of one or
more classes or series of preferred stock to elect one or more directors, any
and all directors may be removed from office at any time, but only with cause,
and by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be
cast generally in the election for directors. Equity One's charter defines
"cause" to mean a conviction of a felony or a final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction holding that the director caused demonstrable, material
harm to Equity One through bad faith or active and deliberate dishonesty.

         Under the Equity One bylaws, any vacancy on the board of directors for
any cause other than an increase in the number of directors shall be filled by a
majority of the remaining directors, even if such majority is less than a
quorum. Any vacancy on the board of directors created by an increase in the
number of directors may be filled by a majority vote of the entire board of
directors. Any individual so elected as a director shall hold office until the
next annual meeting of stockholders and until his successor is elected and
qualifies.

         UIRT. The UIRT declaration of trust provides that there shall be no
less than two nor more than nine trust managers. The number of trust managers
may be fixed by resolution adopted by a majority of the trust managers. Pursuant
to the UIRT bylaws, a majority of the trust managers must be independent trust
managers. If the number of trust managers is two, the bylaws require that only
one trust manager be an independent trust manager. The term "independent trust
manager" is defined as a trust manager who does not perform any services for
UIRT, except in the capacity of a trust manager, and is not an affiliate of any
person or entity that performs any services for UIRT, other than as a trust
manager.

         Pursuant to the UIRT bylaws, a trust manager may be removed at any time
with or without cause by the vote of holders of shares representing two-thirds
of the total votes authorized to be cast by shares then outstanding and entitled
to vote thereon.

         Under the UIRT bylaws, vacancies may be filled by successor trust
managers either appointed by a majority of the remaining trust managers or
elected by the vote of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares
at an annual or special meeting of the shareholders. Any trust manager elected
to fill a vacancy shall hold office for the unexpired term of the former trust
manager.

LIMITATION OF DIRECTOR/TRUST MANAGER AND OFFICER LIABILITY

         EQUITY ONE. The MGCL permits a corporation to include in its charter
any provision expanding or limiting the liability of its directors and officers
to the corporation or its stockholders for money damages, but prohibits the

inclusion of any provision which restricts or limits the liability of its
directors or officers or shareholders to the extent that:

         o    it is proved that the person actually received an improper benefit
              or profit in money, property or services, for the amount of the
              benefit or profit in money, property or services actually
              received; or

         o    a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the person is
              entered in a proceeding based on a finding that the person's
              action, or failure to act, was the result of active and deliberate
              dishonesty and was material to the cause of action adjudicated in
              the proceeding.

         The Equity One charter provides that, to the maximum extent that the
MGCL permits, no director or officer of Equity One shall be liable to Equity One
or to any shareholder for money damages.

         UIRT. The UIRT declaration of trust provides that no trust manager or
officer of UIRT shall be liable to UIRT for any act, omission, loss, damage, or
expense arising from the performance of his or her duties to UIRT save only for
his or her own willful misfeasance or malfeasance or negligence. The Texas REIT
Act and the UIRT declaration of trust both permit trust managers and officers to
rely upon expert advice in making their decisions.

INDEMNIFICATION

         EQUITY ONE. The MGCL allows corporations to indemnify any person who
was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending
or completed action or suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was
a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or is or was serving
at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, partner,
trustee, or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, other enterprise, unless it is established that:

         o    the act or omission was material to the matter giving rise to the
              proceeding and either was committed in bad faith or was the result
              of active and deliberate dishonesty;

         o    the person actually received an improper personal benefit in
              money, property or services; or

         o    in the case of any criminal proceeding, the person had reasonable
              cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful.

         Under the MGCL, indemnity may be provided against judgments, penalties,
fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by the person in
connection with the proceeding. The indemnification may be provided, however,
only if authorized for a specific proceeding after a determination has been made
that indemnification is permissible in the circumstances because the person met
the applicable standard of conduct. This determination is required to be made:

         o    by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum
              consisting of directors not, at the time, parties to the
              proceeding;

         o    if a quorum cannot be obtained, then by a majority vote of a
              committee of the board consisting solely of two or more directors
              not, at the time, parties to the proceeding;

         o    by special legal counsel; or

         o    by the shareholders.

         If the proceeding is one by or in the right of the corporation,
indemnification may not be provided as to any proceeding in which the person is
found liable to the corporation.

         A Maryland corporation may pay, before final disposition, the expenses,
including attorneys' fees, incurred by a director, officer, employee or agent in
defending a proceeding. Under the MGCL, expenses may be advanced to a director
or officer when the trustee or officer gives an undertaking to the corporation
to repay the amounts

advanced if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to
indemnification. The MGCL does not require that the undertaking be secured and
the undertaking may be accepted without reference to the financial ability of
the director or officer to repay the advance. A Maryland corporation is required
to indemnify any director who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise,
in defense of a proceeding for reasonable expenses. The determination as to
reasonableness of expenses is required to be made in the same manner as required
for indemnification.

         Under the MGCL, the indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided by statute are not exclusive of any other rights to which a person
seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any
bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders, vote of directors or otherwise.

         The Equity One bylaws require the corporation to indemnify, to the
maximum extent permitted by the MGCL and, without requiring a preliminary
determination of the ultimate entitlement to indemnification, to pay or
reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding
to:

         o    any individual who is a present or former director or officer of
              Equity One and who is made a party to the proceeding by reason of
              his service in that capacity; or

         o    any individual who, while a director of Equity One and at the
              request of Equity One, serves or has served another corporation,
              real estate investment trust, partnership, joint venture, trust,
              employee benefit plan or any other enterprise as a director,
              officer, partner, managing member or trustee of such entity and
              who is made a party to the proceeding by reason of his service in
              that capacity.

         Equity One may, with the approval of its board of directors, provide
such indemnification and advance expenses to a person who served a predecessor
of Equity One in any of the capacities described in the two clauses above and to
any employee or agent of Equity One or a predecessor of Equity One.

         UIRT. The Texas REIT Act permits a Texas REIT to indemnify a person who
was, is or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding because the person
is or was a trust manager only if:

         o    it is determined that the person conducted himself in good faith;

         o    reasonably believed in the case of conduct in his official
              capacity as a trust manager of the REIT, that his conduct was in
              the REIT's best interest, and in all other cases, that his conduct
              was at least not opposed to the REIT's best interests; and

         o    in the case of criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
              believe that his conduct was unlawful.

         The Texas REIT Act, with limited exceptions, forbids the
indemnification of a trust manager in respect of a proceeding in which the
person is found liable on the basis that personal benefit was improperly
received by him, whether or not the benefit resulted from an action taken in the
person's official capacity or in which the person is found liable to the REIT.

         The UIRT bylaws provide indemnification for:

         o    any present or former trust manager or officer of UIRT;

         o    any person who while serving as a present or former trust manager
              or officer of UIRT served at UIRT's request as a director,
              officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent
              or similar functionary of another REIT or foreign or domestic
              corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship,
              trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise; and

         o    any person nominated or designated by, or pursuant to authority
              granted by, the trust managers or any committee thereof to serve
              in any of the capacities referred to in the prior two clauses.

         The bylaws go on to require UIRT to indemnify every individual meeting
the above qualifications against all judgments, penalties, including excise and
similar taxes, fines, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable expenses
actually incurred by the individual in connection with any proceeding in which
he was, is or is threatened to be named defendant or respondent, or in which he
was or is a witness without being named a defendant or respondent, by reason, in
whole or in part, of his serving or having served, or having been nominated or
designated to serve in any of the above capacities. However, this
indemnification obligation is premised on the condition that the individual met
the minimum standards provided in the Texas REIT Act; provided, however, that in
the event that an individual is found liable to UIRT or is found liable on the
basis that personal benefit was improperly received by the individual, the
indemnification is limited to reasonable expenses actually incurred by the
individual in connection with the proceeding and shall not be made in respect of
any proceeding in which the individual was found liable for willful or
intentional misconduct in the performance of his duty to UIRT. The bylaws
further provide that no indemnification shall be made in respect to any
proceeding in which the individual is found liable on the basis that personal
benefit was improperly received by him, whether or not the benefit resulted from
an action taken in the individual's official capacity or found liable to UIRT.

STATUTORY TAKEOVER PROVISIONS

         EQUITY ONE. The MGCL provides protection for Maryland corporations
against unsolicited takeovers by protecting the board of directors with regard
to actions taken in a takeover context. The MGCL provides that the duties of
directors will not require them to:

         o    accept, recommend, or respond to any proposal by a person seeking
              to acquire control;

         o    make a determination under the Maryland Business Combination
              Statute or the Control Share Acquisition Statute, as described
              below;

         o    elect to be subject to any or all of the "elective provisions"
              described below; or

         o    act or fail to act solely because of:

              --   the effect the act or failure to act may have on an
                   acquisition or potential acquisition of control; or

              --   the amount or type of consideration that may be offered or
                   paid to shareholders in an acquisition.

         The MGCL also establishes a presumption that the act of a director
satisfies the required standard of care. In the case of a Maryland corporation,
a director must perform his or her duties in good faith, in a manner that is in
the best interests of the corporation and with the care of an ordinarily prudent
person under similar circumstances. In addition, an act of a director relating
to or affecting an acquisition or a potential acquisition of control is not
subject under the MGCL to a higher duty or greater scrutiny than is applied to
any other act of a director or trustee. This provision creates a Maryland rule
which is less exacting than case law in many other jurisdictions which imposes
an enhanced level of scrutiny when a board implements anti-takeover measures in
a change of control context, and shifts the burden of proof to directors to show
that the defensive mechanism adopted by a board is reasonable in relation to the
threat posed.

         Maryland legislation enacted in 1999 allows publicly held Maryland
corporations to elect to be governed by all or any part of Maryland law
provisions relating to extraordinary actions and unsolicited takeovers. The
election to be governed by one or more of these provisions can be made by a
Maryland corporation in its charter or bylaws or by resolution adopted by the
board of directors so long as the corporation has at least three directors who,
at the time of electing to be subject to the provisions, are not:

         o    officers or employees of the corporation;

         o    persons seeking to acquire control of the corporation;

         o    directors, officers, affiliates or associates of any person
              seeking to acquire control; or

         o    nominated or designated as directors by a person seeking to
              acquire control.

         Articles supplementary must be filed with the Maryland State Department
of Assessments and Taxation if a Maryland corporation elects to be subject to
any or all of the provisions by board resolution or bylaw amendment. Shareholder
approval is not required for the filing of articles supplementary.

         The Maryland legislation provides that a corporation can elect to be
subject to all or any portion of the following provisions notwithstanding any
contrary provisions contained in the corporation's existing charter or bylaws:

         o    CLASSIFIED BOARD: The corporation may divide its board into three
              classes which, to the extent possible, will have the same number
              of directors, the terms of which will expire at the third annual
              meeting of shareholders after the election of each such class;

         o    TWO-THIRDS SHAREHOLDER VOTE TO REMOVE DIRECTORS ONLY FOR CAUSE:
              The stockholders may remove any director, as applicable, only by
              the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes
              entitled to be cast by the stockholders generally in the election
              of directors, but a director may not be removed without cause;

         o    SIZE OF BOARD FIXED BY VOTE OF BOARD: The number of directors, as
              applicable, will be fixed only by resolution of the board;

         o    BOARD VACANCIES FILLED BY THE BOARD FOR THE REMAINING TERM:
              Vacancies that result from an increase in the size of the board,
              or the death, resignation, or removal of a trustee or director,
              may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
              remaining directors even if they do not constitute a quorum.
              Directors elected to fill vacancies shall hold office for the
              remainder of the full term of the class of trustees or directors
              in which the vacancy occurred, as opposed to until the next annual
              meeting of stockholders, and until a successor is elected and
              qualifies; and

         o    SHAREHOLDER CALLS OF SPECIAL MEETINGS: Special meetings of
              stockholders shall be called by the secretary of the corporation
              only upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast at
              least a majority of all votes entitled to be cast at the meeting.

         Equity One has not elected to be governed by the specific provisions of
the 1999 legislation. However, even prior to the 1999 legislation, the Equity
One charter and/or bylaws, as applicable, already provided for a classified
board and that the number of directors is to be determined by a resolution of
the board, subject to a minimum and maximum number.

         UIRT. The Texas REIT Act does not contain any provisions regarding
unsolicited takeovers.

CALL OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS OR SHAREHOLDERS

         EQUITY ONE. The Equity One bylaws provide that special meetings of
stockholders may be called by the board of directors, the president, or the
chief executive officer. Special meetings of the stockholders may also be called
by the secretary of the corporation upon the written request of the holders of
shares entitled to cast not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be
cast at such meeting.

         UIRT. The UIRT bylaws provide that special meetings of the
shareholders, unless otherwise prescribed by law or the declaration of trust,
may be called by the trust managers, any executive officer of UIRT or the
holders of at least five percent of all of the shares entitled to vote at the
meetings.

SHAREHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT

         EQUITY ONE. The Equity One bylaws do not permit shareholder action by
written consent.

         UIRT. The UIRT bylaws provide that any action required or permitted to
be taken at a meeting of shareholders can be taken without a meeting if a
consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by all

of the shareholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof,
and such consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the
shareholders.

ADVANCE NOTICE PROVISIONS FOR SHAREHOLDER NOMINATIONS AND SHAREHOLDER NEW
BUSINESS PROPOSALS

         EQUITY ONE. The Equity One bylaws require advance written notice for
stockholders to nominate a director or bring other business before a meeting of
stockholders.

         For an annual meeting, a stockholder must deliver notice to the
secretary of Equity One not later than the close of business on the 60th day nor
earlier than the close of business on the 90th day before the first anniversary
of the preceding year's annual meeting. However, if the date of the annual
meeting is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed by more than 60 days from
the applicable anniversary date of the prior year's annual meeting, or the
meeting is a special meeting of shareholders at which directors will be elected,
notice by the shareholder must be given not earlier than the close of business
on the 90th day before the meeting and not later than the close of business on
the later of the 60th day before the meeting or the tenth day following the day
on which public announcement of the date of the meeting is first made by Equity
One.

         The Equity One bylaws contain detailed requirements for the contents of
shareholder notices of directors nominations and new business.

         UIRT. The UIRT bylaws require advance written notice for shareholders
to nominate a trust manager or bring other business before a meeting of
shareholders.

         For an annual meeting, a stockholder must deliver notice to the
secretary of UIRT not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days before the
applicable annual meeting of shareholders. However, in the event that less than
70 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting be given
or made, notice by the shareholders to be timely must be so received not later
than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such
notice of the date of the applicable annual meeting was mailed or such public
disclosure of the date of such annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs.

         The UIRT bylaws contain detailed requirements for the contents of
shareholders notices of trust manager nominations and new business.

AMENDMENT OF THE EQUITY ONE CHARTER AND THE UIRT DECLARATION OF TRUST

         EQUITY ONE. In order to amend the Equity One charter, an affirmative
stockholder vote of a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter is
required. However, in order to amend the sections of the charter regarding REIT
qualification and voting requirements to amend the charter, an affirmative
shareholder vote of two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the
matter is required.

         UIRT. Except as otherwise specified, the UIRT declaration of trust
provides that it may be amended by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds
of the outstanding voting shares. However, an affirmative vote of the holders of
at least 80% of outstanding voting shares is required in order to amend the
provisions of the declaration of trust relating to:

         o    the prohibition against engaging in non-real estate investment
              trust businesses;

         o    the approval of business combinations with related persons;

         o    the number and removal of trust managers;

         o    the share ownership limits; and

         o    the vote required to amend the declaration of trust.

AMENDMENT OF THE BYLAWS

         EQUITY ONE. The Equity One bylaws provide that the power to adopt,
alter, or repeal any provisions of the bylaws and to make new bylaws is vested
exclusively with the board of directors.

         UIRT. The UIRT bylaws may be amended by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the trust managers and, to the extent not inconsistent with the
Texas REIT Act and the declaration of trust, if specified in the notice of the
meeting, by the affirmative vote of holders of two-thirds, or, for some
provisions, a majority, of the outstanding common shares of UIRT. In addition,
the provisions of the bylaws relating to advance notice requirements for
business to be conducted at the annual meetings, the election and term of office
of the trust managers, nominations, removal and vacancies of trust managers and
the vote required to amend the bylaws may be amended by an affirmative vote of
the holders of two-thirds of UIRT's outstanding shares. All other bylaws may be
amended by the affirmative vote of a majority of the holders of UIRT's
outstanding shares.

MERGERS, CONSOLIDATIONS, AND SALE OF ASSETS

         EQUITY ONE. Under the MGCL, Equity One may approve a consolidation,
merger, share exchange or transfer of assets by adopting a resolution that
declares the proposed transaction is advisable on substantially the terms and
conditions set forth in the resolution and directing that the proposed
transaction be submitted for consideration at either an annual or special
meeting of the stockholders. Notice which states that the purpose of the meeting
will be to act on the proposed consolidation, merger, share exchange or transfer
of assets must be provided to each stockholder entitled to vote on the proposed
transaction and to each stockholder not entitled to vote on the proposed
transaction, except the stockholders of a successor in a merger if the merger
does not alter the contract rights of their stock as expressly provided in the
charter.

         Under the MGCL, a proposed merger ordinarily requires the approval of
stockholders by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the votes entitled to
vote on the proposed merger. However, approval of a merger by stockholder's is
not required if:

         o    the merger does not reclassify or change the terms of any class or
              series of stock that is outstanding immediately before the merger
              becomes effective or otherwise amend its charter; and

         o    the number of shares of its stock of such class or series
              outstanding immediately after the effective time of the merger
              does not increase by more than 20% of the number of its shares of
              the class or series of stock that is outstanding immediately
              before the merger becomes effective, or there is no stock
              outstanding or subscribed for and entitled to be voted on the
              merger.

         Under these circumstances, a majority vote of the entire board of
directors is sufficient for approval.

         UIRT. Under the Texas REIT Act, an affirmative vote of the holders of
at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares is required for approval of a plan
of merger. Prior to the shareholder vote, the trust managers must adopt a
resolution either recommending that the plan of merger be approved or submitting
the plan of merger for approval without recommendation and, in connection with
the submission, communicate the basis for the trust manager's determination that
the plan be submitted to shareholders without any recommendation. UIRT must
notify each shareholder, whether or not the shareholder is entitled to vote, of
the shareholder meeting at which the plan of merger is to be submitted for
approval. The notice must be given at least 20 days before the meeting and must
state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider
the plan of merger. The notice must also be accompanied by a copy or summary of
the plan.

DISSOLUTION OF EQUITY ONE OR UIRT; TERMINATION OF REIT STATUS

         EQUITY ONE. Under the MGCL, Equity One may be dissolved if its board of
directors adopts a resolution which declares that dissolution is advisable and
directs that the proposed dissolution be submitted for consideration at either
an annual or special meeting of the stockholders. Notice which states that a
purpose of the meeting will be to act on the proposed dissolution must be given
to each stockholder entitled to vote on the proposed dissolution.

To be effective, the proposed dissolution must be approved by the stockholders
by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast.

         Equity One's charter requires that its board of directors use its
reasonable efforts to take such action as are necessary or appropriate to
preserve the status of Equity One as a REIT. However, if the board of directors
determines that it is no longer in the best interests of Equity One to continue
to be qualified as a REIT, the board may revoke or otherwise terminate Equity
One's election to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.

         UIRT. Under the Texas REIT Act, UIRT may be dissolved by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting
shares.

         In addition, UIRT's declaration of trust requires that the board of
trust managers use their best efforts to cause UIRT and its shareholders to
qualify for U.S. federal income tax treatment in accordance with the provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to REITs. The declaration further
requires that the board of trust managers use their best efforts to take such
actions as are necessary, and may take such actions as it deems desirable, to
preserve the status of UIRT as a REIT.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS WITH INTERESTED SECURITYHOLDERS

         EQUITY ONE. The Maryland Business Combination Act provides that, unless
exempted, a Maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations,
including mergers, dispositions of 10% or more of its assets, issuances of
shares and other specified transactions, with an "interested shareholder" or its
affiliates, for five years after the most recent date on which the interested
shareholder became an interested shareholder. Thereafter, unless specified
"price criteria" and other standards are met or an exemption is available, a
business combination with an interested shareholder or its affiliates must be
recommended by the board of directors and approved by at least 80% of the
outstanding voting shares and at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting
shares, other than voting shares held by the interested shareholder or any of
its affiliates. Under the statute, an "interested shareholder" generally is
defined to mean a person or group which owns beneficially, directly or
indirectly, 10% or more of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation.
These requirements do not apply to a business combination with an interested
shareholder or its affiliates if approved by the board of directors before the
time the interested shareholder first became an interested shareholder.

         By resolution of its board of directors, Equity One exempted business
combinations between it and any of its officers or directors or any affiliate of
its officers or directors.

         UIRT. The UIRT declaration of trust requires that, except in certain
circumstances, a "business combination" between UIRT and a "related person" be
approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% of the outstanding UIRT
common shares, including the vote of the holders of not less than 50% of the
UIRT common shares not owned by the related person.

         The UIRT declaration of trust defines a "business combination" to
include:

         o    any merger or consolidation of UIRT with or into a related person;

         o    any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other
              disposition, of all or more than 35% of the book value of the
              total assets of UIRT and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as of
              the end of the last fiscal year, to or with a related person;

         o    the issuance or transfer by UIRT or a subsidiary, other than by
              way of a pro rata dividend to all UIRT shareholders, of any
              securities of UIRT or a subsidiary to a related person;

         o    any reclassification of securities or recapitalization by UIRT
              that would increase the voting power of the related person; or

         o    the adoption of any plan for the liquidation or dissolution of
              UIRT proposed by or on behalf of a related person which involves
              any transfer of assets or any other transaction in which the
              related person has any direct or indirect interest, except
              proportionately as a UIRT shareholder.

         The UIRT declaration of trust defines a "related person" to include any
individual, corporation, partnership or other person and the affiliates and
associates thereof which individually or together is the beneficial owner in the
aggregate of more than 50% of the outstanding UIRT common shares. The 50% voting
requirement referred to above is not applicable if the related person is
approved by the affirmative vote of holders of not less than 80% of the
outstanding UIRT common shares. Neither the 80% nor the 50% voting requirements
outlined above apply in certain circumstances, if:

         o    the UIRT board of trust managers, by a vote of not less than 80%
              of the trust managers then holding office, have expressly approved
              in advance the acquisition of UIRT common shares that caused the
              related person to become a related person or have expressly
              approved the business combination prior to the date on which the
              related person involved in the business combination shall have
              become a related person; or

         o    the business combination is solely between UIRT and another
              entity, 100% of the voting stock, shares or comparable interests
              of which is owned directly or indirectly by UIRT; or

         o    the business combination is proposed to be consummated within one
              year of the consummation of a "fair tender offer" (as defined in
              the UIRT declaration of trust) by the related person in which
              business combination the cash or the "fair market value" (as
              defined in the UIRT declaration of trust) of the property,
              securities or other consideration to be received per UIRT common
              share by all remaining holders of UIRT common shares in the
              business combination is not less than the price offered in the
              fair tender offer; or

         o    the rights to sell the related person shares described below have
              become exercisable; or

         o    all of the following conditions shall have been met:

              --     the business combination is a merger or consolidation,
                     consummation of which is proposed to take place within one
                     year of the date of the transaction pursuant to which such
                     person became a related person and the cash or fair market
                     value of the property, securities or other consideration to
                     be received per share by all remaining holders of UIRT
                     common shares in the business combination is not less than
                     the highest per UIRT common share price paid by the related
                     person in acquiring any of its holdings of UIRT common
                     shares, determined as of the date of consummation of such
                     business combination;

              --     the consideration to be received by such holders in either
                     cash or, if the related person shall have acquired the
                     majority of its holdings of UIRT common shares for a form
                     of consideration other than cash, in the same form of
                     consideration with which the related person acquired such
                     majority;

              --     after such person has become a related person and prior to
                     consummation of such business combination; (i) except as
                     approved by a majority of the unaffiliated trust managers
                     continuing in office, there shall have been no reduction in
                     the annual rate of dividends, if any, paid per share on the
                     UIRT common shares except any reduction proportionate with
                     any decline in UIRT's net income, and (ii) such related
                     person shall not have received the benefit, directly or
                     indirectly, of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or
                     other financial assistance or any tax credits or other tax
                     advantages provided by UIRT prior to the consummation of
                     such business combination, other than in connection with
                     financing a fair tender offer; and

              --     a proxy statement that conforms with the provisions of the
                     Exchange Act is mailed to the UIRT shareholders for the
                     purpose of soliciting shareholder approval of the business
                     combination.

         If a person has become a related person and within one year after the
date of the transaction pursuant to which the related person became a related
person a business combination meeting all of the requirements above regarding
the applicability of the 80% voting requirement shall not have been consummated,
a fair tender offer shall not have been consummated, and UIRT shall not have
been dissolved and liquidated, then, in such event, the beneficial owner of each
share, not including shares beneficially owned by the related person, will have
the right, which may be exercised, subject to certain conditions, commencing at
the opening of business on the one-year anniversary date of the date that person
became a related person and continuing for a period of 90 days thereafter, to
sell to UIRT one share upon exercise of such right. At 5:00 p.m., Houston, Texas
time, on the last day of that exercise period, each right not exercised will
become void, and, except as otherwise provided in the UIRT declaration of trust,
the certificates representing shares beneficially owned by such a beneficial
holder will no longer represent rights. The purchase price for a share upon
exercise of an accompanying right generally will be equal to the then-applicable
fair price paid by the related person pursuant to the exercise of the right
relating thereto.

CONTROL SHARE ACQUISITIONS

         EQUITY ONE. The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that
shares of a Maryland corporation that are acquired in a "control share
acquisition," which is defined as the acquisition of shares comprising
one-fifth, one-third or a majority of all voting shares, have no voting rights
except:

         o    if approved by shareholders by the affirmative vote of two-thirds
              of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all
              "interested shares"; or

         o    if the acquisition of the shares has been approved or exempted at
              any time before the acquisition of the shares.

         The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act is applicable to a publicly
traded Maryland corporation unless its charter or bylaws specifically provides
that it shall be inapplicable. Neither Equity One's bylaws nor its charter
contain such an opt-out provision.

         UIRT. Neither the Texas REIT Act nor UIRT's declaration of trust or
bylaws contain a similar control share acquisition provision.

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

         EQUITY ONE. Under Maryland corporate law, a shareholder has the right
to demand and receive payment of the fair value of his or her stock, unless:

         o    the shares are listed on a national securities exchange or are
              designated as a national market security on the interdealer
              quotation system of the National Association of Securities
              Dealers, Inc., or NASD, on the record date for determining
              shareholders entitled to vote on the merger; or

         o    the shares are those of a successor entity, as long as the merger
              does not alter the contract rights of the shares as expressly
              provided by the declaration of trust and the shares are converted
              in whole or in part in the merger into stock, including preferred
              stock, of the successor entity or cash, scrip, or other rights or
              interests arising out of the treatment of fractional shares.

         o    the charter of the corporation provides that stockholders are not
              entitled to receive payment of the fair value of their stock.

         UIRT HOLDING CORP. The charter of UIRT Holding Corp. does not permit
any objecting stockholder to exercise rights to the fair value of its stock.

         UIRT. Under the Texas REIT Act, any shareholder of a domestic REIT may
dissent from any of the following actions:

         o    any plan of merger to which the REIT is a party if the shareholder
              approval is required and the shareholder is entitled to vote on
              the matter

         o    any sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of all, or
              substantially all, of the property and assets, with or without
              good will, of a REIT requiring the special authorization of the
              shareholders; or

         o    any share exchange or acquisition in which the shares of the REIT
              of the class or series held by the shareholder are to be acquired.

         However, a shareholder may not dissent from any plan of merger in which
there is a single surviving or new domestic or foreign corporation, REIT,
partnership, or other entity, or from any plan of exchange, if:

         o    the shares held by the shareholder are part of a class or series,
              and on the record date fixed to determine the shareholders
              entitled to vote on the plan of merger or plan of exchange, the
              shares are listed on a national securities exchange, designated as
              a national market security on an interdealer quotation system by
              the NASD, or successor entity, or held of record by not less than
              2,000 holders; and

         o    the shareholder is not required by the terms of the plan of merger
              or plan of exchange to accept any consideration for the
              shareholder's shares other than (a) shares of a domestic or
              foreign entity that, immediately after the effective date of the
              merger, will be part of a class or series, shares of which are
              listed, or authorized for listing upon official notice of
              issuance, on a national securities exchange, approved for
              quotation as a national market security on an interdealer
              quotation system by the NASD or successor entity, or held of
              record by not less than 2,000 holders; (b) cash in lieu of
              fractional shares otherwise entitled to be received; or (c) any
              combination of the securities and cash described previously.

DISTRIBUTIONS

         EQUITY ONE. The MGCL provides that the board of directors may not make
a distribution of money or property to its stockholders if the distribution
would prevent the corporation from paying its debts as they became due in the
ordinary course of business or, unless and to the extent specifically allowed by
the corporation's charter, if after the distribution, the corporation's total
assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that
would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the
distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights to distributions upon
dissolution of the corporation's shareholders whose rights upon dissolution are
superior to those receiving the distribution.

         UIRT.  The Texas REIT Act provides that a REIT may not make a
distribution if:

         o    after giving effect to the distribution, the REIT would be
              insolvent; or

         o    the distribution exceeds the surplus of the REIT.

         UIRT's declaration of trust provides that the board of trust managers
of UIRT may pay dividends on its outstanding shares in cash, in property or in
its shares, except that no dividend shall be declared or paid when UIRT is
unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of its business,
or when the payment of such dividend would result in UIRT being unable to pay
its debts as they become due in the usual course of business.

SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLANS

         EQUITY ONE.  Equity One has not adopted a shareholder rights plan.

         UIRT. The UIRT Board adopted a rights plan and declared a dividend of
one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding UIRT common share. Each
purchase right entitles the registered holder to purchase from UIRT one
one-hundredth of a share of Series A Participating Preferred Share, par value
$.01 per share, or the preferred shares, of UIRT at a price of $13.00 per one
one-hundredth of a preferred share, subject to adjustment.

The description and terms of the purchase rights are set forth in a rights
agreement dated as of January 25, 2001, between UIRT and Fleet National Bank, as
rights agent.

         Until the earlier to occur of ten days following a public announcement
that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding UIRT common shares or ten
business days, or such later date as may be determined by action of the UIRT
board of trust managers prior to such time as any person or group of affiliated
persons becomes an acquiring person, following the commencement of, or
announcement of an intention to make, a tender offer or exchange offer the
consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or
group of 15% or more of the outstanding UIRT common shares, the purchase rights
will be evidenced by the certificates representing the UIRT common shares. The
date that an acquiring person acquires or commences actions to acquire the
requisite amount of UIRT shares is referred as the "distribution date."

         The rights agreement provides that, until the distribution date, the
purchase rights will be transferred with and only with the UIRT common shares.

         The purchase rights are not exercisable until the distribution date.
The purchase rights will expire on February 6, 2011, unless the expiration date
is extended or unless the purchase rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by
UIRT, in each case, as described below.

         At any time prior to the distribution date, purchase rights, other than
purchase rights owned by an acquiring person and the acquiring person's
affiliates and associates, which will have become void, may be exercised to
acquire, in lieu of preferred shares, at the then current purchase price of the
purchase right, that number of UIRT common shares which at such time will have a
market value of two [times] the purchase price of the purchase right.

         The purchase price payable, and the number of preferred shares or other
securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the purchase rights, are
subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution.

         In the event that UIRT is acquired in a merger or other business
combination transaction or 50% or more of its consolidated assets or earning
power are sold after a person or group has become an acquiring person, proper
provision will be made so that each holder of a purchase right, other than an
acquiring person and the affiliates and associates of such acquiring person,
whose purchase rights will have become void, will thereafter have the right to
receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then current exercise price of the
purchase right, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company
which at the time of such transaction will have a market value of two times the
purchase price of the purchase right. In the event that any person or group of
affiliated or associated persons becomes an acquiring person, proper provision
shall be made so that each holder of a purchase right, other than purchase
rights beneficially owned by the acquiring person or the affiliates and
associates of such acquiring persons, which will thereafter be void, will
thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise that number of UIRT common
shares having a market value of two times the purchase price of the purchase
right.

         At any time after any person or group becomes an acquiring person and
prior to the acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more of the
outstanding UIRT common shares, the UIRT board of trust managers may exchange
the purchase rights, other than purchase rights owned by such person or group
and their respective affiliates and associates which have become void, in whole
or in part, at an exchange ratio of one UIRT common share, or one one-hundredth
of a preferred share, per purchase right, subject to adjustment.

         At any time prior to or within 10 business days following the
acquisition by a person or group of affiliated or associated persons of
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding UIRT common shares, the
UIRT board of trust managers may redeem the purchase rights in whole, but not in
part, at a price of $.01 per purchase right The redemption of the purchase
rights may be made effective at such time on such basis with such conditions as
the UIRT board of trust managers in its sole discretion may establish.
Immediately upon any redemption of the purchase rights, the right to exercise
the purchase rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of purchase
rights will be to receive the redemption price.

REIT OWNERSHIP LIMITATIONS

         EQUITY ONE. For Equity One to qualify as a REIT under the Internal
Revenue Code, no more than 50% in value of its outstanding shares of beneficial
interest may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer
"individuals," which, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code for this purpose,
includes some entities. In addition, if Equity One, or an actual or constructive
owner of 10% or more of the shares of Equity One, owns, actually or
constructively, 10% or more of a tenant of Equity One, then the rent received by
Equity One from that "related party tenant" will not be qualifying income for
purposes of determining whether Equity One meets the requirements for
qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code unless the tenant is a
taxable REIT subsidiary and specified requirements are met. A REIT's shares also
must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons.

         As a means of addressing these requirements, Equity One's charter
provides that, subject to exceptions, no person may own, or be deemed to own
directly and/or by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code, more than 9.9%, in value or number of shares, whichever is more
restrictive, of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of
shares. Under the Equity One charter, the board of directors may increase the
ownership limit with respect to any class or series of shares. After giving
effect to this increase, however, five beneficial owners of common shares may
not beneficially own in the aggregate more than 49.5% of the outstanding common
shares. In addition, the Equity One board of directors may waive or modify the
ownership limit with respect to one or more persons who would not be treated as
"individuals" under the Internal Revenue Code if such person submits to the
Equity One board of trustees specified information that demonstrates, to the
reasonable satisfaction of the board of trustees, that such ownership would not
jeopardize Equity One's status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. The
Equity One charter further prohibits any person from transferring any Equity One
common or preferred shares if the transfer would result in shares of beneficial
interest of Equity One being owned by fewer than 100 persons or otherwise would
cause Equity One not to qualify as a REIT.

         If any transfer of shares or any other event would otherwise result in
any person violating the ownership limits, then the declaration of trust
provides that (a) the transfer will be void and of no force or effect with
respect to the prohibited transferee with respect to that number of shares that
exceeds the ownership limits and (b) the prohibited transferee would not acquire
any right or interest in the shares. The shares transferred in violation of the
ownership limit instead would be transferred automatically to a charitable
trust, the beneficiary of which would be a qualified charitable organization
selected by Equity One.

         The trustee of the charitable trust would be required to sell the
shares transferred in violation of the ownership limit to a person or entity who
could own the shares without violating the ownership limit, and to distribute to
the prohibited transferee an amount equal to the lesser of the price paid by
such person for the shares transferred in violation of the ownership limit or
the sales proceeds received by the charitable trust for the shares. In the case
of a transfer for no consideration, such as a gift, the charitable trustee would
be required to sell the shares to a qualified person or entity and distribute to
the prohibited transferee an amount equal to the lesser of the fair market value
of the shares as of the date of the prohibited transfer or the sales proceeds
received by the charitable trust.

         Under its declaration of trust, Equity One, or its designee, would have
the right to purchase the shares from the charitable trust at a price per share
equal to the lesser of (a) the price per share in the transaction that resulted
in the transfer of the shares to the charitable trust, or, in the case of a
devise or gift, the market price at the time of such devise or gift, and (b) the
market price of such shares on the date Equity One, or its designee, were to
agree to purchase the shares. Any proceeds derived from the sale of the shares
in excess of the amount distributed to the prohibited transferee under these
provisions would be distributed to the beneficiary of the charitable trust. The
charitable trustee will have the sole right to vote the shares that it holds,
and any distributions paid on shares held by the charitable trustee would be
paid to the beneficiary of the charitable trust. If the transfer to the
charitable trust of the shares that were transferred in violation of the
ownership limit is not automatically effective for any reason, then the transfer
that resulted in the violation of the ownership limit would be void.

         All persons or entities who own, directly or by virtue of the
attribution provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, more than 5%, or such other
percentage between 1/2 of 1% and 5% as provided in applicable rules and
regulations under the Internal Revenue Code, of the lesser of the number or
value of the outstanding Equity One shares must give a written notice to Equity
One by January 30 of each year stating the name and address of such owner, the
number of Equity One shares owned and a description of the manner in which such
Equity One shares are held. In addition, a holder of record of Equity One shares
subject to the foregoing requirement who holds its Equity One shares as nominee
for another person or entity which is required to include in gross income the
dividends received on such shares must also give notice of the name and address
of such person or entity and the number of Equity One shares of such person or
entity with respect to which such holder of record is nominee.

         The foregoing restrictions on ownership and transferability would not
apply if the Equity One board of directors were to determine that it is no
longer in the best interests of Equity One to attempt to qualify, or to continue
to qualify, as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.

         UIRT. The UIRT declaration of trust provides that, subject to certain
exceptions, no shareholder may directly or indirectly acquire or hold a
beneficial ownership interest, determined in accordance with the attribution
rules applicable to ownership of REIT shares under the Internal Revenue Code, in
more than 9.8% of the outstanding shares of any class or series of shares of
UIRT.

         The UIRT board of trust managers may waive the percentage limit with
respect to a particular shareholder under certain circumstances. Additionally,
any transfer of UIRT shares that would result in UIRT shares being owned by less
than 100 persons, result in UIRT being "closely held" within the meaning of
Section 856(h) of the Code, result in UIRT owning 10% or more of the ownership
interest in any tenant or subtenant of UIRT's real property within the meaning
of Section 856(h) of the Code, or result in the disqualification of UIRT as a
REIT, shall be void and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in the
shares.

         Subject to certain exceptions, if any person acquires or holds UIRT
shares in excess of the applicable percentage limit, those excess shares will
automatically be deemed to have been transferred to UIRT, as trustee for the
exclusive benefit of such beneficiary to whom an interest in such excess shares
may later be transferred.

         Excess shares may not be voted and are not entitled to distributions or
dividends. The purported transferee may designate a beneficiary of an interest
in the trust if the excess shares held in the trust would not be excess shares
in the hands of that beneficiary and the purported transferee does not receive a
price from that beneficiary that reflects a price per share for such excess
shares that exceeds (x) the price per share the purported transferee paid for
the shares in the transfer that resulted in the excess shares or (y) if the
purported transferee did not give value for the excess shares, a price per share
equal to the market price on the date of the transfer that resulted in excess
shares. If a purported transferee receives a price for designating a beneficiary
of an interest in the trust that exceeds the amounts allowable as described
above, such transferee shall pay, or cause such beneficiary to pay, such excess
to UIRT.

         Excess shares shall be deemed to have been offered for sale to UIRT, or
its designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of the price per share in
the transaction that created such excess shares and the market price on the date
UIRT accepts such offer. UIRT has the right to accept such offer for a period of
90 days after the later of the date of the transfer which resulted in such
excess shares and the date the trust managers determined in good faith that a
transfer resulting in excess shares has occurred.

         Each person who owns more than 5% of UIRT's outstanding shares during
any taxable year of UIRT shall file with UIRT an affidavit setting forth the
number of shares owned directly and indirectly by such person.

               DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK OF UIRT HOLDING CORP.

         UIRT Holding Corp.'s authorized stock consists of 500,000,000 shares of
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, of which 20,000 have a par value of $100 per share and 49,980,000 have a
par value of $0.01 per share. As of June 29, 2001, 1,000 shares of common stock
and no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding. Under the MGCL,
stockholders generally are not liable for the corporation's debts or
obligations. The following summary of the terms of the stock of UIRT Holding
Corp. does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its
entirety by reference to the MGCL and to UIRT Holding Corp.'s charter and
bylaws, copies of which are exhibits to the registration statement of which this
proxy statement/prospectus is a part.

COMMON STOCK

         Each outstanding share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote
on all matters presented to stockholders for a vote, including the election of
directors. Except as provided in the terms of any other class or series of
stock, the holders of common stock possess the exclusive voting power, subject
to the provisions of UIRT Holding Corp.'s charter regarding the ownership of
shares of common stock in excess of the aggregate stock ownership limit, or such
other limit as provided in UIRT Holding Corp.'s charter or as otherwise
permitted by the board of directors as described below.

         Holders of shares of common stock have no preference, conversion,
exchange, sinking fund or redemption and have no preemptive rights to subscribe
for any securities of UIRT Holding Corp. or cumulative voting rights in the
election of directors. All shares of common stock to be issued and outstanding
following the consummation of the reorganization merger will be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Subject
to the preferential rights of any other shares or series of stock and to the
provisions of the charter regarding ownership of shares of common stock in
excess of the aggregate stock ownership limit, or such other limit as provided
by UIRT Holding Corp.'s charter or as otherwise permitted by the aggregate stock
ownership limit, distributions may be paid to the holders of shares of common
stock if and when authorized and declared by the board of directors of UIRT
Holding Corp. out of assets legally available therefor.

         Subject to the right of any holders of preferred stock to receive
preferential distributions, if UIRT Holding Corp. is liquidated each outstanding
share of common stock will be entitled to participate pro rata in the assets
remaining after payment of, or adequate provision for, all known debts and
liabilities of UIRT Holding Corp.

         Subject to the provisions of the charter regarding the ownership of
shares of common stock in excess of the aggregate stock ownership limit, or such
other limit as provided in UIRT Holding Corp.'s charter, all shares of common
stock will have equal distribution, liquidation and voting rights, and will have
no preferences or exchange rights.

         Under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend
its charter, merge, sell all or substantially all of its assets, engage in a
share exchange or engage in similar transactions outside of the ordinary course
of business unless approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at
least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote on the matter unless a greater
or lesser percentage (but no less than a majority of all of the votes entitled
to be cast on the matter) is set forth in the corporation's charter. The charter
contains a provision decreasing the two-thirds vote requirement to a majority of
all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. The phrase "substantially all
of the assets" is not defined in the MGCL and is, therefore, subject to
interpretation by courts applying Maryland law in the context of the facts and
circumstances of a particular case.

         The charter authorizes issuances of additional shares of stock and the
classification or reclassification of unissued shares of either common stock or
preferred stock into other classes or series of classes of stock with
preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions,
limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or
conditions of redemption for each such class or series.

PREFERRED STOCK

         The charter authorizes the board of directors to classify any unissued
shares of preferred stock and to reclassify any previously classified but
unissued shares of any series. Prior to issuance of shares of each series, the
Board is required by the MGCL and the charter to set, subject to the provisions
of the charter regarding the restrictions on transfer of stock, the terms,
preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions,
limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or
conditions of redemption for each such series. Thus, the board of directors
could authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock with terms and
conditions which could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a
transaction or a change in control of UIRT Holding Corp. or other transaction
that might involve a premium price for holders of common stock or otherwise be
in their best interest. As of the date hereof, no shares of preferred stock are
outstanding and UIRT Holding Corp. has no present plans to issue any preferred
stock.

                       UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA

         The following pro forma financial statements reflect the proposed
acquisition of UIRT by Equity One and the proposed combination of Equity One and
CEFUS. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2000 and the three months ended March 31, 2001 have been
presented as if the transactions occurred on January 1, 2000. The unaudited pro
forma combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2001 has been presented as if the
transactions occurred on March 31, 2001.

         The proposed acquisition of UIRT is being accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting. The proposed combination of Equity One and CEFUS
is being accounted for as a combination of entities under common control.
Gazit-Globe (1982) Ltd., a 63.4% stockholder of Equity One through the ownership
of affiliated entities, acquired a 68.1% interest in Centrefund Realty
Corporation, an indirect parent of CEFUS, in August 2000. The pro forma
financial statements reflect the push-down of Gazit-Globe's basis in CEFUS, to
the extent of its 68.1% ownership. The remaining 31.9% was recorded in a manner
similar to a pooling of interests and the basis in the assets, liabilities and
results of operations of CEFUS are reflected at their historical amounts.

     NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOR THE
                          YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000
              (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AND PERCENTAGE DATA)

(a)  To eliminate gain on sale and eliminate revenue and expenses on properties
     sold in 2000.
(b)  To adjust depreciation to reflect the purchase adjusted basis of rental
     property and depreciation policies of Equity One.
(c)  To increase interest expense to reflect borrowings under Equity One's
     credit agreement and other borrowings for the cash portion of UIRT purchase
     price. The estimated amount is based on additional borrowings of $24,257 at
     a variable interest rate of 6.25%. If the underlying floating rate were to
     increase or decrease by 0.125%, the associated interest would change by
     $8 per quarter.
(d)  To eliminate advisory fees under agreements to be terminated upon Equity
     One's acquisition of UIRT.
(e)  To eliminate non-recurring expenses incurred by UIRT.
(f)  To eliminate minority interest assuming conversion of operating partnership
     units to UIRT common equity and then to Equity One stock or cash.
(g)  To eliminate asset and property management fees earned by Equity One from
     CEFUS for the period August 18, 2000 to December 31, 2000.
(h)  To eliminate interest expense on loans paid off by CEFUS prior to
     combination with Equity One, including the restructuring of certain loans
     payable to a company under common control which will be restructured to
     eliminate any net inter-company debt, and which will become direct
     obligations to the underlying third party lenders.
(i)  To eliminate management fees paid by CEFUS to its indirect parent,
     Centrefund, because the properties will be managed by Equity One.
(j)  To eliminate incentive and other fees paid under management agreements no
     longer in force.
(k)  To eliminate loss on sale of rental property to reflect the change in
     purchase basis.
(l)  To eliminate CEFUS income tax provisions due to Equity One's REIT status.
(m)  To record the elimination of 8,919 weighted average UIRT shares and reflect
     the issuance of 3,678 Equity One shares representing the sum of 925 shares
     issued under the commitment with Alony Hetz Properties & Investments Ltd.
     and 2,753 shares issued to UIRT shareholders in connection with the merger
     transaction. The 2,753 shares represent an exchange ratio of .60231 Equity
     One shares for 50% of the 9,143 fully diluted outstanding UIRT shares,
     which represents (i) 8,561 outstanding common shares of beneficial
     interest, (ii) 254 UIRT common shares reserved for issuance upon the
     exercise of stock options and (iii) 239 operating partnership units which
     are convertible into UIRT common shares. The exchange ratio is based on an
     Equity One stock price of $12.12 on the date of the announcement.
(n)  To record the elimination of 0.117 CEFUS shares and reflect the issuance of
     10,500 Equity One shares for the acquisition of CEFUS.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholder of
Centrefund Realty (U.S.) Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Centrefund
Realty (U.S.) Corporation as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholder's equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

We have conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2000
and 1999 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

1.       SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

       The Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on
       October 6, 1988, to engage in the business of acquiring, expanding,
       developing and redeveloping, and owning neighborhood and community
       shopping centres. The Company is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
       Centrefund Realty Corporation ("CRC") which is itself indirectly
       controlled by Gazit Inc.

       The Company's financial statements are presented in accordance with
       accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and its
       significant accounting policies are as follows:

       PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

       The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial
       position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its
       wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company also has three non-controlling
       interests in three separate unconsolidated real estate joint ventures,
       which are accounted for under the equity method. All significant
       intercompany amounts have been eliminated.

       SHOPPING CENTRES AND SHOPPING CENTRES UNDER REDEVELOPMENT

       Shopping centres are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
       Shopping centres under redevelopment are stated at cost. In the event
       that there is an impairment, the carrying value of the property is
       reduced to its estimated fair value. Cost includes all expenditures
       incurred in connection with the acquisition and redevelopment of the
       properties. These expenditures include acquisition costs, construction
       costs, other direct costs, building improvement costs and carrying costs.
       Carrying costs (including property taxes and interest on both specific
       and general debt, net of operating results) are capitalized into the cost
       of the properties until the property changes from non-operating to
       operating (which is based on achieving a satisfactory occupancy level
       within a predetermined time limit no later than one year from cessation
       of major construction activities). At that time, costs are no longer
       capitalized.

       The book values are reviewed for impairment on a property-by-property
       basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
       carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable. Impairment is
       recognized when estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without
       interest charges) to be received from the ongoing use and residual worth
       of the properties are less than the carrying amount of the property.
       These projections take into account the specific business plan for each
       property and management's best estimate of the most probable set of
       economic conditions anticipated in its market area.

       If impairment analysis assumptions change, then adjustments to the
       carrying amount of the Company's assets could occur. To the extent that a
       property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property
       over its estimated fair value is charged to income. There was no
       impairment charges recorded to the carrying value of the shopping centres
       and shopping centres under redevelopment for the periods ended March 31,
       2001 and 2000, and December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998.

1.     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

       DEPRECIATION

       Depreciation of the Company's buildings and improvements is provided for
       using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
       assets which is typically 40 years, except for building improvements
       related to tenant improvements which are amortized over the lesser of the
       asset's useful lives or the terms of the related leases.

       Leasing fees and tenant inducements incurred on securing leases are
       amortized over the term of such leases on a straight-line basis.

       The Company amortizes commitment fees and other costs incurred in
       connection with debt financing over the term of such financing.

       CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

       For the purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers
       certificates of deposit with an initial maturity of three months or less
       to be cash equivalents.

       INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES

       The Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures using the
       equity method. Should management determine that an investment has
       suffered a decline in value which it considered to be other than
       temporary, the investment would be written down to estimated realizable
       value.

       GROSS RENTAL INCOME

       Gross rental income includes rents earned from tenants under lease
       agreements and incidental income.

       INCOME TAXES

       Income taxes are accounted for using the liability method. Under this
       method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax
       consequences of differences between the carrying amount of balance sheet
       items and their corresponding tax values.

       Deferred income taxes are computed using enacted corporate income tax
       rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.

       OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

       A statement for other comprehensive income has not been prepared as there
       are no components of other comprehensive income.

1.     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

       FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

       The fair value of the Company's financial instruments is estimated based
       on the amount at which these instruments could be exchanged in a
       transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. Fair value is
       estimated using market values where available or using present value
       techniques and assumptions concerning the amount and the timing of
       expected future cash flows and discount rates which reflect the
       appropriate level of risk of the instrument. The estimated fair values
       may differ from those which could be realized in an immediate settlement
       of the instruments. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents
       approximates their carrying value.

       Certain amounts receivable, other assets, and accounts payable and
       accrued liabilities, are assumed to have a fair value that approximates
       their historical cost carrying amount due to their short-term nature.

       The fair value of the loans and mortgages receivable, and mortgages
       payable has been determined by discounting the cash flows of these
       financial obligations using market rates for debt of similar
       corresponding terms and risk.

       The Company may periodically enter into interest rate swap transactions
       to fix interest rates on debt or to lock in rates on anticipated debt
       issuances. These derivative financial instruments are designated as
       hedges and are effective in meeting the risk reduction objectives of the
       Company by generating cash flows which offset the cash flows related to
       the debt in respect of amount and timing. The initial cost of entering
       into such transactions is recorded as interest expense over the term of
       the debt. Any ongoing difference payable or receivable on such
       transactions is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense.

       NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

       Beginning January 1, 2001, the Company will be adopting FASB Statement
       No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"
       ("SFAS 133"), and the corresponding amendments under FASB Statement No.
       138 ("SFAS 138"). FAS 133 requires that all derivative financial
       instruments be recognized in the financial statements and measured at
       fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them. Changes
       in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either
       recognized periodically in income or shareholder's equity (as a component
       of comprehensive income), depending on whether the derivative is
       designated as a hedge and whether it is being used to hedge changes in
       fair value or cash flows. SFAS 138 amends certain provisions of SFAS 133
       to clarify four areas causing difficulties in implementation. As of March
       31, 2001 and January 1, 2001, the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 133,
       as amended by SFAS 138, did not have a material impact on the Company's
       consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

       USE OF ESTIMATES

       The preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with
       accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
       management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
       amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
       and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of
       revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
       differ from such estimates.

3.     INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES (CONTINUED)

       The Company has non-controlling interests in three separate
       unconsolidated equity investment joint ventures. These ventures own land,
       shopping centres and shopping centres under development and are primarily
       engaged in the development of neighborhood and community-sized shopping
       centres.

       The Company holds a 50.1% non-controlling interest in two of the joint
       ventures (Centrefund Development Group LLC and Centrefund Development
       Group II LLC) with North American Shopping Center Corp. ("NASCC") holding
       the remaining 49.9% interest. NASCC is indirectly controlled by the
       Company's Property Manager and two of the Company's former directors. The
       Company holds a 50% interest in Cashmere Developments Joint Venture with
       NASCC and another unrelated party each holding 25%.

       Subsequent to year end, in accordance with the terms of the partnership
       agreements, the partners agreed to wind up the partnerships on an orderly
       basis. Any properties not purchased by the partners will be sold to third
       parties.

       The Company has advanced at March 31, 2001 $12.5 million ($12.2 million
       and $9.2 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively) in loans to
       its development partner, NASCC, to partially finance its investment in
       the development partnership. The loans bear interest at rates varying
       from the Company's cost of funds to 10%. For the period ended March 31,
       2001, the Company earned interest of $ 0.4 million ($1.3 million and $0.7
       million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively) from loans to the
       development partner which will be repaid from cash flows generated from
       the development properties and from the development partner's share of
       proceeds generated from refinancing or sales.

       The Company is contingently liable for certain of the obligations of the
       partnership ventures and all of the assets of the partnership ventures
       are available for the purpose of satisfying such obligations and
       guarantees (See Note 16).

                                    ========           ========        ========

       (a)   Pursuant to a memorandum of agreement dated September 15, 1997, the
             Company has advanced amounts to fund development activities in
             partnerships with NASCC and affiliates (see Note 3), to finance a
             portion of its capital requirements in the development
             partnerships. The loans bear interest at rates varying from the
             Company's cost of funds to 10% and are repayable from the
             development partner's share of proceeds generated from refinancings
             or sales. The Company has taken assignments of the development
             partner's debt and equity interests in the development partnerships
             as security for the loans receivable.

       (b)   The mortgage receivable due, from one of the partnership ventures
             (see Note 3), bore interest at the rate of 10% and was repaid in
             2000. In 2000, the Company earned interest income in the amount of
             $0.4 million (1999 - $0.4 million).

       The fair value of the loans and mortgage receivable at March 31, 2001,
       December 31, 2000 and 1999 approximate their carrying amounts.

       The Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent that debtors fail to
       meet their obligations. This risk is alleviated by minimizing the amount
       of exposure the Company has to any one tenant, ensuring a diversified
       tenant mix, acquiring properties in superior geographic locations, and by
       the hypothecated properties.

       of the amounts due to affiliated entities at March 31, 2001, December 31,
       2000 and 1999 approximate their carrying values.

       Effective January 2, 2001, $27.7 million of amounts due to and from

       The fair value of mortgages payable at March 31, 2001, December 31, 2000
       and 1999 approximate their carrying values.

       The Company is exposed to financial risks arising from fluctuations in
       interest rates that could cause a variation in earnings. The Company
       periodically enters into interest rate swap transactions to fix interest
       rates on current or future outstanding debt. The Company has entered into
       interest rate swap contracts on $18.2 million of debt included in
       mortgages payable, effectively converting the debt from variable rate
       debt into fixed rate debt maturing in 2001.

       As part of its risk management program, the Company endeavors to maintain
       an appropriate mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt and strives to
       match the nature and timing of lease inflows to financing thereon.

12.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS - ADVISOR'S FEES (CONTINUED)

        (d)  Advisory Termination Fees

             In November 1999, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a
             transaction to terminate the advisory fee and acquisition and
             disposition fee components and revise the incentive fee provisions
             of the Advisory Agreement. Pursuant to the transaction, the amended
             Advisory Agreement could be terminated by the Company at the
             expiration of the current term on March 29, 2004, subject to
             obtaining shareholder approval or upon the expiration of any
             subsequent term. In addition, the Advisor agreed to continue to
             provide the strategic services of the parent company's Chairman,
             President and Chief Executive Officer. The transaction took effect
             on January 1, 2000.

             If the amended Advisory Agreement was terminated March 29, 2004,
             then:

             o   Effective January 1, 2000 and for the balance of the term, the
                 annual incentive fees (see Note 12 (c)) would be calculated
                 solely with reference to the shopping center portfolio and
                 related assets owned by the Company as at September 30, 1999;

             o   The Fair Value Incentive Amount (see Note 14), payable upon
                 termination of the amended Advisory Agreement, would be
                 calculated solely with reference to the shopping center
                 portfolio and related assets owned by the Company as at
                 September 30, 1999;

             o   The Company would have the option to satisfy the Fair Value
                 Incentive Amount in a combination of cash and common shares of
                 CRC, provided that the cash portion of such combined payment
                 represented at least 50% thereof, the common shares forming
                 part of such combined payment were issued on a tax-deferred
                 basis to the Advisor and certain other conditions were met; and

             o   The property management agreement would be terminated effective
                 March 29, 2004 (see Note 13).

       As consideration for the amendments to the Advisory Agreement and in
       consideration for the Advisor continuing to provide the strategic
       services of the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive
       Officer, the Advisor was to receive the following:

       (i)   An advisory termination fee of $6.4 million (Cdn. $9.5 million)
             plus interest to the payment date in the amount of $0.27 million.

       (ii)  An annual base incentive fee. An amount of $0.36 million was paid
             under this agreement in 2000. On the change of control (see Note
             14), under the terms of the amended Advisory Agreement, the total
             amount payable to the end of the contract term was accelerated and
             resulted in a further $2.7 million payment.

12.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS - ADVISOR'S FEES (CONTINUED)

       (iii) A stock appreciation package, which effectively represented at the
             time of issue the appreciation in the value of 1,500,000 common
             shares of CRC measured with reference to a base price of Cdn. $14
             per share, which would be satisfied by the payment of:

             (A)   a fee of $1.5 million (Cdn. $2.2 million) which would, except
                   in certain circumstances, be used to purchase incentive
                   warrants of CRC ("Incentive Warrants") entitling the holder
                   thereof to purchase an aggregate of up to 3,600,000 common
                   shares of CRC at an exercise price of Cdn. $14 per share (as
                   adjusted), having a term expiring on January 1, 2005; and

             (B)   if applicable, a fee of $550 thousand (Cdn. $800 thousand)
                   which would, except in certain circumstances, be used to
                   purchase common share purchase warrants of CRC having a term
                   of five years from the date of their issuance and
                   representing a right to subscribe for up to 3,600,000 common
                   shares of CRC less the aggregate number of common shares of
                   CRC acquired by the holders of the Incentive Warrants for an
                   exercise price equal to the greater of the fair market value
                   of the common shares on the date of issuance of such warrants
                   and Cdn. $14 per share (as adjusted).

       On the change of control, under the terms of the amended Advisory
       Agreement, the stock appreciation package became payable in cash as fair
       value and annual incentive amendment fees totaling $2.2 million (Cdn.
       $3.0 million).

       Pursuant to a fee sharing agreement, the Property Manager received a
       portion of all of the consideration received by the Advisor, except for
       the annual base incentive fee.

       A provision for the advisory termination transaction was recorded in the
       financial statements at December 31, 1999 totaling $8.20 million. The
       payment was in respect of the termination of the advisory fee and
       acquisition and disposition fee components of the Advisory Agreement and
       third party professional and consulting costs. The Advisory Agreement was
       terminated in August 18, 2000 in accordance with its terms (see Note 14).

       agreements as outlined in Note 12.

14.    PREVIOUS MANAGEMENT'S INCENTIVE AND OTHER FEES (CONTINUED)

       On the acquisition of control, in accordance with the terms of the
       amended Advisory Agreement, all of the incentive fees became payable in
       cash and the Advisory Agreement was terminated. On termination of the
       Advisory Agreement, in accordance with its terms, the Advisor also became
       entitled to receive a fair value incentive amount equal to 20% of the
       excess of the fair market value of the Company's shopping center
       portfolio and other related assets over the aggregate of: (i) the
       recorded cost of such portfolio and assets, determined at the termination
       date, and (ii) the aggregate amount required to have provided the Company
       since March 29, 1994 with a 10% compound, cumulative annual return on the
       average aggregate equity allocable to such portfolio and assets, net of
       annual incentive fees paid to the Advisor and after taking into
       consideration aggregate net property cash flow and aggregate net sale
       proceeds received with respect to such portfolio and assets.

       Former management of the Company, which included the Company's former
       Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and who also controlled
       the Advisor, calculated and accrued the fair value incentive amount to be
       $8.8 million. This amount was recorded after an offer by the Gazit Group
       to acquire a controlling interest in the parent company in June 2000. At
       December 31, 2000, $3.7 million of the fair value incentive amount had
       been advanced. The unpaid amount, if any, is secured by a fixed and
       floating charge over two of the Company's shopping centres. The fair
       value incentive amount, as calculated by the Advisor, was based on the
       Advisor's estimate of the fair market value of the Company's shopping
       center portfolio.

       Current management of the Company is disputing the calculation of the
       fair value incentive amount, including amounts that have been advanced.
       When the dispute is resolved, the fair value incentive amount could be
       significantly different from the amount recorded.

       The previous management's incentive fees and certain other costs,
       primarily associated with the parent company's consideration of the
       Offer, and the cost of canceling the property management contract as it
       pertains to the Florida property portfolio, in accordance with a
       settlement agreement dated August 18, 2000, are summarized as follows:

16.    CONTINGENCIES

       (a)   The Company monitors its properties for the presence of hazardous
             or toxic substances. The Company is involved in a legal action
             relating to an environmental liability with respect to two of its
             properties. In management's opinion, the liability, if any, that
             may ultimately result from this environmental issue is not expected
             to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business assets
             or results of operations. The Company is not aware of any other
             environmental liability with respect to the properties. However,
             there can be no assurance that any other material environmental
             liabilities do not exist. The existence of any such material
             environmental liability would have an adverse effect on the
