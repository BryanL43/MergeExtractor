                            BIOSCIENCES CORPORATION

                 A MERGER PROPOSAL--YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

    The boards of directors of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated and Aurora
Biosciences Corporation have approved a merger agreement. When the merger is
completed, holders of Aurora common stock will receive 0.62 of a share of Vertex
common stock for each share they own, and Aurora will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Vertex. The boards of directors of both Vertex and Aurora have
approved the merger and recommend that the stockholders of each company vote FOR
the merger.

    Vertex common stock is listed on The Nasdaq National Market under the
trading symbol "VRTX" and on June 7, 2001, Vertex common stock closed at
$48.70 per share. Aurora common stock is listed on The Nasdaq National Market
under the trading symbol "ABSC" and on June 7, 2001, Aurora common stock closed
at $29.98 per share.

    If the merger is approved, the number of Vertex employees will increase from
approximately 475 to approximately 825. Accordingly, the board of directors of
Vertex has also approved an amendment to Vertex's 1996 Stock and Option Plan to
increase the number of shares reserved for issuance under this plan from
13,000,000 to 16,000,000. The board of directors of Vertex recommends that its
stockholders vote FOR this amendment.

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:   WHY ARE VERTEX AND AURORA PROPOSING THE MERGER?

A:   Vertex is proposing the merger because it believes that by
     integrating Aurora's core strengths in assay development and
     ultra-throughput screening technology, Vertex will be able
     to expand its research into new gene families, as well as
     enhance its existing multi-target research programs in the
     kinase, caspase and protease gene families. Aurora is
     proposing the merger because it believes that the merger
     significantly accelerates Aurora's comprehensive drug
     discovery initiatives and creates new and enhanced
     collaborative opportunities.

Q:   WHY IS VERTEX AMENDING ITS 1996 STOCK AND OPTION PLAN?

A:   If the merger is completed, approximately 350 additional
     employees will be eligible to receive options and stock
     awards under Vertex's 1996 Stock and Option Plan.
     Accordingly, Vertex's board of directors believes that the
     increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under
     this plan is advisable to give Vertex the flexibility needed
     to attract, retain and motivate employees, directors and
     consultants after the merger is completed.

Q:   AS A HOLDER OF AURORA COMMON STOCK, WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IN
     THE MERGER?

A:   Holders of Aurora common stock will receive 0.62 of a share
     of Vertex common stock for each share of Aurora common stock
     they own. No fractional shares, however, will be issued. You
     will receive cash for any fractional shares you would
     otherwise be entitled to receive. The number of shares of
     Vertex common stock to be issued for each share of Aurora
     common stock is fixed and will not be adjusted based upon
     changes in the respective values of these shares.

Q:   WHAT STOCKHOLDER APPROVALS ARE NEEDED?

A:   For Vertex, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
     a majority of the shares of Vertex common stock present or
     represented and voting at the Vertex special meeting is
     required to approve the issuance of Vertex common stock in
     connection with the merger and to approve the amendment to
     Vertex's 1996 Stock and Option Plan. Each holder of Vertex
     common stock is entitled to one vote per share. As of the
     record date, Vertex directors and executive officers and
     their affiliates owned approximately 1.9% of the outstanding
     shares of Vertex common stock. They have executed proxies so
     that these shares will be voted in favor of the issuance of
     the Vertex common stock in connection with the merger.

     For Aurora, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
     a majority of the outstanding shares of Aurora common stock
     is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement. Each
     holder of Aurora common stock is entitled to one vote per
     share. As of the record date, Aurora directors and executive
     officers and their affiliates owned approximately 3.8% of
     the outstanding shares of Aurora common stock. They have
     executed proxies so that these shares will be voted in favor
     of approval and adoption of the merger agreement.

Q:   WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A:   After carefully reading and considering the information
     contained in this joint proxy statement-prospectus, please
     respond by completing, signing and dating your proxy card or
     voting instructions and returning it in the enclosed postage
     paid envelope as soon as possible so that your shares may be
     represented at the special meeting.

Q:   WHAT IF I DON'T VOTE?

A:   If you are an Aurora stockholder and you fail to respond or
     you respond and abstain from voting, it will have the same
     effect as a vote against the merger. If you return a
     properly executed proxy card without instructions, your
     shares will be voted in favor of approval and adoption of
     the merger agreement.

     If you are a Vertex stockholder and you fail to respond or
     you respond and abstain from voting, so long as a quorum is
     present at the special meeting, it will have no effect on
     the vote to approve the issuance of common stock in
     connection with the merger or on the vote to approve the
     amendment to Vertex's 1996 Stock and Option Plan. If you
     return a properly executed proxy card without instructions,
     your shares will be voted in favor of these proposals.

Q:   IF MY SHARES OF VERTEX OR AURORA COMMON STOCK ARE HELD IN
     STREET NAME BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY SHARES FOR
     ME?

A:   If you are an Aurora stockholder, your broker will vote your
     shares with respect to the proposal to approve and adopt the
     merger agreement only if you provide instructions on how to
     vote. You should follow the directions provided by your
     broker regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your
     shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted,
     and this will have the same effect as a vote against the
     merger.

     If you are a Vertex stockholder, your broker will vote your
     shares with respect to the proposal to approve the issuance
     of Vertex common stock in connection with the merger only if
     you provide instructions on how to vote. You should follow
     the directions provided by your broker regarding how to
     instruct your broker to vote your shares. Without
     instructions, your shares will not be voted with respect to
     this proposal. With respect to the proposal to amend
     Vertex's 1996 Stock and Option Plan, your broker will have
     discretion to vote your shares even if you do not provide
     instructions.

Q:   CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE DELIVERED MY PROXY?

A:   Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy
     is voted at the special meeting. If you are a holder of
     record, you can do this in one of three ways. First, you can
     notify us that you would like to revoke your proxy. Second,
     you can complete and submit a new proxy. If you choose
     either of these two methods, you must submit your notice of
     revocation or your new proxy to the Clerk of Vertex or the
     Secretary of Aurora, as appropriate, before the special
     meeting. Third, you can attend your respective special
     meeting and vote in person.

     If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or
     bank, you must follow the directions received from your
     broker to change your vote or to vote at your respective
     special meeting.

Q:   SHOULD AURORA STOCKHOLDERS SEND IN THEIR STOCK CERTIFICATES
     NOW?

A:   No. After the merger is completed, Aurora stockholders will
     receive written instructions for exchanging their stock
     certificates. Please do not send in your stock certificates
     with your proxy.

Q:   WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A:   Each of Vertex and Aurora is working to complete the merger
     as quickly as possible. Assuming that both Vertex and Aurora
     satisfy or waive all of the conditions to closing contained
     in the merger agreement, Vertex and Aurora anticipate that
     the merger will occur as soon as practicable after approval
     of the merger proposals at the special meetings.

Q:   WHO CAN HELP ANSWER MY QUESTIONS?

A:   If you have any questions about the merger or how to submit
     your proxy, or if you need additional copies of this joint
     proxy statement-prospectus or the enclosed proxy card or
     voting instructions, you should contact:

This approach, which targets gene families, has formed the basis for several
commercial collaborations that retain rights to downstream revenue for Vertex.
Vertex's first approved product is Agenerase-Registered Trademark-, an HIV
protease inhibitor, which Vertex co-promotes with GlaxoSmithKline. Vertex has 12
drug candidates in development to treat viral diseases, inflammation, cancer,

                                   THE MERGER

THE STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 38)

    In the proposed merger, Aurora will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Vertex. Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding share of Aurora common
stock will be automatically converted into 0.62 of a share of Vertex common
stock, and the stockholders of Aurora will become stockholders of Vertex. In
addition, Vertex will assume each outstanding option to purchase Aurora common
stock, and each such option will be converted into and become a right to
purchase Vertex common stock, at the same exchange ratio of 0.62 per share.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS AND OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS
(SEE PAGES 38, 44 AND 45)

    TO VERTEX STOCKHOLDERS:  The Vertex board of directors believes that the
merger is fair to you and in your best interest and recommends that you vote FOR
the approval of the issuance of the Vertex common stock in connection with the
merger. The Vertex board of directors also believes that the amendment to
authorize additional shares under the 1996 Stock and Option Plan is in your best
interest and recommends that you vote FOR this proposal.

    TO AURORA STOCKHOLDERS:  The Aurora board of directors believes that the
merger is fair to you and in your best interest and recommends that you vote FOR
the approval and adoption of the merger agreement.

    OPINION OF VERTEX'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR.  In deciding to approve the merger,
the Vertex board of directors considered the opinion of its financial advisor,
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, that, as of the date of its
opinion, based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions described in its
opinion, the exchange ratio was fair from a financial point of view to Vertex.
The full text of this opinion is attached as Annex B to this joint proxy
statement-prospectus. VERTEX URGES ITS STOCKHOLDERS TO READ THE OPINION OF
MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INCORPORATED CAREFULLY AND IN ITS
ENTIRETY.

    OPINION OF AURORA'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR.  In deciding to approve the merger,
the Aurora board of directors considered the opinion of its financial advisor,
Goldman, Sachs & Co., that, as of the date of its opinion, based upon and
subject to the considerations described in its opinion, the exchange ratio
provided by the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the
holders of Aurora common stock. The full text of this opinion is attached as
Annex C to this joint proxy statement-prospectus. AURORA URGES ITS STOCKHOLDERS
TO READ THE OPINION OF GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY.

THE SPECIAL MEETINGS (SEE PAGE 26)

    SPECIAL MEETING OF VERTEX'S STOCKHOLDERS.  The Vertex special meeting will
be held at Vertex's offices at 130 Waverly Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts on
July 18, 2001, starting at 12:00 p.m., Eastern Time. At the Vertex special
meeting, Vertex will ask the holders of Vertex common stock to consider and vote
upon (1) a proposal to approve the issuance of the Vertex common stock in
connection with the merger, (2) a proposal to amend Vertex's 1996 Stock and
Option Plan and (3) any other matters as may properly come before the Vertex
special meeting or any postponements or adjournments of the meeting.

    SPECIAL MEETING OF AURORA'S STOCKHOLDERS.  The Aurora special meeting will
be held at Aurora's offices at 11010 Torreyana Road, San Diego, California on
July 18, 2001, starting at 9:00 a.m., Pacific Time. At the Aurora special
meeting, Aurora will ask the holders of Aurora common stock to consider and vote
upon (1) a proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and (2) any other
matters as

may properly come before the Aurora special meeting or any postponements or
adjournments of the meeting.

INTERESTS OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF AURORA IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 52)

    Some of the directors and officers of Aurora have interests in the merger
that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of Aurora's
stockholders. These interests include the potential for positions as directors
and officers in the merged company, the acceleration of options under Aurora's
Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan as a result of the merger, and the right
to continued indemnification and insurance coverage by Vertex for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the merger.

TREATMENT OF AURORA STOCK OPTIONS (SEE PAGE 54)

    When the merger is completed, each outstanding Aurora stock option (other
than options outstanding under Aurora's Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option
Plan) will be assumed by Vertex and converted into and become a right to
purchase Vertex common stock. Each option assumed by Vertex will be exercisable
for the number of shares of Vertex common stock equal to the number of shares of
Aurora common stock issuable upon exercise of the option multiplied by 0.62,
rounded down to the nearest whole share. The per share exercise price for each
option will be the exercise price of the Aurora option divided by 0.62, rounded
up to the nearest whole cent. Any restrictions on the exercise of any options
shall continue, and the term, vesting schedule and other provisions of each
option shall remain unchanged.

    Each option outstanding pursuant to Aurora's Non-Employee Directors' Stock
Option Plan will, by its terms, become fully vested and immediately exercisable
prior to and subject to the merger and if not exercised prior to the completion
of the merger, will terminate as of the completion of the merger.

TAX CONSEQUENCES (SEE PAGE 55)

    We expect the merger to be treated as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. If the merger is treated as a
reorganization, generally no gain or loss will be recognized by the stockholders
of Aurora for federal income tax purposes (except with respect to cash received
by Aurora stockholders instead of fractional shares of Vertex common stock).

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 57)

    We intend to account for the merger as a "pooling of interests" business
combination. The conditions to completion of the merger include that Vertex be
advised in writing by (1) its independent accountants that they concur with the
conclusion of Vertex's management that the merger can properly be accounted for
as a pooling of interests and (2) Aurora's independent auditors regarding such
firm's concurrence with Aurora's management's conclusions as to whether Aurora
meets the conditions necessary for it to enter into the business combination
accounted for as a pooling of interests. These conditions, however, may be
waived.

ANTITRUST APPROVAL IS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 57)

    The merger is subject to antitrust laws. We have made the required filings
with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. However, we are
not permitted to complete the merger until the applicable waiting periods have
expired or terminated. We believe that we have substantially complied with all
requests for information from the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission and we expect that the applicable waiting periods will expire or be
terminated on or before July 5, 2001. However, the Department of Justice or the
Federal Trade Commission, as well as a foreign regulatory agency or government,
state or private person, may challenge the merger at any time before its
completion.

RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY TO SELL VERTEX COMMON STOCK (SEE PAGE 57)

    All shares of Vertex common stock received by Aurora stockholders in
connection with the merger will be freely transferable unless you are considered
an "affiliate" of Aurora under the Securities Act of 1933 or unless your Aurora
shares are subject to a transfer restriction. Persons who may be deemed to be
affiliates of Aurora include individuals or entities that control, are
controlled by, or are under the common control of Aurora and may include
Aurora's executive officers and directors, as well as Aurora's significant
stockholders.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS (SEE PAGE 58)

    Under applicable law, neither Vertex stockholders nor Aurora stockholders
have appraisal rights.

OVERVIEW OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 58)

    Each of Vertex's and Aurora's obligation to complete the merger are subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions before completion of the
merger, including the following:

    - Vertex's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy
      statement-prospectus forms a part, must be effective;

    - the merger agreement must be approved and adopted at the Aurora special
      meeting, and the issuance of the Vertex common stock must be approved at
      the Vertex special meeting;

    - the applicable waiting periods under U.S. antitrust laws must expire or
      terminate;

    - the shares of Vertex common stock to be issued in the merger must be
      approved for listing on The Nasdaq National Market;

    - no law, order, injunction or proceeding preventing completion of the
      merger may be in effect;

    - we must receive all other necessary regulatory authorizations or
      approvals; and

    - each of Vertex and Aurora must receive an opinion of tax counsel that the
      merger will constitute a tax-free reorganization under the tax code.

    Vertex's obligation to complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of each of the following additional conditions before completion of the
merger:

    - Aurora's representations and warranties in the merger agreement must be
      true and correct in all material respects;

    - Aurora must have complied with its covenants and obligations required by
      the merger agreement;

    - there must be no event that has had and is continuing to have a material
      adverse effect on Aurora and its subsidiaries;

    - Vertex must have received executed affiliate agreements from Aurora's
      affiliates;

    - Vertex must have received a letter from its independent accountants and
      Aurora's independent auditors concerning the accounting treatment of the
      merger as a pooling of interests; and

    Aurora's obligation to complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of each of the following additional conditions before completion of the
merger:

    - Vertex's representations and warranties in the merger agreement must be
      true and correct in all material respects;

    - Vertex must have complied with its covenants and obligations required by
      the merger agreement; and

    - there must be no event that has had and is continuing to have a material
      adverse effect on Vertex.

    "NO SOLICITATION" PROVISION.  The merger agreement contains detailed
provisions prohibiting Aurora from seeking an alternative transaction. These "no
solicitation" provisions prohibit Aurora, as well as its officers, directors,
subsidiaries and representatives, from taking any action to solicit an
acquisition proposal as described on page 61. The merger agreement does not,
however, prohibit Aurora or its board of directors from considering, and
potentially recommending, an unsolicited bona fide written superior proposal
from a third party as described on page 61.

    TERMINATION.  Vertex and Aurora can jointly agree to terminate the merger
agreement at any time. Either company may also terminate the merger agreement
if:

    - the merger is not completed by September 30, 2001 (extended to December
      31, 2001 if the merger is not completed solely due to U.S. antitrust
      laws), so long as the failure to complete the merger is not the result of
      failure by that company to fulfill any of its obligations under the merger
      agreement;

    - government actions do not permit the completion of the merger;

    - the requisite stockholder approval is not received at either of the
      special meetings, so long as the failure to receive stockholder approval
      is not the result of failure by that company to fulfill any of its
      obligations under the merger agreement;

    - the board of directors of the other company takes specified actions or
      fails to take other required actions as described on page 63; or

    - the other company breaches its representations, warranties or covenants in
      the merger agreement in a material way.

    In addition, Aurora may terminate the merger agreement, if its board of
directors believes the failure to do so would create a substantial likelihood of
a liability for breach of its fiduciary duties to Aurora's stockholders.

    PAYMENT OF TERMINATION FEE AND OTHER FEES AND EXPENSES UPON
TERMINATION.  The merger agreement provides that, in several circumstances,
Vertex or Aurora may be required to pay a termination fee to, and the fees and
expenses of, the other party as described on page 62.

STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS (SEE PAGE 68)

    Vertex has entered into stockholder agreements with all of Aurora's
directors and executive officers, pursuant to which they have granted proxies to
officers of Vertex so that all of the shares of Aurora common stock owned by
Aurora's directors and executive officers will be voted by the officers of
Vertex at the Aurora special meeting to approve and adopt the merger agreement.
As of the record date, Aurora's directors and executive officers and their
affiliates owned approximately 3.8% of the outstanding Aurora common stock.
Aurora has entered into stockholder agreements with all of Vertex's directors
and executive officers, pursuant to which they have granted proxies to officers
of Aurora so that all of the shares of Vertex common stock owned by Vertex's
directors and executive officers will be voted by the officers of Aurora at the
Vertex special meeting to approve the issuance of the Vertex common stock in
connection with the merger. As of the record date, Vertex's directors and
executive officers and their affiliates owned approximately 1.9% of the
outstanding Vertex common stock.

COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS (SEE PAGE 80)

    After the merger, Aurora's stockholders will become stockholders of Vertex.

stockholders of Aurora. After the merger, as stockholders of Vertex, their
rights will be governed by Vertex's restated articles of organization, as
amended, Vertex's amended and restated by-laws and the laws of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, rather than by Aurora's amended and restated certificate of
incorporation, Aurora's amended and restated by-laws and the laws of the State
of Delaware.

MARKET PRICE INFORMATION

    The following table sets forth the closing prices per share of Vertex common
stock and Aurora common stock as reported on The Nasdaq National Market on (1)

               ADDITIONAL PROPOSAL FOR THE VERTEX SPECIAL MEETING

PROPOSAL TO AMEND VERTEX'S 1996 STOCK AND OPTION PLAN (SEE PAGE 86)

    As a result of the merger, Vertex will have approximately 350 additional
persons eligible to receive stock options and stock awards under its 1996 Stock
and Option Plan. Accordingly, an amendment to increase the number of shares of
Vertex common stock reserved for issuance under this plan from 13,000,000 to
16,000,000 is also being submitted for stockholder approval at the Vertex
special meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the shares of Vertex common stock present or represented and voting at the
Vertex special meeting is required to approve the amendment to Vertex's 1996
Stock and Option Plan.

         SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED AND PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA

    The following tables present (1) selected historical consolidated financial
data of Vertex, (2) selected historical consolidated financial data of Aurora
and (3) selected unaudited pro forma combined financial data of Vertex, which
reflects the proposed merger, including the conversion of each outstanding share
of Aurora common stock into 0.62 of a share of Vertex common stock, and assumes
the pooling of interests method of accounting.

    The selected historical financial data of Vertex has been derived from the
audited historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of Vertex

*   Note: In the fourth quarter of 2000, retroactive to January 1, 2000, Vertex
    adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial
    Statements" ("SAB 101"). Previously reported financial data for the years
    ended December 31, 1996 through December 31, 1999 has not been restated to
    give the pro forma effect of the adoption of the provisions of SAB 101 as
    the effect could not be reasonably determined. See "Note C: Change in
    Accounting Principle" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    contained in the Vertex 2000 annual report on Form 10-K for further

*   Note: In the fourth quarter of 2000, retroactive to January 1, 2000, Vertex
    adopted SAB 101. Previously reported financial data for the years ended
    December 31, 1996 through December 31, 1999 has not been restated to give
    the pro forma effect of the adoption of the provisions of SAB 101 as the
    effect could not be reasonably determined. See "Note C: Change in Accounting

    in the Vertex 2000 annual report on Form 10-K for further information.

                  UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE INFORMATION

    The following table summarizes the per share information for Vertex and
Aurora on a historical, pro forma combined and pro forma equivalent basis. You
should read this information in conjunction with Vertex's and Aurora's
historical financial statements and related notes that are incorporated by
reference into this joint proxy statement-prospectus and the unaudited pro forma
combined financial information and related notes that are included elsewhere in
this joint proxy statement-prospectus. The Aurora pro forma per share equivalent
data is calculated by multiplying the pro forma combined per share amounts by
0.62, the exchange ratio. The pro forma per share data is not necessarily
indicative of the results that would have occurred if the merger had been
completed on the dates indicated or the results that will occur after the
merger.

(1) The Vertex historical book value per share is calculated by dividing
    Vertex's stockholders' equity by the total number of outstanding shares of
    common stock at the end of the period.

(2) The Aurora historical book value per share is calculated by dividing
    Aurora's stockholders' equity by the total number of outstanding shares of
    common stock at the end of the period.

(3) The pro forma combined net loss per share is calculated by dividing the pro
    forma net income by the pro forma number of basic and diluted shares
    outstanding.

(4) The equivalent pro forma combined amounts are calculated by multiplying the
    pro forma combined per share amounts by the exchange ratio of 0.62 per share
    of Vertex common stock for each share of Aurora common stock equivalent
    share.

(5) The pro forma combined net book value per share is calculated by dividing
    the pro forma stockholders' equity by the pro forma number of shares
    outstanding at the end of the period.

                                  RISK FACTORS

    IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN OR INCORPORATED BY
REFERENCE INTO THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT-PROSPECTUS, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY
CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS IN DECIDING HOW TO VOTE ON THE MERGER.

                          RISKS RELATING TO THE MERGER

AURORA STOCKHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE 0.62 OF A SHARE OF VERTEX COMMON STOCK FOR EACH
SHARE OF AURORA COMMON STOCK DESPITE CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE OF VERTEX COMMON
STOCK OR AURORA COMMON STOCK.

    Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding share of Aurora common stock
will be converted into 0.62 of a share of Vertex common stock. This exchange
ratio is fixed, and there will be no adjustment for changes in the market price
of either Vertex common stock or Aurora common stock. Any change in the price of
either Vertex common stock or Aurora common stock will affect the relative value
per share that Aurora stockholders will receive in the merger. Vertex common
stock and Aurora common stock have both historically experienced significant
volatility, and the relative value of the shares of Vertex common stock received
in the merger may go up or down as the market price of Vertex common stock or
Aurora common stock goes up or down. Stock price changes may result from a
variety of factors that are beyond the control of Vertex and Aurora, including
changes in their businesses, operations and prospects, regulatory considerations
and general market and economic conditions. Neither party is permitted to "walk
away" from the merger or resolicit the vote of its stockholders solely because
of changes in the market price of either party's common stock.

    The prices of Vertex common stock and Aurora common stock at the closing of
the merger may vary from their respective prices on the date of this joint proxy
statement-prospectus and on the dates of the special meetings. Because the date
the merger is completed may be later than the dates of the special meetings, the
prices of Vertex common stock and Aurora common stock on the dates of the
special meetings may not be indicative of their respective prices on the date
the merger is completed.

ALTHOUGH VERTEX AND AURORA EXPECT THAT THE MERGER WILL RESULT IN BENEFITS, THOSE
BENEFITS MAY NOT BE REALIZED.

    Vertex and Aurora entered into the merger agreement with the expectation
that the merger will result in benefits, including:

    - an increase in the flow of new drug candidates into development;

    - acceleration of the creation of a broad intellectual property estate; and

    - enhancement and acceleration of opportunities for major drug discovery,
      development and commercial alliances.

    Achieving the benefits of the merger will depend in part on the successful
integration of Vertex's and Aurora's operations and personnel in a timely and
efficient manner. Integrating Vertex and Aurora will be a complex, time
consuming and expensive process. Employees and management of each of Vertex and
Aurora have played a key role in creating each company. The successful
integration of these two companies will alter prior relationships and may affect
productivity. In addition, the merger is likely to divert the attention of
management of each company and could negatively affect Vertex's ability to
operate and retain key employees after the merger. Neither company can assure
you that Vertex and Aurora can be successfully integrated or that any of the
anticipated benefits will be realized, and failure to do so could have a
material adverse effect on Vertex's business.

AURORA'S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST THAT MAY INFLUENCE
THEM TO SUPPORT OR APPROVE THE MERGER.

    The directors and officers of Aurora will participate in arrangements that
provide them with interests in the merger that are different from, or are in
addition to, those of Aurora's stockholders, including:

    - upon completion of the merger, Stuart J.M. Collinson, Aurora's Chairman of
      the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, will be appointed to
      Vertex's board of directors;

    - several officers of Aurora have entered into employment agreements with
      Aurora that become effective upon completion of the merger and are
      guaranteed by Vertex;

    - options outstanding pursuant to Aurora's Non-Employee Directors' Stock
      Option Plan will, by their terms, become fully vested and immediately
      exercisable prior to and subject to the merger;

    - options granted under the Aurora 1996 Stock Plan to officers of Aurora
      will become fully vested and immediately exercisable if an optionee is
      terminated by Vertex without cause or if an optionee voluntarily
      terminates his or her employment as a result of a constructive termination
      within the period beginning 60 days before completion of the merger and
      ending 13 months following the merger; and

    - for six years following the merger, Aurora's current directors and
      officers are entitled to continued indemnification and limitation of
      personal liability for, and Vertex must provide policies of directors' and
      officers' liability insurance with respect to, acts or omissions occurring
      prior to the completion of the merger.

    As a result, these directors and officers could be more likely to vote to
approve the merger agreement than if they did not hold these interests. Aurora
stockholders should consider whether these interests may have influenced these
directors and officers to support or recommend the merger.

THIRD PARTIES MAY TERMINATE OR ALTER EXISTING CONTRACTS WITH AURORA IF WE FAIL
TO OBTAIN REQUIRED CONSENTS AND WAIVERS OR, IN SOME CASES, WITHOUT CAUSE.

    Aurora has contracts with suppliers, customers, licensors, licensees and
other business partners relating to, among other things, intellectual property
rights. Some of these contracts require Aurora to obtain the consent, waiver or
approval of these other parties in connection with the merger agreement. Other
contracts may be terminated by the other party without cause at any time upon
written notice to Aurora. If a required consent, waiver or approval cannot be
obtained, Aurora may lose the right to use intellectual property and enforce its
rights under other contracts. Aurora has agreed to use reasonable efforts to
secure the necessary consents, waivers and approvals, and it is a condition to
Vertex's obligation to complete the merger that Aurora obtain any consents,
waivers and approvals which, if not obtained, would have a material adverse
effect on Aurora. However, we cannot assure you that Aurora will be able to
obtain all of the necessary consents, waivers and approvals. In the event Vertex
elects to complete the merger without the necessary consents, waivers and
approvals, or if a significant customer with a right to terminate its agreement
with Aurora without cause were to exercise that right, it could have a material
adverse effect on Vertex's business.

FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE MERGER COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT VERTEX'S AND AURORA'S
STOCK PRICES AND FUTURE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS.

    If the merger is not completed for any reason, Vertex and Aurora may be
subject to a number of material risks, including the following:

    - depending upon the circumstances, either Vertex or Aurora may be required
      to pay a termination fee of $20,000,000 and reimburse expenses of the
      other company of up to $1,500,000;

    - the price of Vertex common stock and Aurora common stock may decline to
      the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that
      the merger is more beneficial to the companies than the companies
      remaining independent; and

    - costs related to the merger, such as legal and accounting fees and
      expenses and a portion of the financial advisor fees, must be paid even if
      the merger is not completed.

    If the merger is terminated and Aurora's board of directors determines to
seek another merger or business combination, there can be no assurance that it
will be able to find a partner willing to pay an equivalent or more attractive
price than that which would be paid in the merger.

THE FAILURE TO QUALIFY THE MERGER FOR "POOLING OF INTERESTS" ACCOUNTING
TREATMENT WOULD CREATE THE NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE PURCHASE OF GOODWILL, WHICH
WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE FUTURE EARNINGS OF VERTEX.

    Vertex and Aurora intend to treat the merger for accounting purposes as a
"pooling of interests." The availability of pooling of interests accounting
depends on a number of factors, including that affiliates of Vertex and Aurora
not sell or otherwise transfer more than a DE MINIMIS number of shares held by
them during the period beginning 30 days prior to the closing of the merger and
ending when financial results covering at least 30 days of combined operations
of Aurora and Vertex have been published. Vertex will not receive written
commitments from all of its stockholders who may be deemed affiliates that they
will not transfer shares during this period. If the merger is consummated but
not treated as a pooling of interests, Vertex will have to account for its
purchase of Aurora's goodwill and other intangible assets. This "purchase
accounting" will negatively affect Vertex's earnings, as goodwill and other
intangible assets would be amortized over a period of years and cause decreased
earnings for each quarter during those years. Although Vertex expects to receive
letters from its independent accountants concurring with the conclusion of
Vertex's management that the merger will qualify for pooling of interests
accounting treatment and from Aurora's independent auditors that they concur
with the conclusion of Aurora's management as to whether Aurora meets the
conditions necessary for it to enter into the business combination accounted for
as a pooling of interests, such opinions are not binding on the Securities and
Exchange Commission and do not take into account transactions that may occur
subsequent to the completion of the merger that would disallow pooling of
interests accounting.

VERTEX STOCKHOLDERS FACE IMMEDIATE DILUTION AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER.

    Vertex stockholders will experience immediate and substantial dilution as a
result of the shares of Vertex common stock issued to Aurora stockholders in the
merger. Additional dilution may also occur upon exercise of any of the
outstanding options to purchase Aurora common stock that will be assumed by
Vertex in the merger.

                            RISKS RELATING TO VERTEX

    BY VOTING IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER, AURORA STOCKHOLDERS ARE CHOOSING TO INVEST
IN VERTEX COMMON STOCK. AN INVESTMENT IN VERTEX COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A HIGH
DEGREE OF RISK. IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN OR
INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT-PROSPECTUS, AURORA
STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS CONCERNING
VERTEX IN DECIDING WHETHER TO APPROVE AND ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

VERTEX DOES NOT KNOW HOW SUCCESSFUL AGENERASE WILL BE IN EUROPE, OR WHETHER
AGENERASE SALES IN THE UNITED STATES WILL CONTINUE AT CURRENT LEVELS.

    Vertex's first approved product is Agenerase, an HIV protease inhibitor,
which Vertex co-promotes with GlaxoSmithKline. Agenerase was only recently
launched in Europe. It is too early to predict the extent to which Agenerase
will be successful in Europe. Also, Agenerase's share of the U.S. protease
inhibitor market may decrease due to competitive forces and market dynamics.
Five other HIV protease inhibitors and a number of other products, including
DuPont's Sustiva and GlaxoSmithKline's Ziagen, are on the market for the
treatment of HIV infection and AIDS. Other drugs are still in development by
Vertex's competitors, including Bristol Myers Squibb and Boehringer Ingelheim,
which may have better efficacy, fewer side effects, easier administration and/or
lower costs than Agenerase. Moreover, the growth in the worldwide market for HIV
protease inhibitors has, to a certain extent, occurred as a result of early and
aggressive treatment of HIV infection with a protease inhibitor-based regimen.
Changes in treatment strategy, in which treatment is initiated later in the
course of infection, or in which treatment is more often initiated with a
regimen that does not include a protease inhibitor, may result in less use of
HIV protease inhibitors. In addition, the clinical benefit of strategies used to
boost drug levels of Agenerase by co-administering other antiretrovirals may not
prove to be effective, or may not result in increased revenues. As a result, the
total market for protease inhibitors in the U.S. and Europe may decline,
decreasing Agenerase sales potential. Consequently, Vertex may not recognize
additional royalty and milestone revenues on Agenerase as soon as it had
planned. Further, although Vertex co-promotes Agenerase in the U.S. and Europe,
GlaxoSmithKline is making most of the marketing and sales efforts and Vertex
will have little control over the success of those efforts. GlaxoSmithKline has
the right to terminate its agreement with Vertex without cause upon twelve
months' notice.

IF VERTEX DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP ITS DRUG PIPELINE, IT MAY NOT GENERATE
SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO ACHIEVE OR SUSTAIN PROFITABILITY IN THE FUTURE.

    As of June 1, 2001, Vertex and its collaborators were conducting clinical
trials for eight product candidates resulting from Vertex's research and
development programs, including additional clinical trials of VX-175, VX-497,
VX-740 and VX-745, and preclinical testing of four product candidates from these
programs. All of the products that Vertex is pursuing will require extensive
additional development, testing and investment, as well as regulatory approvals,
prior to commercialization. Vertex's product research and development efforts
may not be successful and its drug candidates may not enter preclinical or
clinical studies as or when anticipated or receive the required regulatory
approvals. Moreover, Vertex's products, if introduced, may not be commercially
successful. The results of preclinical and initial clinical trials of products
under development by Vertex are not necessarily predictive of results that will
be obtained from large-scale clinical testing. Clinical trials of products under
development may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of such products or
result in a marketable product. In addition, the administration alone or in
combination with other drugs of any product developed by Vertex may produce
undesirable side effects in humans.

    The failure to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of a
therapeutic drug under development could delay or prevent regulatory approval of
the product and could have a material adverse effect on Vertex. In addition, the
FDA may require additional clinical trials, which could result

in increased costs and significant development delays. While all or a portion of
these additional costs may be covered by payments under Vertex's collaborative
agreements, Vertex bears all of the costs for its drug candidates that are not
developed with partners.

IF DELAYS IN PATIENT ENROLLMENT SLOW VERTEX'S DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, IT MAY LOSE
ITS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OR BE UNABLE TO BRING ITS DRUGS TO MARKET.

    The rate of completion of clinical trials of Vertex's products is dependent
upon, among other factors, the rate of patient accrual. Patient accrual is a
function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the
proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial,
the level of compliance by the clinical sites to clinical trial protocols, and
the availability of clinical trial material. Vertex's drug candidate VX-745 is
the first p38 MAP kinase inhibitor to enter Phase II clinical trials. While none
of Vertex's clinical trials are currently experiencing slower than expected
patient accrual, delays in patient enrollment in Vertex's planned clinical
trials for VX-745 may result in increased costs, program delays or both, which
could have a material adverse effect on Vertex. While all or a portion of these
additional costs may be covered by payments under Vertex's collaborative
agreements, Vertex bears all of the costs for its drug candidates that are not
developed with partners. If any of Vertex's clinical trials are not completed,
it may not be able to submit a new drug application and any such application may
not be reviewed and approved by the FDA in a timely manner, if at all.

IF VERTEX DOES NOT OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR ITS PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY
BASIS, OR AT ALL, ITS REVENUES WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

    The FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial
requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products through
lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling
activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. Satisfaction of these
requirements typically takes several years or longer and may vary substantially
based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product. Data
obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying
interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In
addition, delays or rejections may be encountered based on changes in, or
additions to, regulatory policies for drug approval during the period of product
development and regulatory review. The effect of government regulation may be to
delay or prevent the commencement of planned clinical trials for Vertex's drug
candidates in clinical development, including VX-175, VX-497, VX-740, VX-745,
VX-148 and timcodar. It may also delay the commercialization of Vertex's
products, if any are developed and submitted for approval, for a considerable
period of time, impose costly procedures upon Vertex's activities and provide
competitive advantages to companies more experienced in regulatory affairs that
compete with Vertex. Moreover, even if approval is granted, such approval may
entail limitations on the indicated uses for which a compound may be marketed.

IF VERTEX IS UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS FOR RESEARCH
SUPPORT AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF ITS PRODUCTS, IT MAY NOT BE
ABLE TO FUND ITS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.

    Vertex's collaborative partners have agreed to fund portions of Vertex's
research and development programs and/or to conduct certain research and
development relating to specified products. In exchange, Vertex has given them
technology, product manufacturing and marketing rights relating to those
products. Some of Vertex's corporate partners, including Novartis,
GlaxoSmithKline, Aventis and Eli Lilly, have rights to control the planning and
execution of product development and clinical programs. Corporate partners may
exercise their control rights in ways that may negatively impact the timing and
success of those programs. Vertex's collaborations are subject to termination
rights by the collaborators. If any of Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, Aventis or Eli
Lilly were to terminate its relationship with Vertex, or fail to meet its
contractual obligations, it could have a material adverse

effect on Vertex's ability to undertake research, to fund related and other
programs and to develop, manufacture and market any products that may have
resulted from the collaboration. For example, if Novartis were to terminate its
collaboration with Vertex before the end of the research term specified in the
contract, Vertex would no longer be eligible to receive milestone payments and
reimbursements worth as much as $400 million from Novartis. Vertex expects to
seek additional collaborative arrangements to provide research support and to
develop and commercialize its products in the future. Vertex may not be able to
establish acceptable collaborative arrangements in the future, and even if it
does establish such collaborations, they may not be successful. Under certain of
Vertex's collaborative agreements, its partners have agreed to provide funding
for only a portion of its research and development activities, and Vertex is
committed to investing its own capital to fund the remainder of the agreed upon
programs. However, Vertex may not have adequate financial resources to satisfy
those requirements.

IF VERTEX LOSES ITS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES, IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE IN
THE MARKETPLACE.

    Vertex believes that its chemogenomics platform and parallel drug design
strategy give it a technological advantage. However, the pharmaceutical research
field is characterized by rapid technological progress and intense competition.
As a result, Vertex may not realize the expected benefits of these technologies.
For example, a large pharmaceutical company, with significantly more resources
than Vertex has, could pursue a novel, systematic approach to discover drugs
based on gene families using proprietary drug targets, compound libraries,
compound approaches, structural protein analysis and information technologies.
Such a company might identify broadly applicable compound classes faster and
more effectively than Vertex does, impeding Vertex's ability to develop and
market drugs based on its approach. Further, Vertex believes that interest in
the application of structure-based drug design, parallel drug design and related
approaches may continue and may accelerate as the strategies become more widely
understood. Businesses, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other
public and private research organizations are conducting research to develop
technologies that may compete with those Vertex uses. It is possible that
Vertex's competitors could acquire or develop technologies that would render its
technology obsolete or noncompetitive. For example, a competitor could develop
information technologies that accelerate the atomic-level analysis of potential
compounds that bind to the active site of a drug target, and predict the
absorption, toxicity, and relative ease-of-synthesis of candidate compounds. If
Vertex were unable to access the same technologies at an acceptable price, its
business could be adversely affected.

IF VERTEX'S COMPETITORS BRING SUPERIOR PRODUCTS TO MARKET OR BRING THEIR
PRODUCTS TO MARKET BEFORE VERTEX DOES, VERTEX MAY BE UNABLE TO FIND A MARKET FOR
ITS PRODUCTS.

    Vertex's products in development may not be able to compete effectively with
products that are currently on the market or new products that may be developed
by others. There are many other companies developing products for the same
indications that Vertex is pursuing in development. For example, Vertex knows of
at least ten drugs in development for the treatment of HIV, five drugs in
development for the treatment of hepatitis C infection, and 20 drugs in
development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, by competitors in the
pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. In order to compete successfully in
these areas, Vertex must demonstrate improved safety, efficacy, and ease of
manufacturing and gain market acceptance over competing products which have
received regulatory approval and are currently marketed. Many of Vertex's
competitors, including major pharmaceutical companies such as GlaxoSmithKline,
Novartis, Abbott and Merck, have substantially greater financial, technical and
human resources than Vertex does. In addition, many of its competitors have
significantly greater experience than Vertex does in conducting preclinical
testing and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products, and in
obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products. Accordingly, Vertex's
competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for products more
rapidly than Vertex does. If Vertex obtains regulatory approval and launches
commercial sales of its

products, it will also compete with respect to manufacturing efficiency and
sales and marketing capabilities, areas in which it currently has limited
experience.

THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF KEY EMPLOYEES OR THE FAILURE TO HIRE QUALIFIED
EMPLOYEES WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT VERTEX'S BUSINESS AND FUTURE GROWTH.

    Because Vertex's products are highly technical in nature, only highly
qualified and trained scientists have the necessary skills to develop these
products. Vertex's future success will depend in large part on the continued
services of its key scientific and management personnel, including Dr. Joshua S.
Boger, its Chief Executive Officer, and Dr. Vicki L. Sato, its President. While
Vertex has entered into employment agreements with Dr. Boger and Dr. Sato, they
may be terminated by the employee upon six months' notice. Vertex faces intense
competition for its scientific personnel from its competitors, its collaborative
partners and other companies throughout its industry. Moreover, the growth of
local biotechnology companies and the expansion of major pharmaceutical
companies into the Cambridge, Massachusetts area has increased competition for
the available pool of skilled employees, especially in technical fields, and the
high cost of living in the Boston area makes it difficult to attract employees
from other parts of the country. A failure to retain, as well as hire, train and
effectively integrate into its organization, a sufficient number of qualified
scientists and professionals would negatively impact Vertex's business and its
ability to grow its business. In addition, the level of funding under some of
Vertex's collaborative agreements, in particular the Novartis collaboration,
depends on the number of Vertex's scientists performing research under those
agreements. If Vertex cannot hire and retain the required personnel, funding
received under the agreements may be reduced.

IF VERTEX FAILS TO MANAGE ITS GROWTH EFFECTIVELY, ITS BUSINESS MAY SUFFER.

    During the year 2000, Vertex added approximately 100 employees, increasing
the size of its organization by almost 30%. In addition, if the merger is
completed, Vertex will add approximately 350 more employees, and Vertex intends
to continue to grow. This type of growth requires a significant investment in
personnel, management systems and resources. Vertex's ability to commercialize
its products, achieve its research and development objectives, and satisfy its
commitments under its collaboration agreements depends on its ability to respond
effectively to these demands and expand its internal organization to accommodate
additional anticipated growth. If Vertex is unable to manage growth effectively,
there could be a material adverse effect on its business.

VERTEX DEPENDS ON THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURERS, AND IF IT IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN
CONTRACT MANUFACTURING ON REASONABLE TERMS, IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DEVELOP OR
COMMERCIALIZE ITS PRODUCTS.

    Vertex's ability to conduct clinical trials and its ability to commercialize
its potential products will depend, in part, on its ability to manufacture its
products on a large scale, either directly or through third parties, at a
competitive cost and in accordance with FDA and other regulatory requirements.
Vertex has no experience in manufacturing pharmaceuticals or other products, and
it may not be able to develop such capabilities in the foreseeable future. In
addition, some of Vertex's current corporate partners have manufacturing rights
with respect to Vertex's products under development. Accordingly, Vertex is
dependent on third party manufacturers and its collaborative partners for the
production of its compounds for preclinical research, clinical trial purposes
and commercial production. If Vertex is not able to obtain contract
manufacturing from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, it may
not be able to conduct or complete clinical trials or commercialize its products
as planned. Further, commercial formulation and manufacturing processes have yet
to be developed for Vertex's drug candidates other than Agenerase. As a result,
Vertex or its collaborators may encounter difficulties developing commercial
formulations and manufacturing processes for Vertex's drug candidates that could
result in delays in clinical trials, regulatory submissions, regulatory
approvals and commercialization of its products.

IF VERTEX'S PATENTS DO NOT PROTECT ITS PRODUCTS, OR VERTEX'S PRODUCTS INFRINGE
THIRD-PARTY PATENTS, VERTEX COULD BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION AND SUBSTANTIAL
LIABILITIES.

    As of June 1, 2001, Vertex had 105 patent applications pending in the United
States, as well as foreign counterparts in other countries. Vertex's success
will depend, in significant part, on its ability to obtain and maintain United
States and foreign patent protection for its products, their uses and its
processes, to preserve Vertex's trade secrets and to operate without infringing
the proprietary rights of third parties. Vertex does not know whether any
patents will issue from any of its patent applications or, even if patents issue
or have issued, that the issued claims will provide Vertex with any significant
protection against competitive products or otherwise be valuable commercially.
Legal standards relating to the validity of patents and the proper scope of
their claims in the biopharmaceutical field are still evolving, and there is no
consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims in
biopharmaceutical patents or the effect of prior art on them. If Vertex is not
able to obtain adequate patent protection, its ability to prevent competitors
from making, using and selling competing products will be limited. Furthermore,
Vertex's activities may infringe the claims of patents held by third parties.
Vertex is currently contesting a suit filed by Chiron Corporation claiming
infringement of three U.S. patents issued to Chiron. Although Vertex believes
that the ultimate outcome of the action will not have a material impact on its
consolidated financial position, defense and prosecution of patent claims,
including those at issue in the Chiron case, as well as participation in other
inter-party proceedings, can be expensive and time-consuming, even in those
instances in which the outcome is favorable to Vertex. If the outcome of any
such litigation or proceeding were adverse, Vertex could be subject to
significant liabilities to third parties, could be required to obtain licenses
from third parties or could be required to cease sales of the affected products,
any of which could have a material adverse effect on Vertex's business.

VERTEX EXPECTS TO INCUR FUTURE LOSSES AND IT MAY NEVER BECOME PROFITABLE.

    Vertex has incurred significant operating losses each year since its
inception and expects to incur a significant operating loss in 2001. Vertex
believes that operating losses will continue beyond 2001, even if Vertex
receives significant future payments under its existing and future collaborative
agreements and royalties on Agenerase sales, because it is planning to make
significant investments in research and development and will incur significant
selling, general, and administrative expenses for its potential products. Vertex
expects that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, and
that such fluctuations may be substantial. Vertex may never achieve or sustain
profitability.

VERTEX MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THAT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE.

    Vertex expects to incur substantial research and development and related
supporting expenses as it designs and develops existing and future compounds and
undertakes clinical trials of potential drugs resulting from such compounds.
Vertex also expects to incur substantial administrative and commercialization
expenditures in the future and substantial expenses related to the filing,
prosecution, defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property
claims. Vertex anticipates that it will finance these substantial cash needs
with:

    - future payments under its collaborative agreements;

    - additional collaborative agreements;

    - Agenerase royalty revenue;

    - existing cash reserves, together with interest earned on those reserves;

    - facilities and equipment financing; and

    - future product sales (including sales of Aurora products) to the extent
      that it markets products directly.

    Vertex expects that funds from these sources will be sufficient to fund its
planned activities for at least the next 18 months. If not, it will be necessary
to raise additional funds through public offerings or private placements of
equity or debt securities or other methods of financing. Any equity financings
could result in dilution to Vertex's then existing securityholders. Any debt
financing, if available at all, may be on terms which, among other things,
restrict Vertex's ability to pay dividends and interest (although Vertex does
not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future). The required interest
payments associated with any significant additional debt financing could
materially adversely impact Vertex's ability to service its outstanding notes.
The terms of any additional debt financing may also, under certain
circumstances, restrict or prohibit Vertex from making interest payments on its
outstanding notes. If adequate funds are not available, Vertex may be required
to curtail significantly or discontinue one or more of its research, drug
discovery or development programs, including clinical trials, or attempt to
obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may
require Vertex to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies or products
in research or development. Additional financing may not be available on
acceptable terms, if at all.

IF GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE INSURANCE PLANS DO NOT PAY FOR VERTEX PRODUCTS, THOSE
PRODUCTS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

    The success of Vertex products in the United States and other significant
markets will depend, in part, upon the extent to which a consumer will be able
to obtain reimbursement for the cost of those products from government health
administration authorities, third-party payors and other organizations. We
cannot always determine in advance the reimbursement status of newly approved
therapeutic products. Even if a product is approved for marketing, the amount
paid by reimbursing organizations may not be adequate. Also, future legislation
or regulation, or related announcements or developments, concerning the health
care industry or third-party or governmental coverage and reimbursement may
adversely affect reimbursement policies. In particular, legislation or
regulation limiting consumers' reimbursement rights could limit reimbursement
amounts for the cost of Agenerase.

VERTEX HAS LIMITED SALES AND MARKETING EXPERIENCE.

    Vertex currently has little experience in marketing and selling
pharmaceutical products. Vertex must either develop a marketing and sales force
or enter into arrangements with third parties to market and sell any of its
product candidates which are approved by the FDA. Vertex currently intends to
bring VX-497 and VX-745 to market itself. For these drug candidates and other
drug candidates for which Vertex has retained marketing or co-promotion rights,
Vertex may not be able to develop successfully its own sales and marketing
force, and Vertex does not know whether it will be able to enter into marketing
and sales agreements with others on acceptable terms, if at all. If Vertex
develops its own marketing and sales capability, it may be competing with other
companies that currently have experienced and well-funded marketing and sales
operations. Vertex has granted exclusive marketing rights for Agenerase and
VX-175 to GlaxoSmithKline worldwide except the Far East, and for VX-740 to
Aventis worldwide. Kissei has exclusive marketing rights to Agenerase, VX-745
and VX-702 in Japan and an option for VX-850. Even though Vertex retains some
co-promotion rights, to the extent that its collaborative partners have
commercial rights to its products, any revenues Vertex receives from those
products will depend primarily on the sales and marketing efforts of others.

IF VERTEX INCURS PRODUCT LIABILITY EXPENSES, ITS EARNINGS COULD BE NEGATIVELY
IMPACTED.

    Vertex's business will expose it to potential product liability risks that
arise from the testing, manufacturing and sales of its products. In addition to
direct expenditures for damages, settlement and defense costs, there is the
possibility of adverse publicity as a result of product liability claims. These

risks will increase as Vertex's products receive regulatory approval and are
commercialized. Vertex currently carries a total of $10 million of product
liability insurance. This level of insurance may not be sufficient. Moreover,
Vertex may not be able to maintain its existing levels of insurance or be able
to obtain or maintain additional insurance that it may need in the future on
acceptable terms.

    In addition, Vertex's research and development activities may from time to
time involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including hazardous
chemicals and radioactive materials. Accordingly, Vertex is subject to federal,
state and local laws governing the use, handling and disposal of these
materials. Although Vertex believes that its safety procedures for handling and
disposing of hazardous materials comply with regulatory requirements, it cannot
completely eliminate the risk that accidental contamination or injury from these
materials could expose Vertex to significant liability.

EVENTS WITH RESPECT TO VERTEX'S SHARE CAPITAL COULD CAUSE THE PRICE OF VERTEX
COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.

    Sales of substantial amounts of Vertex common stock in the open market, or
the availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of
Vertex common stock. As of June 1, 2001, Vertex had 60,373,345 shares of common
stock outstanding, excluding shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of
outstanding stock options, employee stock purchase and 401(k) plans and upon
conversion of its outstanding notes. As of June 1, 2001, Vertex had outstanding
stock options to purchase 11,428,148 shares of Vertex common stock at a weighted
average exercise price of approximately $25.23 per share. Of this total,
5,152,966 were currently exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of
approximately $13.94 per share. The shares of Vertex common stock that may be
issued under the options will generally be freely tradable or transferable
pursuant to an effective registration statement. In addition, upon completion of
the merger, based on shares of Aurora common stock and options to purchase
shares of Aurora common stock outstanding as of June 1, 2001, Vertex will issue
approximately 14,160,814 shares of common stock to the stockholders of Aurora
and will assume options to purchase approximately 2,733,366 shares of Vertex
common stock. All shares of Vertex common stock issuable upon completion of the
merger, except those held by affiliates of Aurora, will be freely transferable.
In addition, Vertex has agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-8
relating to the shares of Vertex common stock issuable upon exercise of the
assumed Aurora stock options within 20 days after completion of the merger.

VERTEX HAS ADOPTED ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS THAT MAY FRUSTRATE ANY ATTEMPT TO
ACQUIRE VERTEX OR TO REMOVE OR REPLACE ITS MANAGEMENT.

    Provisions in Vertex's restated articles of organization, as amended, and
amended and restated by-laws and Vertex's stockholder rights plan may discourage
certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control
of Vertex which might be beneficial to the company or its securityholders.
Vertex's restated articles of organization, as amended, provides for staggered
terms for the members of its board of directors. Vertex's by-laws grant the
directors a right to adjourn annual meetings of stockholders, and certain
provisions of the by-laws may be amended only with an 80% stockholder vote.
Pursuant to Vertex's stockholder rights plan, each share of Vertex common stock
has an associated preferred share purchase right. The rights will not trade
separately from the common stock until, and are exercisable only upon, the
acquisition or the potential acquisition through tender offer by a person or
group of 15% or more of the outstanding Vertex common stock. Vertex may also
issue shares of any class or series of preferred stock in the future without
stockholder approval and upon such terms as its board of directors may
determine. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may
be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of
preferred stock that may be issued in the future. As a result, stockholders or
other parties may find it more difficult to remove or replace Vertex's
management.

VERTEX'S STOCK PRICE MAY FLUCTUATE BASED ON FACTORS BEYOND ITS CONTROL.

    Market prices for securities of biopharmaceutical companies such as Vertex
are highly volatile. Within the 12 months ended March 31, 2001, Vertex common
stock traded between $18.88 and $99.25. The market for Vertex common stock, like
that of stock of other companies in the biopharmaceutical field, has from time
to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated
to Vertex's operating performance. The future market price of Vertex's
securities could be significantly and adversely affected by factors such as:

    - announcements of results of clinical trials;

    - technological innovations or the introduction of new products by Vertex's
      competitors;

    - government regulatory action;

    - public concern as to the safety of products developed by others;

    - developments in patent or other intellectual property rights or
      announcements relating to these matters;

    - developments in domestic and international governmental policy or
      regulation, for example relating to intellectual property rights; and

    - developments and market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology
      stocks, in general.

VERTEX'S OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS MAY INCREASE ITS COSTS AND MAKE IT MORE
DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING.

    As of March 31, 2001, Vertex had approximately $347 million in long-term
debt. The high level of its indebtedness will impact Vertex by:

    - significantly increasing its interest expense and related debt service
      costs;

    - making it more difficult to obtain additional financing for working
      capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other
      purposes; and

    - constraining Vertex's ability to react quickly in an unfavorable economic
      climate.

transact any other business that properly comes before the special meetings or
any adjournment or postponement of the special meetings.

STOCKHOLDER RECORD DATES FOR THE SPECIAL MEETINGS

    VERTEX.  Vertex's board of directors has fixed the close of business on
June 6, 2001 as the record date for determination of Vertex's stockholders
entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. On the record date,
there were 60,373,345 shares of Vertex common stock outstanding, held by
approximately 191 holders of record.

    AURORA.  Aurora's board of directors has fixed the close of business on
June 6, 2001 as the record date for determination of Aurora's stockholders
entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. On the record date,
there were 22,738,438 shares of Aurora common stock outstanding, held by
approximately 233 holders of record.

VOTES REQUIRED AT THE SPECIAL MEETINGS

    VERTEX.  At least a majority of the outstanding shares of Vertex common
stock must be represented, either in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum
at the Vertex special meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will each be
included in determining whether a quorum is present. The affirmative vote of the
holders of at least a majority of the shares of Vertex's outstanding common
stock present or represented and voting at the special meeting is required to
approve the issuance of the Vertex common stock in connection with the merger
and to approve the amendment to Vertex's 1996 Stock and Option Plan. At the
Vertex special meeting, each share of Vertex common stock is entitled to one
vote on all matters properly submitted to the Vertex stockholders at the special
meeting. As of the record date for the special meeting, directors and executive
officers of Vertex and their affiliates owned approximately 1.9% of all
outstanding shares of Vertex common stock entitled to vote at the special
meeting. These directors and executive officers of Vertex have executed proxies
so that these shares will be voted in favor of the approval of the issuance of
the Vertex common stock in connection with the merger.

    AURORA.  At least a majority of the outstanding shares of Aurora common
stock must be represented, either in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum
at the Aurora special meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will each be
included in determining whether a quorum is present. The affirmative vote of the
holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Aurora's common
stock is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement. At the Aurora
special meeting, each share of Aurora common stock is entitled to one vote on
all matters properly submitted to the Aurora stockholders at the special
meeting. As of the record date for the special meeting, directors and executive
officers of Aurora and their affiliates owned approximately 3.8% of all
outstanding shares of Aurora common stock entitled to vote at the special
meeting. These directors and executive officers of Aurora have executed proxies
so that these shares will be voted in favor of the approval and adoption of the
merger agreement.

PROXIES

    VERTEX.  All shares of Vertex common stock represented by properly executed
proxies or voting instructions received before or at the Vertex special meeting
will, unless the proxies or voting instructions are revoked, be voted in
accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxies or voting
instructions. If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy
card, the shares will be voted FOR the approval of the issuance of the Vertex
common stock in connection with the merger and FOR the approval of the amendment
to Vertex's 1996 Stock and Option Plan. You are urged to mark the boxes on the
proxy card to indicate how to vote your shares.

    If you hold your shares of Vertex common stock through a brokerage firm or
bank, they may only vote your Vertex common stock with respect to the proposal
to approve the issuance of Vertex common stock in connection with the merger in
accordance with your instructions. If the broker does not timely receive your
instructions, it may not vote your Vertex common stock with respect to this
proposal. With respect to the proposal to amend Vertex's 1996 Stock and Option
Plan, your broker will have discretion to vote your shares even if you do not
provide instructions. Broker non-votes, as well as abstentions and failures to
vote, will have no effect on the approval of the proposal to approve the
issuance of the Vertex common stock in connection with the merger or the
proposal to approve the amendment to Vertex's 1996 Stock and Option Plan.

    Vertex does not expect that any matter other than approval of the issuance
of Vertex common stock in connection with the merger and approval of the
amendment to Vertex's 1996 Stock and Option Plan will be brought before the
Vertex special meeting. If, however, other matters are properly presented, the
persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment with
respect to those matters, unless authority to do so is withheld on the proxy
card.

    AURORA.  All shares of Aurora common stock represented by properly executed
proxies or voting instructions received before or at the Aurora special meeting
will, unless the proxies or voting instructions are revoked, be voted in
accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxies or voting
instructions. If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy
card, the shares will be voted FOR the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement. You are urged to mark the box on the proxy card to indicate how to
vote your shares.

    If you hold your shares of Aurora common stock through a brokerage firm or
bank, they may only vote your Aurora common stock at the special meeting in
accordance with your instructions. If the broker does not timely receive your
instructions, it may not vote your Aurora common stock. Because the approval and
adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of at least a
majority of the shares of Aurora's common stock outstanding on the record date,
broker non-votes, as well as abstentions and failures to vote, will have the
same effect as a vote against approval and adoption of the merger agreement.

    Aurora does not expect that any matter other than the approval and adoption
of the merger agreement will be brought before the special meeting. If, however,
other matters are properly presented, the persons named as proxies will vote in
accordance with their judgment with respect to those matters, unless authority
to do so is withheld on the proxy card.

REVOCATION OF PROXIES

    A stockholder of record may revoke his or her proxy at any time before it is
voted by:

    - notifying in writing the Clerk of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated at
      130 Waverly Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139-4242, if you are a
      Vertex stockholder, or the Secretary of Aurora Biosciences Corporation at
      11010 Torreyana Road, San Diego, California 92121, if you are an Aurora
      stockholder;

    - granting a subsequently dated proxy; or

    - appearing in person and voting at the special meeting if you are a holder
      of record.

If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must
follow the directions received from your broker to revoke your vote or to vote
at your respective special meeting. Attendance at the special meeting will not
in and of itself constitute revocation of a proxy.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

    Vertex and Aurora will equally share the expenses incurred in connection
with the printing and mailing of this joint proxy statement-prospectus. Vertex
has retained D.F. King & Co., Inc. , at an estimated cost of $4,000.00 plus
reimbursement of expenses, to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the
Vertex special meeting. Vertex, its proxy solicitor and Aurora will also request
banks, brokers and other intermediaries holding shares of Vertex common stock or
Aurora common stock beneficially owned by others to send this joint proxy
statement-prospectus to, and obtain proxies from, the beneficial owners and will
reimburse the holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Solicitation of
proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, telegram, and other electronic
means, advertisements and personal solicitation by the directors, officers or
employees of Vertex and Aurora. No additional compensation will be paid to
directors, officers or employees for such solicitation.

    AURORA STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT SEND IN ANY STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH THEIR
PROXY CARD. A TRANSMITTAL LETTER WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE SURRENDER OF STOCK
CERTIFICATES FOR AURORA COMMON STOCK WILL BE MAILED TO AURORA STOCKHOLDERS AS
SOON AS PRACTICABLE AFTER COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

    In evaluating its strategic direction during 2000, Vertex determined that
one of its near-term goals was to acquire complementary products, capabilities
and technologies that would enhance its drug discovery capabilities.

    Throughout the year 2000, Aurora's board of directors and executive
management team had numerous discussions regarding potential strategic
transactions that would enable Aurora to accelerate Aurora's comprehensive drug
discovery initiatives and create new and enhanced partnership opportunities.
During this time period, Aurora's executive management team reviewed available
information regarding the business and technology of other companies that would
complement and enhance those of Aurora. As a result of these discussions,
Aurora's executive management team decided to explore entering into discussions
with companies that presented the best potential opportunities to accelerate
Aurora's development and growth.

    On May 26, 2000, Dr. Harry Stylli, Aurora's Senior Vice President,
Commercial Development, and Dr. Paul Negulescu, Aurora's Senior Vice President,
Discovery Biology, met with Mr. Richard Aldrich, Vertex's former Senior Vice
President and Chief Business Officer, and Dr. Vicki Sato, Vertex's President, at
Vertex's facilities in Boston, Massachusetts to discuss a potential research
collaboration between Aurora and Vertex. The representatives of Aurora and
Vertex discussed a range of business possibilities, including strategic
alternatives. However, the representatives agreed that, at that time, a
strategic transaction, other than a possible joint venture, was not considered
feasible.

    On October 11, 2000, Dr. Stylli met with Mr. Aldrich at Vertex's facilities
where they discussed the strong complementary nature of the two companies'
technology platforms, the positive commercial reputations of each company and
the potential value that could be created by a strategic relationship. Among
other possible business relationships discussed, Dr. Stylli and Mr. Aldrich
agreed that a potential merger transaction was one alternative that could
achieve the potential benefits to be derived for each company from possible new
collaborations and technology synergies. Dr. Stylli and Mr. Aldrich then
discussed and planned a comprehensive scientific and business meeting.

    On November 20, 2000 and November 21, 2000, Dr. Stylli, Dr. Negulescu and
other members of Aurora management met with Mr. Aldrich and Dr. John Thomson,
Vertex's Vice President of Research. Following presentations by each of the
representatives of Aurora and Vertex on each company's business and science, the
representatives of each company expressed a high interest in working with the
other company. The representatives concluded that there should be further
deliberation regarding the potential of a research collaboration, merger or
other strategic transaction between the two companies.

    On December 4, 2000, Dr. Stylli and Mr. Aldrich had a meeting to explore a
potential strategic transaction between Aurora and Vertex. At this meeting, Dr.
Stylli and Mr. Aldrich discussed potential synergies and the complementary
nature of the businesses of Aurora and Vertex. Dr. Stylli and Mr.

Aldrich agreed to follow-up with another conference call to include Dr.
Negulescu and to arrange for Dr. Stuart J. M. Collinson, Chairman, Chief
Executive Officer and President of Aurora, and Dr. Joshua Boger, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of Vertex, to meet at the JP Morgan H&Q 19th Annual
Health Care Conference in San Francisco, California scheduled for January 2001.

    On December 22, 2000, Aurora and Vertex entered into a mutual nondisclosure
agreement providing for the safeguarding of confidential information which the
parties might disclose to one another during any discussions.

    On January 9, 2001, Drs. Collinson, Stylli and Negulescu met with Drs. Boger
and Sato and Lynne Brum, Vertex's Vice President of Corporate Communications and
Market Development, at the JP Morgan H&Q 19th Annual Health Care Conference in
San Francisco to discuss mutual interests regarding possible collaboration
opportunities, ranging from one or more targeted research or technology
collaborations to a broader strategic business combination and to discuss the
agenda for an on-site visit of Aurora's facilities by the Vertex management
team.

    On January 11, 2001, Drs. Boger and Sato met with members of Aurora's
management team at Aurora's facilities in San Diego, California. At the meeting,
Drs. Collinson, Stylli and Negulescu, and Messrs. Thomas Klopack, a Senior Vice
President and the Chief Operating Officer of Aurora, and Christopher Krueger,
Aurora's Vice President, Strategic Alliances and Legal Affairs, gave
presentations to Drs. Boger and Sato on Aurora's systems, intellectual property
and general business. In addition, Drs. Boger and Sato presented details
regarding Vertex's technology and were given a tour of Aurora's facilities.

    On January 24, 2001, Dr. Boger communicated to Dr. Collinson that Vertex was
interested in further pursuing substantive discussions regarding a potential
acquisition of Aurora by Vertex.

    On January 31, 2001, Drs. Collinson and Boger discussed via telephone
Vertex's desire to better understand Aurora's business. To this end, they agreed
to meet in San Diego in mid-February.

    On February 14, 2001, at a regularly scheduled meeting of Vertex's board of
directors, there was a discussion of potential merger or acquisition candidates
of interest to Vertex, including Aurora.

    On February 16, 2001, Dr. Boger and Mr. Thomas G. Auchincloss, Jr., Vertex's
former Vice President of Finance, met with members of the senior management team
of Aurora at Aurora's facilities in San Diego. The Aurora team discussed
Aurora's culture, hiring process and other business issues and gave
presentations on the financial aspects of Aurora's business and commercial
development strategy. In turn, Dr. Boger discussed Vertex's view on other
companies within the industry and, in particular, discussed the structure of
various corporate partnering deals Vertex had entered into with third parties.
Dr. Boger also shared with the Aurora management team Vertex's financial
position and other financial aspects of Vertex's business.

    On February 22, 2001, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated
gave a presentation to Vertex, including a preliminary evaluation of Aurora.

    On February 27, 2001, the board of directors of Aurora held a regularly
scheduled meeting at which Dr. Collinson gave an update regarding a potential
transaction with Vertex. The board of directors authorized and instructed Dr.
Collinson to continue discussions with Vertex. In addition, the board of
directors also directed management to review other opportunities regarding a
potential strategic transaction.

    On March 1, 2001, Dr. Boger spoke by telephone with Dr. Collinson to signal
Vertex's interest in discussing in more detail a possible merger between the
companies and to gauge Dr. Collinson's interest in engaging in a more formalized
process of evaluation of the opportunity. The parties agreed to meet as soon as
possible to continue discussions.

    On March 5, 2001, Dr. Boger received a communication from Dr. Collinson
indicating that the Aurora senior management team, as well as the Aurora board,
were supportive of further and more detailed discussions.

    On March 7, 2001, Drs. Collinson and Boger had a telephonic meeting in which
they discussed various aspects of the proposed transaction, including Aurora's
desire to conduct technical, legal and financial due diligence of Vertex. In
addition, the parties spoke generally about valuation and the process going
forward.

    On March 8, 2001, members of Vertex senior management met with
representatives of Merrill Lynch, Ernst & Young, its accounting advisors for the
transaction, and Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C., its
outside legal counsel, to discuss plans for due diligence and timing of the
proposed transaction.

    On March 8, 2001, Mr. Krueger spoke via telephone with Sarah Cecil, Vertex's
Corporate Counsel, regarding the process and schedule by which Vertex would
complete its due diligence review of Aurora.

    On March 8, 2001, Aurora engaged Goldman, Sachs & Co., as its financial
advisor in connection with a possible transaction with Vertex.

    On March 9, 2001, Vertex engaged Merrill Lynch to act as its exclusive
financial advisor in connection with the possible acquisition transaction
involving Aurora and to render an opinion, if requested, on the fairness of such
a transaction from a financial point of view to Vertex.

    During the weeks of March 12 and March 19, 2001, Vertex and Aurora exchanged
requests for documents, materials and information required to conduct due
diligence reviews of each company.

    On March 20, 2001, Vertex and Aurora along with representatives of Merrill
Lynch and Goldman Sachs met in Laguna Niguel, California to discuss valuation,
structure and other terms in connection with a potential strategic transaction
between Vertex and Aurora. Possible financial and economic terms of the
transaction were also discussed.

    On March 21, 2001, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Aurora board of
directors, Dr. Collinson provided an update of the potential strategic
transaction with Vertex, including a report of the meeting held in Laguna
Niguel. The board of directors directed Dr. Collinson to proceed with
negotiations with Vertex.

    On March 23, 2001, Aurora and Vertex entered into a second nondisclosure
agreement whereby each party agreed it would not disclose or misuse confidential
information provided by the other party during discussions regarding a potential
strategic relationship. This agreement provided, among other things, that until
April 8, 2001, Aurora would negotiate exclusively with Vertex with respect to a
strategic transaction.

    From March 26, 2001 through March 28, 2001, Vertex's management team, legal
advisors and financial advisors met with representatives of Aurora's management
team and financial and legal advisors at the law offices of Cooley Godward LLP,
outside counsel to Aurora, in San Diego, California. During this three-day
period, various members of Aurora's senior management team gave technical,
commercial and financial presentations to the representatives of Vertex, and
Vertex conducted due diligence review of Aurora's collaboration and partnering
agreements, as well as other records and documents related to Aurora's business
made available by Aurora.

    On March 29, 2001, a first draft of the merger agreement was sent to Aurora
and its legal and financial advisors by Mintz Levin.

    On March 30, 2001, at a telephonic meeting of the Aurora board of directors,
Dr. Collinson provided an update of the status of the proposed transaction with
Vertex. Dr. Collinson reported on the proposed terms of the transaction, the
risks and advantages for Aurora of proceeding with such a

transaction versus continuing as an independent entity and the strengths and
weaknesses of each of Aurora and Vertex. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then
updated the board of directors with respect to merger and acquisition activity
for biotechnology companies in general and summarized current market conditions.
Goldman Sachs also discussed general matters related to the potential
transaction with Vertex.

    From April 1, 2001 through April 4, 2001, members of Aurora's management
team, as well as Aurora's outside legal and financial advisors, met in Boston at
Vertex headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and at the offices of Mintz
Levin, and conducted technical, legal and financial due diligence investigations
of Vertex. Senior members of Vertex's management team gave presentations on the
technical, commercial and financial aspects of Vertex's business. During this
period, representatives of each of Aurora and Vertex, including members of their
respective financial and legal advisory teams, conducted face-to-face
negotiations with respect to the terms of the proposed merger agreement. In
addition, the parties conducted numerous conferences to negotiate the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement and related documents and to discuss various
other legal, financial and regulatory matters related to the merger.

    On April 4, 2001, at a telephonic meeting of Aurora's board of directors,
Dr. Collinson summarized the diligence presentations provided by Vertex during
the parties' discussions from April 1, 2001 through April 4, 2001 and updated
the board of directors on the status of discussions with Vertex, including key
terms of the merger agreement and valuation. Representatives of Goldman Sachs
then discussed valuation matters with the board of directors.

    On April 5, 2001, Dr. Boger communicated to Dr. Collinson proposed
financial, economic and other substantive terms, including the proposed exchange
ratio.

    On April 6, 2001, at a telephonic meeting of Aurora's board of directors,
Aurora's management team and representatives of Foley, Hoag & Elliot, outside
counsel engaged by Aurora specifically to perform a due diligence review of
Vertex's intellectual property, summarized the results of the technical,
regulatory and business due diligence review of Vertex. The board of directors
then heard a presentation by representatives of Goldman Sachs, who summarized
Vertex's most recent proposal. Following that presentation, representatives of
Cooley Godward summarized the legal issues arising out of the currently proposed
merger agreement. Goldman Sachs then provided the board of directors with a
presentation including, among other things, a review of market performance in
the biotechnology sector and a review of Vertex's business, market and trading
history. The board of directors instructed management to proceed with
negotiations with Vertex.

    On April 6, 2001, Dr. Collinson telephoned Dr. Boger, after consulting with
the Aurora board, to report that the terms of the April 5 proposal were not
acceptable to the Aurora board with respect to price and on account of
outstanding issues with the merger agreement. The parties agreed to continue a
dialogue to explore resolution of these issues.

    From April 6, 2001 through April 12, 2001, representatives of each of Aurora
and Vertex and each of the parties' legal and financial advisors continued their
due diligence reviews and conducted numerous telephone conferences to negotiate
the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and related documents, and to

    On April 8, 2001, at a telephonic meeting of Aurora's board of directors,
Dr. Collinson provided the board of directors with an update on the discussions
between Aurora and Vertex since the last board of directors' meeting, including
a specific discussion on valuation and other unresolved issues related to the

proposed financial terms of the transaction, and representatives of Mintz Levin
described key provisions and open issues with respect to the merger agreement.
Representatives of Ernst & Young reported on the results of their financial due
diligence on behalf of Vertex, and Ms. Cecil discussed the results of Vertex's
own due diligence. The board expressed support for the merger in principle but
voiced concern over the proposed financial and economic terms of the
transaction, given relative stock movements since the April 5 proposal. The
board tentatively agreed to meet again to consider the transaction for approval
once the terms of the merger agreement and Aurora management employment
agreements were substantially agreed upon.

    On April 10, 2001, at a telephonic meeting of Aurora's board of directors,
Dr. Collinson provided the board of directors with an update on the discussions
between Aurora and Vertex since Aurora's last board of directors' meeting.

At this meeting, the board of directors expressed concern over the valuation of
Aurora being proposed by Vertex. At this time, the board of directors instructed
Dr. Collinson to continue discussions with Vertex relating to valuation and
other unresolved issues and to report back to the board of directors the next
day.

    On April 12, 2001, Dr. Boger spoke with Dr. Collinson by telephone. Dr.
Boger told Dr. Collinson that, due to recent changes in the relative market
prices of the two companies, Vertex's previously proposed exchange ratio no
longer represented an acceptable exchange from Vertex's perspective, and the
offer was withdrawn by Vertex.

    On April 12, 2001, at a telephonic meeting of Aurora's board of directors,
Dr. Collinson provided the board of directors with an update on the discussions
between Aurora and Vertex, including valuation, proposed terms of the merger
agreement and employment agreements and business integration issues. After an
extensive discussion, the board of directors directed management to discontinue
discussions with Vertex based upon the decision of the board of directors that,
given the market price of Aurora's common stock, the valuation and other terms
relating to the merger being proposed by Vertex were unacceptable. On the
evening of April 12, 2001, representatives of Goldman Sachs communicated, on
behalf of Aurora, to representatives of Merrill Lynch that Aurora was
terminating discussions with Vertex.

    On April 21, 2001, financial advisors of Vertex spoke with Aurora's
financial advisors to determine whether there was mutual interest in reopening
negotiations.

    On April 22, 2001, Dr. Collinson reported to the Aurora board of directors
that Vertex had reinitiated conversations and requested authority from the board
of directors to resume negotiations with Vertex. After full consideration, the

    From April 23, 2001 through April 29, 2001, representatives of each of
Aurora and Vertex, and each of the parties' legal and financial advisors,
conducted numerous telephone conferences and meetings to negotiate the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement and related documents, including affiliate
agreements, stockholder agreements, employment agreements and to discuss various
other issues. During this period, Aurora's and Vertex's respective management
teams and legal and financial advisors concluded their due diligence reviews.

    On April 27, 2001, at a telephonic meeting of Aurora's board of directors,
Dr. Collinson provided the board of directors with an update on the discussions
between Aurora and Vertex, including the material terms of the merger
transaction and valuation. After a discussion of the proposed material terms of
the transaction, the recent market performance of each of Aurora and Vertex and
the recent valuation discussions between representatives of Aurora and Vertex,
the board of directors directed management to proceed with negotiations with
Vertex.

    On April 28, 2001, at a telephonic meeting of Aurora's board of directors,

agreements. Dr. Collinson discussed the potential synergies and upside presented
by the merger along with the risks of combining the two companies. Goldman Sachs
reviewed with the board of directors its financial analysis and delivered to the
board of directors its opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing on
April 29, 2001, that as of April 28, 2001 the exchange ratio provided in the
merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of
Aurora common stock. After full discussion, the Aurora board of directors
unanimously concluded that the merger was in the best interests of Aurora and
the Aurora stockholders, approved the merger and the merger agreement
substantially in the form presented to the board of directors, and resolved to
recommend that the Aurora stockholders vote in favor of the merger.

    On April 29, 2001, the board of directors of Vertex held a special meeting.
Dr. Boger reviewed the rationale for the proposed merger and gave an update on
the recent discussions between Vertex and Aurora. Merrill Lynch reviewed with
the board of directors its financial analysis of the exchange ratio and
delivered to the board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in
writing, to the effect that, as of such date, the exchange ratio was fair, from
a financial point of view, to Vertex. Dr. Boger presented a summary of the
proposed employment arrangements for Dr. Collinson and other members of Aurora
senior management. Ms. Cecil reported on the completion of Vertex's due
diligence. Representatives of Mintz Levin summarized key provisions of the
merger agreement. Johanna Messina Power, Vertex's Controller, reported that
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Vertex's independent accountants, had advised
Vertex, based on facts and circumstances at this date, that they would expect to
render an opinion that the transaction would be eligible for pooling of
interests accounting. After further discussion, the board approved the proposed
merger.

    On April 29, 2001, Vertex and Aurora executed the merger agreement and
related agreements and Dr. Collinson, Mr. Stylli, Mr. Klopack, Dr. Negulescu,
Mr. Krueger, Mr. Pashkowsky, and Ms. Fritz executed employment agreements to
become effective upon the closing of the merger.

    On April 30, 2001, Vertex and Aurora issued a joint press release announcing
the execution of the merger agreement.

VERTEX'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

    The decision of Vertex's board of directors to approve the merger was based
on several potential benefits of the merger that it believes will contribute to
Vertex's success. Vertex believes that the merger with Aurora will enhance
Vertex's drug discovery capabilities, and expand Vertex's chemogenomics drug
discovery platform into additional multi-target gene families.

    The integration of Aurora's technology and expertise with Vertex's drug
discovery capabilities is expected to:

    - increase the flow of Vertex drug candidates into development,

    - accelerate the creation of a broad intellectual property estate, and

    - provide enhanced opportunities for major drug discovery, development and
      commercial alliances.

    Vertex has extensive efforts underway to discover and develop small molecule
inhibitors for specific targets in the kinase and caspase gene families. The
merger is expected to significantly enhance Vertex's drug discovery capabilities
in these and other major gene families and target classes. The merger enables
Vertex to integrate Aurora's capabilities in the development of cell-based
assays and screening instrumentation for use in drug discovery directed at ion
channels, g-protein coupled receptors, kinases, proteases and phosphatases, and
for use in target validation in a wide range of gene families. Together, Vertex
believes the companies will possess a comprehensive, scalable platform for
systematically accelerating drug candidate output in these target-rich gene
families.

    In addition to increasing Vertex's drug discovery capabilities directed at
gene families, Aurora's suite of technologies has the potential to accelerate
Vertex's target selection, lead generation and optimization, drug candidate
selection, and the establishment of clinical proof-of-concept for many of
Vertex's research and development programs. These technologies also include
predictive pharmacology and proteomics approaches, which enable high-throughput
assessments of toxicology and metabolic markers to establish therapeutic
proof-of-concept and safety of drug candidates in early clinical testing.
Aurora's recent acquisition of PanVera, a specialty supplier of high quality
recombinant proteins, provides a further, valuable asset in drug discovery.

    In connection with its approval of the merger and recommendation that
stockholders approve the issuance of the Vertex common stock in connection with
the merger, the board of directors of Vertex consulted with its legal advisors
regarding the duties of the members of the board, as well as with members of
management and Vertex's financial advisors. The board of directors of Vertex
also considered the following information and factors in reaching its decision
to approve the merger:

    - the benefits described above;

    - the exchange ratio in the merger and the resulting ownership interest of
      Vertex by former stockholders of Aurora;

    - presentations by senior members of Vertex's management regarding the
      strategic advantages of acquiring Aurora, operational aspects of the
      transaction and the results of management's operational and legal due
      diligence review;

    - historical information concerning Vertex's and Aurora's respective
      businesses, financial performance and condition, operations, technology,
      management, competitive position, and stock performance;

    - Vertex's management's view as to the financial condition, results of
      operations and businesses of Vertex and Aurora before and after giving
      effect to the merger based on management's due diligence, publicly
      available earnings estimates and other publicly available information;

    - the strategic fit of Vertex and Aurora, including the belief that the
      merger has the potential to enhance stockholder value;

    - the opportunities and alternatives available to Vertex if the merger were
      not to be completed;

    - the analysis and presentation of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
      Incorporated on the financial aspects of the merger, and its written
      opinion to the effect that, as of April 29, 2001, and based upon and
      subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in the opinion, the
      exchange ratio was fair from a financial point of view to Vertex;

    - the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the stockholder
      agreements, the affiliate agreements and the employment agreements;

    - the likelihood that the merger will be completed, including the likelihood
      that the merger will receive the necessary regulatory approvals;

    - the expected tax treatment of the merger as a tax-free reorganization for
      United States federal income tax purposes;

    - the expected accounting treatment of the merger as a pooling of interests
      transaction; and

    - the impact of the merger on Vertex's stockholders and employees.

    Vertex's board of directors also identified and considered the potential
adverse consequences of other factors on the proposed merger, including:

    - the risk that the potential benefits of the merger might not be realized;

    - the challenges and risks involved in combining the businesses of two large
      companies;

    - the risk of diverting management's focus and resources from other
      strategic opportunities and from operational matters while working to
      complete and implement the merger;

    - the risks associated with obtaining the consents required by the merger
      under Aurora's existing contracts and agreements;

    - the risk that Vertex would not be able to account for the merger as a
      pooling of interests;

    - the effect of the announcement of the merger on Vertex's business and
      Aurora's business; and

    - the risk that the merger would not be completed.

    This discussion of the information and factors considered by the Vertex
board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material
factors considered. The Vertex board of directors did not assign particular
weight or rank to the factors it considered in approving the merger. In
considering the factors described above, the individual members of the board of
directors may have given different weight to various factors. The Vertex board
of directors considered all of these factors as a whole, and overall considered
them to be favorable to and to support its determination to approve the merger.

AURORA'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

    In the course of reaching its decision to approve the merger and
recommendation that the stockholders approve and adopt the merger agreement, the
Aurora board of directors consulted with Aurora's legal, auditing and financial
advisors, as well as with Aurora's senior management. The board of directors
considered, among other things, the following information and strategic factors
associated with Vertex's business and the opportunities presented by a merger of
Aurora with Vertex:

    - the opportunity to accelerate the drug discovery and development efforts
      of Aurora;

    - the potential to create new and enhanced partnership opportunities;

    - Vertex's sizable and world-class chemistry group and people-strong
      organization with an established reputation in the market community;

    - the belief that Vertex's resources would be leveraged with Aurora's
      resources to create enhanced commercial opportunities in gene family drug
      discovery and development;

    - the belief that Vertex's resources would be available to facilitate the
      development of Aurora's pre-clinical pipeline;

    - the possibility of accelerating Aurora's collective research output in
      multiple gene families;

    - the acceleration of the creation of a broad intellectual property estate;

    - the benefits of maintaining facilities located in Boston, San Diego and
      the United Kingdom;

    - the likely realization of operational efficiencies as a result of the
      merger, including in the areas of research and development, sales and
      marketing, and finance and administration; and

    - information concerning the business, financial condition, operations,
      competitive position and prospects of Aurora individually and on a
      combined basis with Vertex.

    In addition, Aurora's board of directors considered, after consultation with
it's legal, auditing and financial advisors, as well as with Aurora's senior
management, the following information and factors in reaching its decision to
approve the merger:

    - the benefits described above;

    - the exchange ratio in the merger and the resulting ownership interest of
      Vertex by former stockholders of Aurora;

    - presentations by senior members of Aurora's management regarding the
      strategic advantages of the potential merger with Vertex, operational
      aspects of the transaction and the results of management's operational and
      legal due diligence review;

    - Aurora's management's view as to the financial condition, results of
      operations and businesses of Vertex and Aurora before and after giving
      effect to the merger based on management's due diligence, internal
      projections, publicly available earnings estimates and other publicly
      available information;

    - the strategic fit of Vertex and Aurora, including the belief that the
      merger has the potential to enhance stockholder value;

    - the opportunities and alternatives available to Aurora if the merger were
      not to be completed, including pursuing an acquisition transaction or
      business combination, joint venture or collaboration with entities other
      than Vertex and the conclusion that the merger is expected to yield
      greater benefits and is more feasible than the alternatives;

    - the opinion of Goldman Sachs to the effect that, as of April 28, 2001, and
      based upon and subject to the considerations described in its opinion, the
      exchange ratio provided in the merger agreement was fair from a financial
      point of view to the holders of Aurora common stock;

    - the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the stockholder
      agreements, the affiliate agreements and the employment agreements;

    - the likelihood that the merger will be completed, including the likelihood
      that the merger will receive the necessary regulatory approvals;

    - the expected tax treatment of the merger as a tax-free reorganization for
      United States federal income tax purposes;

    - the expected accounting treatment of the merger as a pooling of interests
      transaction; and

    - the impact of the merger on Aurora's stockholders and employees.

    The Aurora board of directors also considered a number of risks and
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger,
including the risk factors described elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement--prospectus, and in particular:

    - the risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized,
      including that the expected operating synergies might not be achieved;

    - the challenges of integrating the businesses and operations of the two
      companies and the management effort and costs required to complete the
      integration following the merger;

    - the risk of management and employee disruption associated with the merger,
      including the risk that key personnel may decide not to continue
      employment with Aurora after the merger;

    - the risk that sales of substantial amounts of Vertex common stock in the
      public market after the proposed merger could materially adversely affect
      the market price of Vertex common stock;

    - the potential adverse effects on Vertex's earnings if the merger fails to
      qualify for pooling of interests accounting treatment; and

    - the risk that suppliers, customers, licensors, collaborators, licensees
      and other business partners of Aurora may terminate their relationships as
      a result of the merger.

    In analyzing the proposed merger, Aurora's board of directors did not view
any of the factors listed above as determinative or find it practical or
feasible to quantify or otherwise attempt to assign any relative or specific
values to any of the foregoing factors. Rather, the Aurora board of directors
made its determination based upon the total mix of information available to it.
Moreover, the individual members of the board may have accorded different values
to different factors.

STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER AND CONVERSION OF AURORA STOCK

    In accordance with the merger agreement and Delaware law, a newly-formed and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Vertex will merge with and into Aurora. As a result
of this merger, the separate corporate existence of the Vertex subsidiary will
cease and Aurora will survive the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vertex.
Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding share of Aurora common stock
will be automatically converted into 0.62 of a share of Vertex common stock and
the stockholders of Aurora will become stockholders of Vertex. No fractional
shares of Vertex common stock will be issued in connection with the merger.
Instead, Aurora stockholders will receive cash, without interest, in lieu of a
fraction of a share of Vertex common stock, based on the closing price of Vertex
common stock on The Nasdaq National Market on the date that the merger is
completed.

    The number of shares of Vertex common stock issuable to Aurora stockholders
in the merger will be proportionately adjusted for any stock split, stock
dividend or similar event with respect to the Vertex common stock or Aurora
common stock effected between the date of the merger agreement and the date of
completion of the merger.

RECOMMENDATION OF VERTEX'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    The Vertex board of directors believes that the merger is fair to Vertex's
stockholders and in their best interests, and recommends the approval of the
issuance of Vertex common stock in connection with the merger.

OPINION OF VERTEX'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

    Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated has acted as financial
advisor to Vertex in connection with the merger. On April 29, 2001, Merrill
Lynch delivered to Vertex's board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently
confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of such date, and based upon

and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in the opinion, the
exchange ratio was fair from a financial point of view to Vertex.

    THE FULL TEXT OF MERRILL LYNCH'S FAIRNESS OPINION, WHICH SETS FORTH THE
ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND QUALIFICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE
REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY MERRILL LYNCH, IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX B AND IS INCORPORATED
BY REFERENCE IN THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT-PROSPECTUS. THE SUMMARY OF MERRILL
LYNCH'S FAIRNESS OPINION BELOW SETS FORTH THE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE FAIRNESS
OPINION AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF
MERRILL LYNCH'S FAIRNESS OPINION. VERTEX STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE
OPINION CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY.

    Merrill Lynch's fairness opinion was provided to Vertex's board of directors
for its information and is directed only to the fairness from a financial point
of view of the exchange ratio. Merrill Lynch's fairness opinion does not address
any other aspect of the merger, including the merits of the underlying decision
by Vertex to engage in the merger, and does not constitute a recommendation to
any Vertex stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote on the merger or
any related matter. The exchange ratio was determined through negotiations
between Vertex and Aurora and was approved by Vertex's board of directors.

    In arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch, among other things:

    - reviewed publicly available business and financial information relating to
      Aurora and Vertex that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant;

    - reviewed information, including financial forecasts, relating to the
      business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of Aurora
      and Vertex, furnished to Merrill Lynch by Aurora and Vertex, respectively;

    - conducted discussions with members of senior management of Aurora and
      Vertex concerning the matters described above, as well as the business and
      prospects of Aurora and Vertex before giving effect to the merger;

    - reviewed the market prices and valuation multiples for Aurora common stock
      and Vertex common stock and compared them with those of publicly traded
      companies that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant;

    - reviewed the results of operations of Aurora and Vertex and compared them
      with those of certain publicly traded companies that Merrill Lynch deemed
      to be relevant;

    - compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the financial
      terms of other transactions that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant;

    - participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of
      Aurora and Vertex and their financial and legal advisors;

    - reviewed the potential pro forma impact of the merger;

    - reviewed the merger agreement, dated April 29, 2001, and related
      documents; and

    - reviewed such other financial studies and analyses and took into account
      such other matters as Merrill Lynch deemed necessary, including Merrill
      Lynch's assessment of general economic, market and monetary conditions.

    In preparing its opinion, Merrill Lynch assumed and relied on the accuracy
and completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made available to
Merrill Lynch, discussed with or reviewed by or for Merrill Lynch, or publicly
available, and Merrill Lynch did not assume any responsibility for independently
verifying such information. Merrill Lynch has not undertaken an independent
evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities of Vertex or Aurora
or been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Merrill
Lynch did not assume any obligation to conduct any

physical inspection of the properties or facilities of Vertex or Aurora. With
respect to the financial forecast information furnished to or discussed with
Merrill Lynch by Vertex and Aurora, Merrill Lynch assumed that they had been
reasonably prepared and reflected the best available estimates and judgment of
Vertex's or Aurora's management as to the expected future financial performance
of Vertex or Aurora, as the case may be. Merrill Lynch further assumed that the
merger will be accounted for as a pooling of interests under generally accepted
accounting principles and that it will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for
United States federal income tax purposes. Merrill Lynch also assumed that the
representations and warranties of Vertex, its wholly-owned subsidiary and Aurora
contained in the merger agreement are true and correct, that Vertex, its
wholly-owned subsidiary and Aurora will each perform all of the covenants and
agreements to be performed by it under the merger agreement, and that all
conditions to the obligations of Vertex, its wholly-owned subsidiary and Aurora
to consummate the merger will be satisfied without any waiver of such
conditions.

    Merrill Lynch's fairness opinion is necessarily based on market, economic
and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on, and on the
information made available to Merrill Lynch as of, the date of the opinion.
Merrill Lynch assumed that in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory
or other consents or approvals (contractual or otherwise) for the merger, no
restrictions, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or
modifications, will be imposed that will have a material adverse effect on
Vertex or Aurora or materially reduce the contemplated benefits of the merger.
Merrill Lynch did not express any opinion as to the prices at which Vertex
common stock will trade following the announcement or consummation of the
merger. Although Merrill Lynch evaluated the exchange ratio from a financial
point of view, Merrill Lynch was not requested to, and did not, address the
merits of the underlying decision of Vertex to engage in the merger and did not
recommend to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote on the
proposed merger or any related matter.

    In preparing its opinion to Vertex's board of directors, Merrill Lynch
performed financial and comparative analyses, including those described below.
The summary of analyses set forth in this joint proxy statement-prospectus does
not purport to be a complete description of the analyses underlying Merrill
Lynch's fairness opinion or the presentation made by Merrill Lynch to Vertex's
board of directors. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytic
process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the
particular circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is not readily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. No company, business or
transaction used in such analyses as a comparison is identical to Vertex, Aurora
or the merger, nor is an evaluation of the results of such analyses entirely
mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could
affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies,
business segments or transactions being analyzed.

    In arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch did not attribute any particular
weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made qualitative
judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor.
Accordingly, Merrill Lynch believes that its analyses must be considered as a
whole and that selecting portions of its analyses, without considering all
analyses, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion.

    In performing its analyses, numerous assumptions were made with respect to
industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Merrill
Lynch, Vertex or Aurora. The estimates contained in the analyses performed by
Merrill Lynch and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular
analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future
results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those
suggested by such analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses
or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which
such businesses or securities might actually be sold. Accordingly, such analyses
and estimates are inherently

subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, as described above, Merrill
Lynch's fairness opinion was among several factors taken into consideration by
Vertex's board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger
agreement and the merger. Consequently, the Merrill Lynch analyses described
below should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of Vertex's board of
directors or Vertex's management with respect to the fairness of the exchange
ratio.

    The following is a summary of the material financial and comparative
analyses performed by Merrill Lynch in arriving at its April 29, 2001 opinion
and presented to Vertex's board of directors. The Merrill Lynch opinion is based
upon Merrill Lynch's consideration of the collective results of all such
analyses, together with the other factors referred to in its opinion letter.

ANALYSIS OF TRADING PERFORMANCE

    Using publicly available information, Merrill Lynch reviewed the per share
daily closing market prices of the common stock of both Aurora and Vertex over
the three-month and one-month trading periods ending April 27, 2001. This
analysis indicated a range of closing prices per share of Aurora common stock to
be $12.69 to $31.63 for the three-month period and $14.99 to $18.76 for the one-
month period. The range of closing prices per share of Vertex common stock for
the corresponding periods was $29.19 to $74.19 and $29.19 to $44.99,
respectively.

    Merrill Lynch observed that the implied offer price for Aurora was within
the three-month trading range and above the one-month trading range.

    Merrill Lynch then analyzed the ratio of the range of closing share prices
of Aurora common stock to corresponding prices of Vertex common stock for the
three-month and one-month periods ending April 27, 2001. This analysis yielded a
range of implied exchange ratios of 0.171 to 1.084 for the three-month period
ending April 27, 2001 and 0.333 to 0.643 for the one-month period ending
April 27, 2001. Merrill Lynch observed that the exchange ratio was within the
ranges implied by the analyses of both the three-month period and the one-month
period.

ANALYSIS OF SELECTED COMPARABLE PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES

    Using publicly available information, Merrill Lynch compared the valuation
multiples of selected publicly traded companies in the genomics and platform
technology segments of the biotechnology industry considered by Merrill Lynch to
be reasonably comparable to Aurora for the purposes of this analysis. The
companies comparable to Aurora included:

    - Affymetrix, Inc.

    - Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

    - CuraGen Corporation

    - Evotec BioSystems AG

    - Exelixis, Inc.

    - Genencor International, Inc.

    - Myriad Genetics, Inc.

    - Oxford GlycoSciences Plc

    Using publicly available information, Merrill Lynch also compared the
valuation multiples of selected publicly traded companies in the drug discovery
and development sectors of biotechnology

industry considered by Merrill Lynch to be reasonably comparable to Vertex for
the purposes of this analysis. The companies comparable to Vertex included:

    - Chiron Corporation

    - CuraGen Corporation

    - Gilead Sciences, Inc.

    - Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

    Merrill Lynch then calculated the comparable companies' market
capitalization, calculated as fully diluted equity market value, plus total
debt, preferred stock and minority interests, less cash and cash equivalents, as
a multiple of estimated 2001 revenues and as a multiple of 2001 estimated
revenues divided by the estimated 2001-2005 compounded annual growth rate of
revenues. All multiples were based on closing stock prices on April 27, 2001.
Merrill Lynch then applied a range of these multiples to the corresponding
financial data for Aurora and Vertex, respectively. This analysis indicated an
implied value range to be $30.50 to $35.77 per share of Aurora common stock and
$37.51 to $48.31 per share of Vertex common stock.

    Merrill Lynch then compared the implied per share equity reference ranges
for Aurora and Vertex described above and derived an implied exchange ratio
reference range of 0.631x to 1.194x. Merrill Lynch observed that the exchange
ratio was slightly below the range implied by this analysis.

    Because of the inherent differences among the operations of Vertex and
Aurora and the selected comparable companies, Merrill Lynch believes that a
purely quantitative comparable company analysis would not be dispositive in the
context of the merger. Merrill Lynch further believes that an appropriate use of
a comparable company analysis in this instance involves qualitative judgments
concerning differences among the financial and operating characteristics of
Vertex and Aurora and the selected comparable companies, which judgments are
reflected in the Merrill Lynch opinion.

RESEARCH ANALYSTS' ESTIMATES

    Merrill Lynch reviewed the price targets of selected equity research
analysts for Aurora common stock and Vertex common stock. The range of analysts'
price targets for Aurora was $30.00 to $80.00 per share and for Vertex $57.00 to
$100.00 per share. These ranges implied exchange ratios ranging from a low of
0.300x to a high of 1.404x. Merrill Lynch observed that the exchange ratio was
within the ranges implied by this analysis.

ANALYSIS OF SELECTED COMPARABLE ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS

    Merrill Lynch also reviewed publicly available information relating to
eighteen comparable acquisition transactions involving biotechnology companies
announced since December 1997 and examined:

    - premiums paid for the targets' equity over pre-announcement stock prices
      one day prior to announcement and one month prior to announcement; and

    - transaction values for the target companies as a multiple of projected
      revenues for the twelve months following the announcement of each of the
      respective transactions (transaction value being defined as the sum of the
      per share offer price for the target company multiplied by the number of
      company shares outstanding and the number of target company options
      outstanding, net of option proceeds, plus the preferred equity at
      liquidation, if any, the short-term debt, the long-term debt and any
      minority interests, less cash and marketable securities).

    Merrill Lynch then applied a range of selected premiums and multiples
derived from the selected transactions to the corresponding financial data for
Aurora. This analysis indicated an implied value range to be $20.22 to $34.26
per share of Aurora common stock.

    Because the reasons for, and circumstances surrounding, each of the
comparable transactions analyzed were so diverse and due to the inherent
differences between the operations and financial conditions of Aurora and the
selected companies, Merrill Lynch believes that a purely quantitative comparable
transaction analysis would not be dispositive in the context of the merger.
Merrill Lynch further believes that an appropriate use of a comparable
transaction analysis in this instance involves qualitative judgments concerning
the differences between the characteristics of these transactions and the merger
that would affect the value of the acquired companies and businesses and Aurora,
those judgments being reflected in the Merrill Lynch opinion.

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS

    Merrill Lynch utilized the standalone discounted cash flow analysis of
Aurora and the standalone discounted cash flow analysis of Vertex to calculate a
range of implied exchange ratios by dividing the discounted cash flow equity
value per share of Aurora by the discounted cash flow equity value per share of
Vertex.

    Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Aurora based upon
the sum of the discounted net present value of Aurora's five-year stream of
projected unlevered free cash flows for the years 2001 through 2005 plus the
discounted net present value of Aurora's terminal value based on a range of
multiples of its projected 2006 revenues of 6.0x to 8.0x. Using forecasted
income statements based on equity research reports and management projections of
Aurora and applying discount rates ranging from 20% to 30%, Merrill Lynch
calculated that the implied equity value per share of Aurora common stock ranged
from $24.04 to $43.51.

    Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Vertex based upon
the sum of the discounted net present value of Vertex's five-year stream of
projected unlevered free cash flows for the years 2001 through 2005 plus the
discounted net present value of Vertex's terminal value based on a range of
multiples of its projected 2006 revenues of 12.0x to 18.0x. Using forecasted
income statements based on equity research reports and management projections of
Vertex and applying discount rates ranging from 20% to 30%, Merrill Lynch
calculated that the implied equity value per share of Vertex common stock ranged
from $28.47 to $59.48.

    Merrill Lynch, utilizing the standalone cash flow analyses described above,
calculated the implied exchange ratio by dividing the discounted cash flow
equity value per share of Aurora by the discounted cash flow equity value per
share of Vertex. Based upon this analysis, Merrill Lynch calculated a range of
implied exchange ratios from 0.404x to 1.528x. Merrill Lynch observed that the
exchange ratio was within the range implied by this analysis.

PRO FORMA MERGER ANALYSIS

    Merrill Lynch analyzed selected pro forma effects which could result from
the merger for each year through 2005 based on information in selected equity
research reports on Vertex and Aurora. Vertex's management advised Merrill Lynch
that the merger will be accounted for as a pooling of interests under U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Merrill Lynch assumed an exchange
ratio of 0.620x and did not include in the analysis any synergies. This pro
forma analysis indicated that the merger would be accretive to the Vertex's
forecasted earnings per share by $0.20 in 2001, $0.27 in 2002, $0.61 in 2003,
$0.85 in 2004 and $0.84 in 2005.

MISCELLANEOUS

    The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of
the analyses conducted by Merrill Lynch. The preparation of a fairness opinion
is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. Merrill Lynch believes that selecting any portion of its
analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as
a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying Merrill
Lynch's opinion. In arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch considered the
results of all its analyses. The analyses performed by Merrill Lynch are not
necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by Merrill Lynch's
analyses. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices
at which Vertex common stock may trade at any time in the future. Analyses based
upon forecasts or future results are not necessarily indicative of actual values
or future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by Merrill Lynch's analyses. Because the analyses are inherently
subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors and events, including,
without limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive
conditions beyond the control of Merrill Lynch or the parties to the merger,
Merrill Lynch does not assume any responsibility if future results or actual
values are materially different from those forecast.

    Pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement between Merrill Lynch and Vertex
dated March 9, 2001, referred to as the Merrill Lynch letter agreement, Vertex
agreed to pay Merrill Lynch $1,000,000 upon execution of the merger agreement
and $3,500,000 upon completion of the merger for Merrill Lynch's financial
advisory services in connection with the merger. Vertex has also agreed to pay
Merrill Lynch the lesser of the aggregate fees described above and, if the
merger agreement is terminated, 15% of any fee or payment paid to Vertex in
connection with the termination of the merger during the period Merrill Lynch is
retained by Vertex or one year thereafter. Vertex also has agreed to reimburse
Merrill Lynch for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Merrill
Lynch in performing its services, including the fees and expenses of Merrill
Lynch's legal counsel, provided that Merrill Lynch is not entitled to
reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses in excess of $50,000 without the prior
consent of Vertex, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Vertex has
also agreed to indemnify Merrill Lynch and related persons and entities against
liabilities under federal or state law arising out of a business combination
contemplated by the Merrill Lynch letter agreement or the engagement of Merrill
Lynch pursuant to such agreement.

    Vertex retained Merrill Lynch based upon Merrill Lynch's experience and
expertise. Merrill Lynch is an internationally recognized investment banking
firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated
underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other
purposes.

    Merrill Lynch has, in the past, provided financial advisory services to
Vertex. During the past two years Merrill Lynch has acted as the lead manager of
two offerings of convertible notes for which it received customary compensation.
In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Merrill Lynch and its
affiliates may actively trade in securities of Vertex and Aurora for Merrill
Lynch's own accounts and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may
at any time hold a long or short position in securities of Vertex and Aurora.

RECOMMENDATION OF AURORA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    The Aurora board of directors believes that the merger is fair to Aurora's
stockholders and in their best interests, and recommends the approval and
adoption of the merger agreement.

    In considering the recommendation of the Aurora board of directors with
respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that the directors and
executive officers of Aurora have interests in

the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of
Aurora stockholders. Please see the section entitled "Interests of Aurora
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" that begins on page 52 of this
joint proxy statement-prospectus.

OPINION OF AURORA'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

    Goldman, Sachs & Co. delivered its opinion to the board of directors of
Aurora, which was subsequently confirmed in writing on April 29, 2001, that, as
of April 28, 2001, and based upon and subject to the considerations described in
its opinion, the exchange ratio provided in the merger agreement was fair from a
financial point of view to the holders of Aurora common stock.

    THE FULL TEXT OF THE WRITTEN OPINION OF GOLDMAN SACHS, WHICH SETS FORTH THE
ASSUMPTIONS MADE, PROCEDURES FOLLOWED, MATTERS CONSIDERED, AND LIMITATIONS ON
THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE OPINION, IS ATTACHED TO THIS JOINT
PROXY STATEMENT-PROSPECTUS AS ANNEX C AND IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS
JOINT PROXY STATEMENT-PROSPECTUS. GOLDMAN SACHS' OPINION WAS PROVIDED FOR THE
INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF AURORA IN CONNECTION
WITH ITS CONSIDERATION OF THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT.
GOLDMAN SACHS' OPINION IS DIRECTED ONLY TO THE FAIRNESS OF THE EXCHANGE RATIO
AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION AS TO HOW ANY HOLDER OF AURORA COMMON
STOCK SHOULD VOTE WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSACTION. AURORA STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD
READ THE OPINION IN ITS ENTIRETY.

    In connection with its opinion, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:

    - the merger agreement;

    - annual reports to stockholders and annual reports on Form 10-K and Form
      10-K/A of Aurora for the four years ended December 31, 2000;

    - annual reports to stockholders and annual reports on Form 10-K of Vertex
      for the five years ended December 31, 2000;

    - selected interim reports to stockholders and quarterly reports on Form
      10-Q of Aurora and Vertex;

    - other communications from Aurora and Vertex to each of their respective
      stockholders;

    - internal financial analyses and forecasts for Vertex prepared by the
      management of Vertex, which the management of Aurora instructed Goldman
      Sachs to use for the purposes of its opinion; and

    - internal financial analyses and forecasts for Aurora prepared by the
      management of Aurora.

    Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of
Aurora and Vertex regarding their assessment of the strategic rationale for, and
the potential benefits of, the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement
and the past and current business operations, financial condition and future
prospects of their respective companies.

    In addition, Goldman Sachs:

    - reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Aurora common
      stock and Vertex common stock;

    - compared financial and stock market information for Aurora and Vertex with
      similar information for other companies the securities of which are
      publicly traded;

    - reviewed the financial terms of selected recent business combinations in
      the biotechnology industry specifically and in other industries generally;
      and

    - performed such other studies and analyses as Goldman Sachs considered
      appropriate.

    Goldman Sachs relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial, accounting and other information discussed with or reviewed by it and
assumed the accuracy and completeness of this information for purposes of
rendering its opinion. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed, with the consent
of Aurora's board of directors, that the internal financial forecasts prepared
by the managements of Aurora and Vertex were reasonably prepared reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments of Aurora and Vertex. In
addition, Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of
the assets and liabilities of Aurora or Vertex or any of their respective
subsidiaries, and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or
appraisal. Goldman Sachs was not requested to solicit, and did not solicit,
interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business
combination involving, Aurora. Goldman Sachs assumed, with the consent of
Aurora's board of directors, that the transaction contemplated by the merger
agreement will be accounted for as a pooling of interests under generally
accepted accounting principles.

    The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by
Goldman Sachs to the Aurora board of directors on April 28, 2001 in connection

ANALYSIS OF TRANSACTION PREMIUMS AND MULTIPLES

    Goldman Sachs reviewed the premiums, multiples and other information derived
from the exchange ratio provided in the merger agreement. Based on the closing
price of Vertex common stock of $39.25 and the closing price of Aurora common
stock of $16.85 on April 27, 2001, Goldman Sachs calculated an implied price per
share of Aurora common stock of $24.34, representing an implied premium of 44.4%
over the closing price of Aurora common stock on April 27, 2001. Goldman Sachs
then calculated the implied premium using the closing prices of Aurora's common
stock on selected dates and over selected periods. The results of these
calculations are as follows:

                                                                                    IMPLIED % PREMIUM

    Goldman Sachs also reviewed the historical trading prices of Vertex common
stock and Aurora common stock in order to compare exchange ratios implied by
those historical trading prices to the exchange ratio provided in the merger
agreement. Specifically, Goldman Sachs compared the exchange ratio provided in
the merger agreement to the ratio of the daily closing share prices of Vertex
common stock to corresponding prices for Aurora common stock on April 27, 2001,
which was the last trading

day prior to the announcement of the execution of the merger agreement, and the
one week, one month, two month, six month and one year periods ended April 27,
2001. These analyses indicated the following implied exchange ratios and implied
premiums for these dates or periods, as compared with the exchange ratio of 0.62
provided in the merger agreement:

    Based on a Vertex closing price of $39.25 on April 27, 2001 and using the
implied Aurora price per share of $24.34, Goldman Sachs calculated that the
equity consideration in the transaction would be $592 million assuming exercises
of outstanding options based on the transaction price and an enterprise value of
$492.4 million, based on $99.4 million of net debt as of December 31, 2000.
Using Aurora management estimates for fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2006, Goldman
Sachs derived the following transaction multiples:

    - enterprise value as a multiple of actual 2000 and estimated 2001, 2002 and
      2006 sales;

    - enterprise value as a multiple of actual 2000 and estimated 2001, 2002 and
      2006 earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT; and

    - equity consideration on a fully-diluted basis as a multiple of actual 2000
      and estimated 2001, 2002, and 2006 net income.

    The results of these analyses are as follows:

HISTORICAL STOCK TRADING ANALYSIS

    Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared the historical daily trading prices of
Aurora common stock, during the period from April 27, 2000 to April 27, 2001,
with the following: (1) a chemistry, instrument and molecular biology reagent
company composite index comprised of the common stock of Aclara Biosciences,
Inc., Albany Molecular Research, Arqule, Inc., Becton, Dickinson and Co.,
Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Caliper Technologies Corp., Evotec Biosystems AG,
Invitrogen Corporation, Molecular Devices Corp., Pharmacopeia, Inc., Qiagen NV,
Sepracor Inc., Tecan AG, Techne AG and Tularik Inc.; (2) the Goldman Sachs
Biotechnology Index; and (3) the NASDAQ Composite Index. The chemistry,
instrument and molecular biology reagent company composite companies were chosen
because they are companies with operations that for purposes of analysis may be
considered similar to Aurora.

    The analysis indicated that for the period from April 27, 2000 to April 27,
2001, the Aurora common stock initially outperformed all the above indices; but,
since November 2000, Aurora common stock has been underperforming both the
chemistry, instrument and molecular biology reagent composite and the GS Biotech
Index.

    Goldman Sachs also reviewed and compared the historical daily trading prices
of Vertex common stock, during the period April 27, 2000 to April 27, 2001, with
the following: (1) a near-profitable biotechnology composite index comprised of
the common stock of Cell Therapeutics, Inc., Cephalon, Inc., COR
Therapeutics, Inc., Corixa Corporation, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Imclone Systems
Incorporated and QLT, Inc.; (2) a profitable biotechnology composite index
comprised of the common stock of Amgen, Inc., BioChem Pharma, Inc., Biogen,
Inc., Bio-Technology General Corp., Chiron Corporation, Genentech, Inc., Genzyme
Corporation, IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corp., Immunex Corporation and MedImmune,
Inc.; (3) the GS Biotechnology Index; and (4) the NASDAQ Composite Index. The
near-profitable and profitable companies were chosen because they are
biotechnology companies with operations that for purposes of analysis may be
considered similar to Vertex. The analysis indicated that, for the period from
April 27, 2000 to April 27, 2001, the Vertex common stock outperformed all the
above indices.

SELECTED PUBLIC MARKET COMPANIES ANALYSIS

    Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared selected financial information relating
to Aurora and Vertex to corresponding financial information, ratios and public
market multiples for comparable companies whose securities are publicly traded.
Goldman Sachs calculated various financial multiples and ratios for Aurora based
on (1) the closing price of Aurora common stock on April 27, 2001 and (2) the
implied price per share of Aurora common stock derived from the exchange ratio
provided in the merger agreement. These financial multiples and ratios were
compared with those of the companies in the chemistry, instrument and molecular
biology reagent company composite index used in the historical stock trading
analysis. Goldman Sachs also conducted a similar analysis for Vertex based on
the closing price of the Vertex common stock on April 27, 2001. Financial
multiples and ratios for Vertex were compared with those of the near-profitable
and profitable biotechnology companies selected for the historical stock trading
analysis. Where applicable, the financial multiples and ratios for Aurora,
Vertex and the selected companies were calculated using (1) the closing prices
of their common stock on April 27, 2001 and (2) their respective equity market
capitalization. Revenues for Aurora, Vertex and the selected companies were
obtained from the annual reports on Form 10-K of each of the companies.

    Goldman Sachs' analyses of the selected companies compared, among other
things, the following to the results for Vertex and Aurora:

    - stock price as a percentage of the 52-week high; and

    - levered market capitalization as a multiple of the last twelve months'
      revenues.

    The results of these analyses are summarized as follows:

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS

    Goldman Sachs performed an analysis to compare the present value per share
of Aurora common stock, using discounted cash flow methodologies, to the value
per share implied by the exchange ratio provided in the merger agreement. Using
Aurora's management projections, Goldman Sachs performed this analysis by
determining ranges of equity values per share for Aurora on a stand-alone basis.
Specifically, Goldman Sachs considered the range of values for Aurora on a
stand-alone basis based on financial models prepared by Aurora's management.
Goldman Sachs analyzed three elements of the business based on these models: the
"base business," which involves estimates of future revenue growth and earnings,
and no contribution from the Aurora's drug discovery initiatives known as "big
biology"; the big biology business, which reflects only the Company's drug
discovery initiatives and no contribution from the Aurora's base business; and
the "base plus big biology" business, which involves estimates of future revenue
growth and earnings of both the base business and big biology business.

    In its analysis of the base business, Goldman Sachs applied discount rates
ranging from 25.0% to 35.0% and terminal value multiples of estimated 2010 price
to earnings ranging from 10.0x to 12.5x. In its analysis of the big biology
business, Goldman Sachs applied discount rates ranging from 50.0% to 60.0% and
terminal value multiples of estimated 2010 price to earnings ranging from 30.0x
to 35.0x. Finally, in its analysis of the base plus big biology business,
Goldman Sachs applied discount rates ranging from 40.0% to 50.0% and terminal
value multiples of estimated 2010 price to earnings ranging from 25.0x to 30.0x.
The various ranges for discount rates and terminal value multiples were chosen
by Goldman Sachs based upon its prior experience in analyzing cost of capital
ranges that could be applicable. Based on these discount rates and terminal
value multiples, Goldman Sachs derived theoretical equity values per share
ranging from $10.10 to $20.30 for the base business, $3.93 to $8.83 for the big
biology business and $14.50 to $28.66 for the base plus big biology business.

    Goldman Sachs noted that the implied value of $24.34 per share derived from
the exchange ratio provided in the merger agreement was within the range of
share valuations for Aurora stockholders on a stand-alone basis implied by the
range of values derived in the base business plus big biology business
discounted cash flow analysis.

    Goldman Sachs also performed an analysis of the present value per share of
Vertex common stock using discounted cash flow methodologies. Using Vertex
management projections as provided by Vertex management for the fiscal years
2001 through 2006, Goldman Sachs performed this analysis by determining ranges
of equity values per share for Vertex on a stand-alone basis. In its analysis,
Goldman Sachs applied discount rates ranging from 30% to 40% and terminal value
multiples of estimated 2006 price to earnings ranging from 25.0x to 30.0x. The
various ranges for discount rates and terminal value multiples were chosen by
Goldman Sachs based upon its prior experience in analyzing cost of capital
ranges that could be applicable. Based on these discount rates and terminal
value multiples, Goldman Sachs derived theoretical equity values per share
ranging from $26.11 to $47.05 as compared to Vertex's closing stock price per
share on April 27, 2001 of $39.25.

PRO FORMA MERGER ANALYSIS

    Goldman Sachs prepared pro forma analyses of the financial impact of the
merger on Vertex and Aurora on a stand-alone basis for the fiscal years ending
December 31, 2001 and March 31, 2002 using projected 2001 and 2002 earnings per
share obtained from Vertex's and Aurora's management. For the years 2001 and
2002, Goldman Sachs compared, among other financial items, estimated net income
and diluted earnings per share for Vertex, Aurora and the combined company on a
pro forma basis. Goldman Sachs' analysis indicated that the proposed merger
would be accretive to Vertex's diluted earnings per share in estimated year 2001
and estimated year 2002.

CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS

    Goldman Sachs reviewed the historical and estimated future operating and
financial information, including, among other things, revenues and net income,
for Aurora, Vertex and the pro forma combined entity resulting from the merger
based on Aurora's and Vertex's management projections. A contribution analysis
demonstrates the parties' respective historical and projected contributions, on
a percentage basis, to certain income statement items of the combined company
and compares those contributions to the parties' stockholders' relative equity
interests in the combined company following the merger. Goldman Sachs analyzed
the relative income statement contribution of Vertex and Aurora to the combined
company on a pro forma basis based on financial data and on the assumptions
provided to Goldman Sachs by Aurora's and Vertex's managements for estimated
years 2001, 2002 and 2006. Goldman Sachs calculated the relative contributions
of Aurora and Vertex to the combined company in terms of (1) revenues, (2) net
income, (3) equity market capitalization, (4) enterprise value and (5) pro forma
ownership. The results of these analyses are as follows:

                                                                % CONTRIBUTION

SELECTED TRANSACTIONS ANALYSIS

    Using the implied value of $24.34 per share for Aurora common stock derived
from the exchange ratio provided in the merger agreement, Goldman Sachs
calculated (1) the premium represented by the implied value in relation to the
Aurora's closing price on April 27, 2001, one day prior to the announcement of
the execution of the merger agreement, and (2) the corresponding latest twelve
months, or LTM, revenue multiple. Goldman Sachs then compared those results with
publicly available

information for 44 pending and completed merger and acquisition transactions
during 1994 -- 2001 in the biotechnology industry. The results of the analysis
are as follows:

    The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering
the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination,
Goldman Sachs considered the results of all the analyses and did not attribute
any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it; rather,
Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its
experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all the
analyses. No company used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly
comparable to Aurora or Vertex, and no transaction used is directly comparable
to the proposed merger.

    Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses solely for purposes of providing an
opinion to the Aurora board as to the fairness of the exchange ratio to the
holders of shares of Aurora common stock from a financial point of view. The
analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect the prices at
which the business or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon
forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by
these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty and
are based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or
their respective advisors, none of Aurora, Vertex or Goldman Sachs assumes
responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasted.
As described above, the opinion of Goldman Sachs to the Aurora board was one of
many factors taken into consideration by the Aurora board in making its
determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not
purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs.

    Goldman Sachs, as part of its investment banking business, is continually
engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements
and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. Goldman Sachs is
familiar with Aurora, having provided certain investment banking services to
Aurora from time to time, including having acted as its financial advisor in
connection with, and having participated in certain of the negotiations leading
to, the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs also has provided certain investment
banking services to Vertex from time to time.

    Aurora selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an
internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial
experience in transactions similar to the merger. In addition, Goldman Sachs
provides a full range of financial, advisory and securities services and in the
course of its normal trading activities it may from time to time effect
transactions and hold securities, including derivative securities, of Aurora and
Vertex for its own account and for the accounts of customers. In addition,
Goldman Sachs may provide investment banking services to Vertex and its
subsidiaries in the future.

    Pursuant to a letter agreement, dated March 8, 2001, Aurora engaged Goldman
Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with a potential transaction
involving Vertex. Pursuant to this letter agreement, Aurora agreed to pay
Goldman Sachs an initial fee of $100,000, payable in cash two months following
the execution of the letter, which will be applied against any transaction fee
which may

become payable pursuant to the letter. In addition, assuming an aggregate
purchase price of $591.8 million based on Vertex's closing stock price on
April 27, 2001, Aurora has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee of
approximately $8 million upon consummation of the merger. Aurora has agreed to
reimburse Goldman Sachs for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, not to exceed
$150,000 without the prior consent of Aurora, including attorneys' fees and
disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs against certain liabilities,
including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

INTERESTS OF AURORA DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

    In considering the recommendation of the board of directors of Aurora to
vote for the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, stockholders of
Aurora should be aware that members of the Aurora board of directors and members
of Aurora's management team have agreements or arrangements that provide them
with interests in the merger that differ from those of Aurora's stockholders.
The board of directors of Aurora was aware of these agreements and arrangements
during its deliberations of the merits of the merger and in determining to
recommend to the stockholders of Aurora that they vote for the proposal to
approve and adopt the merger agreement.

    VERTEX BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  Upon completion of the merger, Stuart J.M.
Collinson, Aurora's Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and
President, will be appointed to Vertex's board of directors in the class of
directors whose term expires in 2002, with a commitment by Vertex and its board
of directors to renominate him for one additional three-year term.

    EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS.  The following officers of Aurora have entered into
employment agreements that become effective upon completion of the merger and
are guaranteed by Vertex:

    - Stuart J.M. Collinson, Aurora's Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive
      Officer and President;

    - Harry Stylli, Aurora's Senior Vice President, Commercial Development;

    - Thomas Klopack, Aurora's Senior Vice President and Chief Operating
      Officer;

    - Paul Negulescu, Aurora's Senior Vice President, Discovery Biology;

    - Christopher Krueger, Aurora's Vice President, Strategic Alliances and
      General Counsel;

    - John Pashkowsky, Aurora's Vice President, Finance and Treasurer; and

    - Pamela Fritz, Aurora's Vice President, Human Resources.

    AURORA STOCK OPTIONS.  Each option outstanding pursuant to Aurora's
Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan will, by its terms, become fully
vested and immediately exercisable prior to and subject to completion of the
merger and if not exercised prior to the completion of the merger, will
terminate as of the completion of the merger. In addition, as of June 1, 2001,
approximately 4,160,337 shares of Aurora common stock were subject to
outstanding options granted to officers and employees of Aurora under Aurora's
1996 Stock Plan, which contains a provision that provides for acceleration of
vesting after the merger if, within the period beginning 60 days before
completion of the merger and ending 13 months following the merger, the optionee
is terminated by Vertex without cause or if the optionee voluntarily terminates
his or her employment as a result of a constructive termination.

    INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.  The merger agreement provides that all
rights to indemnification and limitation of personal liability existing in favor
of the directors and officers of Aurora and its subsidiaries as provided in
existing agreements, Aurora's amended and restated certificate of incorporation
and Aurora's amended and restated by-laws will be assumed by Vertex and the
surviving subsidiary in the merger and will continue in full force and effect
for six years following completion of

the merger. The merger agreement also provides that for six years after the
completion of the merger, Vertex will maintain the existing policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance with respect to acts or omissions
occurring prior to the completion of the merger or substitute policies of
comparable coverage for the existing policies, subject to a maximum annual
aggregate premium of $180,000.

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER

    The merger will be completed when all of the conditions to completion of the
merger are satisfied or waived, including the approval of the issuance of the
Vertex common stock in connection with the merger by Vertex's stockholders and
the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by Aurora's stockholders. The
merger will become effective upon filing of a certificate of merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

    Each of Vertex and Aurora is working towards completing the merger as
quickly as possible. Assuming that both Vertex and Aurora satisfy or waive all
of the conditions to closing contained in the merger agreement, Vertex and
Aurora anticipate that the merger will occur as soon as practicable after
approval of the merger proposals at the special meetings.

EXCHANGE OF AURORA STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR VERTEX STOCK CERTIFICATES

    When the merger is completed, Vertex or an exchange agent will mail to
Aurora stockholders a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in
surrendering Aurora stock certificates in exchange for statements indicating
book-entry ownership of Vertex common stock or, if requested, Vertex stock
certificates. When Aurora stockholders deliver certificates to the exchange
agent along with a properly executed letter of transmittal and any other
required documents, the Aurora stock certificates will be canceled and the
Aurora stockholder will receive statements indicating book-entry ownership of
Vertex common stock or, if requested, Vertex stock certificates representing the
number of full shares of Vertex common stock to which they are entitled under
the merger agreement. Aurora stockholders will receive payment in cash, without
interest, in lieu of any fractional shares of Vertex stock which would have been
otherwise issuable to them as a result of the merger.

    You are not entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on
Vertex common stock until the merger is completed and you have surrendered your
Aurora stock certificates in exchange for Vertex stock certificates. If there is
any dividend or other distribution on Vertex common stock with a record date
after the date on which the merger is completed and a payment date prior to the
date you surrender your Aurora stock certificates in exchange for Vertex stock
certificates, you will receive the dividend or distribution with respect to the
whole shares of Vertex common stock issued to you promptly after they are
issued. If there is any dividend or other distribution on Vertex common stock
with a record date after the date on which the merger is completed and a payment
date after the date you surrender your Aurora stock certificates in exchange for
Vertex stock certificates, you will receive the dividend or distribution with
respect to the whole shares of Vertex common stock issued to you promptly after
the payment date.

    Vertex will only issue Vertex stock certificates or a check in lieu of a
fractional share in a name other than the name in which a surrendered Aurora
stock certificate is registered if you present the exchange agent with all
documents required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership and
show that you paid any applicable stock transfer taxes.

    AURORA STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT SUBMIT THEIR AURORA STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR
EXCHANGE UNTIL THEY RECEIVE THE TRANSMITTAL INSTRUCTIONS AND A FORM OF LETTER OF
TRANSMITTAL FROM VERTEX OR THE EXCHANGE AGENT.

TREATMENT OF AURORA'S EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

    Vertex has agreed that all employees of Aurora who continue employment after
the merger will be eligible to participate in the retirement, health, vacation
and other non-equity based employee benefit plans of the surviving corporation
after the merger, and Vertex will be assuming the outstanding rights of Aurora
employees under the Aurora Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the offering period
commencing June 1, 2001. In addition, after the merger, Aurora employees will be
eligible to participate in Vertex's 1996 Stock and Option Plan. Vertex may,
however, in its sole discretion, amend or terminate any Aurora employee benefit
plan at any time. If Vertex terminates such employee benefit plans, employees
will be eligible to participate in Vertex's employee benefit plans, to
substantially the same extent as employees of Vertex in similar positions and at
similar levels. Aurora employees will receive full credit for purposes of
eligibility and vesting under any employee benefit plans or arrangements for
their service with Aurora and its subsidiaries. Vertex or the surviving
corporation, as the case may be, will use its best efforts to cause any
applicable insurance carrier to waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements under any employee benefits plans that Aurora employees
may be eligible to participate in after the completion of the merger and will
also credit any co-payments and deductibles paid during the calendar year prior
to the completion of the merger in satisfying any applicable deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements under any employee benefit plans that Aurora
employees may be eligible to participate in after the completion of the merger.

TREATMENT OF AURORA STOCK OPTIONS

    When the merger is completed, each outstanding option to purchase Aurora
common stock (other than options outstanding under Aurora's Non-Employee
Directors' Stock Option Plan) will be assumed by Vertex and converted into and
become a right to purchase Vertex common stock. Each assumed option will be
governed by the same terms and conditions that governed the applicable Aurora
stock option immediately before the merger except that:

    - each such option will be exercisable for the number of shares of Vertex
      common stock equal to the number of shares of Aurora common stock issuable
      upon exercise of the option multiplied by 0.62, rounded down to the
      nearest whole share;

    - the per share exercise price for the shares of Vertex common stock
      issuable upon the exercise of the assumed option will be equal to the
      exercise price per share of the Aurora option divided by 0.62, rounded up
      to the nearest whole cent; and

    - each option outstanding pursuant to Aurora's Non-Employee Directors' Stock
      Option Plan will, by its terms, become fully vested and immediately
      exercisable prior to and subject to the merger and if not exercised prior
      to the completion of the merger, will terminate as of the completion of
      the merger.

    Any restrictions on the exercise of such options shall continue, and the
term, vesting schedule and other provisions of each such option shall remain
unchanged. However, as of June 1, 2001, approximately 4,160,337 shares of Aurora
common stock were subject to outstanding options granted to officers and
employees of Aurora under Aurora's 1996 Stock Plan, which contains a provision
that provides for acceleration of vesting after the merger if, within the period
beginning 60 days before completion of the merger and ending 13 months following
the merger, the optionee is terminated by Vertex without cause or if the
optionee voluntarily terminates his or her employment as a result of a
constructive termination. On June 1, 2001, excluding outstanding options under
the Aurora Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan, there were options to
purchase 4,408,654 shares of Aurora common stock outstanding at a weighted
average exercise price of $22.55 per share. On June 1, 2001 there were options
to purchase 101,584 shares of Aurora common stock outstanding under the Aurora
Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan at a weighted average exercise price
of $28.13 per share.

    Vertex has agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-8 relating to
the shares of Vertex common stock issuable upon exercise of the assumed Aurora
stock options within 20 days after completion of the merger.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

    The following general discussion summarizes the anticipated material United
States federal income tax consequences of the merger. This discussion is based
on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the regulations promulgated thereunder,
existing administrative interpretations and court decisions, all of which are
subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, and assumptions,
limitations, representations and covenants, including those contained in
certificates of officers of Vertex, its wholly-owned subsidiary and Aurora
expected to be executed as of the completion of the merger. This discussion does
not address all aspects of United States federal income taxation that may be
important to you in light of your particular circumstances or if you are subject
to special rules, such as rules relating to:

    - stockholders who are not citizens or residents of the United States;

    - financial institutions;

    - mutual funds;

    - tax-exempt organizations;

    - insurance companies;

    - dealers in securities;

    - stockholders who acquired their Aurora common stock pursuant to the
      exercise of options or similar derivative securities or otherwise as
      compensation;

    - stockholders whose shares are qualified small business stock for purposes
      of Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code; and

    - stockholders who hold their Aurora common stock as part of an integrated
      investment such as a hedge, constructive sale, straddle or other risk
      reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction.

    This discussion assumes you hold your Aurora common stock as a capital asset
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.

    TAX OPINIONS REGARDING THE MERGER.

    Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. has delivered to Vertex
and Cooley Godward LLP has delivered to Aurora, opinions stating that the merger
will qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code. These opinions assume the absence of changes in
existing facts and rely on assumptions, representations and covenants contained
in these opinions and in certificates executed by officers of Vertex, its
wholly-owned subsidiary and Aurora. These opinions neither bind the Internal
Revenue Service, or IRS, nor preclude the IRS from adopting a position contrary
to that expressed below, and no assurance can be given that contrary positions
will not be successfully asserted by the IRS or adopted by a court if the issues
are litigated. If either Mintz Levin or Cooley Godward does not render such
opinion, the condition will be satisfied if the other law firm renders its
opinion to both Vertex and Aurora. Neither Vertex nor Aurora intends to obtain a
ruling from the IRS with respect to the tax consequences of the merger.

    Assuming the merger constitutes a reorganization, the following tax
consequences will result:

    - Except as discussed below, Aurora stockholders will not recognize gain or
      loss for United States federal income tax purposes when shares of Aurora
      common stock are exchanged for Vertex common stock pursuant to the merger.

    - The aggregate tax basis of the Vertex common stock received by an Aurora
      stockholder as a result of the merger will be the same as the aggregate
      tax basis in the Aurora common stock surrendered in the exchange, reduced
      by the tax basis of any Aurora common stock for which the Aurora
      stockholder receives cash instead of fractional shares of Vertex common
      stock.

    - The holding period of the Vertex common stock an Aurora stockholder
      receives as a result of the exchange will include the period during which
      the stockholder held the Aurora common stock exchanged in the merger.

    - Because fractional shares of Vertex common stock will not be issued in the
      merger, Aurora stockholders will recognize capital gain or loss for United
      States federal income tax purposes with respect to the cash received
      instead of fractional share interests in Vertex common stock. This gain or
      loss will equal the difference between the amount of cash received and the
      tax basis of the Aurora stock surrendered in the merger that is allocated
      to fractional shares. This gain or loss will be a long-term capital gain
      or loss if the Aurora common stock has been held for more than one year at
      the time the merger is completed.

    - Vertex, its wholly-owned subsidiary and Aurora will not recognize gain or
      loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the
      merger.

    In addition to the foregoing, there are other tax-related issues of which
you should be aware, including:

    - OTHER CONSIDERATION. Even if the merger qualifies as a reorganization, a
      recipient of Vertex common stock would recognize income to the extent
      that, for example, any such shares were determined to have been received
      in exchange for services, to satisfy obligations or in consideration for
      anything other than the Aurora common stock surrendered. Generally, such
      income is taxable as ordinary income upon receipt. In addition, to the
      extent that an Aurora stockholder were treated as receiving, directly or
      indirectly, consideration other than Vertex common stock in exchange for
      such stockholder's Aurora common stock, gain or loss would have to be
      recognized.

    - REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. Each Aurora stockholder that receives Vertex
      common stock in the merger will be required to file a statement with the
      stockholder's federal income tax return setting forth the stockholder's
      basis in the Aurora common stock surrendered and the fair market value of
      the Vertex common stock and cash, if any, received in the merger, and to
      retain permanent records of these facts relating to the merger.

    - BACKUP WITHHOLDING. Unless an exemption applies under the applicable law
      and regulations and is proved in a manner satisfactory to the exchange
      agent, the exchange agent may be required to withhold and, if required,
      will withhold 31% of any cash payments to an Aurora stockholder in the
      merger unless the stockholder provides the appropriate form. A stockholder
      should complete and sign the substitute Form W-9 enclosed with the letter
      of transmittal sent by the exchange agent. This completed form provides
      the information, including the holder's taxpayer identification number,
      and certification necessary to avoid backup withholding.

    - CONSEQUENCES OF IRS CHALLENGE. In the event of a successful IRS challenge
      to the status of the merger as a reorganization, Aurora stockholders would
      recognize gain or loss with respect to each share of Aurora common stock
      surrendered in the merger. Such gain or loss would be equal to the
      difference between the stockholder's basis in such shares and the sum of
      the fair

      market value, as of the effective time, of the Vertex common stock
      received. In such event, a stockholder's aggregate basis in the Vertex
      common stock so received would equal its fair market value as of the
      effective time, and the stockholder's holding period for such stock would
      begin the day after the merger is completed.

    THIS DISCUSSION IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION OF
ALL POTENTIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OR ANY OTHER
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER. IN ADDITION, THIS DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX
CONSEQUENCES WHICH MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL
CIRCUMSTANCES. MOREOVER, THIS DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY NON-INCOME TAX OR
ANY FOREIGN, STATE OR LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER. ACCORDINGLY, YOU ARE
STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT WITH YOUR TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR
UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN INCOME OR OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES
TO YOU OF THE MERGER.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER

    We intend to account for the merger as a "pooling of interests" business
combination. It is a condition to completion of the merger that Vertex be
advised in writing by its independent accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
that they concur with the conclusion of Vertex's management that the merger can
properly be accounted for as a pooling of interests business combination. It is
also a condition to completion of the merger that Vertex be advised in writing
by Aurora's independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, that they concur with
Aurora's management's conclusion as to whether Aurora meets the conditions
necessary for it to enter into the business combination accounted for as a
pooling of interests. Each of these conditions, however, may be waived. Under
the pooling of interests method of accounting, each of Vertex's and Aurora's
historical recorded assets and liabilities will be carried forward to the
combined company at their recorded amounts. In addition, the operating results
of the combined company will include Vertex's and Aurora's operating results for
the entire fiscal year in which the merger is completed and Vertex's and
Aurora's historical reported operating results for prior periods will be
combined and restated as the operating results of the combined company.

REGULATORY MATTERS

    Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, Vertex may
not complete the merger until notifications have been furnished to the Federal
Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, and
the required waiting period has expired or been terminated. Vertex and Aurora
each filed a pre-merger notification and report form with the FTC and the
Antitrust Division on June 5, 2001. We expect that the applicable waiting period
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act will expire or be terminated on or before
July 5, 2001. As a result, the merger will be deemed to have received antitrust
approval and may be consummated, pending compliance with the other closing
conditions.

    At any time before the completion of the merger, the Antitrust Division, the
FTC or a private person or entity could seek under antitrust laws, among other
things, to enjoin the merger and any time after the completion of the merger, to
cause Vertex to divest itself, in whole or in part, of the surviving corporation
of the merger or of business conducted by the surviving corporation of the
merger. We cannot assure you that a challenge to the merger will not be made or
that, if a challenge is made, Vertex will prevail. The obligation of Vertex and
Aurora to complete the merger is subject to the condition that any applicable
waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act shall have expired without action
by the Antitrust Division or the FTC to prevent completion of the merger.

RESTRICTIONS ON SALES OF SHARES BY AFFILIATES OF AURORA

    The shares of Vertex common stock to be issued to Aurora stockholders in
connection with the merger will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933
and will be freely transferable under the

Securities Act, except for shares of Vertex common stock issued to any person
who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of Aurora at the time of the Aurora special
meeting and shares issued in exchange for Aurora shares that are subject to a
transfer restriction. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include
individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under the common
control of Aurora and may include Aurora's executive officers and directors, as
well as Aurora's significant stockholders. Affiliates may not sell their shares
of Vertex common stock acquired in connection with the merger except pursuant
to:

    - an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
      resale of those shares;

    - an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or

    - any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

    In addition, the directors and executive officers of Aurora and all other
stockholders who may be deemed affiliates of Aurora have executed affiliate
agreements with Vertex prohibiting the sale, exchange, transfer, pledge or other
disposition of the Aurora common stock held by them or the Vertex common stock
received by them in the merger:

    - during the 30-day period prior to the closing of the merger; and

    - until after the merger when Vertex has published the financial results
      covering at least 30 days of combined operations of Aurora and Vertex.

    Vertex's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy
statement-prospectus forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of Vertex
common stock to be received by affiliates of Aurora in the merger.

NO APPRAISAL RIGHTS

    Vertex stockholders and Aurora stockholders are not entitled to exercise
dissenter's or appraisal rights as a result of the merger or to demand payment
for their shares under applicable law.

LISTING ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET OF THE VERTEX COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN
THE MERGER

    Vertex will use reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Vertex common
stock to be issued in connection with the merger to be approved for listing on
The Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of issuance, before the
completion of the merger.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF AURORA COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER

    When the merger is completed, Aurora common stock will be delisted from The
Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    The following summary of the merger agreement is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, which is incorporated
by reference and attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement-prospectus.

obligations to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
specified conditions before completion of the merger, including the following:

      seeking to prevent completion of the merger;

      Aurora; and

    - the receipt by Vertex of an opinion from its tax counsel, Mintz, Levin,
      Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C., and by Aurora of an opinion from

      tax-free reorganization under the tax code.

    Subject to limited exceptions under specified circumstances, "Material
Adverse Effect" means any event, change, effect, occurrence, violation,
inaccuracy, circumstance or other matter, which, either individually or together
with other such matters, had or would reasonably be expected to have a material

    - the business, condition, capitalization, assets, liabilities, operations
      or financial performance of either Vertex or Aurora and its subsidiaries,
      taken as a whole;

    - the ability of either Vertex or Aurora to complete the merger or any of
      the other transactions or obligations of such party as contemplated by the
      merger agreement; or

    - with respect to Vertex only, Vertex's ability to vote, receive dividends
      with respect to or otherwise exercise ownership rights with respect to the
      stock of Aurora after the merger is completed.

waiver of each of the following additional conditions before completion of the
merger:

    - Aurora's representations and warranties must be true and correct in all
      material respects as of the date of the merger agreement, except that

      completion of the merger are satisfied to cure any untrue or incorrect
      representation or warranty;

    - Aurora's representations and warranties must be true and correct in all
      material respects as of the date the merger is to be completed, except for
      any failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct
      that would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Material
      Adverse Effect with respect to Aurora;

    - Aurora must have complied with or performed, in all material respects,
      each of the covenants and obligations required of it by the merger
      agreement;

    - Aurora and its subsidiaries must not have suffered a Material Adverse
      Effect which has not been cured as of the date that all other conditions
      to completion of the merger are satisfied;

    - Vertex must have received from each of Aurora's affiliates an executed
      affiliate agreement;

    - Vertex must have received a letter from Aurora's independent auditors,
      Ernst & Young LLP, to the effect that Ernst & Young concurs with Aurora's
      management's conclusions as to the appropriateness of accounting for the
      merger as a pooling of interests in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles and the regulations and policies of the Securities
      and Exchange Commission;

    - Vertex must have received a letter from its independent accountants,
      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, to the effect that PricewaterhouseCoopers
      concurs with the conclusion of Vertex's management that it may account for
      the merger as a pooling of interests in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles and the regulations and policies of the Securities
      and Exchange Commission; and

    - Vertex must have received resignations from all of the directors of Aurora
      and its subsidiaries.

    Aurora's obligation to complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of each of the following additional conditions before completion of the
merger:

    - Vertex's representations and warranties must be true and correct in all
      material respects as of the date of the merger agreement;

    - Vertex's representations and warranties must be true and correct in all
      material respects as of the date the merger is to be completed;

    - Vertex must have complied with or performed, in all material respects,
      each of the covenants and obligations required of it by the merger
      agreement; and

    - from the date of the merger agreement, Vertex must not have suffered a
      Material Adverse Effect that is continuing as of the date that all other
      conditions to completion of the merger are satisfied.

    NO SOLICITATION OF OTHER PROPOSALS BY AURORA.  The merger agreement contains
detailed provisions prohibiting Aurora from seeking an alternative transaction.
Under these "no solicitation" provisions, Aurora has agreed that until the
merger agreement is terminated, it will not, nor will it permit any of its
subsidiaries or representatives acting on behalf of its subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly:

    - solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or induce the making, submission or
      announcement of an Acquisition Proposal, as described below;

    - take any action that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
      Acquisition Proposal;

    - furnish any nonpublic information regarding itself or its subsidiaries in
      connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry or
      indication of interest that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
      Acquisition Proposal;

    - engage in discussions or negotiations with respect to any Acquisition
      Proposal;

    - approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or

    - enter into any letter of intent or similar document or contract
      contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Transaction, as
      described below.

    However, the merger agreement does not prevent Aurora from entering into
discussions, or furnishing confidential information in connection with a
Superior Proposal, as described below, submitted to Aurora if:

    - Aurora's board of directors concludes in good faith, after consultation
      with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would create a
      substantial risk of liability for breach of its fiduciary duties to
      Aurora's stockholders; and

    - at least two business days prior to having such discussions, Aurora
      notifies Vertex in writing.

    "Acquisition Proposal" means an offer, proposal, inquiry or indication of
interest contemplating or relating to an Acquisition Transaction.

    "Acquisition Transaction" means a transaction or series of transactions
involving a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
issuance of securities, acquisition of securities, tender offer, exchange offer
or other similar transaction:

    - involving Aurora or any of its subsidiaries;

Vertex's restated articles of organization, as amended, Vertex's amended and
restated by-laws and the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. See the
section entitled "Comparison of Rights of Holders of Aurora Common Stock and
Vertex Common Stock" that begins on page 80 of this joint proxy
statement-prospectus.

               UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

    The following unaudited pro forma combined financial information gives
effect to the merger using the pooling of interests method of accounting, after
giving effect to the pro forma adjustments described in the accompanying notes.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial information should be read in
conjunction with the audited historical consolidated financial statements and
related notes of Vertex and Aurora, which are incorporated by reference into
this joint proxy statement-prospectus. The audited consolidated financial
statements and related notes thereto of Aurora are included in its current
report on Form 8-K dated May 18, 2001, which is incorporated by reference into
this joint proxy statement-prospectus.

    The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations give effect to the
merger as if it had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented. The
unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations for each year in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2000 combine the audited historical
consolidated statements of operations of Vertex for each year in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2000 included in its annual report on Form 10-K and
the audited consolidated statements of operations of Aurora for each year in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2000 included in its current report on
Form 8-K dated May 18, 2001. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of
operations for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000 combine the
unaudited historical consolidated statements of operations of Vertex for the
three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000 and the unaudited historical
consolidated statements of operations of Aurora for the three months ended March
31, 2001 and 2000 as found in their respective filings on Form 10-Q.

    The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet gives effect to the
merger as if it had occurred on March 31, 2001. The unaudited pro forma combined
condensed balance sheet combines the unaudited condensed historical consolidated
balance sheets of Vertex and Aurora as of March 31, 2001. We intend to account
for the merger as a pooling of interests business combination. Upon completion
of the merger, each outstanding share of Aurora common stock will be converted
into 0.62 of a share of Vertex common stock and the stockholders of Aurora will
become stockholders of Vertex. The pro forma balance sheet as of March 31, 2001
reflects $15.45 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in
stockholders' equity representing estimated expenses to be incurred in
connection with the merger--mainly advisor, legal and accounting fees and
expenses. These costs have not been reflected in the pro forma statements of
operations for any period; they will be reflected in the statement of operations
during the accounting period in which the merger is consummated.

    The unaudited pro forma combined financial information is presented for
illustrative purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of the
operating results or financial position that would have actually occurred if the
merger had been in effect on the dates indicated, nor is it necessarily
indicative of future operating results or financial position of the merged
companies. The pro forma adjustments are based on the information and
assumptions available at the time of the printing of this joint proxy
statement-prospectus.

                      DESCRIPTION OF VERTEX CAPITAL STOCK

    The following is a summary of the material terms of Vertex's capital stock.
Because it is only a summary, it does not contain all information that may be
important to you. Therefore, you should read carefully the more detailed
provisions of Vertex's restated articles of organization, as amended, Vertex's
amended and restated by-laws and the Vertex stockholder rights plan.

GENERAL

    Vertex's authorized capital stock consists of 200,000,000 shares of common
stock, $0.01 par value, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par
value.

VERTEX COMMON STOCK

    As of the record date, there were 60,373,345 shares of Vertex common stock
outstanding held by approximately 191 stockholders of record. Holders of Vertex
common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters
submitted to a vote of stockholders and do not have cumulative voting rights.
Accordingly, holders of a majority of the shares of Vertex common stock entitled
to vote in any election of directors may elect all of the directors standing for
election. Holders of Vertex common stock are entitled to receive ratably such
dividends, if any, as may be declared by Vertex's board of directors out of
funds legally available therefor, subject to any preferential dividend rights of
any outstanding preferred stock. Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of Vertex, the holders of Vertex common stock are entitled to receive ratably
the net assets of Vertex available after the payment of all debts and other
liabilities and subject to any prior rights of any outstanding preferred stock.
Holders of Vertex common stock have no preemptive, subscription, redemption or
conversion rights. The outstanding shares of Vertex common stock are fully paid
and nonassessable. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of Vertex
common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the
holders of shares of any series of preferred stock which Vertex may designate
and issue in the future.

VERTEX PREFERRED STOCK

    Vertex's board of directors has the authority, without further action by the
stockholders, to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more
series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof,
including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of
redemption, liquidation preferences, sinking fund terms and the number of shares
constituting any series or the designation of such series, without any further
vote or action by stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely
affect the voting power of holders of Vertex common stock and the likelihood
that such holders will receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation
and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in
control. Vertex has no present plan to issue any shares of preferred stock.

11,428,148 shares of Vertex common stock at a weighted average exercise price of

    AURORA.  Aurora's board of directors currently consists of seven members.
Aurora's charter and by-laws provide that the number of directors shall be fixed
exclusively by Aurora's board of directors.

    VERTEX.  Vertex's board of directors currently consists of seven members.
Vertex's by-laws state that the number of directors shall be fixed by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, but shall not be
less than three nor more than nine persons. Upon completion of the merger, the
number of directors will be increased to eight, and Stuart J.M. Collinson, the
current Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President of Aurora,
will be appointed as a director of Vertex.

CLASSIFICATION OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    AURORA.  The DGCL permits, but does not require, a classified board of
directors, divided into as many as three classes with staggered terms under
which one half or one-third of the directors are elected for terms of two or
three years. Aurora's charter does not provide for the classification of its
board of directors. Accordingly, each director holds office for one year and
until the director's successor has been elected (or until the director's prior
death, resignation or removal).

    VERTEX.  Vertex's charter and by-laws provide that the board of directors
shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, with
each class having a three-year term.

REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

    AURORA.  Directors of Aurora may be removed from office for cause by the
holders of a majority of outstanding stock entitled to vote at an election of
directors, or removed without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least 66 2/3% of the outstanding stock entitled to vote at an election of
directors.

    VERTEX.  Directors of Vertex may be removed from office, but only for cause,
by a majority of shares entitled to vote at an election of directors. Any
director may also be removed from office for cause by vote of a majority of the
directors then in office.

FILLING VACANCIES ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    AURORA.  A vacancy or newly created directorship resulting from death,
resignation, disqualification, removal or other cause and any newly created
directorship resulting from an increase in the number of directors may be filled
by a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum. The board
of directors of Aurora may also determine by resolution that any such vacancies
shall be filled by stockholders.

    VERTEX.  A vacancy or newly created directorship, whether resulting from an
increase in the size of the board of directors, the death, resignation,
disqualification, removal of a director or other cause may be filled solely by
the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office,
even if less than a quorum.

AMENDMENTS TO CHARTER

    AURORA.  Under the DGCL, a corporation's charter may be amended by approval
of the board of directors and the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for the amendment, unless a higher
vote is required by the corporation's charter. Aurora's charter provides that
the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting shares,
voting as a single class, is required to alter, amend or repeal the provisions
of Aurora's charter related to:

    - election, nomination and removal of directors;

    - amendment of Aurora's by-laws;

    - indemnification of directors; and

    - amendment of Aurora's charter.

    VERTEX.  Vertex's charter generally may be amended by the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for the
amendment. However, Vertex's charter also requires (1) the affirmative vote of
holders of at least 80% of the outstanding shares of Vertex's capital stock
entitled to vote in an election of directors, voting as a single class, to amend
provisions related to election, nomination and removal of directors, and (2) the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares
of Series A Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the
charter in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers,
preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect
them adversely.

AMENDMENTS TO BY-LAWS

    AURORA.  Under the DGCL, the power to amend the by-laws rests with the
stockholders entitled to vote, although the certificate of incorporation may
give the board of directors power to amend the by-

laws. Aurora's charter provides that Aurora's by-laws may be amended, altered or
repealed and new by-laws may be adopted, by the board of directors or the
affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the
outstanding shares of Aurora voting stock.

    VERTEX.  Vertex's by-laws generally may be amended, altered or repealed and
new by-laws may be adopted, by a vote of at least a majority of the outstanding
shares of Vertex stock entitled to vote, or except with respect to any provision
which requires action by the stockholders, by a vote of a majority of the
directors then in office. However, the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least 80% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote in the election of
directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend,
adopt any provision inconsistent with, or repeal any provision of the by-laws
concerning election, nomination, and removal of directors, vacancies on the
board of directors, or the amendment requirements.

SPECIAL STOCKHOLDER MEETINGS

    AURORA.  A special meeting of Aurora's stockholders may be called, for any
purpose, only by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or the
board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total
number of authorized directors.

    VERTEX.  A special meeting of Vertex's stockholders may be called by the
Chairman of the Board, the President, or the board of directors. A special
meeting may also be called by the Clerk, or any other officer in the Clerk's
absence or refusal, upon the written application of stockholders holding at
least 40% of the Vertex capital stock entitled to vote at the proposed meeting.

ACTION BY CONSENT OF STOCKHOLDERS

    AURORA.  Under the DGCL, unless a company's certificate of incorporation
specifies otherwise, stockholders may execute an action by written consent in
lieu of a stockholder meeting. Aurora's charter provides that actions by written
consent of the stockholders are prohibited.

    VERTEX.  Vertex stockholders may act by unanimous written consent.

INSPECTION RIGHTS

    AURORA.  By law, every stockholder of record has the right to examine for
any proper purpose a Delaware corporation's stock ledger, a list of its
stockholders and its other books and records.

    VERTEX.  By law, stockholders have the right for a proper purpose to inspect
a Massachusetts corporation's charter, by-laws, records of all meetings of
incorporators and stockholders, and stock and transfer records, including the
stockholder list. Additionally, stockholders have a qualified right to inspect
other books and records of a Massachusetts corporation.

LIMITATION OF PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS

    AURORA.  Aurora's charter provides that no director of Aurora shall be
personally liable for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director. However, no such provision will eliminate the liability of a director
for:

    - any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to Aurora or its
      stockholders;

    - acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
      misconduct or a knowing violation of the law;

    - violation of the provisions of the DGCL regarding unlawful payment of
      dividends or unlawful stock purchases or redemptions; or

    - any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
      benefit.

    VERTEX.  Vertex's charter provides that no Vertex director shall be
personally liable for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director. However, this provision will not eliminate the liability of a Vertex
director for:

    - any breach of the director's loyalty to Vertex or its stockholders;

    - acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
      misconduct or a knowing violation of laws;

    - any violation of the provisions of the MBCL regarding unlawful
      distributions to stockholders, or unlawful loans to directors, officers
      and stockholders; or

    - for any transactions from which the director derived an improper personal
      benefit.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

    AURORA.  Aurora's by-laws provide that Aurora shall indemnify its directors
and executive officers to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL,
provided that Aurora may limit the extent of such indemnification by individual
contracts with its directors and executive officers and that Aurora shall not be
required to indemnify any director or executive officer in connection with any
proceeding initiated by such person or any proceeding by such person against
Aurora or its directors, officers, employees or other agents unless (1) such
indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (2) the proceeding was
authorized by the board of directors, or (3) such indemnification is provided by
Aurora, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in it under the
DGCL.

    VERTEX.  Vertex's by-laws provide that Vertex shall indemnify each of its
directors and officers against all liabilities and expenses, including amounts
paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromise, or as fines and penalties, and
counsel fees reasonably incurred by such director or officer in connection with
the defense or disposition of any action, suit, or other proceeding, whether
civil or criminal, in which such director or officer may be involved or with
which such person may be threatened, while in office or thereafter, by reason of
such person's being or having been such a director, officer, or trustee.
However, indemnification will not apply with respect to any matter as to which
such director or officer shall have been adjudicated in any proceeding not to
have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that such director's or
officer's action was in the best interest of Vertex or, to the extent that such
matter relates to service with respect to an employee benefit plan, in the best
interest of the participants or beneficiaries of such employee benefit plan.

STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLANS

    AURORA.  Pursuant to a Rights Agreement dated April 2, 2001, as amended on
April 29, 2001, each holder of Aurora common stock as of April 17, 2001 is
entitled to receive one right for each share of common stock held. These rights
expire ten years from the date of adoption of the Rights Agreement.

    Each right entitles the holder thereof, upon the occurrence of certain
events, to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of newly-created Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock of Aurora for a purchase price equal to
$200.00 per right. These rights initially trade with the common stock, but
detach from the common stock and become exercisable (1) in the event a person or
affiliated group acquires 15% or more of the Aurora's outstanding common stock,
or (2) ten business days after the commencement (or public announcement of the
intention to commence) by a person or affiliated group of a tender offer or
exchange offer for 15% or more of the Aurora's outstanding common stock. In
addition, in the event a person or affiliated group acquires 15% of more of the
Aurora's outstanding common stock, the holders of rights will be entitled, in
lieu of purchasing shares of Series A Preferred Stock, to purchase shares of
Aurora common stock from the Company at a 50% discount.

    If after the rights are exercisable, Aurora is acquired in a business
combination transaction or 50% or more of its assets are sold, each holder of a
right will then be allowed to purchase at the purchase price a number of shares
of the acquiring company's common stock which at the time of the transaction has
a market value of twice the purchase price.

    The Aurora's board of directors may terminate the Rights Agreement or redeem
the rights for $0.001 per right at any time prior to the time a person or
affiliated group acquires 15% or more of the Aurora's common stock.

    On April 29, 2001, the Rights Agreement was amended to provide for the
exclusion of the merger as a transaction that would trigger any rights under the
agreement.

    VERTEX.  Pursuant to a Rights Agreement dated July 1, 1991, as amended on
February 21, 1997, each outstanding share of Vertex common stock has, and each
share of Vertex common stock issued in the future, including the shares of
Vertex common stock issued in exchange for Aurora common stock upon completion
of the merger, will have an associated preferred share purchase right that
entitles the holder to purchase from Vertex one half of one-hundredth of a share
of Vertex's Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value, at a
purchase price of $135, subject to adjustment for stock splits and other
recapitalization events. The Rights Agreement will expire by its terms on
June 30, 2001. On May 8, 2001, the board of directors of Vertex met and voted to
amend the Rights Agreement to extend the term of the Rights Agreement through
June 30, 2011. These rights are not currently exercisable, but will become
exercisable upon the earlier of:

    - ten days following the acquisition by a person, group or entity of 15% or
      more of Vertex's outstanding common stock; or

    - ten business days following the commencement of a tender or exchange
      offer, the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership
      by a person, group of persons or entity of 15% or more of Vertex's
      outstanding common stock.

    When exercisable, each right permits its holder to purchase that number of
shares of Vertex's common stock equal in value to twice the purchase price. The
acquiror that triggers the exercisability of the rights cannot exercise or
transfer their rights. Additionally, if after the rights are exercisable, Vertex
is acquired in a business combination transaction or 50% or more of its assets
are sold, each holder of a right will then be allowed to purchase at the
purchase price a number of shares of the acquiring company's common stock which
at the time of the transaction has a market value of twice the purchase price.

    At any time after any person, group or entity triggers the exercisability of
the right and prior to the acquisition by such person, group or entity of 50% or
more of the outstanding Vertex common stock, Vertex's board of directors may
cause the rights (other than rights owned by such person, group or entity) to be
exchanged, in whole or in part, for Vertex common stock or junior preferred
shares, at an exchange rate of one share of Vertex common stock per right or one
half of one-hundredth of a junior preferred share per right.

    At any time prior to the rights becoming exercisable, Vertex's board of
directors may redeem the rights in whole at a price of $.01 per right.

RELEVANT BUSINESS COMBINATION PROVISIONS AND STATUTES

    AURORA.  The DGCL provides that if a person acquires 15% or more of the
stock of a Delaware corporation, such person may not engage in certain
transactions with the corporation for a period of three years. The statute
contains certain exceptions to this prohibition. If, for example, the board of
directors approves the acquisition of stock or the transaction prior to the time
that the person becomes an interested stockholder, or if the interested
stockholder acquires at least 85% of the voting stock of

the corporation (excluding voting stock owned by directors who are also officers
and certain employee stock plans) in one transaction, or if the transaction is
approved by the board of directors and the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the
holders of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested
stockholder at a meeting of the stockholders, then the prohibition on business
combinations is not applicable.

    VERTEX.  The MBCL provides that, if a person acquires 5% or more of the
stock of a Massachusetts corporation, such person may not engage in certain
transactions with the corporation for a period of three years. The statute
contains certain exceptions to this prohibition. If, for example, the board of
directors approves the subject transaction prior to the time that the person
becomes an interested stockholder, or if the interested stockholder acquires 90%
of the voting stock of the corporation (excluding voting stock owned by
directors who are also officers and certain employee stock plans) in one
transaction, or if the transaction is approved by the board of directors and by
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the holders of the outstanding voting
stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder at a meeting of the
stockholders, then the prohibition on business combinations is not applicable.

    Under the Massachusetts Control Share Acquisition Statute, a person who
acquires beneficial ownership of shares of stock of a corporation in a threshold
amount equal to greater than one-fifth, one-third, or a majority of the voting
stock of the corporation (a "control share acquisition"), must obtain the
approval of a majority of shares entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors (excluding (1) any shares owned by such person acquiring or proposing
to acquire beneficial ownership of shares in a control share acquisition, (2)
any shares owned by any officer of the corporation and (3) any shares owned by
any employee of the corporation who is also a director of the corporation) in
order to vote the shares that such person acquires in crossing the foregoing
thresholds. The statute does not require that such person consummate the
purchase before the stockholder vote is taken. The Massachusetts Control Share
Acquisition statute permits, to the extent authorized by a corporation's
articles of organization or by-laws, redemption of all shares acquired by an
acquiring person in a control share acquisition for fair value (which is to be
determined in accordance with procedures adopted by the corporation) if (1) no
control share acquisition statement is delivered by the acquiring person or (2)
a control share acquisition statement has been delivered and voting rights were
not authorized for such shares by the stockholders in accordance with applicable
law. If the stockholders authorize voting rights and after such control share
acquisition the acquiring person beneficially owns shares entitling such person
to vote, or direct the voting of, shares having a majority or more of all voting
power in the election of directors, each stockholder who did not vote in favor
of authorizing the voting rights may demand payment for his shares and appraisal
rights.

               ADDITIONAL PROPOSAL FOR THE VERTEX SPECIAL MEETING
                  TO AMEND VERTEX'S 1996 STOCK AND OPTION PLAN

GENERAL

    Vertex's board of directors adopted the 1996 Stock and Option Plan, or the
Plan, in December 1996. Under the Plan, Vertex may grant:

    - options intended to qualify as incentive stock options, or ISOs, under
      Section 422(b) of the Internal Revenue Code;

    - non-qualified stock options, or NQSOs; and

    - awards of shares of Vertex common stock or the opportunity to make a
      direct purchase of shares of Vertex common stock, or Stock Awards.

Any of these stock rights may be granted under the Plan to employees of Vertex
and its subsidiaries, including officers and directors who are employees.
Consultants, advisors and non-employee directors of Vertex and its subsidiaries
are eligible to receive NQSOs and Stock Awards under the Plan. As of May 17,
2001, approximately 480 employees and directors of Vertex and its subsidiaries
were eligible to receive stock rights under the Plan. Upon completion of the
merger, approximately 350 Aurora employees will be eligible to receive stock
rights under the Plan.

AMENDMENT TO THE PLAN

    Due to the increase in the number of persons eligible to receive stock
rights under the Plan upon completion of the merger, on May 17, 2001 Vertex's
board of directors adopted an amendment to the Plan to increase the number of
shares of Vertex common stock reserved for issuance under the Plan by 3,000,000,
from 13,000,000 to a total of 16,000,000. This amendment is being submitted for
stockholder approval at the Vertex special meeting to ensure continued
qualification of the Plan under the Internal Revenue Code's rules relating to
ISOs. If the merger is approved by both the Vertex stockholders and the Aurora
stockholders, but the amendment to the Plan is not approved by the Vertex
stockholders, the amendment to the Plan as approved by the board of directors
will remain in effect, but any options that are granted relating to the
additional shares must be granted as NQSOs. Vertex's board of directors believes
that the increase is advisable to give Vertex the flexibility needed to attract,
retain and motivate employees, directors and consultants after the merger is
completed.

    As of June 1, 2001, stock options to purchase 7,938,733 shares of common
stock were outstanding under the Plan, with exercise prices ranging from $7.66
to $93.12. These options have expiration dates ranging from December 11, 2006 to
December 21, 2010. As of the same date, after giving effect to this amendment,
6,372,354 shares of Vertex common stock remained available for the grant of
additional stock rights under the Plan. On June 7, 2001, the last sales price
for Vertex's common stock reported on The Nasdaq National Market was $48.70. The
number of shares subject to the Plan is subject to adjustment in the case of a
stock split, stock dividend, combination, recapitalization or similar
transaction.

    As of June 1, 2001, unexercised options for 1,544,689 shares of Vertex
common stock were outstanding under the Vertex 1991 Stock Option Plan, and
22,522 shares remained available for the granting of additional options under
that plan. As of the same date, unexercised options for 1,936,360 shares of
Vertex common stock were outstanding under the Vertex 1994 Stock and Option
Plan, and 18,239 shares of Vertex common stock remained available for the
granting of additional options and stock awards under that plan. The number of
shares authorized for issuance under the Plan will be increased by the number of
shares reserved for options under the 1991 Stock Option Plan and the 1994 Stock
and Option Plan but not granted, if any.

DESCRIPTION OF MATERIAL FEATURES OF THE PLAN

    Vertex's compensation committee administers the Plan. Subject to the
provisions of the Plan, the compensation committee has the authority to
determine the persons to whom stock rights will be granted, the number of shares
to be covered by each stock right, the exercise price per share and the manner
of exercise, and the terms and conditions upon which stock rights are granted.
The compensation committee may also accelerate the vesting schedule of any stock
option, and is generally responsible for interpreting the provisions of the
Plan.

    Stock options may not be granted under the Plan at a price less than the
fair market value of Vertex common stock on the date of grant. ISOs granted
under the Plan must expire not more than ten years from the date of grant. No
participant may be granted options in any calendar year for the purchase of more
than 400,000 shares of Vertex common stock, subject to adjustment in the event
of certain stock dividends, stock splits and other corporate events. Stock
Awards may be granted on such terms and conditions as are approved by the
compensation committee, provided that the purchase price per share cannot be
less than the par value per share of the Vertex common stock. Stock Awards under
the Plan must be subject to restrictions on transfer and a right of repurchase
by Vertex, which shall vest over a period of not less than three years from the
date of grant, or until the later of one year after the date of grant or the
achievement of specified performance objectives approved by the compensation
committee.

    ISOs granted under the Plan are exercisable during the optionholder's
lifetime only by the optionholder and are not transferable except by will or by
the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to qualified domestic relations
orders or otherwise by law.

    Each newly elected non-employee director of Vertex is automatically granted
a NQSO to purchase 20,000 shares of Vertex common stock, at a purchase price
equal to the fair market value per share of Vertex's common stock on the date of
election of such director. These options vest in equal quarterly installments
over a period of four years from the date of grant. In addition, each
non-employee director serving in office on June 1 of any year is granted a NQSO
to purchase 7,500 shares of Vertex common stock at an exercise price equal to
the fair market value per share of Vertex's common stock on the date of grant.
These options are fully exercisable immediately upon grant and have a term of
ten years.

    In the event of certain consolidations or acquisitions of Vertex or a sale
of substantially all of Vertex's assets, either:

    - the compensation committee shall provide for the surviving or acquiring
      entity or an affiliate to assume the outstanding options or grant
      replacement options on an equitable basis as determined by the
      compensation committee; or

    - if there is no such assumption or substitution, all outstanding options
      shall become fully exercisable immediately prior to the acquisition,
      notwithstanding any restrictions or vesting conditions set forth in the
      option agreements.

    The Plan may be amended by the stockholders or by the Board of Directors or
the compensation committee. No amendment may adversely affect the rights of any
participant to whom stock rights have previously been granted without that
participant's consent.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

    STOCK OPTIONS.  Options granted under the Plan may be either ISOs which
satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code or NQSOs
which are not intended to meet such requirements. The federal income tax
treatment for the two types of options differs as follows:

       ISOS. No taxable income is recognized by the optionee at the time of the
       option grant, and no taxable income is generally recognized at the time
       the option is exercised. The optionee will, however, recognize taxable
       income in the year in which the purchased shares are sold or otherwise
       made the subject of a taxable disposition. For federal tax purposes,
       dispositions are divided into two categories: qualifying and
       disqualifying. A qualifying disposition occurs if the sale or other
       disposition is made after the optionee has held the shares for more than
       two years after the option grant date and more than one year after the
       exercise date. If either of these two holding periods is not satisfied,
       then a disqualifying disposition will result.

       Upon a qualifying disposition of the shares, the optionee will recognize
       long-term capital gain in an amount equal to the excess of the amount
       realized upon the sale or other disposition of the purchased shares over
       the exercise price paid for those shares. If there is a disqualifying
       disposition of the shares, then the excess of the fair market value of
       the shares on the exercise date (or the amount realized on a
       disqualifying sale, if less) over the exercise price paid for those
       shares will be taxable as ordinary income to the optionee; any additional
       gain or loss recognized upon the disposition will be taxable as a capital
       gain or loss.

       NQSOS. No taxable income is recognized by an optionee upon the grant of a
       NQSO. The optionee will in general recognize ordinary income, in the year
       in which the option is exercised, equal to the excess of the fair market
       value of the purchased shares on the exercise date over the exercise
       price paid for the shares, and the optionee will be required to satisfy
       the tax withholding requirements applicable to such income.

    Vertex will generally be entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the
amount of ordinary income recognized by the optionee with respect to the
exercise of a NQSO or the disqualifying disposition of an ISO. The deduction
will in general be allowed for the taxable year of Vertex in which such ordinary
income is recognized by the optionee.

    STOCK AWARDS.  Under the Stock Awards feature of the Plan, an eligible
individual may be granted a specified number of shares of Vertex common stock.
However, vested rights to such stock must be made subject to certain
restrictions or conditioned on the attainment of certain performance goals. If
the recipient violates any of the restrictions during the period specified by
the compensation committee or the performance standards fail to be satisfied,
the shares may be forfeited.

    A recipient of a Stock Award will recognize ordinary income equal to the
fair market value of the Vertex common stock at the time the restrictions lapse,
less any amount which the recipient paid for the stock. However, instead of
postponing the income tax consequences of a Stock Award, the recipient may elect
to include the fair market value of the Vertex common stock (less any purchase
price paid) in income in the year the award is granted. This election is made
under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code by filing a written notice with
the Internal Revenue Service. In general, Vertex will be entitled to a deduction
for federal income tax purposes equal to the amount of compensation recognized
by the recipient at such time as the recipient recognizes such income.

    The tax treatment of the subsequent disposition of restricted stock will
depend upon whether the recipient has made a Section 83(b) election to include
the value of the Vertex common stock in income when awarded. If the recipient
makes a Section 83(b) election, any disposition thereafter will result in a
capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the selling price of the
Vertex common stock and the fair market value of the Vertex common stock on the
date of grant. If no Section 83(b) election is made, any disposition will result
in a capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the selling price of
the Vertex common stock and the fair market value of the Vertex common stock on
the date the restrictions lapsed.

OPTION INFORMATION

    Options for 7,500 shares each will be granted under the Plan to all
non-employee directors who continue to serve as directors on June 1, 2002
(currently six persons). The number of additional shares or options, if any,
that will be granted to executive officers and directors under the Plan is
indeterminable at this time, since any such grants are subject to the discretion
of the compensation committee. However, pursuant to employment agreements with
seven Aurora officers that will become effective upon completion of the merger
and are guaranteed by Vertex, upon completion of the merger, Vertex will
consider grants of options to these officers to purchase Vertex common stock at
a level commensurate with similarly situated employees of Vertex. In addition,
Dr. Collinson will become a member of Vertex's board of directors upon the
closing of the merger and will be eligible to receive the annual 7,500 share
non-employee director stock option grant under the Plan after the end of his
employment with Aurora and for so long as he remains a member of Vertex's board
of directors.

    THE VERTEX BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE
AMENDMENT TO THE 1996 STOCK AND OPTION PLAN AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE AFFIRMATIVE
VOTE OF THE HOLDERS OF AT LEAST A MAJORITY OF THE SHARES OF VERTEX COMMON STOCK
PRESENT OR REPRESENTED AND VOTING AT THE VERTEX SPECIAL MEETING IS REQUIRED TO
APPROVE THE AMENDMENT.

future prospects and make informed investment decisions. This joint proxy
statement-prospectus contains such "forward-looking statements" within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These

"plans," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection
with any discussion of future operating or financial performance, or the merger
of Vertex and Aurora, identify forward-looking statements. All forward-looking
statements are management's present expectations of future events and are
subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ materially from those

described in the forward-looking statements. In addition to the risks related to
the businesses of Vertex and Aurora, the factors relating to the merger
discussed under "Risk Factors," among others, could cause actual results to
differ materially from those described on the forward-looking statements.

                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

    THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER ("Agreement") is made and entered into as
of April 29, 2001, by and among: VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED, a
Massachusetts corporation ("Parent"); AHAB ACQUISITION SUB, INC., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"); and AURORA
BIOSCIENCES CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Certain
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in EXHIBIT A.

                                    RECITALS

    A.  Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger (the
"Merger") of Merger Sub into the Company in accordance with this Agreement and
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"). Upon consummation of the
Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent.

    B.  It is intended that the Merger qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"). For financial reporting purposes, it is intended that the Merger be
accounted for as a "pooling of interests."

    C.  The respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have approved this Agreement and the Merger and Parent, acting as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, has approved this Agreement and the Merger.

                                   AGREEMENT

    The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1
                                   THE MERGER

    Section 1.1  MERGER OF MERGER SUB INTO THE COMPANY.  Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the DGCL, at the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease.
Following the Effective Time, the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

    Section 1.2  EFFECT OF THE MERGER.  The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective
Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company
and Merger Sub shall continue with, or vest in, as the case may be, the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and
Merger Sub shall continue to be, or become, as the case may be, the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. As of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall be a direct subsidiary of Parent.

    Section 1.3  CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME.  The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices
of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, PC, One Financial Center,
Boston, Massachusetts, at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be designated by Parent and
the Company (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the fifth
business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or
waived of the conditions set forth in Articles 6, 7 and 8 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions). Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the applicable requirements
of the DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger") shall be duly executed by the Company
and, simultaneously with or as soon as practicable following the Closing, filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Secretary of State").
The Merger shall

                                      A-1

become effective upon the latest of: (a) the date and time of the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State, or (b) such later date and
time as may be specified in the Certificate of Merger with the consent of Parent
(the "Effective Time").

    Section 1.4  CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS; DIRECTORS AND
OFFICERS.:  At the Effective Time:

        (a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall
    be amended to conform to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as
    in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time;

        (b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
    restated to conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
    prior to the Effective Time; and

        (c) the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
    shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation from and after the
    Effective Time, in each case until their successors are appointed and
    qualified or until their resignation or removal. The directors of Merger Sub
    immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
    Surviving Corporation, in each case until their successors are elected or
    until their resignation or removal. If at the Effective Time a vacancy shall
    exist on the Board of Directors or in any office of the Surviving
    Corporation, such vacancy may thereafter be filled in the manner provided by
    applicable Legal Requirements and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

    Section 1.5  CONVERSION OF SECURITIES.

    (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the
Company:

        (i) any shares of Company Common Stock then held in the Company's
    treasury or owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company shall be
    canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
    delivered in exchange therefor;

        (ii) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by Parent, Merger Sub
    or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired
    and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
    exchange therefor;

       (iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and subject to
    Sections 1.5(b), 1.5(c) and 1.5(d), each share of Company Common Stock then
    outstanding shall be converted into the right to receive 0.62 of a share of
    Parent Common Stock; and

        (iv) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
    Merger Sub then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common
    stock of the Surviving Corporation.

The fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock specified in
Section 1.5(a)(iii) (as such fraction may be adjusted in accordance with
Section 1.5(b)) is referred to as the "Exchange Ratio."

    (b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification, recapitalization or other
similar transaction, then the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted.

    (c) To the extent any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option,
risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company or under which the
Company has any rights, then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and
subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition,
and the certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may
accordingly be marked with appropriate legends.

                                      A-2

    (d) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional
shares shall be issued. Any holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise
be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such
holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and, upon surrender of such
holder's Company Stock Certificate(s) (as defined in Section 1.6), be paid in
cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of a share of
Parent Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market on the date the Effective Time
occurs.

    Section 1.6  CLOSING OF THE COMPANY'S TRANSFER BOOKS.  At the Effective
Time: (a) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights as stockholders of the Company (other than the right to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares as
set forth in Section 1.5); and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares
of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously
representing any shares of Company Common Stock (a "Company Stock Certificate")
is presented to the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 1.7) or to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be
canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.7.

    Section 1.7  EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

    (a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent in
the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). Promptly (but in any event within five
(5) business days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent (i) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to this Article 1, and (ii) cash sufficient to make payments
in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5(d). The shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so deposited with the Exchange Agent,
together with any dividends or distributions received by the Exchange Agent with
respect to such shares, are referred to collectively as the "Exchange Fund."

    (b) As soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within five
(5) business days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to the record holders of Company Stock Certificates (i) a letter
of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company
Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company
Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock
Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate
to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of
transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Exchange Agent or Parent, (1) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5 (and cash in lieu of any
fractional share of Parent Common Stock), and (2) the Company Stock Certificate
so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 1.7, each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive shares of Parent Common
Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock) as
contemplated by Section 1.5. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance of any certificate representing Parent Common Stock,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock

                                      A-3

Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such
sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

    (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
shares of Parent Common Stock (or certificates therefor) shall be issued in
exchange for any Company Stock Certificate to any Person who may be an
"affiliate" (as that term is used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of the
Company until such Person shall have delivered to Parent and the Company a duly
executed Affiliate Agreement as contemplated by Section 5.10.

    (d) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive in the
Merger until such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in accordance
with this Section 1.7 (at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to
the effect of applicable escheat or similar laws, to receive all such dividends
and distributions, without interest).

    (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders
of Company Stock Certificates as of the date 180 days after the date on which
the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any
holders of Company Stock Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their
Company Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall thereafter
look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Parent Common Stock,
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock.

    (f) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company
Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or
under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise
have been paid.

    (g) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with
respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, delivered to any public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Legal
Requirement.

    Section 1.8  TAX CONSEQUENCES.  For federal income tax purposes, the Merger
is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of
the Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan
of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of
the United States Treasury Regulations and agree to take whatever other steps
are necessary to give effect to the Merger on such a basis.

    Section 1.9  ACCOUNTING CONSEQUENCES.  For financial reporting purposes, the
Merger is intended to be accounted for as a "pooling of interests."

                                      A-4

    Section 1.10  FURTHER ACTION.  If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and
the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company
and otherwise) to take such action.

                                   ARTICLE 2
                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

time, been a general partner of any general partnership, limited partnership or
other Entity.

necessary power and authority: (i) to conduct its business in the manner in

requires such qualification except where the failure to be so qualified does not
and would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Corporations.

    Section 2.2  CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS.  The Company has made
available to Parent accurate and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws and other charter and organizational documents of the
respective Acquired Corporations, including all amendments thereto and has made

stockholders at the Company Stockholders' Meeting (as defined in Section 5.2),

causing the Company not to be subject to any state takeover law or similar Legal

Company in accordance with its terms, subject to (i) laws of general application
relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors, and (ii) rules of
law governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable

purports to apply to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Except for the dividend of rights to shareholders of record
on April 17, 2001 pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated April 2, 2001 between
the Company and Mellon Investors Services, LLC, as amended on April 29, 2001
(the "Company Rights Agreement"), as of the date hereof, the Company has not

number and the date filed, the title, if applicable, of the registration or
application, and (ii) the names of the jurisdictions covered by the applicable
registration or application. Part 2.11(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule

ongoing royalty or payment obligations in excess of $50,000 per annum with
respect to, Intellectual Property that is licensed or otherwise made available

Acquired Corporations (except for any Intellectual Property that is licensed to
the Acquired Corporations under any third party software license generally
available to the public). The Acquired Corporations have good and valid title to
all of the Acquired Corporation Intellectual Property identified in Parts
2.11(a)(i) and 2.11(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, free and clear of

material to the business of the Acquired Corporations with

                                      A-11

respect to which such other Person has any rights. Except as set forth in
Part 2.11(a)(v) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no Acquired
Corporation Contract (with the exception of end user license agreements in the
form previously made available to Parent) pursuant to which any Person has any
right (whether or not currently exercisable) to use, license or otherwise
exploit any Acquired Corporation Intellectual Property that is material to any
of the Acquired Corporations.

    (b) The Acquired Corporations have taken reasonable measures and precautions
to protect and maintain the confidentiality, secrecy and value of all material
Acquired Corporation Intellectual Property (except Acquired Corporation
Intellectual Property whose value would be unimpaired by disclosure). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as set forth in Part 2.11(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) all current and former employees of the
Acquired Corporations who are or were involved in, or who have contributed to,
the creation or development of any material Acquired Corporation Intellectual
Property have executed and delivered to the Acquired Corporations an agreement
(containing no exceptions to or exclusions from the scope of its coverage with
respect to the assignment of Intellectual Property other than inventions
conceived of or reduced to practice prior to such person's employment with the
Company) that is similar in scope to the form of Proprietary Information and
Inventions Agreement previously made available to Parent, and (ii) all current
and former consultants and independent contractors to the Acquired Corporations
who are or were involved in, or who have contributed to, the creation or
development of any material Acquired Corporation Intellectual Property have
executed and delivered to the Company an agreement (containing no exceptions to
or exclusions from the scope of its coverage with respect to the assignment of
Intellectual Property other than inventions conceived of or reduced to practice
prior to such person's providing services to the Company) that contains terms
substantially similar to those in the form of Proprietary Information and
Inventions Agreement previously made available to Parent. No current or former
employee, officer, director, stockholder, consultant or independent contractor
has any right, claim or interest in or with respect to any Acquired Corporation
Intellectual Property. All Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreements
signed by current and former employees, consultants and independent contractors
remain in full force and effect and have not been superceded by any subsequent
agreements.

    (c) To the knowledge of the Company and except as described on Part 2.11(c)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule: (i) all patents, trademarks, service marks
and copyrights held by any of the Acquired Corporations are valid, enforceable
and subsisting; (ii) none of the Acquired Corporation Intellectual Property and
no Intellectual Property that is currently being developed by any of the
Acquired Corporations (either by itself or with any other Person) infringes,
misappropriates or conflicts with any Intellectual Property owned or used by any
other Person; (iii) none of the products that are or have been designed,
created, developed, assembled, manufactured or sold by any of the Acquired
Corporations is infringing, misappropriating or making any unlawful or
unauthorized use of any Intellectual Property owned or used by any other Person,
and none of the Acquired Corporations has received any notice or other
communication (in writing or otherwise) of any actual or alleged infringement,
misappropriation or unlawful or unauthorized use of, any Intellectual Property
owned or used by any other Person; (iv) no other Person is infringing,
misappropriating or making any unlawful or unauthorized use of, and no
Intellectual Property owned or used by any other Person infringes or conflicts
with, any material Acquired Corporation Intellectual Property.

    (d) The Acquired Corporation Intellectual Property constitutes all the
Intellectual Property necessary to enable the Acquired Corporations to conduct
their business in the manner in which such business is being conducted. Except
as described on Part 2.11(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the
Acquired Corporations has (i) licensed any of the material Acquired Corporation
Intellectual Property to any Person on an exclusive basis, or (ii) entered into
any covenant not to compete or Contract (other than non-exclusive license
agreements) limiting its ability to exploit fully

                                      A-12

any material Acquired Corporation Intellectual Property or to transact business
in any market or geographical area or with any Person.

    (e) Except as set forth in Part 2.11(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
none of the Acquired Corporations has disclosed or delivered to any Person, or
permitted the disclosure or delivery to any escrow agent or other Person, of any
Acquired Corporation Source Code. No event has occurred, and no circumstance or
condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of time) would
reasonably be expected to, result in the disclosure or delivery to any Person of
any Acquired Corporation Source Code. Part 2.11(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule identifies each Contract currently in effect pursuant to which the
Company has deposited or is required to deposit with an escrowholder or any
other Person of any Acquired Corporation Source Code, and further describes
whether the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby would reasonably be expected to result in the
release or disclosure of any Acquired Corporation Source Code.
