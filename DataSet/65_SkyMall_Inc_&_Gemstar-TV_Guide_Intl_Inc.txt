THE MERGER

Background of the Merger

   Both Gemstar and SkyMall regularly evaluate different strategies to improve
their competitive positions and enhance their respective stockholder values,
including opportunities for acquisitions of other companies or their assets,
possible partnerships or alliances, and other significant transactions.

   
In February 2001, at the request of and on behalf of SkyMall, a
representative of Robertson Stephens, Inc. ("Robertson Stephens") approached
Dr. Henry C. Yuen, Gemstar's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board,
regarding a potential relationship between the companies.
A brief telephonic
meeting was held on February 21, 2001 between Dr. Yuen and Mr. Robert M.
Worsley, SkyMall's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board.
Other
SkyMall management team members who participated in this meeting included Mr.
Cary Deacon, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Ms. Christine A.
Aguilera, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel.
During the initial
telephonic meeting, SkyMall discussed with Gemstar various general information
about its business, including its financial information, its key relationships
with airlines, merchant partners and other third parties, and its technology
and business infrastructure.
The parties concluded the initial telephonic
meeting by scheduling an in-person meeting at Gemstar's corporate offices in
Pasadena, California.
A confidentiality agreement between Gemstar and SkyMall
was executed on February 26, 2001.

   
At a board of directors meeting held on February 23, 2001, SkyMall's
management advised the board that SkyMall was engaged in initial discussions
with Gemstar about a possible merger.
SkyMall management discussed with the
board various considerations relative to the potential relationship with
Gemstar.

   
SkyMall and Gemstar met at the offices of Gemstar in Pasadena, California on
March 3, 2001.
Representatives of Gemstar that attended the meeting included
Dr. Yuen, Elsie Leung, Chief Financial Officer and Co-President, Mike Jeffress,
Vice President of Business Development, and Jim Gregg and Eric Jue, both of
Gemstar's Business Development Group.
SkyMall management that participated in
the meeting included Mr. Worsley, Mr. Deacon and Ms. Aguilera.
A representative
from Robertson Stephens, SkyMall's financial advisor, also attended the
meeting.
At this meeting, the SkyMall management team provided more detailed
information to Gemstar about its business and financial model.
Gemstar's
management presented SkyMall with an overview of Gemstar's business.
The
parties also discussed various potential synergies between the companies that
focused primarily on using SkyMall and its assets to support the e-commerce
initiatives of Gemstar's various media properties, especially its interactive
platforms.

   
Following the initial meeting in Pasadena and over the next three weeks,
SkyMall and Gemstar negotiated a letter of intent that outlined the terms of
the merger.
A non-binding letter of intent was signed on March 28, 2001,
subject to the approval of SkyMall's board of directors.
SkyMall's board of
directors held a meeting on March 30, 2001, at which time the term sheet was
discussed at length and approved.
At the meeting, SkyMall's management and
financial and legal advisors were authorized to negotiate a definitive
agreement for the merger consistent with the term sheet.

   
During the next six weeks, Gemstar and SkyMall conducted their respective
due diligence investigations.
Dr. Yuen and Ms. Leung, together with other
Gemstar business analysts and accountants, visited the corporate offices of
SkyMall in Phoenix, Arizona on April 12, 2001.
At the meeting, SkyMall's
management presented Gemstar with detailed information about SkyMall business
operations, its technology infrastructure, and various commerce strategies that
it had developed.
During this period, in addition to the meetings between
Gemstar's and SkyMall's senior management teams, numerous other accountants,
lawyers and Gemstar business representatives visited SkyMall and performed due
diligence investigations.
In addition, during this period, representatives of
Robertson Stephens and SkyMall's senior management conducted various due
diligence investigations of Gemstar and its business.

   
Throughout the period from March 28, 2001 to the signing of the definitive
merger agreement on May 14, 2001, Mr. Worsley and Ms. Aguilera, together with
their legal advisors, held numerous conversations, reviewed

and revised drafts of the merger agreement and related agreements, and
negotiated various terms of the transaction and provisions of the agreements.

This process involved representatives of the law firm of Greenberg Traurig,
LLP, SkyMall's legal counsel, representatives of Baker Botts L.L.P, Gemstar's
legal counsel, and representatives of Robertson Stephens, SkyMall's financial
advisor.

   
At board meetings held on April 13, 2001 and May 4, 2001, management updated
the board on the status of the negotiations with Gemstar.
On May 9, 2001, the
SkyMall board of directors held a telephonic meeting at which they discussed
the status of the negotiations and the likely timing for a definitive agreement
with SkyMall's management and representatives of Greenberg Traurig and
Robertson Stephens.
The board discussed the principal terms of the agreement
and provided guidance to the management team relating to further negotiations.

   
During the afternoon of May 12, 2001, the SkyMall board of directors
reviewed with its senior management and Greenberg Traurig the material terms
and conditions of the merger agreement, the stock option agreement, the voting
agreement, and the other matters contemplated by those agreements.
In addition,
representatives of Robertson Stephens presented to the SkyMall board of
directors certain financial analyses of the proposed transaction.
At this
meeting of the SkyMall board of directors, representatives of Robertson
Stephens delivered to the SkyMall board of directors its oral opinion that as
of that date, and based on the assumptions made, the matters considered and the
limitations on the review undertaken set forth in its opinion, the merger
consideration to be received by holders of SkyMall common stock in the merger
(other than Robert M. Worsley, Christi M. Worsley and/or Robert Merrill Worsley
and Christi Marie Worsley Family Revocable Trust dated July 29, 1998, Gemstar
or any of its affiliates and any dissenting stockholders), as proposed as of
May 12, 2001, was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders.

Robertson Stephens subsequently confirmed its opinion in writing as of May 14,
2001 after the merger agreement was finalized.
The SkyMall board of directors
discussed the information presented by senior management and by its financial
and legal advisors.
After discussion and due consideration, the SkyMall board
of directors unanimously approved, contingent upon satisfactory resolution of
certain additional provisions to be negotiated with Gemstar, the merger
agreement, the stock option agreement, the voting agreement, and the other
matters contemplated by those agreements, unanimously recommended that the
merger agreement be approved by the SkyMall stockholders, and directed that the
merger agreement be submitted to the SkyMall stockholders for approval.

   
After the Nasdaq National Market closed on May 14, 2001, the merger
agreement and related agreements were finalized and signed.
SkyMall issued a
press release to announce the execution of the definitive merger agreement and
the related agreements at that time.


SkyMall's Reasons for the Merger

   The SkyMall board of directors consulted with SkyMall senior management, as
well as its financial advisor and legal counsel, in reaching its decision to
approve the merger agreement.
Among the factors the SkyMall board of directors
considered in its deliberations were the following:

  .  
the board of directors' knowledge of SkyMall's business, operations,
     prospects, projected financial performance, and competitive position and
     current trends in the catalog and specialty retailer industries;

  .  
the financial and other terms and conditions of the merger agreement and
     the fact that they were the product of arms'-length negotiations among
     the parties;

  .  
current financial market conditions and the fact that the cash and stock
     consideration to be received by SkyMall's stockholders in the merger
     represents a premium over the recent trading prices for the shares,
     including a premium over the closing market price of $2.56 per share on
     May 11, 2001;

  .  
the financial analyses of Robertson Stephens presented to the board of
     directors of SkyMall at its special meeting on May 12, 2001 relating to
     the merger and the oral opinion of Robertson Stephens

     delivered to the board of directors of SkyMall on May 12, 2001, and the
     subsequent written opinion of Robertson Stephens delivered to the board
     of directors of SkyMall and dated as of May 14, 2001, as to the
     fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of its opinion
     and subject to the assumptions made, the matters considered and the
     limitations on the review undertaken set forth in its opinion, of the
     merger consideration to be received by holders of shares of SkyMall
     common stock in the merger (other than Robert M. Worsley, Christi M.
     Worsley and/or Robert Merrill Worsley and Christi Marie Worsley
     Revocable Trust dated July 29, 1998, Gemstar or any of its affiliates
     and any dissenting shareholders);

  .  
the results of the process undertaken by SkyMall management and
     Robertson Stephens to identify and solicit indications of interest from
     selected potential acquirors with respect to the purchase of SkyMall,
     including the fact that no potential acquiror or strategic partner had
     expressed an interest in engaging in a business combination or other
     strategic transaction that would likely be on terms as favorable to
     SkyMall's stockholders as those in the merger;

  .  
the fact that Robert M. Worsley and Christi M. Worsley and a trust for
     the benefit of their children (SkyMall's principal stockholders and
     beneficial owners of approximately 30% of the outstanding shares)
     indicated that they were prepared to endorse the merger agreement, and
     that they expressly agreed to vote all of their shares in favor of the
     merger;

  .  
the fact that the merger was not expressly conditioned on the
     availability of financing which, combined with the experience,
     reputation and financial condition of Gemstar, increased the likelihood
     that the proposed merger would be consummated;

  .  
the advice of SkyMall's legal advisors with respect to the terms of the
     merger agreement and the merger;

  .  
the terms of the merger agreement, including the parties'
     representations, warranties and covenants and the conditions to their
     respective obligations;

  .  
the fact that, to the extent required by the fiduciary obligations of
     the board of directors of SkyMall to the stockholders under Nevada law,
     SkyMall may terminate the merger agreement in order to approve a tender
     offer for the shares or other proposed business combination by a third
     party on terms more favorable to SkyMall's stockholders than the merger,
     upon the payment of a $1,940,000 termination fee plus one-half of
     certain Gemstar expenses (up to $500,000);

  .  
the status of SkyMall's relationship with its principal lender and
     prospects for SkyMall to comply with financial covenants in its line of
     credit with that lender;

  .  
the listing status of SkyMall's shares on, and the listing requirements
     of, Nasdaq; and

  .  
the effect of the merger on SkyMall's relationships with its employees
     and customers.

   
The SkyMall board of directors also considered potentially negative factors
relating to the merger, including:

  .  
the risk that the per share value of the consideration to be received in
     the merger could decline significantly from the value immediately prior
     to the announcement of the merger, because the exchange ratio will not
     be adjusted for changes in the market price of SkyMall common stock or
     Gemstar common stock;

  .  
the merger may not be consummated as a result of either party's failure
     to satisfy the conditions to closing;

  .  
there is no provision in the merger agreement for the payment by Gemstar
     of a termination or break-up fee if the merger is not consummated;

  .  
the difficulty and potential for significant dilution in quickly
     obtaining necessary private equity to fund SkyMall's operations if the
     merger is not consummated;

  .  
the risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger might not be
     fully realized;

  .  
the possibility that the merger might not be consummated and the effect
     of a public announcement of the merger or any failure to consummate the
     merger on:

    --SkyMall's operating results and stock price; and

    --SkyMall's ability to attract and retain customers, suppliers, and key
       management, sales, and marketing personnel;

  .  that the termination fee of $1,940,000 required to be paid by SkyMall
     under the merger agreement, and the option granted to Gemstar to acquire
     19.9% of SkyMall's outstanding common stock exercisable by Gemstar under
     certain circumstances, might discourage a third party from seeking to
     acquire SkyMall;

  .  
risks associated with fluctuations in Gemstar's common stock price; and

  .  
other applicable risks described in this proxy statement/prospectus
     under "Risk Factors.
"

   This discussion is not exhaustive of all the factors considered by the
SkyMall board of directors.
In view of the wide variety of factors considered
in connection with the board's evaluation of the merger and the complexity of
these matters, the SkyMall board did not quantify or otherwise assign relative
weights to the factors described above.
Rather, the SkyMall board of directors
made its determination based on the totality of the information it considered.

The members of the board were aware that, as described below under "Interests
of SkyMall's Officers and Directors in the Merger," directors and executive
officers of SkyMall have interests in the merger in addition to, or different
from, their interests as stockholders of SkyMall, and the board considered this
in deciding to recommend the transaction.

   
SkyMall cannot assure you that any of the expected results, synergies,
opportunities, or other benefits described in this section will be achieved as
a result of the merger.


Recommendation of SkyMall's Board of Directors

   After careful consideration, the SkyMall board of directors has unanimously
determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the merger are fair to,
and in the best interests of, SkyMall and its public stockholders.
The SkyMall
board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement, recommended
that the merger agreement be approved by SkyMall's stockholders, and directed
that the merger agreement be submitted to SkyMall's stockholders for approval.

The SkyMall board of directors recommends that SkyMall's stockholders vote
"FOR" the approval of the merger agreement.

   
In considering the recommendation of SkyMall's board of directors relating
to the merger agreement and the merger, you should be aware that some of its
directors and officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or
in addition to, the interests of SkyMall's stockholders generally.
Please see
the section entitled "Interests of SkyMall's Officers and Directors in the
Merger" below for additional information regarding these interests.


Opinion of SkyMall's Financial Advisor

   SkyMall engaged Robertson Stephens, Inc. to render an opinion as to the
fairness of the merger consideration, from a financial point of view, to
holders of shares of SkyMall common stock (other than Robert M. Worsley,
Christi M. Worsley and/or Robert Merrill Worsley and Christi Marie Worsley
Family Revocable Trust dated July 29, 1998, Gemstar or any of its affiliates
and any dissenting stockholders).

   
Robertson Stephens has delivered to the SkyMall board a written opinion
that, as of May 14, 2001 and based on the assumptions made, the matters
considered and the limitations on the review undertaken described in the
opinion, the merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to
the holders of shares of

SkyMall common stock (other than Robert M. Worsley, Christi M. Worsley and/or
Robert Merrill Worsley and Christi Marie Worsley Family Revocable Trust dated
July 29, 1998, Gemstar or any of its affiliates and any dissenting
stockholders).
The merger consideration was determined through negotiations
between the respective managements of SkyMall and Gemstar.
Although Robertson
Stephens did assist the management of SkyMall in these negotiations, it was not
asked to, and did not, recommend to SkyMall that any specific merger
consideration constituted the appropriate consideration for the merger.

Robertson Stephens assisted SkyMall's management in the negotiations leading to
an agreement on principal structural terms of the merger.

   
The full text of the Robertson Stephens opinion, which sets forth, among
other things, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the
review undertaken, is attached as Annex B and is incorporated in this proxy
statement/prospectus by reference.
We urge SkyMall stockholders to read the
Robertson Stephens opinion in its entirety.
The Robertson Stephens opinion was
prepared for the benefit and use of the SkyMall board in connection with its
evaluation of the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to
stockholders of SkyMall as to how they should vote, or take any other action,
with respect to the merger.

   
The Robertson Stephens opinion does not address:

  .  
the relative merits of the merger and the other business strategies that
     the SkyMall board has considered or may be considering; or

  .  
the underlying business decision of the SkyMall board to proceed with
     the merger.

   
The summary of the Robertson Stephens opinion set forth in this proxy
statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of the Robertson Stephens opinion.

   
In connection with the preparation of the Robertson Stephens opinion,
Robertson Stephens, among other things:

  .  reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other
     business and financial information of SkyMall and Gemstar, respectively;

     operating data, including certain financial forecasts and other forward-
     looking information, concerning SkyMall prepared by the management of
     SkyMall;

  .  reviewed with SkyMall and Gemstar certain publicly available estimates
     of research analysts relating to Gemstar;

  .  
held discussions with the respective managements of SkyMall and Gemstar
     concerning the businesses, past and current operations, financial
     condition and future prospects of both SkyMall and Gemstar,
     independently and combined, including discussions with the managements
     of SkyMall and Gemstar concerning their views regarding the strategic
     rationale for the merger;

  .  
reviewed the financial terms and conditions set forth in the draft of
     the merger agreement dated May 11, 2001;

     activity of SkyMall common stock with that of certain other publicly
     traded companies comparable with SkyMall;

  .

     activity of Gemstar common stock with that of certain other publicly
     traded companies comparable with Gemstar;

  .

     the extent publicly available, of other transactions that it deemed
     relevant;

  .  
reviewed the pro forma impact of the merger on Gemstar's earnings before
     interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization per share, cash earnings
     per share and GAAP earnings per share;

  .  
prepared a discounted cash flow analysis of SkyMall;

  .  
participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of
     SkyMall and Gemstar and their financial and legal advisors; and

  .  
made such other studies and inquiries, and reviewed such other data, as
     it deemed relevant.

   
In its review and analysis, and in arriving at its opinion, Robertson
Stephens assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial and other information provided to it (including information furnished
to it orally or otherwise discussed with it by the managements of SkyMall and
Gemstar) or publicly available and neither attempted to verify, nor assumed
responsibility for verifying, any of such information.
Robertson Stephens
relied upon the assurances of SkyMall's and Gemstar's respective managements
that they were not aware of any facts that would make such information
inaccurate or misleading.
Furthermore, Robertson Stephens did not obtain or
make, or assume any responsibility for obtaining or making, any independent
evaluation or appraisal of the properties, assets or liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) of SkyMall or Gemstar, nor was Robertson Stephens furnished with any
such evaluation or appraisal.

   
With respect to the financial forecasts and projections (and the assumptions
and bases therefor) for SkyMall that Robertson Stephens reviewed, Robertson
Stephens assumed that such forecasts and projections:

  .  had been reasonably prepared in good faith on the basis of reasonable
     assumptions;

  .  reflected the best available estimates and judgments of the management
     of SkyMall as to the future financial condition and performance of
     SkyMall; and

  .  
will be realized in the amounts and in the time periods estimated.

   
With respect to Gemstar, Robertson Stephens discussed with management of
Gemstar certain publicly available estimates of research analysts relating to
Gemstar, and Robertson Stephens was advised, and it assumed, that such
estimates represented reasonable estimates and judgments as to the future
financial condition and performance of Gemstar and that such estimates would be
realized in the amounts and in the time periods estimated.

   
In addition, Robertson Stephens assumed that:

  .  
the merger will be consummated upon the terms set forth in the merger
     agreement without material alteration thereof, including, among other
     things, that the merger will be accounted for as a purchase method
     business combination in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
     accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP");

  .  
the merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the
     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and

  .  
the historical financial statements of each of SkyMall and Gemstar
     reviewed by it had been prepared and fairly presented in accordance with
     U.S. GAAP consistently applied.

   
Although developments following the date of the Robertson Stephens opinion
may affect the opinion, Robertson Stephens assumed no obligation to update,
revise or reaffirm its opinion.
The Robertson Stephens opinion is necessarily
based upon market, economic and other conditions as in effect on, and
information made available to Robertson Stephens as of, the date of the
Robertson Stephens opinion.
It should be understood that subsequent
developments may affect the conclusion expressed in the Robertson Stephens
opinion and that Robertson Stephens disclaims any undertaking or obligation to
advise any person of any change in any matter affecting the opinion which may
come or be brought to its attention after the date of the opinion.
The
Robertson Stephens opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point
of view and as of the date thereof,

of the merger consideration to holders of shares of SkyMall common stock (other
than Robert M. Worsley, Christi M. Worsley and/or Robert Merrill Worsley and
Christi Marie Worsley Family Revocable Trust dated July 29, 1998, Gemstar or
any of its affiliates and any dissenting stockholders).
Robertson Stephens does
not express any opinion as to:

  .  
the value of any employee agreement or other arrangement entered into in
     connection with the merger;

  .  
any tax or other consequences that might result from the merger; or

  .  
what the value of Gemstar common stock will be when issued to SkyMall's
     stockholders pursuant to the merger or the price at which the shares of
     Gemstar common stock that are issued pursuant to the merger may be
     traded in the future.

   
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by
Robertson Stephens in connection with rendering the Robertson Stephens opinion,
and reviewed with the board of directors of SkyMall at its meeting on May 12,
2001.
For purposes of the financial analyses reviewed with the board at this
meeting, Robertson Stephens assumed that the merger consideration would be, for
each share of SkyMall common stock held by public stockholders, 0.0375 shares
of Gemstar common stock and $1.50 in cash.
The final merger consideration was
agreed upon when the merger agreement was finalized on May 14, 2001.
The
following summary of financial analyses is not a complete description of all of
the analyses performed by Robertson Stephens.
Certain of the information in
this section is presented in a tabular form.
In order to better understand the
financial analyses performed by Robertson Stephens, these tables must be read
together with the text of each summary.
The Robertson Stephens opinion is based
upon the totality of the various analyses performed by Robertson Stephens and
no particular portion of the analyses has any merit standing alone.

   Comparable Companies Analysis.
Using publicly available information,
Robertson Stephens analyzed, among other things, the trading multiples of
SkyMall and eight selected publicly traded companies in the specialty retailer
and catalog industries.

   
Multiples compared by Robertson Stephens included total enterprise value to
total revenues and total enterprise value to EBITDA.
All multiples were based
on closing stock prices as of May 9, 2001.
Using the ranges of multiples set
forth in the table below that Robertson Stephens derived from multiples for the
public comparable companies, the following SkyMall equity values were implied
based upon SkyMall's 2000 revenue and EBITDA and 2001 and 2002 estimated
revenue and EBITDA:

                                                           
Implied SkyMall
                                         Multiple range      Equity Value

     2001E Revenue......................

         Implied Value per SkyMall
          Share.........................                
$0.50  - $2.29

   Precedent Acquisition Analysis.
Using publicly available information,
Robertson Stephens analyzed the consideration offered, the premiums paid and
the implied transaction value multiples paid in four selected public
acquisition transactions in the specialty retailer and catalog industries.

   
In analyzing these "precedent transactions", Robertson Stephens compared,
among other things, the aggregate value (equity value plus debt less cash) as a
multiple of revenue and EBITDA for the latest 12 months prior to the
transaction.
All multiples for the precedent transactions were based on public
information available at the time of the announcement.
Based on this
information and other publicly available information, the following table
illustrates the implied SkyMall equity valuations derived from applying a range
of multiples

that Robertson Stephens derived from the precedent transactions to SkyMall's
2000 revenue and EBITDA and 2001 estimated revenue and EBITDA:

                                                            Implied SkyMall
                                          Multiple range     Equity Value
                                          --------------
---------------------

     2000 Revenue........................  0.2x - 0.5x   $ 8.9 - $33.6 million
     2001E Revenue.......................  0.2x - 0.5x   $ 9.0 - $33.7 million

     2000 EBITDA.........................  5.2x - 6.2x         Negative
     2001E EBITDA........................  4.7x - 9.0x   $10.4 - $26.7 million
         Reference Range.................                $ 9.4 - $31.3 million
         Implied Value per SkyMall
          Share..........................                $0.59 - $1.95

   No company, business or transaction compared in the comparable companies
analysis or precedent transaction analysis is identical to SkyMall or the
proposed merger.
Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing is
not entirely mathematical; rather it involves complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and
other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading and other
values of the comparable companies, precedent transactions or the business
segment, company or transactions to which they are being compared.

   
Premiums Paid Analysis.
Robertson Stephens also took an average of the
control premium paid in all public transactions for the 12 months ending May 1,
2001 with a transaction value between $10 million and $100 million for which
premium information was available from Securities Data Corporation.
Based on
this information and other publicly available information, the following table
illustrates the implied SkyMall equity values derived from applying a range of

   Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.
Robertson Stephens conducted a discounted
cash flow analysis based on SkyMall's estimated net cash flows for calendar
years 2001 through 2005.
Robertson Stephens applied EBITDA exit multiples
ranging from 3.0x to 5.0x and discount rates ranging from 15.0% to 25.0%.
The
following table summarizes the results of this analysis:

                                                                     Implied

     25.0% Discount Rate................... $19.9 - $26.4 million $1.25 - $1.65
         Reference Range................... $24.3 - $32.2 million $1.52 - $2.01

   Pro Forma Analysis.
Robertson Stephens analyzed certain pro forma effects
resulting from the merger, including, among other things, the impact of the
merger on the projected revenue per share and earnings per share of the
combined company for fiscal years 2000 and 2001.
The following table summarizes
the results of such analysis:

     Fiscal year 2001 estimated EBITDA per share accretion:         1.1%
     Fiscal year 2001 estimated cash earnings per share accretion:  0.8%
     Fiscal year 2001 estimated GAAP earnings per share accretion:  0.2%

     Fiscal year 2002 estimated EBITDA per share accretion:         1.5%
     Fiscal year 2002 estimated cash earnings per share accretion:  1.0%
     Fiscal year 2002 estimated GAAP earnings per share accretion:  2.1%

   The actual results achieved by the combined company may vary from these
estimated pro forma results and the variations may be material.

   
Other Factors and Comparative Analyses.
In rendering its opinion, Robertson
Stephens considered certain other factors and conducted certain other
comparative analyses, including, among other things, a review of:

  .  
the history of trading prices and volume for Gemstar common stock for
     the period from May 8, 2000 to May 9, 2001;

  .  
the history of the exchange ratio of the trading price of SkyMall common
     stock to the trading price of Gemstar common stock for the period from
     May 8, 2000 to May 9, 2001; and

  .  selected published analysts' reports on Gemstar.

   
While the foregoing summary describes certain analyses and factors that
Robertson Stephens deemed material in its presentation to the SkyMall board, it
is not a comprehensive description of all analyses and factors considered by
Robertson Stephens.
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process
that involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analysis and the application of these methods to the
particular circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is not readily
susceptible to summary description.
Robertson Stephens believes that its
analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its
analyses and of the factors considered by it, without considering all analyses
and factors, would create an incomplete view of the evaluation process
underlying the Robertson Stephens opinion.
Several analytical methodologies
were employed and no one method of analysis should be regarded as critical to
the overall conclusion reached by Robertson Stephens.
Each analytical technique
has inherent strengths and weaknesses, and the nature of the available
information may further affect the value of particular techniques.
The
conclusions reached by Robertson Stephens are based on all analyses and factors
taken as a whole and also on application of Robertson Stephens' own experience
and judgment.
Such conclusions may involve significant elements of subjective
judgment and qualitative analysis.
Robertson Stephens therefore gives no
opinion as to the value or merit standing alone of any one or more parts of the
analysis that it performed.
In performing its analyses, Robertson Stephens
considered general economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond the control of SkyMall and Gemstar.
The analyses
performed by Robertson Stephens are not necessarily indicative of actual values
or future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those
suggested by such analyses.
Accordingly, analyses relating to the value of a
business do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which the
business actually may be purchased.
Furthermore, no opinion is being expressed
as to the prices at which shares of SkyMall common stock or Gemstar common
stock may be traded at any future time.

   
The engagement letter between Robertson Stephens and SkyMall provides that
Robertson Stephens is entitled to receive a fee for its services, a substantial
portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the merger.
SkyMall has
also agreed to reimburse Robertson Stephens for certain of its out-of-pocket
expenses, including legal fees, and to indemnify and hold harmless Robertson
Stephens and its affiliates and any director, employee or agent of Robertson
Stephens or any of its affiliates, or any person controlling Robertson Stephens
or its affiliates for certain losses, claims, damages, expenses and liabilities
relating to or arising out of services provided by Robertson Stephens as
financial advisor to SkyMall.
The terms of the fee arrangement with Robertson
Stephens, which SkyMall and Robertson Stephens believe are customary in
transactions of this nature, were negotiated at arm's length between SkyMall
and Robertson Stephens, and the SkyMall board was

aware of such fee arrangements, including the fact that a significant portion
of the fees payable to Robertson Stephens is contingent upon completion of the
merger.
Robertson Stephens maintains a market in the shares of Gemstar common
stock.
In the ordinary course of its business, Robertson Stephens may trade in
SkyMall's securities and Gemstar's securities for its own account and the
account of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position in SkyMall's securities or Gemstar's securities.

   
Robertson Stephens was retained based on Robertson Stephens' experience as a
financial advisor in connection with mergers and acquisitions and in securities
valuations generally, as well as Robertson Stephens' investment banking
relationship and familiarity with SkyMall.

   
Robertson Stephens is an internationally recognized investment banking firm.

As part of its investment banking business, Robertson Stephens is frequently
engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of
securities, private placements and other purposes.


Gemstar's Reasons for the Merger

   Gemstar is seeking to acquire SkyMall because it believes SkyMall will
greatly enhance Gemstar's television-based T-commerce and e-commerce
initiatives, especially in Gemstar's interactive TV strategy.
Gemstar's
principal reasons for the merger are as follows:

  .  
T-commerce and e-commerce are major aspects of Gemstar's interactive TV
     strategy.
With the acquisition of SkyMall, Gemstar will obtain proven
     back-office infrastructure and fulfillment capacities to support and
     accelerate Gemstar's T-commerce and e-commerce platforms.

  .  
SkyMall's "virtual inventory" model, which leverages the fullfillment
     infrastructure of other merchants, represents a proven model on which
     Gemstar can build out and expand its T-commerce and e-commerce
     strategies across its various media properties without incurring
     inventory costs or risks.

  .  
The acquisition of SkyMall will afford Gemstar the opportunity to
     greatly extend the SkyMall brand and leverage its relationships with
     airlines and premium merchants.
Gemstar expects to leverage these
     relationships by extending SkyMall's sales channels to Gemstar's
     portfolio of media properties, including TV Guide Magazine with its
     circulation of approximately 10 million, tvguide.com with over 3 million
     unique monthly visitors and Gemstar's Interactive Program Guides with
     its approximately 12 million and growing viewer base.

  .  
SkyMall's access to over 70% of all domestic airline seats will provide
     Gemstar with a significant, captive audience with an upscale
     demographic--airline passengers.
Gemstar believes that SkyMall will
     provide Gemstar with a unique opportunity to expose this demographic to
     Gemstar's various media products, services and platforms, including its
     Gemstar eBook offerings.


Accounting Treatment

   The merger will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting,
with Gemstar treated as the acquiror.
As a result, Gemstar will record the
assets and liabilities of SkyMall at their estimated fair values and will
record as goodwill the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair
values.
From the date of the merger, the operating results of SkyMall will be
combined with the results of Gemstar for financial accounting purposes.


Certain Financial Projections

   SkyMall does not, as a matter of course, make public forecasts or
projections as to its future financial performance.
However, in connection with
the negotiations between SkyMall and Gemstar, SkyMall made available to Gemstar
and its representatives certain nonpublic information regarding SkyMall's
projected operating performance (the "Projections").
Such information included,
among other things, SkyMall's projections of revenue, gross margin, earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), and net
income for SkyMall's fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003.
Set forth below is a
summary of such Projections.
These Projections should be read together with the
financial statements of SkyMall that are included in SkyMall's Annual Report on
Form 10-K, as amended, and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which can be obtained
from the SEC as described in "Summary--Where You Can Find More Information."

                                             Fiscal 2001 Fiscal 2002 Fiscal 2003
                                             ----------- -----------
-----------
                                                       (in thousands)

     Revenue................................   $91,318    $101,407    $111,093
     Gross margin...........................    39,916      44,797      49,180
     EBITDA.................................     2,950       6,163       8,211
     Net income.............................    (2,525)      2,422       6,644

   The Projections were prepared solely for internal use and not with a view to
public disclosure or compliance with the published guidelines of the SEC or the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants regarding projections and
were not prepared with the assistance of, or reviewed by, independent
accountants.
The Projections are included in this proxy statement/prospectus
solely because such information was furnished to Gemstar by SkyMall.
The
Projections were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and were not audited or reviewed by any independent accounting firm,
nor did any such firm perform any other services with respect thereto.
The
Projections are based on a variety of assumptions relating to the business of
SkyMall, industry performance, general business and economic conditions and
other matters, which are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and
contingencies, many of which are beyond SkyMall's control.
These assumptions
involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic and
competitive conditions, inflation rates and future business conditions.

Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the assumptions made in preparing
the Projections will prove accurate, and actual results may be materially
greater or less than those contained in the Projections.
The inclusion of the
Projections herein should not be regarded as an indication that SkyMall,
Gemstar, or any of their respective affiliates or representatives considered or
consider the Projections to be a reliable prediction of future events, and the
Projections should not be relied upon as such.
None of SkyMall, Gemstar, or any
of their respective affiliates assumes any responsibility for the validity,
reasonableness, accuracy or completeness of the Projections.
None of SkyMall,
Gemstar, or any of their respective affiliates or representatives is under any
obligation to or has any intention to update the Projections at any future
time.


Interests of SkyMall's Officers and Directors in the Merger

   
In considering the recommendation of SkyMall's board regarding the merger,
you should be aware that several members of SkyMall's management and board of
directors may be deemed to have interests in the merger that are different
from, or in addition to, the interests of SkyMall stockholders generally.

SkyMall's board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them,
among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and the merger.

 
Different Merger Consideration to be Paid to Robert M. Worsley

   In connection with the merger, all holders of SkyMall common stock other
than Robert M. Worsley, his wife and a trust for the benefit of their children
will receive a combination of Gemstar common stock and cash.
As requested by
Gemstar, Mr. Worsley will continue as SkyMall's CEO after the merger, and it is
a requirement of Gemstar that all shares of SkyMall common stock beneficially
owned by him be exchanged

solely for Gemstar common stock in the merger.
To encourage Mr. Worsley to
contribute to the long-term goals of the merger, his shares, as well as those
owned by his wife and a trust for the benefit of their children, will be
subject to the five-year lock up agreement with Gemstar described under the
caption "Other Transaction Agreements--Lock-up Agreement."
In order to ensure
that the different consideration being received by the Worsleys is fair to
SkyMall's public stockholders, the additional number of shares of Gemstar stock
they will receive will effectively equal the number of shares of Gemstar stock
they could have purchased with the cash consideration they would have received
had they been treated the same as other SkyMall stockholders in the merger.

However, while SkyMall's public stockholders will generally recognize gain for
income tax purposes on the cash consideration received by them in the merger,
it is not anticipated that the Worsleys will recognize gain with respect to
their receipt of Gemstar common stock in the merger.

 
Stock Options

   SkyMall's directors and executive officers hold options to purchase SkyMall
common stock.
At the effective time of the merger, each option to acquire
SkyMall common stock outstanding under the 1994 Employee Stock Option Plan will
become fully vested and exercisable for 0.03759 of a share of Gemstar common
stock and $1.50 in cash for each underlying share of SkyMall common stock.
See
"The Merger Agreement--Treatment of SkyMall Stock Options."

   Non-employee directors hold options issued under the Non-employee Director
Plan.
These options will be assumed by Gemstar and will convert into the right
to acquire Gemstar common stock and cash in the amount the holder would have
received if such option had been exercised immediately prior to the merger.

   
Immediately after the effective time of the merger, all holders of SkyMall
options will be offered the substitute cash payment described under "The Merger
Agreement--Treatment of SkyMall Stock Options."

 Voting Agreement

   As of the record date for the special meeting, the Worsleys collectively
held approximately 30% of the outstanding shares of SkyMall common stock.
Under
the voting agreement, which is described in more detail under the caption
"Other Transaction Agreements--Voting Agreement", the Worsleys have agreed to
vote all of their shares at the special meeting in favor of the merger
agreement and the merger, and against any inconsistent proposal.

 
Worsley Employment Agreement

   
At the time the merger agreement was signed, SkyMall entered into a new
employment agreement with Mr. Worsley that will become effective at the
effective time of the merger.
The agreement has a term of five years and
provides that Mr. Worsley will continue to serve as the Chief Executive Officer
of SkyMall following the merger at an initial salary of $315,000 per year.
The
agreement also provides that within thirty days after the merger Mr. Worsley
will receive options to acquire 105,000 shares Gemstar common stock at an
exercise price equal to the fair market value of Gemstar common stock on the
grant date, such options to vest in equal annual installments over the five
year period following the date of the merger.
For a description of this
employment agreement, see "Other Agreements--Worsley Employment Agreement.
"

 Release Agreement

   In December 1998, Robert and Christi Worsley exercised an option under an
agreement among the Worsleys, SkyMall and Alan C. and Karen Ashton to purchase
2,386,798 shares of SkyMall common stock.
In connection with the exercise of
the option, the Worsleys agreed to make charitable contributions to the
Ashtons' family foundation over a five-year period commencing in 2003 totaling
approximately $7 million, which contributions have a present value of
approximately $3,500,000 to $5,000,000 using interest rates of 10% to 20% per
annum.
It is a requirement of Gemstar, and a covenant in the merger agreement,
that SkyMall

seek to enter into an agreement with the Ashtons, as long as the amount paid by
SkyMall thereunder does not exceed $5.1 million, which includes a complete
release by the Ashtons of all claims (none of which have been asserted to date)
that the Ashtons may have against SkyMall or any of its affiliates, control
persons, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents or
representatives.
SkyMall intends to enter into an agreement on these terms, and
Gemstar has agreed to fund payment of the amount due thereunder at or
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
The proposed agreement
would result in the release of the Worsleys from their obligation to make
contributions to the Ashtons' foundation.


Indemnification and Insurance

   The merger agreement provides that, following the merger:

  .  
The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation
     in the merger will contain indemnification provisions for directors and
     officers that are substantially identical to such provisions in
     SkyMall's current articles of incorporation for at least six years after
     completion of the merger.

  .  
For a period of three years after the merger is completed, Gemstar is
     required to cause the surviving corporation in the merger to maintain in
     effect SkyMall's existing officers' and directors' liability insurance,
     or to provide equivalent insurance covering acts or omissions occurring
     prior to completion of the merger.
The surviving corporation in the
     merger is not required to pay an annual premium for this insurance in
     excess of two times the last annual premium paid by SkyMall prior to the
     date of the merger agreement, but in such case it will be required to
     purchase as much coverage as possible for that amount.


Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

 Scope of Discussion

   The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger.
It is not a complete analysis of all potential tax
effects relevant to the merger.
This discussion assumes that you hold your
shares of SkyMall common stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section
1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.

   
This discussion is addressed only to SkyMall stockholders who receive both
Gemstar common stock and cash.
This discussion does not address the tax
consequences that may be relevant to a particular SkyMall stockholder subject
to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as dealers in
securities, banks, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, non-U.S.
persons, stockholders who acquired their SkyMall shares pursuant to the
exercise of options or otherwise as compensation, or stockholders who hold
their stock as part of a hedge, constructive sale, wash sale, straddle or
conversion transaction, nor does the discussion address any consequences
arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign jurisdiction.
Moreover,
the tax consequences to holders of SkyMall options and warrants, and the tax
consequences of the release agreement with the Ashtons, are not discussed.
The
discussion is based on and subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, Treasury Regulations thereunder, and administrative rulings and court
decisions as of the date hereof.
All of the foregoing are subject to change,
which may be retroactive, and any such change could affect the continuing
validity of this discussion.
We urge you to consult your own tax advisors
concerning the U.S. federal, state and local and foreign tax consequences of
the merger to you.


Tax Opinions

   
It is a non-waivable condition of the merger that SkyMall receive an opinion
at closing from Greenberg Traurig, LLP, counsel to SkyMall, that:

  .  
the merger will qualify for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
     reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue
     Code; and

  .  
each of Gemstar, GSky Acquisition Sub and SkyMall will be a party to the
     reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue
     Code.

   
It is a non-waivable condition of the merger that Gemstar receive an opinion
at closing from Baker Botts L.L.P., counsel to Gemstar, that:

  .  
the merger will qualify for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
     reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue
     Code; and

  .  
each of Gemstar, GSky Acquisition Sub and SkyMall will be a party to the
     reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue
     Code.

   
Opinions of counsel are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the
courts.
There is no assurance that the IRS will not successfully challenge the
conclusions expressed in such opinions.
In rendering their opinions, respective
counsel for the companies will rely upon factual representations made by
Gemstar, GSky Acquisition Sub, and SkyMall in the merger agreement and related
documents and in certificates to be executed in connection with the merger.
Any
inaccuracy or change in the representations could adversely affect the
conclusions reached in the opinions and the tax discussion below.
The opinions
will be subject to the qualifications and assumptions set forth above and to
the further assumption that the consideration per share received by dissenting
shareholders, if any, will have a value which is not materially different from
the value of the consideration per share received by the public shareholders.

   
Assuming that the merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code, the following discussion summarizes
the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to the SkyMall
stockholders.
SkyMall has received the opinion of Greenberg Traurig, LLP, and
Gemstar has received the opinion of Baker Botts L.L.P. to the effect that the
discussion under this section "-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
of the Merger" is accurate in all material respects.
These opinions are subject
to the qualifications and assumptions set forth above and to the further
assumption that the merger will qualify as a reorganization as described above.

 
Tax Consequences to SkyMall Stockholders Receiving Gemstar Common Stock and
 Cash

   If you receive both Gemstar common stock and cash in the merger, including
any cash received instead of fractional shares of Gemstar common stock, you
will not recognize any loss on the exchange.
In general, you will recognize
gain equal to the lesser of either the amount of cash received or the gain
realized.
The gain realized will be the excess, if any, of:

  .  
the sum of:

    .  
the fair market value, as of the date of the merger, of the Gemstar
       common stock you receive in the merger; and

    .  
the amount of cash you receive in the merger; over

  .  
your adjusted tax basis in your SkyMall common stock.

   
SkyMall stockholders must calculate gain or loss separately for each
identifiable block of shares of SkyMall common stock exchanged, and the loss
recognized on one block of stock may not be offset against gain recognized on
another block of stock.

   
Any gain recognized by a SkyMall stockholder will generally be treated as
capital gain, unless, as discussed below, the receipt of the cash has the
effect of the distribution of a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

In such case, the gain recognized by the stockholder will be treated as
ordinary dividend income to the extent of the stockholder's ratable share of
the accumulated earnings and profits of SkyMall.
Any gain that is treated as
capital gain will be long-term capital gain if the holding period for shares of
SkyMall common stock that are surrendered in the exchange is more than one year
as of the date of the merger.

   
For purposes of determining whether the cash received has the effect of a
distribution of a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a SkyMall
stockholder is treated as if the stockholder first exchanged all of the
stockholder's shares of SkyMall common stock solely for Gemstar common stock
and then Gemstar immediately redeemed a portion of the Gemstar common stock in
exchange for the cash the stockholder actually received.
This is called a
"deemed redemption."
Under this analysis, in general, if the receipt of cash by
the stockholder in the deemed redemption results in a "substantially
disproportionate" reduction in the stockholder's voting stock interest in
Gemstar or is "not essentially equivalent to a dividend," the receipt of the
cash will not have the effect of the distribution of a dividend.

   
The deemed redemption will be "substantially disproportionate," and,
therefore, will not have the effect of a distribution of a dividend with
respect to a SkyMall stockholder if the percentage of the outstanding Gemstar
common stock that is actually and constructively owned by the stockholder
immediately after the deemed redemption is less than 80% of the percentage of
the outstanding Gemstar common stock that is considered to be actually and
constructively owned by the stockholder immediately before the deemed
redemption.
The deemed redemption will not be "essentially equivalent to a
dividend," and, therefore, will not have the effect of a distribution of a
dividend with respect to a SkyMall stockholder if it results in a "meaningful
reduction" in the stockholder's proportionate interest in Gemstar.
If a
stockholder that is considered to have a relatively minimal stock interest in
Gemstar and no right to exercise control over corporate affairs suffers a
reduction in the stockholder's proportionate interest in Gemstar, the
stockholder should be regarded as having suffered a meaningful reduction of his
or her interest in Gemstar.
For example, the Internal Revenue Service has held
in a published ruling that, in the case of a less than 1% stockholder who does
not have management control over the corporation, any reduction in the
stockholder's proportionate interest will constitute a "meaningful reduction.
"

   For purposes of this deemed redemption analysis, certain attribution rules
apply in determining a SkyMall stockholder's ownership interest in Gemstar
immediately after the acquisition, but before the deemed redemption, and after
the deemed redemption.
Under those rules, a SkyMall stockholder is deemed to
own stock held by certain family members, estates and trusts of which the
stockholder is a beneficiary, a partnership in which the stockholder is a
partner, and a corporation in which the stockholder is a direct or indirect 50%
stockholder, as well as stock subject to options that are held by the
stockholder or the entities.
In addition, if the SkyMall stockholder is itself
an entity, Gemstar stock which is owned, actually or constructively, by owners
or beneficiaries of the entity may be attributed "downward" to the entity.

Because these constructive ownership rules are complex, each SkyMall
stockholder who believes that he or she may be subject to these rules should
consult his or her tax advisor.

   
The aggregate tax basis of the Gemstar common stock received by a SkyMall
stockholder will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the shares SkyMall
common stock surrendered in the exchange, decreased by the amount of cash
received, and increased by the amount of gain recognized, including any portion
of the gain that is treated as a dividend.
The holding period of the Gemstar
common stock received will include the holding period of the shares of SkyMall
common stock surrendered in exchange therefor.
If a SkyMall stockholder has
differing tax bases and/or holding periods with respect to the stockholder's
shares of SkyMall common stock that the stockholder surrenders in the exchange,
the stockholder should consult a tax advisor in order to identify the
particular tax bases and/or holding periods of the particular shares of Gemstar
common stock received in the exchange.

 
Consequences of Failure to Qualify as a Reorganization

   If the merger did not qualify as a reorganization under Section 368 of the
Internal Revenue Code:

  .  
SkyMall would recognize gain on the merger which would, in general, be
     equal to the excess of:

  .  
the sum of the fair market value on the merger date of the Gemstar
     common stock received by SkyMall stockholders in the merger, the total
     amount of cash received by SkyMall stockholders in the merger, and the
     amount of liabilities of SkyMall assumed by the surviving corporation in
     the merger; over

    .  
SkyMall's basis in its assets; and

  .  
SkyMall stockholders would recognize capital gain or loss on the merger
     in an amount equal to the difference between the sum of the cash and the
     fair market value, as of the date of the merger, of the Gemstar common
     stock received in the merger and the stockholder's basis in the SkyMall
     common stock surrendered.

 
Backup Withholding

   Payments of cash to a SkyMall stockholder surrendering shares of SkyMall
common stock in the merger generally will be subject to information reporting
to the IRS.
In addition, they generally will be subject to backup withholding
at a rate of 31% of the cash payable to the SkyMall stockholder, unless the
SkyMall stockholder furnishes their taxpayer identification number in the
manner prescribed in applicable Treasury regulations, certifies that the number
is correct, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding, and
meets other specified conditions.
Appropriate documentation for this purpose
will be provided to SkyMall stockholders with the transmittal letter that will
be sent to them by the exchange agent.
Any amounts withheld from payments to a
stockholder under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or
credit against the SkyMall stockholder's U.S. federal income tax liability,
provided the required information is furnished to the IRS.

   
THE ABOVE DISCUSSION MAY NOT APPLY TO CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF STOCKHOLDERS
SUBJECT TO SPECIAL TREATMENT UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.
STOCKHOLDERS ARE
URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS TO DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM, INCLUDING ANY FEDERAL, STATE OR OTHER TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER.


Delisting and Deregistration of SkyMall Common Stock

   SkyMall common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq National Market under
the symbol "SKYM."
Upon the completion of the acquisition, SkyMall common stock
will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Securities Exchange
Act.


Regulatory Matters

   At this time we do not expect the merger to be subject to the requirements
of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and
the rules promulgated under that Act by the Federal Trade Commission, which
prevent some transactions from being completed until required information and
materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of
Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the waiting periods are
terminated or expire.


Restrictions on Sales by Affiliates of SkyMall

   The shares of Gemstar common stock that will be issued in the merger will be
registered under the Securities Act and will be freely transferable under the
Securities Act, except for shares of Gemstar common stock issued to any person
who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of SkyMall at the time of the special
meeting.


Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that
control, are controlled by or are under common control with, SkyMall and may
include some of its officers and directors, as well as its principal
stockholders.
Any person deemed to be an affiliate of SkyMall at the time of
the special meeting may not sell their shares of Gemstar common stock acquired
in the merger except pursuant to:

  .  
an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering
     the resale of those shares;

  .  
an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act;
     or

  .  
any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

   
Gemstar's registration statement, of which this proxy statement/prospectus
forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of Gemstar common stock to be
received by affiliates of SkyMall in the merger.

                              
THE MERGER AGREEMENT

   The following description summarizes the material provisions of the merger
agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement/prospectus and incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus.
We urge you to read the complete merger agreement for the
precise terms of the merger agreement and other information that may be
important to you.


Structure of Merger

   At the time the merger becomes effective SkyMall will merge with and into
GSky Acquisition Sub, with GSky Acquisition Sub as the surviving corporation.

GSky Acquisition Sub will change its name to "SkyMall, Inc.", with the result
that SkyMall will then be a wholly owned subsidiary of Gemstar.


Merger Consideration

   In the merger, SkyMall stockholders other than the Worsleys will receive,
for each share of SkyMall common stock held, 0.03759 of a share of Gemstar
common stock and $1.50 in cash, subject to adjustment for tax purposes as
described below.
The Worsleys will receive, for each share of SkyMall stock
held by them, 0.03759 of a share of Gemstar common stock and a fraction of a
share of Gemstar stock determined by dividing $1.50 by the volume weighted
average sale price of a share of Gemstar common stock on the closing date of
the merger.
The number of shares of Gemstar common stock stockholders will
receive in the merger will be appropriately adjusted for any stock splits,
combinations and other similar events that occur between the date of the merger
agreement and the completion of the merger.

   
Gemstar will not issue fractional shares of Gemstar common stock in the
merger.
Instead, each SkyMall stockholder otherwise entitled to a fractional
share will receive cash, without interest, in an amount determined by
multiplying the fraction of a share of Gemstar common stock by $39.90.

   
The merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code.
To ensure that the merger will so qualify, the
merger agreement provides that the Gemstar common stock to be issued in the
merger must constitute at least 45% of the overall value of the consideration
paid by Gemstar for SkyMall common stock in connection with the merger.
Hence,
if the market value of the Gemstar common stock to be issued in the merger does
not, as of the date the merger is effected, represent at least 45% of the value
of the merger consideration as of that date, then the amount of Gemstar stock
to be issued to SkyMall stockholders will be increased, and the cash to be paid
to those stockholders will be decreased, until the 45% requirement is achieved.


Effective Time of the Merger

   The merger will become effective when (1) a certificate of merger is filed
with the Delaware Secretary of State or articles of merger are filed with the
Nevada Secretary of State, whichever is later, or (2) at a later time as may be
specified in the certificate of merger and articles of merger filed by Gemstar
and SkyMall.
The closing date of the merger will occur as soon as practicable
after the last of the conditions in the merger agreement has been satisfied or
waived.


Conversion of Shares in the Merger

   At the effective time of the merger, by virtue of the merger and without any
additional action on the part of SkyMall stockholders or Gemstar:

  .  
each share of outstanding common stock of GSky Acquisition Sub will
     remain outstanding and continue as one share of common stock of the
     surviving corporation; and

  .  
each share of SkyMall common stock held by SkyMall, Gemstar or GSky
     Acquisition Sub will be cancelled and retired without any conversion or
     the payment of any consideration.


Exchange Agent; Procedures for Exchange of Certificates

   Gemstar will appoint American Stock Transfer & Trust Company to serve as
exchange agent and will deliver to the exchange agent cash and certificates
representing shares of Gemstar common stock in an amount sufficient to pay the
cash and deliver the shares to be issued in the merger as well as cash in
sufficient amount for payment in lieu of fractional shares.
The exchange agent
will deliver to SkyMall stockholders cash and shares of Gemstar common stock
(including all rights attached to such shares) and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares.

   
The exchange agent will mail to each SkyMall stockholder a letter of
transmittal and instructions to surrender his or her certificates representing
shares of SkyMall stock in exchange for cash, certificates representing
Gemstar common stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares.
After a
SkyMall stockholder surrenders his or her SkyMall stock certificate along with
a duly executed and properly completed letter of transmittal and other
required documents, the exchange agent will deliver to such stockholder the
following:

  .  
the cash portion of the merger consideration to which such stockholder
     is entitled;

  .  
a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Gemstar common
     stock to which such stockholder is entitled;

  .  
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Gemstar common stock to which
     such stockholder would otherwise be entitled; and

  .  
the amount of any dividends or other distributions declared on Gemstar
     common stock with a record date on or after the completion of the merger
     and a payment date before the surrender of the certificates representing
     shares of SkyMall common stock.


SkyMall stockholders should not forward their SkyMall stock certificates with
the enclosed proxy card nor should they forward their SkyMall stock
certificates to the exchange agent until they have received the packet of
information, including the letter of transmittal, described above.


Treatment of SkyMall Stock Options in the Merger

   Options to acquire SkyMall common stock issued under the SkyMall 1994
Employee Stock Option Plan will become fully vested at the effective time of
the merger and will terminate 30 days after the effective time of the merger.

Options under the 1994 Employee Stock Option Plan that are exercised after the
effective time but within 30 days shall be exercisable for 0.03759 of a share
of Gemstar common stock and $1.50 in cash for each share of SkyMall common
stock subject to such option.

   
Stock options issued by SkyMall apart from the 1994 Employee Stock Option
Plan (including those issued to SkyMall's directors under the Non-Employee
Director Option Plan ) will be assumed by Gemstar at the effective time of the
merger.
Each such option will be exercisable for the amount of cash and
Gemstar common stock that the holder would have received if the option had
been exercised immediately before the merger.

   
Immediately after the effective time of the merger, Gemstar shall offer to
all SkyMall option holders the right to receive a substitute cash payment
instead of the combination of Gemstar common stock and cash received by
SkyMall stockholders in the merger.
The substitute cash payment will be the
product of (1) the number of shares of SkyMall common stock underlying the
option immediately prior to the merger and (2) the excess, if any, of:

     (A) the sum of

       (x) $1.50, plus

       (y) 0.03759 multiplied by the volume weighted average trading price
    of Gemstar common stock at the closing date, minus

     (B) the exercise price per share of the option immediately prior to the
  merger.


Treatment of Warrants in the Merger

   Each warrant to acquire SkyMall common stock outstanding at the effective
time of the merger will be converted to a warrant to acquire the cash and
Gemstar common stock that the holder of such warrant would have received if
the warrant had been exercised for shares of SkyMall common stock immediately
prior to the merger.
The terms and conditions of warrants for SkyMall common
stock shall remain substantially the same after the merger as before the
merger.

constitute a Material Adverse Effect.


Conduct of SkyMall's Business Pending the Merger

   SkyMall agreed in the merger agreement that, except as specifically
contemplated by the merger agreement and the other transaction documents, until
the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, SkyMall and its

business consistent with past practices and use their reasonable best efforts
to:

  .  
preserve intact their present business organizations;

  .  
keep available the services of their present officers and key employees;
     and

  .  
preserve their relationships with material customers, suppliers,
     licensors, licensees and others having business dealings with them.

   
SkyMall also agreed that, except as specifically contemplated or expressly
permitted by the merger agreement and the other transaction documents, until
the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, neither SkyMall
nor its subsidiaries will take any of the following actions, unless Gemstar
consents in writing:

  .  
issue, deliver, sell, grant, pledge or transfer or agree to issue,
     deliver, sell, grant, pledge or transfer any of its securities (other
     than the issuance of SkyMall common stock pursuant to warrants or

Other Covenants

   Stockholder Meeting.
SkyMall will call and hold a special meeting of
stockholders to approve the merger and the merger agreement.

   
Rights.
SkyMall will redeem all rights outstanding under its rights plan or
otherwise terminate or render ineffective such rights with respect to the
merger agreement, the merger, the voting agreement and the option agreement or
any exercise thereof.

   
Notice.
Each party will promptly notify the other in writing of:

  .  
the discovery by such party of any circumstance that would render untrue
     in any material respect any representation or warranty by such party in
     the merger agreement;

  .  
any material breach of any covenant or obligation of such party in the
     merger agreement;

  .  
any circumstance that would make the timely satisfaction of any
     condition to the merger unlikely; and

  .  
the occurrence of any circumstance that has had or is likely to have a
     material adverse effect on such party.

   
Contract Consents.
SkyMall will use commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver all notices required to be delivered, and obtain all consents required
to be obtained, in connection with the merger under the terms of any material
contract to which SkyMall is a party.

   
Additional Insurance.
At any time prior to the stockholders meeting Gemstar
may require SkyMall to obtain additional insurance covering SkyMall and its
directors and officers in respect of any litigation pending against SkyMall.

Gemstar must specify the litigation for which such insurance must be obtained
and the amount of the policy, provided that the policy amount will not exceed
$10 million and the premium will not exceed $200,000.
Gemstar will promptly
reimburse SkyMall for the cost of such additional insurance if the merger
agreement is terminated.

   
Release Agreement.
Gemstar has consented to SkyMall entering into an
agreement with Alan and Karen Ashton, as long as the total amount payable by
SkyMall under the agreement does not exceed $5.1 million, the agreement
contains a full and unconditional release by the Ashtons of any claims against
SkyMall (none of which have been asserted to date), and the form and substance
of the agreement is otherwise acceptable to Gemstar.
At or immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger, Gemstar will advance to SkyMall the funds
necessary to pay the amount owed by SkyMall to the Ashtons under the agreement.

   
Company Employees.
If any person that has been, as of the effective time of
the merger, continuously employed by SkyMall as a full time employee for at
least a year is terminated without cause within a year after the merger, then
the surviving corporation in the merger will pay to such employee a cash
severance payment in an amount equal to the base compensation of such employee
at the time of termination for the greater of (1) two weeks for each year of
continuous service as a full time employee or (2) 90 days.

   
Access to Information; Confidentiality.
SkyMall will, and will cause its
subsidiaries to, afford to Gemstar and its officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisors and other representatives, reasonable access to all
of their properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records.

Gemstar will keep such information confidential in accordance with the
confidentiality agreement entered into between Gemstar and SkyMall in
connection with the negotiation of the merger agreement.

   
Filings; Other Actions.
Before we can complete the merger we must satisfy
all regulatory requirements and obtain the approval of all regulatory agencies
having jurisdiction over the merger.
We have agreed to use all reasonable
efforts to make all necessary filings and obtain all necessary government
approvals and to take all actions necessary to complete the merger.
At present,
we do not believe any regulatory approvals or filings are required other than
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission the registration statement
on Form

S-4 of which this proxy statement/prospectus will be a part.
However, if the
market price of Gemstar common stock rises sufficiently to cause the total
value of the merger consideration to exceed $50 million, then we may be
required to make filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976.


Indemnification of SkyMall Directors and Officers

   The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation
shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation from
liability substantially identical to those currently set forth in the SkyMall
articles of incorporation and bylaws, and those provisions are not to be
amended for a period of six years from the effective time of the merger in any
manner that would affect the rights of individuals who prior to the merger were
directors, officers, employees or agents of SkyMall, unless required by law.

   
Gemstar will cause the surviving corporation to cause to be maintained in
effect the current policy of directors and officers insurance maintained by
SkyMall for events occurring prior to the merger for three years, provided that
the surviving corporation will not be required to expend more than 200% of the
current annual premiums paid by SkyMall for such insurance, but in such case
will purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount.


Termination

   The merger agreement and the transactions contemplated in the merger
agreement may be terminated at any time prior to completing the merger, whether
before or after approval of the merger agreement and the merger by SkyMall's
stockholders, in the following situations:

  .  by mutual consent of Gemstar and SkyMall;

  .  
by either Gemstar or SkyMall if:

    (1) the merger has not occurred by September 30, 2001; however, this
        right to terminate is not available to any party whose action or
        failure to act has resulted in the merger not occurring by
        September 30, 2001 and constitutes a breach of the merger
        agreement;

    (2) after May 14, 2001 but before the special meeting of SkyMall
        stockholders if SkyMall has not received, and no public
        announcement has been made, of a Takeover Proposal, and the special
        meeting of SkyMall stockholders has been held but the merger has
        not been approved by the SkyMall stockholders; or

    (3) any court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority
        has issued an injunction or order permanently prohibiting the
        merger and the injunction or order has become final and
        nonappealable; however, this right to terminate is not available to
        any party that failed to use commercially reasonable efforts to
        lift or rescind such injunction or order before it became
        permanent.

  .  
by Gemstar if:

    (1) SkyMall breaches any of its representations, warranties or
        covenants in the merger agreement which (i) would result in a
        failure of a condition to the merger agreement and (ii) cannot or
        has not been cured within 30 days after giving written notice to
        SkyMall or, if earlier, September 30, 2001;

    (2) after May 14, 2001, SkyMall receives, or a public announcement is
        made, of a Takeover Proposal and any of the following occur:

    .  
SkyMall does not submit the merger to its stockholders at a special
       meeting;

    .  
the board of directors of SkyMall withholds, withdraws or changes in
       any manner adverse to Gemstar its recommendation to SkyMall
       stockholders to approve the merger; or

    .  
the special meeting of SkyMall stockholders is held and the merger
       agreement and merger are not adopted and approved.

  .  
by SkyMall if:

    (1) Gemstar breaches any of its representations, warranties or
        covenants in the merger agreement which (i) would result in a
        failure of a condition to the merger agreement and (ii) cannot or
        has not been cured within 30 days after giving written notice to
        Gemstar, or, if earlier by September 30, 2001; or

    (2) after May 14, 2001, SkyMall receives, or a public announcement is
        made, of a Takeover Proposal and (i) the special meeting of SkyMall
        stockholders is held and the merger agreement and the merger have
        not been approved by the SkyMall stockholders, and (ii) SkyMall has
        paid a termination fee and expense reimbursement to Gemstar.


No Solicitation; Termination Fee

   SkyMall has agreed that, except as described below, during the period from
May 14, 2001 until completion of the merger or termination of the merger
agreement, it will not, and will use its best efforts to ensure that
its officers, directors, employees and other agents or affiliates do not,
directly or indirectly, take any of the following actions:

  .  
initiate, solicit or encourage the submission of any Takeover Proposal;

  .  
enter into an agreement in connection with a Takeover Proposal;

  .  
facilitate any inquiries or proposals reasonably expected to lead to a
     Takeover Proposal, or amend, waive or release any standstill agreement.

   
SkyMall will immediately notify Gemstar of any request for information or of
any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or which could reasonably
lead to a Takeover Proposal.
SkyMall will promptly provide Gemstar with the
material terms of any such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the
identity of the person making such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry.

SkyMall will keep Gemstar informed of the status and details of any such
request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry.
Gemstar will be obligated to keep all
such information confidential.

   
However, if, prior to approval of the merger and the merger agreement by
SkyMall's stockholders, SkyMall receives an unsolicited Takeover Proposal which
the SkyMall board of directors reasonably determines in good faith (after
consulting with its independent financial advisor) is a Superior Proposal, then
SkyMall may participate in discussions with and provide information to the
proposing party, as long as SkyMall enters into a non-disclosure agreement with
such party on terms that are at least as restrictive as those contained in the
confidentiality agreement it entered into with Gemstar in connection with the
negotiation of the merger agreement.

   
If Gemstar terminates the merger agreement because a Takeover Proposal has
been made or announced, and (a) SkyMall fails to submit the merger agreement to
its stockholders for approval, (b) SkyMall's board withdraws or amends its
recommendation of the merger agreement in a manner adverse to Gemstar or (c)
the SkyMall stockholders fail to approve the merger at a special meeting called
for that purpose, then SkyMall must pay to Gemstar a termination fee of
$1,940,000 and reimburse those expenses described in "--Expenses" below.

   
"Takeover Proposal" means any proposal other than the merger described in
this proxy statement/prospectus regarding any of the following transactions:

     (1) a merger, consolidation, purchase of 20% or more of SkyMall's assets
  (or assets which generated 20% or more of SkyMall's revenue or cash flow
  from operations), or other business combination or similar transaction with
  SkyMall;

     (2) the acquisition from SkyMall of any equity interest in or voting
  securities of SkyMall which constitute 20% or more of the applicable class
  of such equity interests or voting securities;

     (3) any tender or exchange offer which, if completed, would result in
  the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the SkyMall
  common stock outstanding at that time;

     (4) any public announcement of an intention to do any of the foregoing
  or any agreement or engagement to do any of the foregoing.

   
"Superior Proposal" means a Takeover Proposal which:

     (1) would result in SkyMall stockholders receiving consideration per
  share of SkyMall common stock (valuing any non-cash consideration at its
  fair market value as determined in good faith by the SkyMall board of
  directors after consultation with its independent financial advisors) that
  is superior from a financial point of view to the consideration per share
  to be received in the merger;

     (2) is not subject to a financing contingency; and

     (3) is made by a person which the board of directors of SkyMall
  reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with its
  independent financial advisors) has the financial resources to complete the
  transaction.

Amendment, Extension and Waiver

   The parties may amend the merger agreement at any time before or after the
merger agreement and the merger are approved by SkyMall's stockholders;
provided that the merger agreement may not be amended in a manner that requires
stockholder approval after SkyMall stockholder approval has been obtained
without further approval from the SkyMall stockholders.

   
At any time before the merger is completed, any party may, by written
instrument signed by the waiving party, extend the time for performance of the
obligations of any other party to the merger agreement, waive inaccuracies in
representations and warranties of any other party contained in the merger
agreement, waive compliance by any other party with any agreements or covenants
in the merger agreement, or waive any condition to the waiving party's
obligation to complete the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement or
to any of the waiving party's other obligations under the merger agreement
(except that neither party may waive the condition that its counsel deliver an
opinion that the merger will qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368 of
the Internal Revenue Code).


Expenses

   Except as described below, whether or not the merger is completed, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be paid by the party
incurring the cost or expense.

   
If Gemstar terminates the merger agreement following a Takeover Proposal or
because of a breach by SkyMall of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants in the merger agreement, then SkyMall must reimburse Gemstar for one-
half of the expenses incurred by Gemstar in connection with printing this proxy
statement/prospectus and the registration statement of which it is a part and
one-half of the filing fee incurred in connection with any required filing
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Anti-Trust Improvements Act of 1976 (except that
the total amount that SkyMall would have to pay for such reimbursable expenses
will not exceed $500,000).

                                
OTHER AGREEMENTS

Voting Agreement

   As an inducement for it to enter into the merger agreement, Gemstar required
Robert M. Worsley, his spouse and a trust for the benefit of their children to
enter into a voting agreement.
Mr. Worsley is the Chief Executive Officer of
SkyMall.

   
In the voting agreement, the Worsleys have agreed with Gemstar to vote their
shares of SkyMall common stock in favor of the merger agreement and the merger
and against any inconsistent proposals or transactions involving SkyMall.

   
As of the record date for the special meeting, the Worsleys beneficially
owned 4,830,280 shares of SkyMall common stock, representing approximately 30%
of the total number of votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting by
holders of SkyMall common stock.

   
The Worsleys have agreed not to sell, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose
of the shares of SkyMall common stock directly or indirectly owned by them and
covered by the voting agreement.
The Worsleys have also granted to Gemstar an
irrevocable proxy with respect to their shares for the purpose of voting those
shares in accordance with the covenant of the Worsleys described above.
The
voting agreement will terminate upon the earlier of the date we complete the
merger or termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms.
The
voting agreement will be filed as an exhibit to Gemstar's registration
statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus will form a part.


Lock-up Agreement

   
As an inducement to Gemstar to enter into the merger agreement, the Worsleys
have entered into a five-year lock-up agreement with Gemstar covering all
shares of Gemstar common stock to be received by the Worsleys in the merger.

The Worsleys have agreed not to sell, pledge, make any short sale or enter into
a derivative transaction involving the shares of Gemstar common stock they
receive in the merger, without the prior written consent of Gemstar, for so
long as they are subject to the lock-up agreement.

   
The lock-up agreement provides for one-fifth of the total number of shares
subject to the lock-up agreement to be released on each anniversary of the
effective time of the merger.
The lock-up agreement will terminate at the end
of five years or, if earlier, on the first anniversary of Mr. Worsley no longer
being employed by SkyMall or Gemstar.
Mr. Worsley may, for tax and estate
planning purposes, monetize up to one-half of the number of shares initially
subject to the lock-up agreement.


Option Agreement

   
In order to induce Gemstar and GSky Acquisition Sub to enter into the merger
agreement, SkyMall granted Gemstar an option to purchase up to 3,929,992 shares
of SkyMall common stock for $3.00 per share in cash, for a total amount of up
to $11,789,976.
If the option were exercised in full, Gemstar would own 19.9%
of the total issued and outstanding common stock of SkyMall, based on the total
number of shares outstanding as of April 30, 2001.

   
The option may be exercised if any of the following occur:

  .  
prior to termination of the merger agreement, a party other than Gemstar
     has made a Takeover Proposal (as defined above under "The Merger
     Agreement--No Solicitation; Termination Fee") or publicly announced an
     intention to do so, and then the SkyMall stockholder meeting is held but
     stockholder approval of the merger and the merger agreement is not
     obtained;

  .  
Gemstar terminates the merger agreement after SkyMall receives, or
     public announcement is made of, a Takeover Proposal and either (i)
     
SkyMall fails to submit the merger agreement and the merger to a

     vote of the SkyMall stockholders, (ii) SkyMall's board of directors
     withholds, withdraws or modifies in any manner adverse to Gemstar its
     recommendation to its stockholders to approve the merger and the merger
     agreement, or (iii) the SkyMall stockholders meeting is held but
     stockholder approval of the merger and the merger agreement is not
     obtained; or

  .  
SkyMall terminates the merger agreement after SkyMall receives, or
     public announcement is made of, a Takeover Proposal and (i) the SkyMall
     stockholders meeting has been held but stockholder approval of the
     merger and the merger agreement is not obtained and (ii)
SkyMall has
     paid the termination fee and expense reimbursement to Gemstar as
     required in the merger agreement.

   
The option agreement terminates on the earlier of the effective time of the
merger or 180 days after it becomes exercisable, except that the exercise
period will be extended as necessary to obtain all required regulatory
approvals and for the expiration of all statutory waiting periods, to the
extent necessary to avoid liability under Section 16(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and during any period in which Gemstar is precluded from
exercising the option due to an injunction or other legal restriction.

   
If Gemstar desires to sell any shares of SkyMall common stock acquired by
exercise of the option within two years after Gemstar acquires them, and such
sale requires registration under the Securities Act of 1933, then SkyMall is
required to cooperate with Gemstar and any underwriters in effecting such
registration, including filing and maintaining the effectiveness of a
registration statement.


Worsley Employment Agreement

   
At the time the merger agreement was signed, SkyMall entered into a new
employment agreement with Robert M. Worsley which will become effective at the
effective time of the merger.
A copy of this agreement has been filed as an
exhibit to the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus
forms a part.

   
The agreement has a term of five years, but can be terminated earlier with
or without cause.
During the term of the agreement and after the merger, Mr.
Worsley will continue to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of SkyMall.
He
will receive an annual salary of $315,000 per year, subject to annual
increases for inflation, which is substantially the same salary he currently
receives from SkyMall.
Within thirty days after the effective time of the
merger, he will receive options to acquire 105,000 shares of Gemstar common
stock at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of Gemstar common
stock at the grant date.
These options will vest in equal annual installments
over five years.
This option grant is of a similar size and with similar
provisions as Gemstar has made to similarly situated executives of Gemstar.

SkyMall will provide Mr. Worsley with the health and welfare benefits
generally made available to executives of SkyMall.
He will be reimbursed for
reimbursable travel and business expenses and receive an automobile allowance
of $750 per month.
He will be entitled to three weeks vacation per year and
will be eligible to receive an annual bonus at the discretion of the Co-
President, or if necessary the Compensation Committee, of Gemstar.

   
If SkyMall terminates Mr. Worsley without cause, he will be entitled to a
lump sum payment of twenty-four months' salary and the cash equivalent of any
unused vacation time.
In addition, if less than 40% of his Gemstar options are
vested at the time of termination, a number of unvested options will
accelerate and vest so that 40% of such options are vested.
It will be a
constructive termination without cause if SkyMall relocates its office to a
new location over 50 miles outside the city limits of Phoenix, Arizona.
Cause
for termination is:

  .  
any illegal or other wrongful conduct substantially detrimental to the
     business of Gemstar or any subsidiary, or a charge or conviction of any
     felony;

  .  
refusal or failure to act in accordance under the reasonable direction
     of the Co-President of Gemstar and such refusal or failure is not
     corrected within five days after receiving written notice; or

  .  
fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation or similar conduct against Gemstar
     or a direct or indirect subsidiary.

   
For a period of three years after termination of employment, Mr. Worsley
will not use any proprietary information of SkyMall or Gemstar to compete with
Gemstar or SkyMall and will not attempt to direct any business from Gemstar or
SkyMall or solicit for employment, employ or recommend for employment any
employee of Gemstar or SkyMall.
Mr. Worsley will assign to SkyMall any
inventions or intellectual property rights resulting from his work for SkyMall
or relating to SkyMall's business.

                      
COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS

   If the merger is completed, stockholders of SkyMall will hold shares of
Gemstar common stock and their rights as holders of Gemstar common stock will
be governed by Gemstar's charter and bylaws, which differ in several material
respects from SkyMall's charter and bylaws.
As holders of Gemstar common stock,
the rights of former SkyMall stockholders will also be governed by Delaware law
instead of Nevada law.
Delaware is Gemstar's jurisdiction of incorporation and
Nevada is SkyMall's jurisdiction of incorporation.

   
The following comparison summarizes the material differences between the
rights of SkyMall stockholders and the rights of Gemstar stockholders.
It is
not a complete description of the differences between the rights of SkyMall
stockholders and Gemstar stockholders.
The summary is qualified in its entirety
by reference to Delaware law, Nevada law, Gemstar's charter and bylaws,
SkyMall's charter and bylaws and SkyMall's rights plan and Gemstar's rights
plan.


Authorized Capital Stock

SkyMall

  .  
50,000,000 shares of SkyMall common stock

  .  
10,000,000 shares of SkyMall preferred stock

Gemstar

  .  2,350,000,000 shares of Gemstar common stock

  .  
150,000,000 shares of Gemstar preferred stock

Size of Board of Directors

SkyMall

   SkyMall's articles of incorporation provide for a maximum of nine directors.

The bylaws allow the board of directors to fix the number of directors from
time to time, and that number is currently fixed at five.


Gemstar

   Gemstar's certificate of incorporation provides for twelve directors, four
of which must be "independent directors."
Mr. Henry C. Yuen, Gemstar's Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer, is entitled to designate six members of the board
of directors, including himself, and The News Corporation Limited ("News
Corp.") is entitled to designate six members of the board of directors.
The
size of Gemstar's board of directors may be changed by an affirmative vote of
nine of the twelve directors.


Classes of Directors

   Both SkyMall and Gemstar have three classes of directors serving staggered
three-year terms.

   
Delaware law permits a board of directors to be divided into up to three
classes with staggered terms, with only one class elected each year.
Nevada law
requires at least one-fourth of the directors to be elected annually.


Authority of Directors

   Delaware and Nevada law give directors broad authority in managing the
affairs of a corporation.
Gemstar's bylaws enumerate specific matters to be
decided by the board, leaving management with broad authority in other matters.

SkyMall's bylaws provide that the business and affairs of the corporation shall
be managed by the board of directors.


Filling Vacancies on the Board

SkyMall

   Nevada law provides that all vacancies, including those vacancies caused by
an increase in the number of directors of a Nevada corporation, may be filled
by a majority of the remaining directors, even though less than a quorum,
unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation of the corporation.

   
SkyMall's bylaws provide that vacancies may be filled by a majority of
directors then in office or by a sole remaining director.
If no directors are
in office, vacancies may be filled by stockholders at a special meeting.


Gemstar

   Delaware law provides that, unless the governing documents of a Delaware
corporation provide otherwise, vacancies and newly-created directorships
resulting from a resignation or an increase in the authorized number of
directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a
single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office.
If a
vacancy is filled by less than a majority of the entire board of directors
(measured before an increase in the size of the board), the Delaware Chancery
Court may, upon application of stockholders holding at least ten percent of the
voting shares outstanding, summarily order an election to fill vacancies or
replace directors chosen by the directors then in office.

   
Gemstar's bylaws allow vacancies to be filled by a majority of a quorum of
directors, or by unanimous written consent.
Vacancies of News Corp. designees
are to be filled by the TV Guide Director Committee, and vacancies of Mr. Yuen
designees are to be filled by the Gemstar Director Committee.


Removal of Directors

SkyMall

   Under Nevada law, a director of a Nevada corporation may be removed by the
vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the voting power of the
issued and outstanding stock entitled to vote at an election of directors,
unless the articles of incorporation of the corporation provide for a greater
percentage.
Nevada law does not distinguish between removal for cause and
without cause.
SkyMall's bylaws provide that a director may be removed with or
without cause by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 51% of the common
stock outstanding and entitled to vote.


Gemstar

   Delaware law provides that a director or the entire board of directors of a
Delaware corporation may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a
majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors,
unless otherwise stated in the corporation's certificate of incorporation.

Gemstar's certificate of incorporation provides that directors may be removed
from office, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the holders of
at least 66 2/3% of the total voting securities outstanding, voting as a single
class at a meeting called for such purpose.


Nomination of Directors for Election

   Nominations for the SkyMall and Gemstar boards of directors may be made at a
meeting of stockholders, by the respective board of directors or by any
stockholder entitled to vote for directors that complies with the notice
procedures.
Notice to SkyMall must be not less than 30 days, nor more than 60
days, prior to the meeting.
Notice to Gemstar must be not less than 60 days,
nor more than 90 days, prior to the meeting.


Anti-Takeover Provisions

SkyMall

   Nevada law contains provisions that restrict the ability of a Nevada
corporation to engage in any combination with an interested stockholder for
three years after the interested stockholder's date of acquiring the shares
that cause the stockholder to become an interested stockholder, unless the
combination or the purchase of shares by the interested stockholder is approved
by the board of directors of the corporation before that date.
If the
combination was not previously approved, the interested stockholder may effect
the combination after the three-year period only if that stockholder receives
approval from a majority of the disinterested shares or the offer meets various
fair price criteria.
An "interested stockholder" means any person who is:

  .  
the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the
     voting power of the corporation; or

  .  
an affiliate or associate of the corporation that at any time within
     three years immediately before the date in question was the beneficial
     owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the
     corporation.

   
A Nevada corporation may elect not to be subject to the foregoing
restrictions, and SkyMall has elected not to be subject to these restrictions.

However, SkyMall's articles of incorporation contain provisions having a
similar effect.

   
Under Nevada law, a person that acquires or offers to acquire ownership of
"control shares" of a corporation (defined as shares obtained pursuant to a
transaction in which an acquiring person reaches the 20%, 33% or majority
ownership levels) has the right to vote those shares, and shares acquired
within the previous 90 days, only to the extent granted by a resolution of the
stockholders approved at a special or annual meeting, unless otherwise provided
in the articles of incorporation or bylaws in effect on the tenth day following
the control acquisition.

   
The corporation must, within 50 days after delivery of certain information
by the acquiring person, hold a special meeting to consider a resolution
authorizing voting rights for the control shares, unless the acquiring person
consents in writing to holding a meeting after 50 days.
Unless the
corporation's articles of incorporation provide otherwise, a resolution
granting voting rights must be approved by a majority vote.

   
The corporation may adopt a provision in its articles of incorporation or
bylaws allowing mandatory redemption of the control shares if:

  .  
the acquiring party fails to make certain disclosures within ten days of
     acquiring the control shares, or

  .  
the control shares are not accorded full voting rights at the meeting
     held for such purpose.

   
Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation provide
otherwise, if the acquiring party has:

  .  acquired a majority (or larger) stake, and

  .  been accorded full voting rights,

any holder that did not vote in favor of granting voting rights is entitled to
put his or her shares to the corporation for "fair value" (defined as the
highest price paid by the acquiring party for control shares).

   
Nevada law allows a corporation to elect not to be subject to this statute.

A corporation may impose stricter requirements than those established by this
statute through a charter or bylaw amendment or by resolution.
SkyMall's
articles of incorporation state that SkyMall is not subject to this statute,
but SkyMall's articles of incorporation contain provisions having a similar
effect.

   
The provisions of Nevada law relating to the acquisition of control shares
of a Nevada corporation do not apply to an acquisition of stock in good faith,
without an intention to avoid the statutory requirements, including
acquisitions:

  .  
by an acquiring person to the extent that the new acquisition does not
     result in the acquiring person obtaining a controlling interest greater
     than that previously authorized;

  .  
pursuant to the laws of descent and distribution, the enforcement of a
     judgment or the satisfaction of a pledge or other security interest; or

  .  
pursuant to a merger or reorganization to which the corporation is a
     party that is effected in compliance with the provisions of Nevada law.

   
Nevada law provides that the board of directors of a Nevada corporation may
take action to protect the interests of the corporation and its stockholders,
including adopting or executing a rights plan.
SkyMall has adopted a rights
plan.
The board has agreed that the transactions with Gemstar contemplated in
the merger agreement will not be subject to the SkyMall rights plan.

   
Under Nevada law, when evaluating a change in control opportunity, the board
of directors of a Nevada corporation may consider a number of constituencies,
including the interests of employees, suppliers, creditors and customers, the
economy of the state and nation, the interests of the community and of society,
and the long-term and short-term interests of the corporation and its
stockholders and is not required to consider the effect of a change of control
on any particular group having an interest in the corporation as a dominant
factor.

   
SkyMall's articles of incorporation contain a supermajority voting provision
for mergers, consolidations, sales or leases of substantially all of SkyMall's
assets, or any similar transactions, with beneficial owners of 10% or more of
the voting stock outstanding unless the transaction is approved by a majority
of directors not affiliated with the 10% stockholder.


Gemstar

   Delaware law contains a business combination statute that protects Delaware
corporations from hostile takeovers, and from actions following the takeover,
by prohibiting some transactions once an acquiror has gained a significant
holding in the corporation.
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
prohibits "business combinations," including mergers, sales and leases of
assets, issuances of securities and similar transactions by a corporation or a
subsidiary with an interested stockholder that beneficially owns 15% or more of
a corporation's voting stock, within three years after the person becomes an
interested stockholder, unless:

  .   
the transaction that will cause the person to become an interested
     stockholder is approved by the board of directors of the target prior to
     the transaction;

  .  
after the completion of the transaction in which the person becomes an
     interested stockholder, the interested stockholder holds at least 85% of
     the voting stock of the corporation not including:

    --shares held by officers and directors of interested stockholders, and

    --shares held by specified employee benefit plans; or

  .  
after the person becomes an interested stockholder, the business
     combination is approved by the board of directors of the corporation and
     holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock, excluding
     shares held by the interested stockholder.

   
A Delaware corporation may elect not to be governed by Section 203 by a
provision contained in the original certificate of incorporation of the
corporation or an amendment thereto or to the bylaws of the corporation, which
amendment must be approved by a majority of the shares entitled to vote and may
not be further amended by the board of directors of the corporation.
This
amendment is not effective until 12 months following its adoption.
Gemstar has
not made this election.

   
Gemstar's certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of 66
2/3% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for the following actions:

  .  
amendment or repeal of any provision in the certificate of incorporation
     or bylaws (although the board can alter the bylaws without a stockholder
     vote);

  .  
a merger, consolidation, or any binding share exchange (other than a
     merger of a subsidiary);

  .  
the sale, lease or exchange of all or a substantial part of the assets
     of Gemstar and its subsidiaries;

  .  
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of Gemstar; and

  .  
any other matter required to be submitted to stockholder approval by
     state law or the SEC.


Stockholder Action Without a Meeting

SkyMall

   In accordance with Nevada law, SkyMall's bylaws provide that any action
required or permitted to be taken at a stockholders meeting may be taken
without a meeting pursuant to the written consent of the holders of the number
of shares of SkyMall common stock that would have been required to effect the
action at an actual meeting of SkyMall stockholders.


Gemstar

   Gemstar's certificate of incorporation does not allow stockholders to act by
written consent, and generally provides that except as otherwise provided in
the terms of any series of preferred stock, no stockholder action may be taken
without a meeting.


Calling Special Meetings of Stockholders

SkyMall

   Nevada law does not specifically address who may call special meetings of
stockholders of a Nevada corporation.
SkyMall's bylaws provide that a special
meeting of stockholders may be called by the board of directors, chairman of
the board, the president, or holders of at least 10% of the outstanding common
stock.


Gemstar

   Under Delaware law, a special meeting of stockholders of a Delaware
corporation may be called by the board of directors of the corporation or by
any other person authorized to do so in the certificate of incorporation or the
bylaws of the corporation.
Gemstar's bylaws provide for special meetings to be
called by the secretary upon written request of holders of at least a majority
of the voting stock outstanding, or at the request of six directors.


Submission of Stockholder Proposals

SkyMall

   SkyMall's articles of incorporation and bylaws do not specify advance notice
requirements for the submission of stockholder proposals by SkyMall
stockholders.


Gemstar

   Gemstar's bylaws require stockholders to give written notice to the
secretary not less than 60 nor more than 90 days prior to the meeting.
The
notice must specify the matters for the meeting.


Stockholder Vote Required for Mergers

   Under both Delaware and Nevada law, a merger, share exchange or sale of all
of a Nevada corporation's assets (that is not otherwise governed by an anti-
takeover statute) must be adopted by the board of directors of the corporation
and approved by a majority of the corporation's voting power, unless
stockholders of a class of stock are entitled to vote as a class, in which case
the approval of each class is also required.
However, no vote of stockholders
of a constituent corporation surviving a merger is required if:

  .  
the merger agreement does not amend the articles of incorporation of the
     surviving corporation;

  .  
each share of stock of the surviving corporation outstanding before the
     merger is an identical outstanding or treasury share after the merger;
     and

  .  
either no shares of common stock of the surviving corporation are to be
     issued or delivered pursuant to the merger, or, if common stock will be
     issued or delivered, it will not increase the number of shares of common
     stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger by more than 20%.

   
SkyMall's articles provide that business combinations not involving
interested parties require only an affirmative vote by the majority of the
voting power.
Gemstar's certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative
vote of 66 2/3% of the voting power for a business combination other than a
merger of a subsidiary.


Dividends

SkyMall

   Except as otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation of a Nevada
corporation, Nevada law authorizes the corporation to make distributions to its
stockholders, unless:

  .  
the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in
     the usual course of business, or

  .  
the corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its total
     liabilities plus any amount owed to stockholders with preferential
     rights superior to those receiving the distribution, if the corporation
     were dissolved at the time of distribution, unless such distribution is
     specifically allowed by the corporation's articles of incorporation.

   
SkyMall's bylaws provide that dividends may be declared or paid in
accordance with Nevada law.


Gemstar

   Under Delaware law, a Delaware corporation may pay dividends out of surplus
or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which
declared and for the preceding fiscal year.
Delaware law also provides that
dividends may not be paid out of net profits if, after the payment of the
dividend, capital is less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock
of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets.
Gemstar's
certificate of incorporation provides that dividends are payable only as and
when declared by the board of directors out of assets legally available for
payment of dividends.


Appraisal Rights

SkyMall

   Nevada law provides stockholders of a Nevada corporation involved in a
merger the right to demand and receive payment of the fair value of their stock
in certain mergers.
However, unless otherwise provided in the articles of
incorporation of the corporation (and SkyMall's articles of incorporation do
not otherwise provide), appraisal rights are not available to holders of
shares:

  .  
listed on a national securities exchange,

  .  
included in the national market system by the National Association of
     Securities Dealers or

  .  
held of record by at least 2,000 stockholders,

  unless holders of stock are required to accept in the merger anything other
     than any combination of:

  .  
cash, owner's interests or owner's interests and cash in lieu of
     fractional shares of:

    --the surviving or acquiring entity in the merger, or

    --another entity that, at the effective date of the merger, will be:

      --listed on a national securities exchange,

      --included in the national market system by the National Association
         of Securities Dealers, or

      --held of record by at least 2,000 stockholders

   Dissenters' appraisal rights are not available to SkyMall stockholders with
respect to the merger because SkyMall's common stock is included in the Nasdaq
National Market System.


Gemstar

   Delaware law provides stockholders of a Delaware corporation involved in a
merger the right to demand and receive payment of the fair value of their stock
in certain mergers.
However, appraisal rights are not available to holders of
shares:

  .  
listed on a national securities exchange,

  .  
designated as a national market system security on an interdealer
     quotation system operated by the National Association of Securities
     Dealers, or

  .  
held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders,

  unless holders of stock are required to accept in the merger anything other
     than any combination of:

    .  
shares of stock or depository receipts of the surviving corporation
       in the merger,

    .  
shares of stock or depository receipts of another corporation that,
       at the effective date of the merger, will be:

      --listed on a national securities exchange,

      --designated as a national market system security on an interdealer
       quotation system operated by the National Association of Securities
       Dealers, or

      --held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and

    .  
cash instead of fractional shares of the stock or depository
       receipts received.


Inspection of Stockholder Lists

SkyMall

   Under Nevada law any person that has been a stockholder of record of a
Nevada corporation for at least six months, or any person holding or
representing at least 5% of its outstanding shares, upon at least five days'
written demand, may inspect its stock ledger and make copies from it.
A
corporation must allow stockholders of record that own or represent at least
15% of a corporation's shares the right, upon at least five days' written
demand, to inspect the books of accounting and financial records of the
corporation, to make copies from them and to conduct an audit of those records,
except that any corporation listed and traded on any recognized stock exchange
or any corporation that furnishes to its stockholders a detailed, annual
financial statement is exempt from this requirement.


Gemstar

   Delaware law allows any stockholder to inspect the stock ledger and the
other books and records of a Delaware corporation for a purpose reasonably
related to that person's interest as a stockholder.


Stockholder Class Voting Rights

SkyMall

   With respect to mergers, Nevada law requires voting by separate classes and
series of shares if the plan of merger contains a provision that if contained
in an amendment to the articles of incorporation of the corporation would
entitle the particular class of stockholders to vote as a class on the proposed
amendment.

   
With respect to share exchanges, Nevada law requires voting by each separate
class or series of shares included in the exchange, with each class
constituting a separate voting class.

   
Nevada law also requires, in addition to the affirmative vote otherwise
required, voting and approval by the separate classes of shares for any
amendment to the articles of incorporation if the amendment would alter or
change any preference or relative or other right given to any such class or
series of outstanding shares.

   
SkyMall has two classes of stock authorized, but only one class currently
outstanding.


Gemstar

   Delaware law requires voting by separate classes of shares only with respect
to amendments to a Delaware corporation's certificate of incorporation that
adversely affect the holders of those classes or that increase or decrease the
aggregate number of authorized shares or the par value of the shares of any of
those classes.

   
Gemstar has two classes of stock authorized, but only one class currently
outstanding.
Gemstar's certificate of incorporation provides that holders of
common stock and preferred stock shall vote together as a single class to elect
directors and on all other matters (unless otherwise required by Delaware law
or provided in the designation of a series of preferred stock), including
amendments that would increase or decrease the number of shares of any class or
series of stock.


Indemnification

SkyMall

   Nevada law provides that, subject to certain limitations in the case of
derivative suits brought by a corporation's stockholders in its name, a
corporation may indemnify any individual who is made a party to any third-party
suit or proceeding on account of being a director, officer, employee or agent
of the corporation against expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement reasonably and

actually incurred by him or her in connection with the action, through, among
other things, a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not
parties to the suit or proceeding, if the individual:

  .  
acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be
     in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation or, in some
     circumstances, at least not opposed to its best interests, provided that
     the termination of any action or suit by judgment, order, settlement,
     conviction or on a plea of nolo contendre does not create a presumption
     by itself that the individual did not act in good faith, and

  .  
in a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her
     conduct was unlawful.

   
To the extent a director, officer, employee or agent is successful on the
merits or otherwise in the defense of this action, suit or proceeding, the
corporation is required by Nevada law to indemnify the individual for
reasonable and actual expenses incurred thereby.

   
SkyMall's articles of incorporation provide for indemnification of former
and current officers and directors of SkyMall to the fullest extent of the law.


Gemstar

   Delaware law provides that, subject to certain limitations in the case of
derivative suits brought by a corporation's stockholders in its name, a
corporation may indemnify any individual who is made a party to any third-party
suit or proceeding on account of being a director, officer, employee or agent
of the corporation against expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement reasonably incurred by him or her in
connection with the action, through, among other things, a majority vote of a
quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the suit or proceeding,
if the individual:

  .  
acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be
     in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation or, in some
     circumstances, at least not opposed to its best interests; and

  .  
in a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her
     conduct was unlawful.

   
To the extent a director, officer, employee or agent is successful in the
defense of the action, suit or proceeding, the corporation is required by
Delaware law to indemnify such individual for reasonable expenses incurred
thereby.

   
Gemstar's certificate of incorporation provides for indemnification, to the
fullest extent authorized by law, for former and current directors and officers
of Gemstar, and for a person serving as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation at the request of Gemstar.
Gemstar is required to
indemnify or make advances in connection with a proceeding initiated by the
indemnified person only if the proceeding was authorized by the Gemstar board
of directors.

   
Gemstar must pay expenses incurred in defending the proceedings specified
above in advance of their final disposition, provided that the advancement of
expenses to a director or officer shall be made only if such person undertakes
to repay all amounts so advanced if it is ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to be indemnified.


Charter Amendments

SkyMall

   Under Nevada law, amendments to the articles of incorporation may be adopted
if recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by a
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.

   
SkyMall's articles of incorporation require an affirmative vote of 66 2/3%
of the outstanding voting power to amend, alter, repeal or adopt any provision
inconsistent with the articles of incorporation.


Gemstar

   Under Delaware law, amendments to a certificate of incorporation require the
approval of the board of directors of the corporation and stockholders holding
a majority of the outstanding stock of the class entitled to vote on the
amendment as a class, unless a different proportion is specified in the
certificate of incorporation or by other provisions of Delaware law.

   
Gemstar's certificate of incorporation requires at least 66 2/3% of the
outstanding voting power to amend the certificate of incorporation.


Amendment of Bylaws

SkyMall

   Under Nevada law, the board of directors of the corporation may adopt, amend
and repeal the bylaws of the corporation, subject to any bylaws adopted by the
stockholders.

   
SkyMall's bylaws provide that the board of directors may amend or repeal the
bylaws by a majority vote.
SkyMall's bylaws also may be amended or repealed by
the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting stock outstanding; however,
changes to bylaw provisions addressing director nomination and indemnification
of officers and directors require approval of 66 2/3% of the voting stock
outstanding.


Gemstar

   Under Delaware law, holders of a majority of the voting power of a
corporation, and, when provided in the certificate of incorporation, the
directors of the corporation, have the power to adopt, amend and repeal the
bylaws of a corporation.

   
Gemstar's bylaws may be adopted, amended or repealed by action of at least
nine of the twelve directors, without stockholder approval.
Subject to the
rights of holders of any preferred stock, stockholders may adopt, amend or
repeal the bylaws by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the voting
power.
