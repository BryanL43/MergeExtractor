BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER

     
In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Corporate Development Group at Sybase,
under the direction of Marty Beard, Sybase's Vice President, Corporate
Development, researched companies offering enterprise application integration
products and identified NEON as a potential candidate for a strategic
relationship.

     
In December 2000, NEON engaged Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation
("CSFB") to provide financial advisory services in connection with a possible
business combination involving NEON.
In December 2000 and January 2001, CSFB and
officers of NEON contacted approximately seven parties to determine their
interest in engaging in a business combination with NEON.

     
On December 27, 2000, Mr. Beard placed a telephone call to George F. (Rick)

Adam, Jr., NEON's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, inviting Mr. Adam to
participate in an initial discussion regarding a possible strategic
relationship.

     
On January 1, 2001, Mr. Beard and Mr. Adam had an initial discussion by
telephone.
During that conversation, Mr. Beard introduced the possibility of a
business combination transaction, and Mr. Adam expressed an interest in
exploring such a transaction.

     
On January 3, 2001, Mr. Adam met, at Sybase's offices in Emeryville,
California, with Mr. Beard, John S. Chen, Sybase's President and Chief Executive
Officer, Raj Nathan, Sybase's General Manager, Internet Applications Division,
and Billy Ho, Sybase's Vice President of Research and Development to discuss a
possible business combination.
At the meeting, Mr. Adam and Mr. Chen presented
each other with strategic overviews of their respective companies and confirmed
their mutual interest in pursuing further discussions regarding a possible
business combination.

     
On January 12, 2001, Mr. Chen conveyed to Mr. Adam Sybase's proposed terms
for a possible business combination involving Sybase and NEON.

     
On January 15, 2001, NEON's board of directors authorized NEON to continue
discussions with Sybase regarding a possible business combination.

     
On January 16, 2001, at the direction of Mr. Adam, CSFB contacted Mr. Chen
to express NEON's desire to continue discussions regarding a potential business
combination.
At this time, Mr. Chen expressed Sybase's desire to continue
discussions as well.

     
On January 17, 2001 NEON and Sybase entered into a mutual nondisclosure
agreement pursuant to which they agreed to exchange confidential information
regarding their respective businesses.

     
On January 19, 2001, Mr. Adam, Dr. Patrick Fortune, NEON's President and
Chief Operating Officer, Stephen Webb, NEON's Chief Financial Officer, and Peter
Hoversten, NEON's Chief Technology Officer, met with Pieter Van der Vorst,
Sybase's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Beard and Mark Wilson, Sybase's Senior
Director, Corporate Development, in San Francisco, California to review
strategic, financial, product and operational information about NEON, and to
continue discussions regarding the merits of a business combination.
That night,
Mr. Adam and Mr. Chen continued discussions of a possible business combination.

     
On January 22, 2001, Merrill Lynch & Co. ("Merrill Lynch") was engaged to
act as Sybase's financial advisor in connection with a possible transaction with
NEON.

     
On January 24, 2001, Merrill Lynch began its due diligence review of NEON,
which continued through the signing of the reorganization agreement.

Representatives of Merrill Lynch met with

representatives of NEON management at NEON's offices in Englewood, Colorado to
review background historical information on NEON's strategy, products and
financial and operational performance.

     
On January 26, 2001, Sybase transmitted a proposed term sheet and certain
ancillary documents to NEON.

     
On January 27, 2001, Mr. Adam notified Mr. Beard that NEON was interested
in continuing discussions with Sybase regarding a possible business combination.

     
On January 30 and 31, 2001, several discussions took place among
representatives of Sybase, Merrill Lynch, CSFB and NEON with respect to the
proposed financial terms of the business combination transaction.

     
On February 1, 2001, NEON retained Cooley Godward LLP to act as its outside
legal counsel in connection with the possible business combination transaction.

Later that evening, management of the two companies agreed to continue
discussions regarding a business combination transaction and directed their
outside legal counsel to commence negotiation of a definitive reorganization
agreement.

     
On February 5, 2001, representatives from Sybase, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &
Rosati, Professional Corporation, outside legal counsel to Sybase, and Ernst &
Young LLP, independent accountants to Sybase, began their due diligence review
of NEON which continued through the signing of the reorganization agreement.

     
Between February 5 and February 7, 2001, Mr. Adam, Dr. Fortune, Mr. Webb,
Mr. Hoversten, Fred Horn, NEON's Executive Vice President of Operations, Leonard
Goldstein, NEON's Senior Vice President, Senior Counsel and Secretary, Leslie
Lundberg, NEON's Vice President of Human Resources, Brian Duff, NEON's
Controller, and other members of NEON management met with Mr. Van der Vorst, Mr.
Beard, Mr. Nathan, Dan Carl, Sybase's General Counsel, Pamela George, Sybase's
Vice President of Marketing, Nita White-Ivy, Sybase's Vice President of Human
Resources, and other members of Sybase management, at the offices of Cooley
Godward in San Francisco, California.
During these meetings, the parties
discussed the business, financial condition and organization of the two
companies.
Simultaneously, Scott Powell, NEON's Group President of Engineering,
and Mr. Ho met in Denver, Colorado, to discuss both companies' product
architecture and specifications.

     
On February 6, 2001, the NEON board of directors held a special telephonic
meeting to discuss the potential business combination.
Members of NEON's
management and representatives of CSFB explained the background and status of
the negotiations.
At this meeting, representatives of Cooley Godward reviewed
the responsibilities of the board of directors in considering the proposed
business combination transaction.
The NEON board of directors discussed the
strategic rationale for a proposed business combination and authorized
management to continue negotiations with Sybase.
Later that evening, Wilson
Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati delivered drafts of the reorganization agreement and
related agreements to Cooley Godward.

     
From February 9, 2001 through February 20, 2001, negotiations on the terms
of the reorganization agreement and related agreements continued among Sybase,
NEON and their respective legal counsel and financial advisors.
These
negotiations covered all aspects of the transaction, including, among other
things, the representations and warranties made by the parties, the restrictions
on the conduct of their businesses, the conditions to completion of the offer
and the merger, the provisions regarding termination, the details of the "no
shop" clause, the amount, triggers and payment of the termination fee and the
consequences of termination, and the delivery and terms of the stockholder
agreements.
During this period, executive officers of NEON who were asked to
enter into employment and non-competition agreements and agreements amending
certain change of control severance agreements negotiated the terms of these
agreements with Sybase.

     
On February 14, 2001, the NEON board of directors held a special telephonic
meeting during which the NEON board of directors discussed the proposed business
combination with Sybase.
Mr. Adam reviewed the background of NEON's discussions
with Sybase as well as the current status of negotiations

and reviewed the terms of the proposed business combination transaction.

Representatives of CSFB reviewed the financial terms of the transaction as
proposed at that time.
In addition, representatives of Cooley Godward outlined
the board's fiduciary duties and other applicable legal principles in the
context of business combination transactions and reviewed the reorganization
agreement and stockholder agreements and related matters.
The NEON board of
directors discussed the strategic, business and financial merits and the timing
of a possible transaction with Sybase and the terms of Sybase's proposal, and
directed management to continue negotiations with Sybase.

     
From February 12, 2001 to February 14, 2001, Mr. Chen, Mr. Van der Vorst,
Mr. Beard and representatives of Merrill Lynch had several conversations with
the individual members of the Sybase board of directors regarding the proposed
business combination with NEON, including the strategic rationale for the
transaction and the proposed financial and other transaction terms.

     
On February 15, 2001, the Sybase board of directors met and reviewed the
proposed transaction terms and the results of Sybase's due diligence
investigation.
Representatives of Merrill Lynch and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &
Rosati also participated.
The Sybase board of directors received a presentation
from its financial advisor, Merrill Lynch, concerning the transaction.

Representatives of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati reviewed the proposed
principal terms of the reorganization agreement and outlined the legal
principles applicable to the Sybase board of directors' consideration and
approval of the proposed transaction.
The Sybase board of directors, by
unanimous vote of the directors present and voting at the meeting, authorized
Sybase to enter into a reorganization agreement with NEON in substantially the
form proposed at the meeting consistent with the Sybase board of directors'
guidance on certain open issues, including the completion of the audit of NEON's
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2000.

     
On February 19, 2001, a representative of Merrill Lynch telephoned a
representative of CSFB to discuss open issues in the negotiations, including
valuation and the potential exchange ratio.
In addition, on February 19, 2001,
Mr. Chen telephoned Mr. Adam to discuss open issues in the negotiations,
including valuation and the potential exchange ratio.

     
On February 19, 2001, the NEON board of directors held a special telephonic
meeting to review the status of negotiations and discussions with Sybase since
the board's February 14, 2001 meeting and reviewed revised drafts of the
reorganization agreement and related agreements.
Representatives of CSFB and
Cooley Godward also participated.
Representatives of Cooley Godward reviewed
with the NEON board of directors the main legal principles applicable to the
proposed business combination transaction (including the board's fiduciary
duties and authority in considering the transaction).
Representatives of Cooley
Godward also reviewed in detail the principal terms of the proposed
reorganization agreement and related agreements and summarized the remaining
open issues and responded to questions by the NEON board of directors.
The NEON
board of directors reviewed and discussed the principal terms of the proposed
transaction, including the exchange ratio, closing conditions, termination
rights, the termination fee, the stockholder agreements and NEON's ability to
consider alternative proposals.
Also at this meeting, CSFB reviewed with NEON's
board of directors the financial terms of the transaction proposed at that time
and indicated that, subject to agreement on the final exchange ratio consistent
with the financial terms as proposed at that time, it was prepared to render an
opinion to the NEON board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and
subject to various considerations, the exchange ratio in the transaction was
fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of NEON common stock.
After
further deliberation, the NEON board of directors, by the unanimous vote of all
directors present and voting at the meeting:

     - determined that the reorganization agreement and the transactions
       contemplated thereby, including the offer and the merger, are consistent
       with and in furtherance of the long-term business strategy of NEON and
       are advisable and are fair to and in the best interest of NEON and its
       stockholders,

     - approved and adopted the reorganization agreement and the transactions
       contemplated thereby, including the offer and the merger and the
       stockholder agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby,
       together with such changes as were discussed at the meeting,

     - resolved to recommend acceptance of the offer and approval and adoption
       of the reorganization agreement by NEON's stockholders, and

     - authorized Mr. Adam to execute, on behalf of NEON, the reorganization
       agreement and such other documents that certain of NEON's officers find
       necessary or advisable in their sole discretion, together with any
       changes, deletions, additions and alterations that such officers approve
       consistent with the resolutions of the NEON board of directors.

     
After the close of trading on the Nasdaq National Market on February 20,
2001, Sybase and NEON agreed on the final exchange ratio of 0.3878 and entered
into the reorganization agreement.
Following agreement on the final exchange
ratio, CSFB rendered to the NEON board of directors its written opinion that, as
of February 20, 2001, and based upon and subject to various considerations set
forth in its opinion, the exchange ratio in the transaction was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of NEON common stock, other than Sybase
and its affiliates.
CSFB was not aware of any ownership of shares of NEON common
stock by Sybase or its affiliates.
A copy of CSFB's opinion is included in
NEON's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which is being
mailed to NEON stockholders together with this prospectus.
Stockholders should
read CSFB's opinion carefully in its entirety.

     
Also on February 20, 2001, the directors and certain officers and
stockholders of NEON entered into stockholder agreements with Sybase, pursuant
to which they agreed to tender their NEON shares in the offer and vote their
NEON shares in favor of the approval and adoption of the reorganization
agreement.
In addition, the directors and certain officers and stockholders of
NEON entered into affiliate agreements with Sybase, acknowledging the
restrictions imposed by the federal securities laws, in some instances, on their
ability to sell Sybase shares following the completion of the offer or the
merger, as applicable.
In addition, certain officers of NEON also signed
amendments to the change of control severance agreements to which such officers
are party to, among other things, waive certain severance and other rights that
may be triggered as a direct or indirect result of the transactions contemplated
by the reorganization agreement.
Messrs. Adam, Fortune, Horn and Hoversten each
entered into employment and non-competition agreements with Sybase, effective
upon consummation of the merger, under which they agreed not to engage in
certain activities or make certain investments, and not to solicit Sybase
employees, during the period of their employment by the surviving corporation
and for eighteen months following their termination of employment with the
surviving corporation.
See the section entitled "Interests of NEON Officers and
Directors in the Transaction" beginning on page 53 of this prospectus,
specifically "-- Certain Executive Agreements" beginning on page 54 of this
prospectus, for a further description of some of these agreements.

     
After the parties signed the reorganization agreement, Sybase issued a
press release announcing the transaction.

     
On March 15, 2001 Neel Acquisition Corp. commenced the offer.

REASONS FOR THE OFFER AND MERGER

Improve our e-Business/Enterprise Application Integration Products

     - We believe the combination of Sybase and NEON furthers our strategy of
       improving and expanding our product offerings in the
       e-business/enterprise application integration marketplace.
This
       marketplace is demanding the integration of new e-business applications
       with existing and older legacy applications on the web to facilitate
       seamless e-business.
Enterprise application integration is one of the
       fastest growing areas of the information technology industry and Sybase's
       acquisition of NEON would provides us with processes, integration
       technology, portal servers and other elements critical for our growth in
       this area.


Strengthen our Market Position

     - We believe the combination of Sybase and NEON will strengthen our
       position in the emerging e-business marketplace.
Acquisition of NEON's
       technology would broaden Sybase's e-business platform, enabling it to
       respond to customer demand by providing products complimentary to
       Sybase's application server, replication server and messaging middleware.
       
We believe an enhanced e-business platform would meet the needs of
       customers interested in maximizing and integrating all business
       interactions, from the consumer to suppliers and the back-office.

     
- We believe the combination of Sybase and NEON will enable us to
       strengthen our market presence by broadening the total number of products
       available to customers and allowing customers to develop e-business
       solutions faster.

     - NEON's strength in the manufacturing, distribution, retail and utilities
       vertical markets should provide an opportunity for us to expand our
       presence into those vertical markets.


Increase Our Selling Opportunities

     - We believe enterprises will increasingly demand e-business implementation
       and integration services from one vendor.
The combined products of Sybase
       and NEON will allow us to meet this demand and offer our customers
       additional products and capabilities, as well as reach new customers who
       are seeking a broad e
-business/enterprise application integration
       solution.

     - NEON has over 3,000 worldwide customers, mostly in the Fortune Global
       2000, which we believe will provide opportunities for cross-selling of
       other Sybase products.


Improve Organizational Capabilities

     - NEON had approximately 1,000 employees as of February 23, 2001.
Many of
       these employees, including 260 engineers, 280 consultants, and 85 sales
       representatives, we believe will strengthen Sybase's development,
       professional services and sales capabilities.

     
-
We believe that the combined company's capabilities will allow us to
       deliver new e-business solutions to the market faster, in months instead
       of years.


RECOMMENDATION OF THE NEON BOARD; FACTORS CONSIDERED

     In approving the offer, the merger, the reorganization agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the reorganization agreement and recommending that
all holders of NEON shares accept the offer and tender their NEON shares
pursuant to the offer, the NEON board of directors considered a number of
factors, including:

     - the complementary strategies and direction of NEON, a leading supplier of
       e-business integration software and services, and Sybase, a leading
       global provider of software solutions that help businesses manage and
       deliver information across distributed mixed computing environments,
       including the Internet;

     - the combination of Sybase's e-business platform products and NEON's suite
       of e-business integration products, creating a complete e-business
       infrastructure solution for companies building on-line businesses;

     - the opportunity for NEON to access Sybase's installed base of 40,000
       customers for cross-selling opportunities, and to leverage Sybase's
       distribution channels to drive sales of NEON's e-business integration
       products;

     - Sybase offers a more significant international presence for the
       distribution of NEON products;

     - the exchange ratio for the offer and the merger representing a premium of
       65.2% over the closing price of the NEON common stock on the Nasdaq
       National Market on February 16, 2001, the last

       trading day prior to the NEON board's approval of the reorganization
       agreement, as well as 80.2% and 82.5% premiums over the average of the
       closing prices for the ten and 30 trading days, respectively, ending on
       February 16, 2001;

     - the presentations of CSFB regarding the financial terms of the proposed
       transaction and the opinion of CSFB that, as of February 20, 2001 and
       based upon and subject to the various considerations set forth in the
       CSFB opinion, the exchange ratio in the transaction was fair, from a
       financial point of view, to the holders of NEON common stock, other than
       Sybase and its affiliates.
A copy of the opinion is included in NEON's
       Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which is being
       mailed to NEON stockholders together with this prospectus.
NEON
       stockholders should read the opinion carefully in its entirety;

     - the financial and other terms of the offer, the merger and the
       reorganization agreement, including the benefits of the transaction being
       structured as a first-step exchange offer and second-step merger, which
       may provide NEON's stockholders with an opportunity to receive shares of
       Sybase common stock on an accelerated basis;

     - the opportunity for the holders of the NEON shares to participate in a
       significantly larger and more diversified company and, as stockholders of
       the combined company, to have greater liquidity in their shares and to
       benefit from any future growth of the combined company;

     - the strengths and weaknesses of Sybase's and NEON's businesses and the
       key attributes and opportunities of the combined company in terms of,
       among other things, products, sales, customers, management, and financial
       and competitive position;

     - the nature of the e-business software industry and the belief of NEON's
       board of directors that greater size and resources are increasingly
       required for companies to successfully compete in this industry;

     - the increasing competition that NEON faces from both existing and
       potential competitors, many of which have greater assets and resources
       than NEON, which has occurred as a result of, among other reasons, the
       consolidation taking place in the software industry in general;

     - historical information concerning Sybase's and NEON's respective
       businesses, financial performance and condition, operations, technology,
       management and competitive position, including public reports concerning
       results of operations filed with the SEC;

     - the consideration to be received by NEON stockholders in the offer and
       the merger and an analysis of the market value of the Sybase common stock
       to be issued in exchange for the NEON common stock in light of comparable
       transactions;

     - current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
       volatility and trading information with respect to Sybase common stock
       and the NEON common stock;

     - the belief that the terms of the reorganization agreement, including the
       parties' representations, warranties and covenants, and the conditions to
       the parties' respective obligations, are reasonable;

     - the impact of the offer and the merger on NEON's customers and employees;
       and

     - reports from management, legal advisors and financial advisors as to the
       results of their due diligence investigation of Sybase.

     
NEON's board of directors also considered the terms of the reorganization
agreement regarding NEON's rights to consider and negotiate other acquisition
proposals, as well as the possible effects of the provisions regarding
termination fees.
In addition, NEON's board of directors noted that the offer
and merger are expected to be a tax-free transaction.
NEON's board of directors
also considered various alternatives to the offer and the merger, including
remaining as an independent company.
NEON's board of directors believed that
these factors, including the NEON board's review of the terms of the
reorganization agreement, supported the board's recommendation of the offer and
the merger when viewed

together with the risks and potential benefits of the offer and the merger.

NEON's board of directors also identified and considered a variety of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the offer and the
merger, including, but not limited to:

     - the risk that the potential benefits sought in the offer and the merger
       might not be fully realized;

     - certain risks applicable to Sybase's business (see the section of this
       prospectus under the heading "Risk Factors -- Risks Related to Our
       Business" on page 12);

     - the possibility that the offer and the merger might not be completed and
       the effect of public announcement of the offer and the merger on NEON's
       sales and operating results, and its ability to attract and retain key
       technical, marketing and management personnel;

     - the risk that the terms of the transaction could be dilutive to Sybase's
       earnings and that such potential dilution could negatively impact the
       trading price of Sybase common stock.

     - the substantial charges to be incurred in connection with the offer and
       the merger, including costs of integrating the businesses and transaction
       expenses arising from the offer and the merger;

     - the risk that despite the efforts of the combined company, key technical,
       marketing and management personnel might not remain employed by the
       combined company; and

     - the difficulty of managing separate operations at different geographic
       locations.

     
NEON's board of directors believed that these risks were outweighed by the
potential benefits of the offer and the merger.

     
The NEON board of directors did not assign relative weights to the
foregoing factors or determine that any factor was of particular importance.

Rather, the NEON board of directors viewed its position and recommendations as
being based on the totality of the information presented to and considered by
the NEON board of directors.
In addition, individual members of the NEON board
of directors may have given different weights to different factors.

     
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the
NEON board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to
include the material factors considered by the NEON board of directors.
In view
of the wide variety of factors, both positive and negative, considered by the
NEON board of directors, the NEON board of directors did not find it practical
to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific
factors considered.


OPINION OF NEON FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     On February 20, 2001, CSFB delivered its opinion to NEON's board of
directors that, as of that date, based upon and subject to the various
considerations set forth in the CSFB opinion, the exchange ratio in the
transaction was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of NEON common
stock, other than Sybase and its affiliates.
CSFB was not aware of any ownership
of shares of NEON common stock by Sybase or its affiliates.

     
WE INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE THE FULL TEXT OF THE CSFB OPINION DATED
FEBRUARY 20, 2001.
THE FULL TEXT OF THE WRITTEN OPINION OF CSFB, WHICH SETS
FORTH THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS ON THE REVIEW
UNDERTAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE OPINION IS ATTACHED AS SCHEDULE II TO NEON'S
SOLICITATION/RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT ON SCHEDULE 14D-9, WHICH IS BEING MAILED
TO NEON STOCKHOLDERS TOGETHER WITH THIS PROSPECTUS.
WE URGE NEON STOCKHOLDERS TO
READ THE OPINION IN ITS ENTIRETY AND THE DISCUSSION IN NEON'S
SOLICITATION/RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT REGARDING THE OPINION.


MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following discussion summarizes the material United States federal
income tax consequences of the offer and the merger to holders of NEON shares
who exchange their NEON shares for Sybase shares in the offer and/or the merger.

This discussion and the tax opinions described below are based on the

Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the "Code"),
applicable Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations and court
decisions in effect as of the date of this prospectus, all of which may change,
possibly with retroactive effect.
Any such change could alter the tax
consequences described in this summary and the tax opinions.

     
This discussion of material federal income tax consequences of the offer
and the merger is intended to provide only a general summary, and is not a
complete analysis or description of all potential federal income tax
consequences of the offer and/or the merger.
It does not address all aspects of
federal income taxation that may be important to a holder of NEON shares in
light of that holder's particular circumstances or to a holder subject to
special rules, such as:

     - a foreign entity or an individual stockholder who is not a citizen or
       resident of the United States;

     - a financial institution or insurance company;

     - a tax-exempt organization;

     - a dealer or broker in securities;

     - a stockholder who is subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of
       the Code;

     - a stockholder whose shares are qualified small business stock for
       purposes of Section 1202 of the Code;

     - a stockholder who holds NEON shares as part of a hedge, appreciated
       financial position, straddle, constructive sale or conversion
       transaction;

     - a stockholder who acquired NEON shares pursuant to the exercise of
       incentive stock options or who holds NEON shares that are subject to a
       substantial risk of forfeiture; or

     - a stockholder who does not hold NEON shares as capital assets.

     
In addition, this discussion does not address any state, local or foreign
income tax or non-income tax consequences of the offer and/or the merger or of
any transactions other than the offer and the merger.
We urge holders of NEON
shares to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular federal
income tax or other tax consequences to them of participation in the offer
and/or the merger.

     
Although there is limited authority, the offer and the merger will be
treated for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code if, among other things, all of the following
factual assumptions (which we refer to as the supporting conditions) are met:

     - the offer and the merger are completed under the current terms of the
       reorganization agreement;

     - the minimum tender condition for the offer is satisfied; and

     - the merger is completed promptly after the offer.

     
The consummation of the offer is conditioned upon the receipt by Sybase and
NEON of tax opinions to the foregoing effect from Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &
Rosati, Professional Corporation and Cooley Godward LLP, respectively.
These
opinions will rely upon, and the consequences summarized below under "-- Federal
Income Tax Consequences If the Offer and Merger Qualify As a Reorganization" are
based upon, representations and covenants made by Sybase and NEON, and those
contained in certificates of officers of Sybase and NEON to be delivered to tax
counsel prior to the consummation of the offer, and upon certain assumptions,
including the absence of changes in facts or in law between the date of the
consummation of the offer and the effective time of the merger.
If any of those
representations, covenants or assumptions is inaccurate, the tax consequences of
the offer and the merger could differ materially from those summarized below
under "-- Federal Income Tax Consequences If the Offer and Merger Qualify As a
Reorganization."
In addition, the ability to satisfy the supporting conditions,
and therefore the federal income tax consequences of the offer and the merger,
depend in part on facts that will not be available before the completion of the
merger.
There can be no assurance that the merger will be completed, or that the
supporting conditions will be satisfied.
If the supporting conditions are not
satisfied, the opinions of

Cooley Godward and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati described above may not be
relied upon.
Furthermore, Cooley Godward's and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &
Rosati's opinions will neither bind the IRS nor preclude the IRS or the courts
from adopting a contrary position.
NEON stockholders should be aware that
neither the IRS nor any court has ruled on the tax treatment of a combination of
transactions identical to the offer and the merger and no ruling has been or
will be requested from the IRS in connection with the offer and the merger.

Accordingly, it is possible that the offer and/or the merger may not qualify as
a reorganization, and the tax consequences of the offer and the merger could
differ materially from those summarized below under "-- Federal Income Tax
Consequences If the Offer and Merger Qualify As a Reorganization."
See
"-- Federal Income Tax Consequences If the Offer and Merger Do Not Qualify As a
Reorganization.
"

     Federal Income Tax Consequences If the Offer and Merger Qualify As a
Reorganization.
Assuming that the offer and the merger qualify as a tax-free
reorganization, for federal income tax purposes:

     - A holder of NEON shares will not recognize any gain or loss on its
       exchange in the offer or the merger of its NEON shares for Sybase shares.

     - If a holder of NEON shares receives cash instead of a fraction of a
       Sybase share, the holder will be required to recognize capital gain or
       loss, measured by the difference between the amount of cash received
       instead of that fraction of a share and the portion of the tax basis of
       that holder's NEON shares allocable to that fraction of a share.
This
       gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder has
       held the NEON shares exchanged for that fraction of a Sybase share for
       more than one year at the time such NEON shares are accepted in the offer
       or at the effective time of the merger, as the case may be.
The
       deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations for both
       individuals and corporations.

     
- A holder of NEON shares will have a tax basis in the Sybase shares
       received in the offer or the merger equal to (1) the tax basis in the
       NEON shares surrendered by that holder in the offer or merger, reduced by
       (2) any tax basis in such NEON shares that is allocable to a fraction of
       a Sybase share for which cash is received.

     - The holding period for Sybase shares received in exchange for NEON shares
       in the offer or the merger will include the holding period for NEON
       shares surrendered in the offer or the merger.

     - Under specified circumstances, holders of NEON shares may be entitled to
       appraisal rights in connection with the merger.
See "-- Purpose of the
       Offer; The Merger; Appraisal Rights" below.
If appraisal rights are
       available and a holder of NEON shares receives cash pursuant to the
       exercise of appraisal rights, such holder will recognize gain or loss,
       measured by the difference between the amount realized and such holder's
       tax basis in such NEON shares.
Holders of NEON shares who exercise
       appraisal rights are urged to consult their own tax advisors.

     - NEON will not recognize gain or loss as a result of the offer and the
       merger.

     
Federal Income Tax Consequences If the Offer and Merger Do Not Qualify as a
Reorganization.
The tax consequences described above are based on factual
assumptions, representations and covenants, including the satisfaction of the
supporting conditions.
If any of those factual assumptions, representations or
covenants are not satisfied or observed, or in the event of a contrary ruling by
the IRS or a court, the federal income tax consequences of the offer and the
merger to holders of NEON shares could differ materially from those summarized
above under "-- Federal Income Tax Consequences If the Offer and Merger Qualify
As a Reorganization."
In that event, exchanges by NEON stockholders pursuant to
the offer and/or the merger could be taxable transactions for federal income tax
purposes depending on the particular facts surrounding the offer and/or the
merger, some of which may not be known before the completion of the merger or
later points in time.

     
If the offer and/or the merger is taxable, each NEON stockholder
participating in the offer and/or the merger, as applicable, will recognize
capital gain or loss, measured by the difference between the fair market value
of the Sybase shares (together with any cash instead of a fraction of a Sybase
common

share) received by such stockholder and such stockholder's tax basis in the NEON
shares surrendered.
This gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if
such stockholder had held such NEON shares for more than one year at the time
such NEON shares are accepted in the offer or at the effective time of the
merger, as applicable.

     
Federal Income Tax Consequences If the Merger Is Not Consummated.
In
addition to the limitations, assumptions and qualifications described above, no
opinion has been given concerning any tax consequences of the offer if the
merger is not consummated, or if the merger is not consummated promptly after
the offer.
Except as described under this heading, if the merger is not
consummated, exchanges pursuant to the offer generally will be taxable
transactions for federal income tax purposes with the consequences described
above under "-- Federal Income Tax Consequences If the Offer and Merger Do Not
Qualify As a Reorganization."

     
Even if the merger is not consummated, the offer will still be treated for
federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code so long as the following factual assumptions are met:

     - in general, Neel Acquisition Corp. must acquire at least 80% of the NEON
       shares in the offer;

     - any acquisition of additional NEON shares from other stockholders that
       Sybase or Neel Acquisition Corp. may decide to effect must not be for
       consideration other than Sybase voting stock; and

     - the representations and covenants made by Sybase and NEON to Cooley
       Godward and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati must remain effective.

     
Whether these factual assumptions will be satisfied will not be known at
the time of the offer and there can be no assurances that such factual
assumptions will be satisfied.

     
We urge each holder of NEON shares to consult his or her own tax advisor to
determine the particular United States federal, state or local or foreign income
or other tax consequences of participation in the offer and/or the merger.

     
Federal Backup Withholding.
To prevent backup federal income tax
withholding with respect to cash, if any, received pursuant to the offer and/or
the merger, you must either provide the exchange agent with your correct
taxpayer identification number and certify whether you are subject to backup
withholding of federal income tax by completing the substitute Form W-9 included
in the letter of transmittal or establish a basis for exemption from backup
withholding.
Some stockholders (including, among others, all corporations and
some foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and
reporting requirements.
In order for a foreign individual to qualify as an
exempt recipient, the stockholder must submit a Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8EXP or
W-8IMY, as appropriate, signed under penalties of perjury, attesting to that
individual's exempt status.
NEON stockholders that fail to provide their
taxpayer identification numbers and the appropriate certifications or that fail
to establish an exemption as described above will be subject to backup
withholding of 31% on cash amounts received in the offer and/or the merger and
may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the IRS.
If withholding is made and
results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained.
Cash amounts paid
pursuant to the tender offer and/or the merger will be reported to the extent
required by the Code to NEON stockholders and the IRS.

     
Each NEON stockholder that receives our common shares in the offer and/or
the merger is required to file a statement with his, her or its federal income
tax return setting forth the stockholder's basis in the NEON shares surrendered
and the fair market value of our common shares and the proceeds from the cash in
lieu of fractional shares received in the offer and the merger and is required
to retain permanent records of these facts relating to the offer and the merger.


PURPOSE OF THE OFFER; THE MERGER; APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Purpose.
We are making the offer in order to acquire control of at least a
majority of the common stock of NEON on a fully diluted basis.
The offer is the
first step in our acquisition of NEON and is

intended to facilitate the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of NEON
common stock.
We intend, as soon as practicable after completion of the offer,
to have Neel Acquisition Corp. merge with and into NEON.
The purpose of the
merger is to acquire all NEON shares not tendered and exchanged pursuant to the
offer.
In the merger, each then outstanding NEON share (except for NEON shares
held in NEON's treasury and NEON shares owned by Sybase or Neel Acquisition
Corp. and, if applicable, NEON stockholders exercising appraisal rights) would
be converted into the right to receive the same number of Sybase shares as is
paid in the offer subject to appraisal rights that may be exercised under the
Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL").

     
Approval of the Merger.
Under Section 251 of the DGCL, the approval of the
board of directors of a company and the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of its outstanding shares are required to approve and adopt a merger
and a reorganization agreement.
The NEON board of directors has previously
approved the merger.
Accordingly, if we complete the offer, we would have a
sufficient number of NEON shares to approve the merger without the affirmative
vote of any other holder of NEON shares.
Therefore, unless the merger is
consummated in accordance with the short-form merger provisions under the DGCL
described below (in which case no action by the stockholders of NEON, other than
by Sybase acting in its capacity as the majority shareholder, will be required
to consummate the merger), the only remaining corporate action of NEON will be
the approval and adoption of the reorganization agreement by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the outstanding NEON shares.

     
Possible Short-Form Merger.
Section 253 of the DGCL would permit the merger
to occur without a vote of NEON's stockholders (a "short-form merger") if Sybase
were to acquire at least 90% of the outstanding NEON shares in the offer or
otherwise (including as a result of purchases by Sybase during any subsequent
offering period).
If, however, we do not acquire at least 90% of the then
outstanding NEON shares pursuant to the offer or otherwise, and a vote of NEON's
stockholders is required under the DGCL, a longer period of time will be
required to effect the merger.

     
Appraisal Rights.
NEON stockholders do not have appraisal rights in
connection with the offer.

     
If we complete the offer but less than 90% of the outstanding NEON shares
are validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the offer, we will effect a
long-form merger (as described above) as permitted under Section 251 of the
DGCL.
NEON stockholders who have not exchanged their NEON shares in the offer
will not have appraisal rights in connection with a long-form merger.

     
However, if at least 90% of the outstanding NEON shares are validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn in the offer, we will effect a short-form
merger (as described above) as permitted under Section 253 of the DGCL, NEON
stockholders at the time of a short-form merger will have the right under
Section 262 of the DGCL to dissent and demand appraisal of their NEON shares.

Under Section 262, dissenting stockholders who comply with the applicable
statutory procedures will be entitled to receive a judicial determination of the
fair value of their NEON shares (exclusive of any element of value arising from
the accomplishment or expectation of the merger) and to receive payment of this
fair value in cash, together with a fair rate of interest, if any.
In Cede & Co.
and Cinerama, Inc. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of the State of
Delaware construed Section 262 of the DGCL and held that the "accomplishment or
expectation" exclusion from the calculation of fair value set forth in the
preceding sentence is narrow and is designed to eliminate use of pro forma data
and projections of a speculative variety relating to the completion of a merger.

The court held that it is appropriate to include in the calculation of fair
value any known elements of value.
We cannot assure you as to the methodology a
court would use to determine fair value or how a court would select which of the
elements of value are to be included in such a determination.

CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

     The offer is subject to a number of conditions, which are described below:

Minimum Tender Condition

     There must be validly tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the
expiration of the offer a number of NEON shares which will constitute at least a
majority of the total number of outstanding NEON shares on a fully diluted basis
(as though all currently exercisable options or other securities convertible
into or exercisable or exchangeable for NEON shares had been so converted,
exercised or exchanged) as of the date that we accept the NEON shares pursuant
to our offer.
Based on information supplied by NEON, the number of NEON shares
needed to satisfy the minimum tender condition would have been approximately
19,898,416 as of February 15, 2001.


Regulatory Clearance Condition

     This condition has been satisfied as the waiting period under the HSR Act
has been terminated.


Registration Statement Effectiveness Condition

     The registration statement on Form S-4 of which this prospectus is a part
must have become effective under the Securities Act and not be the subject of
any stop order or proceedings seeking a stop order.


Nasdaq Listing Condition

     The shares of Sybase common stock issuable to NEON stockholders in the
offer and the merger must have been approved for listing on the Nasdaq National
Market, subject to official notice of issuance, or be exempt from such
requirement under the applicable laws, regulations and rules of the Nasdaq Stock
Market, Inc.

Tax Opinion Conditions

     Sybase and NEON must have received opinions from their respective counsel,
reasonably satisfactory to both, on the basis of customary facts,
representations and assumptions, that the offer and the merger will be a
tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes; provided that if NEON's
counsel does not render the opinion, this condition shall still be considered
satisfied if counsel to Sybase renders the opinion to NEON.


Other Conditions of the Offer

     The offer is also subject to the conditions that, at the time of acceptance
for exchange of NEON shares pursuant to the offer:

          (1) There shall not have been any action taken, law enacted, judgment
     entered or similar barrier imposed, by any governmental entity, other than
     the application of the waiting period provisions of the HSR Act to the
     offer or the merger, and there shall not be pending any action, suit or
     proceeding by any governmental entity against Sybase, NEON, Neel
     Acquisition Corp. or any of their respective subsidiaries, that, in the
     reasonable judgment of Sybase, is likely, directly or indirectly, to:

             (i) prohibit, or make illegal, the acceptance for payment of or
        payment for NEON common stock or the consummation of the offer or the
        merger,

             (ii) render Neel Acquisition Corp. unable to accept for payment or
        pay for some or all of the shares of NEON common stock,

             (iii) impose material limitations on the ability of Sybase
        effectively to exercise full rights of ownership of the NEON shares,
        including the right to vote the NEON common stock purchased by it on all
        matters properly presented to NEON's stockholders,

             (iv) prohibit or impose any material limitations on Sybase's direct
        or indirect ownership or operation (or that of any of its affiliates) of
        all or a material portion of its or NEON's businesses or assets,

             (v) compel Sybase or its affiliates to dispose of or hold separate
        any portion of the business or assets of NEON or Sybase and their
        respective subsidiaries which would be material in the context of NEON
        and its subsidiaries taken as a whole,

             (vi) oblige NEON, Sybase or any of their respective subsidiaries to
        pay material damages in connection with the transactions contemplated by
        the reorganization agreement or

             (vii) otherwise constitute a material adverse effect on NEON or, as
        a result of the transactions contemplated by the reorganization
        agreement, Sybase;

          (2) NEON shall not have materially breached any of its covenants,
     obligations or agreements under the reorganization agreement; the
     representations and warranties of NEON contained in the reorganization
     agreement shall have been true and correct in all material respects as of
     the date of the reorganization agreement and shall be true and correct in
     all respects on and as of the date of the expiration of the offer with the
     same force and effect as if made on that date, except for certain breaches
     which individually or in the aggregate do not constitute a material adverse
     effect;

          (3) all change of control severance agreements entered into between
     selected NEON officers and NEON and Amendment No. 1 to the Preferred Shares
     Right Agreement, dated August 5, 1998 shall be in full force and effect;
     and

          (4) the reorganization agreement shall not have been terminated in
     accordance with its terms.


REGULATORY CLEARANCES

     We and NEON have agreed pursuant to the reorganization agreement to use all
reasonable efforts to take whatever actions are required to obtain necessary
regulatory approvals with respect to the offer and the merger.
Other than
clearance under the antitrust laws applicable to the offer and the merger which
are described below, the SEC declaring the effectiveness of the registration
statement of which this prospectus is a part and the filing of a certificate of
merger under the DGCL with respect to the merger, we do not believe that any
additional material governmental filings are required with respect to the offer
and the merger.

     
Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR
Act") and the related rules, the merger may not be completed until we and NEON
notify and furnish information to the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice and specified waiting period requirements
have been satisfied.
The notifications required under the HSR Act to the Federal
Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice have
been filed and we received notice of early termination on March 9, 2001.

     
We and NEON also conduct operations in Germany where other regulatory
filings or approvals are required in connection with the completion of the offer
or the merger.
We and NEON have made all necessary filings required by the
German regulatory authorities.
With respect to such filings, we cannot be
certain that the German approvals or consents will be granted and, if these
approvals or consents are received, we cannot be certain as to the date of those
approvals or consents.
In addition, we cannot be certain that we will be able to
cause NEON or its subsidiaries to satisfy or comply with those laws or that
compliance or noncompliance will not have adverse consequences for NEON or any
subsidiary of NEON after purchase of the shares of NEON common stock pursuant to
the offer or the merger.


POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF OUR OFFER

     Reduced Liquidity; Possibly no Longer Included for Quotation.
The tender of
NEON shares pursuant to the offer will reduce the number of holders of NEON
shares and the number of NEON shares that might otherwise trade publicly and
could adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the remaining

NEON shares held by the public.
NEON shares are included for quotation and
principally traded on the Nasdaq National Market.
Depending on the number of
NEON shares acquired pursuant to the offer, following consummation of the offer,
NEON shares may no longer meet the requirements of the Nasdaq National Market
for continued quotation.
The NASD's requirements for continued inclusion in the
Nasdaq National Market, among other things, require that an issuer have either:

     - at least 750,000 publicly held shares, held by at least 400 stockholders
       of round lots, with a market value of at least $5 million and net
       tangible assets of at least $4 million and at least two registered and
       active market makers for the shares; or

     - at least 1,100,000 publicly held shares, held by at least 400
       stockholders of round lots, with a market value of at least $15 million
       and at least four registered and active market markers, and either:

       - a market capitalization of at least $50 million; or

       - total assets and total revenue of at least $50 million each for the
         most recently completed fiscal year or two of the last three most
         recently completed fiscal years.

     
The shares might nevertheless continue to be included in the Nasdaq
National Market with quotations published in the Nasdaq "additional list" or in
one of the "local lists," but if the number of holders of the shares were to
fall below 300, the number of publicly held shares were to fall below 500,000 or
there were not at least two registered and active market makers for the shares,
the NASD's rules provide that the shares would no longer be "qualified" for
Nasdaq reporting and Nasdaq would cease to provide any quotations.
Shares held
directly or indirectly by directors, officers or beneficial owners of more than
10% of the shares are not considered as being publicly held for this purpose.

If, following the closing of offer, the shares of NEON no longer meet the
requirements of the NASD for continued inclusion in the Nasdaq National Market
or in any other tier of Nasdaq and the shares were no longer included in the
Nasdaq National Market or in any other tier of Nasdaq, the market for NEON
shares could be adversely affected.

     
If the NEON shares no longer meet the requirements of the NASD for
continued inclusion in any tier of the Nasdaq, it is possible that the shares
would continue to trade in the over-the-counter market and that price quotations
would be reported by other sources.
The extent of the public market for the NEON
shares and the availability of quotations for NEON shares would, however, depend
upon the number of holders of shares remaining at that time, the interest in
maintaining a market in NEON shares on the part of securities firms, the
possible termination of registration of the shares under the Exchange Act, as
described below, and other factors.
We cannot predict whether the reduction in
the number of NEON shares that might otherwise trade publicly would have an
adverse or beneficial effect on the market price for, or marketability of, the
NEON shares.

     
According to NEON, there were, as of March 8, 2001, approximately
36,848,779 shares of NEON common stock outstanding.

     
Status as "Margin Securities."
The NEON shares are presently "margin
securities" under the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, which has the
effect, among other things, of allowing brokers to extend credit on the
collateral of NEON shares.
Depending on the factors similar to those described
above with respect to market quotations, following consummation of the offer,
the NEON shares may no longer constitute "margin securities" for the purposes of
the Federal Reserve Board's margin regulations, in which event the NEON shares
would not be eligible as collateral for margin loans made by brokers.

     
Registration Under the Exchange Act.
NEON shares are currently registered
under the Exchange Act.
NEON can terminate that registration upon application to
the SEC if the outstanding shares are not listed on a national securities
exchange, quoted on an automated inter-dealer quotation system or if there are
fewer than 300 holders of record of NEON shares.
Termination of registration of
the NEON shares under the Exchange Act would reduce the information that NEON
must furnish to its stockholders and to the SEC and would make certain
provisions of the Exchange Act, such as the short-swing profit recovery

provisions of Section 16(b) and the requirement of furnishing a proxy statement
in connection with stockholders meetings pursuant to Section 14(a) and the
related requirement of furnishing an annual report to stockholders, no longer
applicable with respect to NEON shares.
In addition, if NEON shares are no
longer registered under the Exchange Act, the requirements of Rule 13e-3 under
the Exchange Act with respect to "going-private" transactions would no longer be
applicable to NEON.
Furthermore, the ability of "affiliates" of NEON and persons
holding "restricted securities" of NEON to dispose of these securities pursuant
to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be impaired or eliminated.
If
registration of the shares under the Exchange Act were terminated, they would no
longer be eligible for Nasdaq reporting or for continued inclusion on the
Federal Reserve Board's list of "margin securities.
"

     Except as set forth herein, neither we nor, to the best of our knowledge,
any of our directors, executive officers or other affiliates has any contract,

arrangement, understanding or relationship concerning the transfer or the voting
of any such securities, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or
calls, guaranties of loans, guaranties against loss or the giving or withholding
of proxies.
Except as described herein, there have been no contacts,
negotiations or transactions since January 1, 1997, between us or, to the best
of our knowledge, any of our directors, executive officers or other affiliates
on the one hand, and NEON or its affiliates, on the other hand, concerning a
merger, consolidation or acquisition, a tender offer or other acquisition of
securities, an election of directors, or a sale or other transfer of a material
amount of assets.
Neither we nor, to the best of our knowledge, any of our
directors, executive officers or other affiliates has since January 1, 1997 had
any transaction with NEON or any of its officers, directors or affiliates that
would require disclosure under the rules and regulations of the SEC applicable
to the offer.

     
Neither we nor, to the best of our knowledge, any of our directors,
executive officers or other affiliates beneficially owns or has any right to
acquire, directly or indirectly, any NEON shares and neither we nor, to the best
of our knowledge, any of our directors, executive officers or other affiliates
has effected any transaction in the NEON shares during the past 60 days.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     The merger of Sybase and NEON will be accounted for as a "purchase," as
that term is used under generally accepted accounting principles, commonly
referred to as "GAAP", for accounting and financial reporting purposes.
NEON
will be treated as the acquired corporation for these purposes.
NEON's assets,
liabilities and other items will be adjusted to their estimated fair value on
the closing date of the merger and combined with the historical book values of
the assets and liabilities of Sybase.
Applicable income tax effects of these
adjustments will be included as a component of the combined company's deferred
tax asset or liability.
The difference between the estimated fair value of the
assets, liabilities and other items (adjusted as discussed above) and the
purchase price will be recorded as an intangible asset and amortized against the
combined company's earnings over six years following completion of the merger.

For further information concerning the amount of goodwill or other intangibles
to be recorded in connection with the merger and the amortization of that
goodwill, see "Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial
Statements" on page 30.

     
Sybase has prepared the unaudited pro forma financial information contained
in this prospectus using the purchase accounting method to account for the offer
and the merger.
See "Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial
Statements" on page 26.

connection with its services as financial advisor, including certain liabilities

The information contained in the Information Statement attached as Schedule
I to the Schedule 14D-9 of NEON dated March 15, 2001 is incorporated herein by
reference.

     
Except as described in this prospectus or incorporated herein by reference
as a result of the previous sentence, as of the date of this prospectus, there

TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS

     
The reorganization agreement provides that each outstanding option to
purchase shares of NEON common stock under the NEON stock option plans will be
assumed upon consummation of the merger by Sybase and shall thereafter be
exercisable for that number of shares of Sybase common stock equal to the number
of shares of NEON common stock for which it is exercisable multiplied by the
exchange ratio rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Sybase
common stock.
In addition, the per share exercise price of each assumed option
shall be determined by dividing the original exercise price by the exchange
ratio rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

     
According to the terms of the NEON 1995 Stock Option Plan, 1998
Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan and 1997 Director Option Plan, 12 months of
unvested options held by employees, directors and officers of NEON shall
accelerate in the event that the employee, director or officer is terminated
without cause or as a result of constructive termination at any time within 12
months following consummation of the offer.

     
In addition, George F. (Rick) Adam, Jr., Frederick T. Horn, Peter
Hoversten, Leonard Goldstein and Stephen E. Webb and Dr. Patrick J. Fortune hold
unvested options that will become exercisable in full upon consummation of the
Offer.
(See "-- Certain Executive Agreements" below.)

     
The following table sets forth, with respect to each of the executive
officers and non-employee directors of NEON:

     - the number of shares of NEON common stock subject to options held by such
       persons that will be exercisable immediately upon the consummation of the
       merger (including options that are currently exercisable as well as
       options which will become exercisable in connection with the transactions
       contemplated by the reorganization agreement);

     - the range of exercise prices of the options held by such persons;

     - the weighted average exercise price of the options held by such persons;
       and

     - the cash value (i.e., the total stock value less the exercise price) of
       all options held by such persons which are in-the-money (i.e. represent a
       positive spread between the respective exercise prices of the options and
       the per share of NEON common stock value of the consideration to be
       received in the offer and the merger), based upon an assumed per share of
       NEON common stock amount of

       consideration to be received by NEON stockholders in the offer and the
       merger of $6.54 in Sybase common stock, based on the last sales price of
       Sybase common stock on March 14, 2001 of $16.88.

CERTAIN EXECUTIVE AGREEMENTS

     In connection with the negotiation of the reorganization agreement, Sybase
required that the change of control severance agreements between NEON and each
of Messrs. Adam, Horn, Hoversten, Goldstein and Webb and Dr. Fortune be amended
with new terms to be effective upon the consummation of the offer.
Each of the
amended change of control severance agreements provides that all NEON options
granted to such person prior to the date of the amended agreements will vest and
all restrictions on restricted stock held by such person will lapse upon
consummation of the offer.
The amended agreements of Mr. Goldstein and Mr. Webb
provide for a cash payment of $750,000 to be paid to each of them upon
consummation of the offer.
The amended agreements of Mr. Horn, Mr. Hoversten and
Dr. Fortune provide cash payments of $1,092,000, $390,000 and $1,560,000,
respectively, based upon their continued employment with Sybase following the
consummation of the offer.
The cash payments to Mr. Horn, Mr. Hoversten and Dr.
Fortune are payable as follows: 5/13 on the 12-month anniversary of the
consummation of the offer, 3/13 on the 18-month anniversary of the consummation
of the offer, and the remaining 5/13 on the 24-month anniversary of the
consummation of the offer.
If any of Mr. Horn, Mr. Hoversten or Dr. Fortune is
terminated by Sybase without cause prior to the 24-month anniversary of the
consummation of the offer, he will receive his respective cash payment (less any
amounts previously paid) in a lump sum payment.
The amended agreement of Mr.
Adam does not provide for a cash payment.

     
This summary of the terms of the amended change of control severance
agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the
amended change of control severance agreements, which have been filed as
exhibits (e)(6) through (e)(11) of NEON's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement
on Schedule 14D-9 and are incorporated herein by reference.

executive officers is included in Schedule I of NEON's
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 .

     
Also, Dr. Franz Koepper is a party to a Change of Control Severance
Agreement with NEON, dated January 30, 2001, which provides that if Dr. Koepper
is terminated other than "for cause" (as defined

therein) within 18 months following the consummation of the offer, Dr. Koepper
will receive a lump sum cash payment equal to 100% of his annual compensation,
accelerated vesting of all NEON options held and, for a period of one year
following the date of termination, continued employee benefits.
This summary of
the terms of Dr. Koepper's Change of Control Severance Agreement is qualified in

with NEON is included in Schedule I of NEON's Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9.

     
In connection with the negotiation of the reorganization agreement, Sybase
required that Messrs. Adam, Horn and Hoversten and Dr. Fortune enter into
employment and non-competition agreements in order to help retain these officers
following the merger.
These agreements, which become effective only upon the
effective date of the merger, provide for initial base salaries of $400,000 for
Mr. Adam, $400,000 for Dr. Fortune, $300,000 for Mr. Horn and $250,000 for Mr.
Hoversten.
The agreements provide for annual target bonuses of up to $200,000 in
the cases of Mr. Adam and Dr. Fortune, up to $120,000 in the case of Mr. Horn,
and up to $100,000 in the case of Mr. Hoversten.
The agreements provide that
upon the effective date of the merger, Messrs. Adam, Horn and Hoversten and Dr.
Fortune will be granted stock options to purchase 155,000, 125,000, 125,000 and
125,000 shares of Sybase common stock, respectively, 1/8 of which will vest on
the six-month anniversary of the merger (based upon continued employment) and
1/48 of which will vest monthly thereafter through the 48th month following the
effective date of the Merger (based upon continued employment).
The agreements
for Messrs. Adam, Horn and Hoversten and Dr. Fortune provide that in the event
they are terminated "without cause," they will receive (provided the officer
executes a release in favor of Sybase) a severance payment as follows: an amount
equal to 18 months of salary and bonus in the case of Mr. Adam, an amount equal
to the senior vice president severance package then applicable to such employees
in the case of Dr. Fortune and an amount equal to the vice president severance
package then applicable to such employees in the cases of Mr. Horn and Mr.
Hoversten.
Each of the agreements also provides for certain restrictive
covenants on behalf of the officers in favor of Sybase, including provisions
regarding noncompetition, nonsolicitation and nondisclosure of confidential
information.

     
This summary of the terms of the employment and non-competition agreements
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the employment

     From and after the effective time of the merger, Sybase will fulfill and
honor in all respects the obligations of NEON pursuant to the provisions of each
indemnification agreement between NEON and its directors or officers in effect
prior to the effective time of the merger and the indemnification provisions of
the NEON certificate of incorporation in effect as of the date of the
reorganization agreement (or indemnification provisions at least as favorable as
the provisions of the NEON certificate of incorporation).
Furthermore, Sybase
has agreed to maintain for six years after the effective time of the Merger,
subject to certain cost limitations, a policy of directors' and officers'
liability insurance covering the directors and officers of NEON.

          
THE REORGANIZATION AGREEMENT AND THE STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS

     
The following descriptions of the reorganization agreement and the
stockholder agreements describe the material terms of such agreements but does
not purport to describe all the terms of such agreements.
The complete text of
the reorganization agreement, and the form of the stockholder agreement are

attached as Annex A and Annex B, respectively, to this prospectus.
All
stockholders are urged to read the reorganization agreement and the form of the
stockholder agreement in their entirety because they are the legal documents
that govern the offer and the merger.


THE OFFER

     Terms of the Offer.
The reorganization agreement provides for the
commencement by Neel Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sybase, of
this offer to exchange all outstanding shares of NEON common stock for shares of
Sybase common stock.
The reorganization agreement provides for the consideration
that we will pay in the offer, including the exchange ratio of 0.3878 of a share
of Sybase common stock for each share of NEON common stock.
The reorganization
agreement provides that the initial expiration date of the offer is the
twentieth business day following commencement of the offer and that the offer is
subject to a number of conditions, including the minimum tender condition.
For a
description of those matters, refer to the discussion under "The Offer" on page
32 of this prospectus.

     
The reorganization agreement prohibits Neel Acquisition Corp., without the
consent of NEON, from amending or waiving the minimum tender condition or
amending the offer to change the form or amount of consideration to be paid,
decreasing the number of shares of NEON common stock sought in the offer,
imposing additional conditions to the offer, extending the expiration date of
the offer except as described below or making any other change which is adverse
to the holders of the shares of NEON common stock.

     
Mandatory Extensions of the Offer.
If any of the conditions to the offer is
not satisfied or waived on any scheduled expiration date of the offer, Neel
Acquisition Corp. will extend the offer for successive extension periods of not
more than 10 business days until all conditions to the offer are satisfied or
waived; provided that Neel Acquisition Corp. is not required to extend the offer
beyond June 30, 2001.

     
Optional Extensions of the Offer.
Neel Acquisition Corp. will have the
right to extend the offer (i) after acceptance of shares in the initial offering
period, as it may be extended, for a further period of time by means of a
subsequent offering period not to exceed 20 business days for the purpose of
having Sybase and Neel Acquisition Corp. collectively own at least 90% of the
outstanding shares of NEON common stock and (ii) for any period required by any
rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff applicable
to the offer.

     
Prompt Payment for NEON Shares after the Closing of the Offer.
Subject to
the conditions of the offer, Neel Acquisition Corp. will accept for payment and
pay for, promptly after the expiration of the offer, all shares of NEON common
stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the offer.


THE MERGER

     The Merger.
The reorganization agreement provides that Neel Acquisition
Corp. will be merged with and into NEON no later than the second business day
following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the
reorganization agreement unless the parties agree to another date.
Under the
terms of the reorganization agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each
share of NEON common stock will be converted into the right to receive from Neel
Acquisition Corp. 0.3878 of a share of Sybase common stock for each share of
NEON common stock, the same per share consideration paid to holders of NEON
common stock who exchanged their NEON shares in the offer.
Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the merger consideration will not be payable in respect of NEON
shares held by NEON, Sybase or Neel Acquisition Corp.

     Effective Time of the Merger.
The merger will become effective upon the
filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of Delaware or
such later time as is agreed by NEON and Sybase and specified in the certificate
of merger.
The filing of the certificate of merger will take place as soon as
practicable on or after the closing date of the merger.


NEON BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Upon the acceptance for exchange of shares of NEON common stock pursuant to
the offer, Sybase will be entitled to designate a number of directors of NEON
(rounded up to the next whole number) that equals the product of (i) the total
number of directors on NEON's board of directors (giving effect to the election
of additional directors) and (ii) the percentage that the number of shares
beneficially owned by Sybase and Neel Acquisition Corp. bears to the total
number of shares of NEON common stock outstanding.
Until the merger has become
effective, NEON's board of directors shall include at least two members who were
directors of NEON prior to the consummation of the offer.
The reorganization
agreement provides that, prior to the effective time of the merger, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the continuing NEON directors will be required
for NEON to:

     - amend or terminate the reorganization agreement;

     - waive any rights, benefits or remedies under the reorganization
       agreement;

     - extend the time for performance of Sybase's or Neel Acquisition Corp.'s
       obligations under the reorganization agreement; or

     - approve any other action by NEON which is reasonably likely to adversely
       affect the interests of NEON's stockholders with respect to the
       transactions contemplated by the reorganization agreement.


TREATMENT OF NEON STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK

     At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding NEON option,
regardless of the extent vested, shall become an option to acquire, on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under the NEON stock option, the same
number of shares of Sybase common stock as the holder of the NEON option would
have been entitled to receive pursuant to the reorganization agreement had the
holder exercised the NEON option in full immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger multiplied by the exchange ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole number.
The price per share shall equal the per share exercise price at
which the NEON option was exercisable immediately prior to the effective time,
divided by the exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

     
Sybase has agreed to take all action necessary to implement the above,
including the reservation for issuance and listing of a sufficient number of
shares of Sybase common stock for delivery upon exercise of these assumed
options.
Sybase has agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-8 with
respect to the shares of Sybase common stock subject to the above options as
soon as is reasonably practicable (and in any event within 10 business days)
after the effective time of the merger.

     
Shares of Sybase common stock that are issued upon conversion of shares of
NEON common stock that immediately prior to the effective time of the merger are
unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other
agreement will continue to be unvested or subject to the same options, risks or
other conditions after the effective time of the merger unless the relevant
agreement provides that the option, risk or condition will be altered or will
terminate on consummation of the merger.


COVENANTS AND REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     Reasonable Efforts.
The reorganization agreement provides that each of
Sybase and NEON will use its reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary to
close the offer and the merger.

     
Conduct of Business Pending the Appointment of Directors.
The
reorganization agreement obligates NEON, until the first acceptance for exchange
of shares of NEON common stock pursuant to the offer, to conduct its operations
in the ordinary course of business.
The reorganization agreement expressly
restricts the ability of NEON to engage in certain material transactions, such
as purchases and sales of assets or the sale or redemption of outstanding
securities of NEON, without the prior written consent of Sybase.

     
No Solicitation of Alternative Transactions.
The reorganization agreement
provides that, except in the circumstances described below, NEON will not,
directly or indirectly:

     - solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to assist, facilitate,
       induce or encourage the making, submission or announcement of, any
       Acquisition Proposal (as defined below);

     - engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
       knowingly furnish any information relating to NEON or any of NEON's
       subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books
       or records of NEON or any of NEON's subsidiaries to any person that has
       made, or knowingly take any other action to assist or facilitate any
       inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may
       reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;

     - approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or

     - enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract,
       agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any
       Acquisition Proposal.

     
However, the reorganization agreement does provide that in response to an
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach by NEON of
its obligations not to solicit alternative transactions and following delivery
to Sybase of notice of the Acquisition Proposal, NEON's board of directors may,
subject to certain conditions:

     - engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with or furnish to
       any third party that makes a bona fide Acquisition Proposal nonpublic
       information relating to NEON or any of NEON's subsidiaries under a
       confidentiality agreement no less favorable than the confidentiality
       agreement between NEON and Sybase and/or

     - following receipt of such an Acquisition Proposal, withhold, withdraw,
       modify or change in a manner adverse to Sybase or fail to make its
       recommendation to its stockholders of the offer and the merger,

if, in each case, the NEON board of directors concludes in good faith (after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that
the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below) and
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that it is necessary to take such action(s) in order to satisfy its fiduciary

"Acquisition Proposal" means any offer or proposal by a third party
relating to:

     - any acquisition or purchase from NEON by any person or group of more than
       15% of the outstanding voting securities of NEON or any of its
       subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
       would result in any person or group beneficially owning 15% or more of
       the outstanding voting securities of NEON or any of its subsidiaries or
       any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
       involving NEON pursuant to which the stockholders of NEON immediately
       preceding that transaction would hold less than 85% of the equity
       interests in the surviving or resulting entity of that transaction;

     - any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business),

"Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal not
received in violation of the solicitation prohibitions of the reorganization
agreement for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of NEON common stock
on terms that the NEON board of directors determines in good faith by a majority
vote, after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal, are more favorable to the NEON stockholders than the offer
and the merger; provided that no proposal shall be deemed a "Superior Proposal"
if any

financing required to consummate the transaction contemplated in that offer is
not committed and is not likely in the good faith judgment of the NEON board of
directors to be obtained by that party on a timely basis.

     
Antitrust Laws.
Each of Sybase and NEON will take those lawful actions that
are necessary to make the filings required under any applicable antitrust laws
in connection with the reorganization agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the reorganization agreement.

     
Employee Benefits.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, we have
agreed to give credit under all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements maintained by us or the surviving corporation (other than
sabbatical benefits) to each employee of NEON or its subsidiaries for all
service with NEON or its subsidiaries.
In addition, we have agreed to provide
employees of NEON and its subsidiaries who are retained by us with the benefits
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those benefits provided to our
similarly situated employees; provided that such benefits are available on
reasonable terms, we are permitted to make any changes required by law and there
shall be no duplication of benefits.

     Representations and Warranties.
The reorganization agreement contains a
number of customary representations and warranties relating to each of the
parties and their ability to consummate the offer and the merger.
All
representations and warranties of each party expire upon the filing of the
certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

     - by Sybase prior to the first acceptance for exchange of shares of NEON
       common stock as described under "-- Termination of the Reorganization
       Agreement -- Termination by Sybase"; or

     - by NEON as described under "-- Termination of the Reorganization
       Agreement -- Termination by NEON,"

then NEON shall be required to pay to Sybase a termination fee in an amount
equal to $15 million in immediately available funds.

     
If Sybase or NEON terminates the reorganization agreement as described in
paragraphs (1)(i) and (1)(ii) under "-- Termination of the Reorganization
Agreement -- Termination by either Sybase or NEON" prior to the first acceptance
of shares of NEON common stock in the offer and no event described under

occurred, and (i) after the date of the reorganization agreement and prior to
the date of termination of the reorganization agreement any Acquisition Proposal
has been publicly announced or has become publicly known and not withdrawn at
least 5 business days prior to the termination by NEON and (ii) within 9 months
following termination of the reorganization agreement either a Company
Acquisition occurs or NEON enters into an agreement or binding letter of intent
providing for a Company Acquisition (and such Company Acquisition is later
consummated), then NEON shall pay to Sybase, no later than one business day
after Sybase demands payment, $15 million in immediately available funds.

     
For purposes of the preceding paragraph, "Company Acquisition" means any of
the following transactions (other than the offer and the merger):

       transaction;

     - a sale or other disposition by NEON of a business or assets representing

       offer or an exchange offer or issuance by NEON), directly or indirectly,
       of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of
       shares representing in excess of 50% of the voting power of the then
       outstanding shares of capital stock of NEON.


AMENDMENTS

     The reorganization agreement may be amended by action taken by Sybase, Neel
Acquisition Corp. and NEON at any time prior to the closing of the merger.
The
reorganization agreement provides that if Sybase designates directors of NEON
prior to the effective time of the merger, any amendment of the reorganization
agreement, any termination of the reorganization agreement by NEON, any
extension by NEON of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of Sybase or Neel Acquisition Corp. under the reorganization
agreement, waiver by NEON of any rights of NEON under the reorganization
agreement or any approval of any other action by NEON which is reasonably likely
to adversely affect the interests of the NEON stockholders with respect to the
transactions provided for under the reorganization agreement, will require the
concurrence of a majority of the NEON directors then in office who were not
designated by Sybase.


THE STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS

     Parties.
As an inducement for Sybase and Neel Acquisition Corp. to enter
into the reorganization agreement, immediately prior to the signing of the

affiliated stockholders entered into stockholder agreements with Sybase.

     
The obligations of those stockholders under the stockholder agreements
cover, in the aggregate, 4,408,112 NEON shares, which represented approximately
12% of the outstanding NEON shares as of February 15, 2001 (approximately 14%
after giving effect to all options which will become exercisable within 60 days
of February 15, 2001).

     
Agreement to Tender.
Each stockholder who signed a stockholder agreement
agreed to tender in the offer and not withdraw that portion of his or her shares
of NEON covered by such stockholder agreement as well as any additional NEON
shares acquired by such stockholders after the date of the stockholder
agreement.

     
Proxy.
Each stockholder who signed a stockholder agreement granted Sybase
or any nominee of Sybase a proxy to vote or grant a consent with respect to that
portion of that stockholder's NEON shares covered by the stockholder agreement:

     - in favor of the adoption and approval of the reorganization agreement and
       the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the reorganization
       agreement;

     - against the approval of any Acquisition Proposal;

     - against any merger, consolidation, business combination or sale of assets
       of NEON with any party other than Sybase;

     - against the reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation or winding up
       of NEON or any other extraordinary transaction involving NEON;

     - against the corporate action that would prevent or delay consummation of
       the offer, the merger or any other transaction contemplated by the
       reorganization agreement; or

     - against any other matters relating to the foregoing.

     Termination.
All obligations under the stockholder agreements terminate
upon the earlier of (i) the effective time of the merger or (ii) the termination
of the reorganization agreement in accordance with its terms.

STATE ANTI-TAKEOVER LAWS

     Under Delaware law, a Delaware corporation generally may not engage in a
"business combination" with an "interested stockholder" for a period of three
years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder.

"Business combination" includes a merger, consolidation, asset sale or other
transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder.

"Interested stockholder" is a person who, together with affiliates and
associates, owns, or within three years, did own 15% or more of the
corporation's voting stock.
This prohibition does not apply if

     - the corporation has elected not to be governed by these restrictions;

     - prior to the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder,
       the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business
       combination or the transaction resulting in the stockholder's becoming an
       interested stockholder;

     - upon consummation of the transaction resulting in the stockholder's
       becoming an interested stockholder, the stockholder owns at least 85% of
       the outstanding voting stock of the corporation, excluding voting stock
       owned by directors who are also officers and certain employee stock
       plans; or

     - at or subsequent to the time that the stockholder became an interested
       stockholder, the business combination is approved by the board and
       authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by
       written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the
       outstanding voting stock that the interested stockholder does not own.

     
Neither Sybase nor NEON has elected not to be governed by these
restrictions.
The NEON board of directors has taken the necessary action to make
the above restrictions on business combinations inapplicable to the offer and
the merger.

                               INDEX OF EXHIBITS

Exhibit A      Form of Company Stockholder Agreement
Exhibit B      Form of Company Affiliate Agreement
Exhibit C      Form of Employment and Non-Competition Agreement

                                       iii

                      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

     This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of February 20, 2001, among Sybase, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Neel Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and New Era of Networks, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Company").

                                    
RECITALS

     
The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and Company have
approved this Agreement, and declared advisable that Merger Sub make an exchange
offer (the "Offer") to exchange shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") for all of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Company Common Stock"), of
Company (the "Shares") and the merger of Merger Sub with and into Company (the
"Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("Delaware
Law").

     
A. It is intended that, for United States federal income tax purposes, the
Offer and the Merger (together, the "Transaction") shall be treated as an
integrated transaction and shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code").
For accounting purposes, the Merger is intended to be accounted for as
a "purchase" under United States generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP").

     
B. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition and
inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement: (1) the
directors, executive officers and certain stockholders of Company are entering
into Stockholder Agreements in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit
A (the "Company Stockholder Agreements"), (2) the Company Affiliates (as defined
in Section 5.15) are entering into Company Affiliate Agreements in substantially
the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Company Affiliate Agreements"), and
(3) George Adam, Patrick Fortune, Fredrick Horn and Peter Hoversten are entering
into Employment and Non-Competition Agreements in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C.

     C. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, (i) certain
officers of Company have entered into amendments to the Change of Control
Severance Agreements to which such officers are party to, among other things,
waive certain severance and other rights that may be triggered as a direct or
indirect result of the transactions contemplated hereby (each, a "Severance
Agreement Amendment"), and (ii) Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company have amended (the "Rights Plan Amendment") the Preferred Shares Right
Agreement, dated August 5, 1998 (the "Company Rights Plan"), to render the
Rights thereunder inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Company Stockholder
Agreements.

     
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree
as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                            THE OFFER
AND THE MERGER

     SECTION 1.01  The Offer.
(a) Provided that (i) this Agreement shall not
have been terminated in accordance with Section 7.01 and (ii) none of the events
set forth in Annex I hereto that would entitle Parent and Merger Sub to fail to
consummate the Offer shall have occurred and be continuing, Merger Sub shall, as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof, commence the Offer.
Each Share
accepted by Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer shall be exchanged for the right to
receive from Merger Sub that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio.
For

                                       A-1

purposes of this Agreement, the "Exchange Ratio" shall mean 0.3878.
The initial
expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth business day following
commencement of the Offer.
The Offer shall be subject to the condition that
there shall be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer prior
to the expiration date of the Offer and not withdrawn a number of Shares which,
together with the Shares then owned by Parent and Merger Sub (if any) represents
at least a majority of the total number of outstanding Shares, assuming the
exercise of all currently exercisable options, rights and convertible securities
(if any) and the issuance of all Shares that Company is obligated to issue
thereunder (such total number of outstanding Shares being hereinafter referred
to as the "Fully Diluted Shares") (the "Minimum Condition") and to the other
conditions set forth in Annex I hereto.
Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve
the right to waive the conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the
terms or conditions of the Offer; provided that, without the prior written
consent of Company, no change may be made which decreases the number of Shares
sought in the Offer, changes the form or amount of consideration to be paid,
imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex I,
changes or waives the Minimum Condition or any of the other conditions set forth
in Annex I, extends the Offer (except as set forth in the following two
sentences), or makes any other change to any of the terms and conditions to the
Offer which is adverse to the holders of Shares.
Subject to the terms of the
Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction (or waiver to the extent permitted
by this Agreement) of the conditions to the Offer, Merger Sub shall accept for
payment all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as
soon as practicable after the applicable expiration date of the Offer and shall
pay for all such Shares promptly after acceptance; provided that (x) Merger Sub
shall extend the Offer for successive extension periods not in excess of 10
business days per extension if, at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer or
any extension thereof, any of the conditions to the Offer shall not have been
satisfied, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived, and (y)
Merger Sub may extend the Offer if and to the extent required by the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
In
addition, Merger Sub may extend the Offer after the acceptance of Shares
thereunder for a further period of time by means of a subsequent offering period
under Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), of not more than 20 business days to meet the
objective (which is not a condition to the Offer) that there be validly
tendered, in accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to the expiration
date of the Offer (as so extended) and not withdrawn a number of Shares which,
together with Shares then owned by Parent and Merger Sub, represents at least
90% of the Fully Diluted Shares.
No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
will be issued in connection with the exchange of Parent Common Stock for Shares
upon consummation of the Offer, but in lieu thereof each tendering stockholder
who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
that otherwise would be received by such holder) in the Offer shall receive from
Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
equal to the product obtained by multiplying such fraction by the closing price
of one (1) share of Parent Common Stock on the first date Merger Sub accepts
Shares for exchange in the Offer, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market
("NASDAQ").

     (b) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register
the offer and sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the
"Registration Statement").
The Registration Statement will include a preliminary
prospectus containing the information required under Rule 14d-4(b) promulgated
under the Exchange Act (the "Preliminary Prospectus").
As soon as practicable on
the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file with
the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer which
will contain or incorporate by reference all or part of the Preliminary
Prospectus and form of the related letter of transmittal (together with any
supplements or amendments thereto, collectively the "Offer Documents") and (ii)
cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares.
Parent,
Merger Sub and Company each agree promptly to correct any information provided
by it for use in the Registration Statement or the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect.

Parent and Merger Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
holders of Shares, in

                                       A-2

each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws.

Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule TO, the Registration Statement and the Offer Documents
prior to their being filed with the SEC.
Parent agrees to provide Company and
its counsel with any comments Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive in
writing from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents as soon as
practicable after receipt of such written comments.

     
SECTION 1.02  Company Action.
(a) Company hereby consents to the Offer and
represents that its Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held on or
prior to the date hereof, has by the unanimous vote of all directors present and
voting (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are consistent with and in
furtherance of the long-term business strategy of Company and are advisable and
are fair to and in the best interest of Company and its stockholders, (ii)
approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger and the Company Stockholder Agreements and
the transactions contemplated thereby, which approval constitutes approval under
Section 203 of Delaware Law such that the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and the Company Stockholder Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, are not and shall not be subject to
any restriction pursuant to Section 203 of Delaware Law, and (iii) resolved to
recommend acceptance of the Offer and approval and adoption of this Agreement by
Company's stockholders (the recommendations referred to in this clause (iii) are
collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "Recommendations").
Company
has been advised that all of its directors and executive officers and each
stockholder party to the Company Stockholder Agreements currently intend to
tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer.

     
(b) As soon as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced, Company
will file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (the "Schedule 14D-9")
which shall include the opinion of Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation
referred to in Section 2.20 and, subject to Section 5.03(b), shall include the
Recommendations; provided, however, that prior to the Appointment Time the Board
of Directors of Company may withhold, withdraw, modify or change in a manner
adverse to Parent, or fail to make, its Recommendations in accordance with the
terms of Section 5.03(b).
Company, Parent and Merger Sub each agree promptly to
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to
the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect.
Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9
as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws.
Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to its being filed with the
SEC.
Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel with any comments Company
or its counsel receives in writing from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 as soon as practicable after receipt of such written comments.

     (c) Company will promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub with a list of its
stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists of
securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case as of
the most recent practicable date, and will provide to Parent and Merger Sub such
additional information (including, without limitation, updated lists of
stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such other
assistance as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request in connection with the
Offer.

     
SECTION 1.03  Directors.
(a) Effective upon the acceptance for payment by
Merger Sub of Shares pursuant to the Offer (the "Appointment Time"), Parent
shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next
whole number, on Company's Board of Directors that equals the product of (i) the
total number of directors on Company's Board of Directors (giving effect to the
election of any additional directors pursuant to this Section 1.03) and (ii) the
percentage that the number of Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub (including
Shares accepted for payment) bears to the total number of Shares outstanding,
and Company shall take all action reasonably necessary to cause Parent's
designees to be elected or appointed to Company's Board of Directors, including,
without limitation, increasing the

                                       A-3

number of directors, or seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent
directors, or both; provided that, prior to the Effective Time, Company's Board
of Directors shall always have at least two members who were directors of
Company prior to consummation of the Offer (each, a "Continuing Director").
If
the number of Continuing Directors is reduced to less than two for any reason
prior to the Effective Time, the remaining and departing Continuing Directors
shall be entitled to designate a person to fill the vacancy.
Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Parent's designees are elected to
Company's Board of Directors prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote
of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required for Company to (a)
amend or terminate this Agreement or agree or consent to any amendment or
termination of this Agreement, (b) waive any of Company's rights, benefits or
remedies hereunder, (c) extend the time for performance of Parent's and Merger
Sub's respective obligations hereunder, or (d) approve any other action by
Company which is reasonably likely to adversely affect the interests of the
stockholders of Company (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their affiliates
(other than Company and its subsidiaries)), with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

     (b) Company's obligations to appoint designees to its Board of Directors
shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated
thereunder.
Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section
1.03 and Rule 14f-l in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.03
and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to Company
and its officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-l. Parent will supply to Company in writing and be solely responsible for
any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and
affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

     
SECTION 1.04  The Merger.
At the Effective Time (as defined in Section
1.05) and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
Company (the "Merger"), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and Company shall continue as the surviving corporation.
Company as the
surviving corporation after the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as
the "Surviving Corporation."

     SECTION 1.05  Effective Time; Closing.
Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, Company and Merger Sub shall cause the Merger to be consummated by

agreed in writing by Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of
Merger) being the "Effective Time") as soon as practicable on or after the
Closing Date (as herein defined).
Unless the context otherwise requires, the
term "Agreement" as used herein refers collectively to this Agreement and Plan
of Reorganization and the Certificate of Merger.
The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati,
Professional Corporation, One Market, Spear Street Tower, Suite 3300, San
Francisco, California, at a time and date to be specified by the parties, which
shall be no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article VI, or at such other time, date and
location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the "Closing Date").

     
SECTION 1.06  Effect of the Merger.
At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions
of Delaware Law.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation,
and all debts, liabilities and duties of Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

     
SECTION 1.07  Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.

     (a) Certificate of Incorporation.
At the Effective Time, subject to the
provisions of Section 5.14 hereof, the Certificate of Incorporation of Company
shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be the same in substance as the
Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time (except that the name of Company shall remain "New Era of
Networks, Inc."), and such Certificate of Incorporation of Company, as so
amended and restated, shall be the Certificate of

                                       A-4

Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with Delaware Law and such Certificate of Incorporation.

     (b) Bylaws.
At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of Section
5.14 hereof, the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be adopted as the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.

     
SECTION 1.08  Directors and Officers.
The initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time until their successors shall have been duly elected and
qualified.
The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time until their
successors shall have been duly elected and qualified.

     
SECTION 1.09  Effect on Capital Stock.
Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of
the following securities, the following shall occur:

          (a) Conversion of Company Common Stock.
Each share of Company Common
     Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
     than any share of Company Common Stock to be canceled and extinguished
     pursuant to Section 1.09(b)) will be automatically converted (subject to
     Sections 1.09(e) and (f)) into the right to receive a fraction of a share
     of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (together with the cash
     in lieu of Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock as specified below, the
     "Merger Consideration") upon surrender of the certificate representing such
     share of Company Common Stock in the manner set forth in Section 1.10
     hereof (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon
     delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner set forth in
     Section 1.12 hereof).
Except to the extent otherwise provided for in any
     plan or agreement listed on Section 2.03 or 2.18 of the Company Schedule
     applicable to such shares, any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a
     repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any
     applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with
     Company, then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such
     shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the
     same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the
     certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may
     accordingly be marked with appropriate legends.
Company shall take all
     action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective
     Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other
     right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other
     agreement.

          (b) Cancellation of Company-Owned and Parent-Owned Stock.
Each share
     of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Company or any direct or indirect
     wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or Company, immediately prior to the
     Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
     thereof.

          
(c) Stock Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plans.
(i)
At the Effective
     Time, all options to purchase Company Common Stock then outstanding under
     Company's 1995 Stock Option Plan, 1997 Director Option Plan, 1998
     Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan, Century Analysis, Inc. 1996
