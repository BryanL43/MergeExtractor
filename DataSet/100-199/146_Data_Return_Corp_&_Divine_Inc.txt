Based
on the maximum number of shares of divine class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, that divine may be required to issue in the merger, calculated as the product of
(a) 46,069,666, which is the sum of (i) the aggregate number of outstanding shares of common stock, $0.001 par value, of Data Return Corporation on November 14, 2001 and
(ii) the aggregate number of common shares of Data Return issuable pursuant to all outstanding employee and director stock options and warrants, multiplied by (b) the exchange ratio of
1.9876 shares of divine common stock for each common share of Data Return.

Estimated
solely for the purpose of calculating the registration fee pursuant to Rule 457(f)(1) and Rule 457(c) on the basis of the market value of the common shares of Data Return
to be exchanged in the merger, as the product of (a) $0.83 (the average of the high and low sales prices per common share of Data Return as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on November
14, 2001), multiplied by (b) 46,069,666, which is the estimated maximum number of common shares of Data Return that may be exchanged in the merger. 
(3)
Each
share of divine class A common stock is accompanied by a series A junior participating preferred stock purchase right that trades with the divine common stock. The value
attributed to those rights, if any, is reflected in the market price of the divine common stock. Prior to the occurrence of certain events, none of which has occurred as of this date, the rights will
not be exercisable or evidenced separately from the divine common stock. 

The Registrant hereby amends this Registration Statement on such date or dates as may be necessary to delay its effective
date until the Registrant shall file a further amendment that specifically states that this Registration Statement shall thereafter become effective in accordance with Section 8(a) of the Securities
Act of 1933 or until the Registration Statement shall become effective on such date as the Securities and Exchange Commission, acting pursuant to said Section 8(a), may determine.

PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS 

The Proposed MergerYour Vote Is Important  

    divine, inc. and Data Return Corporation have agreed on a transaction whereby divine will acquire Data Return in a
stock-for-stock transaction. The transaction is structured as a merger in which a newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of divine will be merged into Data Return. If we
complete the merger, based on the number of common shares of Data Return outstanding as of November 14, 2001, you will receive 1.9876 shares of divine class A common stock for each
common share of Data Return that you own. 

    divine's
class A common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "DVIN." On November 14, 2001, the closing sale price of divine's class A
common stock was $0.52. 

    We
cannot complete the merger unless the Data Return shareholders adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger. A special meeting for that purpose has been scheduled for Data
Return shareholders. This proxy statement/prospectus provides you with detailed information about the proposed merger and the special meeting. 
Please read this entire document
carefully, including the "Risk Factors" section beginning on page 26, which discusses the potential risks involved in the merger, in the operation of the combined company and in owning divine
class A common stock.

completing and mailing the enclosed proxy card to us. If you sign, date and mail your proxy card without indicating how you want to vote, we will count your proxy as a vote in favor of approving and
adopting the merger agreement, the merger and any other proposal properly submitted to shareholders at the meeting. If you abstain, do not vote or do not instruct your broker how to vote any shares
your broker holds for you in its name, the effect will be a vote against approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger. Returning your proxy card will not affect your right to vote in
person if you choose to attend the special meeting.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT
  THE PROPOSED MERGER    

Q:
Why are the two companies proposing to merge?

A:
The
products and services offered by the companies are generally complementary, and we expect that the acquisition of Data Return by divine will provide our combined enterprise
significant potential advantages and resources, including a more diversified portfolio of products and services. We believe that the proposed merger will allow us to accelerate long-term
growth and provide added stockholder value. Achieving these anticipated benefits, however, is subject to certain risks discussed in "Risk Factors" beginning on page 26. To review the reasons
for the acquisition in greater detail, see "The MergerReasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Data Return Board of Directors" beginning on page 58.

Q:
How will I benefit?

A:
We
believe that you will benefit by being an owner of a company that is able to compete more effectively than either divine or Data Return separately.

Q:
What will happen in the merger?

A:
A
newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of divine will merge into Data Return. As a result, Data Return will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine.

Q:
What will I receive in the merger?

A:
You
will receive 1.9876 shares of divine class A common stock in exchange for each common share of Data Return that you own if we complete the merger. This exchange
ratio may be adjusted in certain limited circumstances. For a description of the potential adjustments to the exchange ratio, see "The Merger AgreementConsideration to be Received in the
Merger" on page 81. 

Example: Based on the number of common shares of Data Return outstanding as of November 14, 2001, if you own 1,000 common shares of Data Return at the time we
complete the merger, you will be entitled to receive 1,988 shares of divine common stock.  

Q:
What happens as the market price of divine common stock fluctuates?

A:
The
exchange ratio, and therefore the number of shares of divine common stock that you will receive in the merger, will not be adjusted in the event of any increase or decrease in
the price of divine common stock. Therefore, the value of the divine common stock you will receive in the merger will fluctuate as the price of divine common stock increases or decreases. However,
Data Return may terminate the merger agreement if divine's closing price is equal to or less than $0.329 for ten consecutive trading days prior to the merger. You should obtain a current market
quotation for divine common stock before voting on the merger. 

Q:
Will divine issue fractional shares?

A:
divine
will not issue fractional shares. Instead, any holder of Data Return common shares who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a divine share in the merger will
receive a number of divine shares rounded up or down to the nearest whole number (with fractions equal to or greater than 0.5 being rounded up).

Q:
What do I need to do now?

A:
After
carefully reviewing and considering this proxy statement/prospectus, you should submit your proxy by mail before the special meeting so that your shares are represented at the
special meeting. You may also attend the special meeting scheduled to take place on                ,    . The board of directors of Data Return
unanimously
recommends voting in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

Q:
What shareholder vote is required to approve the merger?

A:
The
affirmative vote of two-thirds of the common shares of Data Return outstanding as of the record date,             ,    , is required
to adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger. As of November 14, 2001, holders of approximately 36% of Data Return's outstanding common shares have agreed to vote for adoption and
approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

Q:
Can I vote my shares without attending the special meeting?

A:
You
may vote your shares without attending the special meeting by granting a proxy to us. Complete, sign and date your enclosed proxy card and mail it using the enclosed postage
paid envelope.

Q:
If my Data Return shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote my shares for me?

A:
Your
broker will only vote your shares if you provide instructions on how to vote. You should follow the directions provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your broker to
vote your shares. If you do not provide instructions to your broker on how to vote your shares, they will not be voted. This will have the same effect as voting against the adoption and approval of
the merger agreement and the merger.

Q:
What if I don't vote by proxy or at the special meeting or I abstain?

A:
If
you fail to vote by proxy or at the special meeting or abstain from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote against the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and
the merger. 

Q:
Can I change my vote after I have mailed a signed proxy card?

A:
If
you are a shareholder of record, you may revoke a previously-granted proxy and change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting in one of the
following ways:


by
delivering to Data Return's Investor Relations office a written notice that states you would like to revoke your proxy;


by
delivering a later-dated proxy card by mail; or


by
attending the special meeting and voting in person (merely attending the meeting will not revoke your previously-granted proxy and change your vote; you
must cast a vote at the special meeting). 

For
shares held in the name of a bank, broker or other fiduciary, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to the bank, broker or other fiduciary. 

Q:
What if I receive more than one proxy card?

A:
It
may mean that your shares are registered in different ways or are in more than one account. Please provide voting instructions for all proxy cards you receive to ensure that all
of your shares are voted at the meeting.

Q:
Should I send in my Data Return share certificate now?

A:
No.
After we complete the merger, Computershare Trust Company of New York, the exchange agent, will send you written instructions for exchanging your Data Return share certificates
for divine stock certificates.

Q:
When do you expect to complete the merger?

A:
We
expect to complete the merger as quickly as possible after the special meeting.

Q:
What are the tax consequences of the merger?

A:
You
generally will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the exchange of common shares of Data Return for divine common stock. To review the tax
consequences to Data Return shareholders in greater detail, see "The MergerMaterial United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page 79. The tax consequences to
each of you will depend on your particular situation. You should therefore consult your own tax advisor for an understanding of the tax consequences to you resulting from the merger.

Q:
What will happen to Data Return if we do not complete the merger?

A:
If
we do not complete the merger, Data Return may be required under certain circumstances to (1) pay divine a termination fee of $1.7 million, (2) reimburse
divine for its expenses incurred in connection with the merger, up to a maximum of $500,000, and (3) repay amounts borrowed from divine pursuant to the credit agreement within 90 days or
180 days from the date of termination. In addition, except in limited circumstances, significant merger-related costs incurred by Data Return, such as legal, accounting and financial advisor
fees, must be paid by Data Return even if we do not complete the 

merger. Also, the price of the common shares of Data Return may decline to the extent that its current market price reflects a market assumption that we will complete the merger. For a detailed
discussion of certain risks associated with owning Data Return common shares, see "Information Regarding Data ReturnManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations Risk Factors" beginning on page 134. 

Q:

proxy, you should contact one of the following:

SUMMARY    

For your convenience, we have provided a brief summary of certain information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus. This
summary highlights selected information from this document and does not contain all of the information that is important to you. To understand the merger fully and for a more complete description of
the legal terms of the merger, you should read carefully this entire document and the documents we have referred you to, including the divine documents incorporated by reference and the merger
agreement, which we have attached as Appendix A. You should also see "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 160. We have included page references parenthetically to direct you to
more complete descriptions of the topics presented in the summary.  

 The Companies  

 divine, inc. and TD Acquisition Corp. 
(page 105) 

    divine
provides a combination of Web-based technology, professional services and managed applications capabilities designed to allow clients to deploy advanced Web
solutions for the extended enterprise that are integrated with their business strategies and existing software and technical systems. divine's enterprise Web solutions offer businesses the ability to
improve collaboration, workflow and business relationships. divine provides these solutions and managed applications through its four business units: 


Enterprise
Portal Solutions;


Software
Applications;


Professional
Services; and


Managed
Applications. 

    divine
maintains its principal offices at 1301 North Elston Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60622, telephone (773) 394-6600. See "divine's Recent Developments"
beginning on page 14 for a discussion of recent events intended to further divine's business strategy. 

    TD Acquisition
Corp. is a newly formed Texas corporation formed solely to effect the merger and has no business or assets. 

 Data Return Corporation
 (page 110) 

    Data
Return provides advanced managed hosting services based on Microsoft technologies. Data Return provides these services to businesses seeking to outsource the deployment,
maintenance and support of their complex web sites. Data Return's services include providing, configuring, operating and maintaining the hardware, software and network technologies necessary to
implement and support these web sites. It also offers additional services options, such as scalability and architecture testing, storage solutions and a suite of security services, including

75039, telephone (972) 869-0770. 

Reasons for the Merger
 (page 58) 

    divine
and Data Return believe that the proposed merger will provide each company with the complementary strengths and resources of the other and will enable the combined company to
address strategic opportunities more effectively. For example, the combination of Data
Return's advanced hosting services with divine's professional services, software services and applications and sales and marketing infrastructure should enable the combined company to further its
strategy of providing Web-based technology, professional services, and managed applications that help global enterprises conveniently and cost-effectively manage information
resources and engage their constituencies. 

    In
considering the proposed merger, Data Return's board of directors has evaluated, and you should evaluate, a number of factors, including the value of the divine shares you would
receive at the effective time of the merger. Based on divine's closing price of $0.52 as of November 14, 2001 and the exchange ratio of 1.9876, you currently would receive approximately $1.03
in divine shares for each Data Return share you hold. The actual value that you will receive at the closing of the merger, if it is approved by Data Return's shareholders, could be more or less than
$1.03, depending on the market price for divine's common stock and the number of outstanding common shares of Data Return at the time of closing. After considering various alternatives, including the
alternative of continuing to operate as an independent entity, the Data Return board believes the merger is in the best interests of Data Return shareholders because of the strategic advantages and
the potential up-side created by the combined companies. See "The MergerReasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Data Return Board of Directors" beginning on page 58. 

Recommendation of the Data Return Board of Directors
 (page 58) 

    The
Data Return board unanimously recommends that you vote 
FOR
 the proposal to adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger. 

The Data Return Special Meeting  

 Date, Time, Place and Purpose
 (page 50) 

    The
special meeting of Data Return shareholders will be held on             ,    , at 10:00 a.m. local time at the Marriott Hotel
located at 223 West Las Colinas Boulevard, Irving, Texas. The purpose of the special meeting is to vote upon the proposal to adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger. You may also
vote upon such other matters as may be properly brought
before the Data Return special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. 

 Record Date and Vote Required
 (page 50) 

    Only
Data Return shareholders of record at the close of business on the record date,             ,    , are entitled to vote at the special meeting. The
affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Data Return common shares outstanding as of the record date is required to adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger. At the close of business on the
record date, there were           shares of Data Return outstanding and entitled to vote at the Data Return special meeting, approximately    % of which were held by
directors and executive officers of Data Return and their affiliates. Certain shareholders, directors and 

officers and their affiliates holding in the aggregate approximately 36% of Data Return's common shares as of November 14, 2001 have executed a shareholder voting agreement with divine and
agreed to vote their shares in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger. See "Agreements Related to the MergerThe Shareholder Voting Agreements" beginning
on page 93 for additional information concerning this agreement. 

Dissenters' Rights
 (page 78) 

    You
are not entitled to dissenters' rights or appraisal rights under the Texas Business Corporation Act in connection with the merger. 

The Merger  

    The merger agreement is attached as Appendix A to this proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read the merger agreement because it is the legal
document that governs the merger. If the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding common shares of Data Return adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger and all other conditions to the
merger are satisfied or waived, TD Acquisition Corp. will merge into Data Return. As a result, Data Return will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine. 

 What You Will Receive 
(pages 77 and 81) 

    If
we complete the merger, each outstanding common share of Data Return will be exchanged for 1.9876 shares of divine common stock, subject to potential adjustment as described
in the following sentence. If the total number of common shares of Data Return outstanding immediately prior to the merger is greater than 36,350,372, the exchange ratio will be adjusted to equal the
quotient of (A) 72,250,000 divided by (B) the total number of Data Return common shares outstanding at that time. Because there were only 36,182,438 common shares of Data Return
outstanding as of November 14, 2001, an additional 167,934 common shares of Data Return would have to be issued in order to trigger an adjustment in the exchange ratio. Data Return is
prohibited under the terms of the merger agreement from issuing additional shares except upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants or if approved by divine. Certain holders of options that
are currently in-the-money have contractually agreed not to exercise their options prior to the consummation of the merger and none of Data Return's outstanding warrants are
currently in-the-money. 

    The
value of the divine shares you will receive in the merger will fluctuate as the market price of divine common stock changes. As of November 14, 2001, divine had
approximately 292,375,767 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Based upon 36,182,438 common shares of Data Return issued and outstanding as of November 14, 2001 and an
exchange ratio of 1.9876, divine will issue an aggregate of approximately 71,916,214 shares of divine common stock to holders of common shares of Data Return following the merger. As a result,
following completion of the merger, and assuming divine does not issue any additional shares of its common stock (in the pending merger with Eprise Corporation or otherwise), Data Return shareholders
would own approximately 19.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of divine's common stock. Assuming that divine (1) completes its pending merger with Eprise and issues
53,968,000 shares of divine common stock in that merger, and (2) does not issue any other shares of divine common stock prior to the closing of this merger, Data Return 

shareholders would own approximately 17.2% of the issued and outstanding shares of divine's common stock after the merger. 

 Treatment of Outstanding Options
 (page 82) 

    Each
outstanding option to purchase common shares of Data Return under Data Return's stock option plans with an exercise price that, when divided by the exchange ratio, is greater
than the closing sale price of divine common stock on the trading day immediately prior to the completion of the merger, will be canceled to the extent permitted by the applicable option agreement and
option plan and applicable law. Each outstanding Data Return option with an exercise price that, when divided by the exchange ratio, is less than or equal to the closing sale price of divine common
stock on the trading day immediately prior to the completion of the merger, will be converted into an option to purchase divine common stock with an exercise price equal to the exercise price of the
Data Return option divided by the exchange ratio, for a number of shares of divine common stock determined by multiplying the number of common shares of Data Return subject to the Data Return option
by the exchange ratio. For those out-of-the money Data Return options that are terminated, divine will grant replacement options to purchase a total of approximately 14,383,000 shares of divine common
stock, less the number of shares of divine common stock that are subject to options issued upon conversion of in-the-money Data Return options and less the product of the exchange ratio multiplied by
the number of common shares of Data Return issued upon exercise of Data Return options between November 1, 2001 and the date the merger is consummated. As of October 31, 2001, Data
Return had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 9,600,000 common shares of Data Return, with exercise prices ranging from $0.02 to $84.81. Based on the 1.9876 exchange
ratio and the closing sale price of divine common stock of $0.52 as of November 14, 2001, only 5,209,123 of those options would be in-the-money at that date. 

 Treatment of Outstanding Warrants
 (page 83) 

    Each
outstanding warrant to purchase common shares of Data Return will be converted into a warrant to purchase a number of shares of divine common stock at an exercise price as
determined in accordance with the terms of the warrant. As of November 14, 2001, Data Return had outstanding warrants to purchase (1) 340,910 common shares of Data Return at an
exercise price of $11.00 per share, and (2) 5,000 common shares of Data Return at an exercise price of $49.1875 per share. Upon completion of the merger, based on the exchange ratio of
1.9876, the first warrant will convert into a warrant to purchase approximately 677,593 shares of divine at an exercise price of approximately $5.53 per share, and the second warrant will
convert to a warrant to purchase approximately 9,938 shares of divine common stock at an exercise price of approximately $24.75 per share. 

 Opinion of Data Return's Financial Advisor 
(page 61) 

    ABN
AMRO Incorporated, Data Return's financial advisor, delivered its oral opinion, which was later confirmed in writing, to the Data Return board on November 1, 2001, that as
of that date and based on and subject to various assumptions, matters considered and limitations described in the opinion, the exchange ratio set forth in the Data Return merger agreement was fair
from a financial point of view to the shareholders of Data Return. The full text of the ABN AMRO opinion is attached as Appendix C. You should read the ABN 

AMRO opinion, including its assumptions, matters considered and qualifications, in its entirety. 
The ABN AMRO opinion is addressed to the Data Return board of directors and
does not address Data Return's business decision to effect the merger or constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of Data Return shares should vote with respect to the merger.  

 Conditions to the Merger 
(page 87) 

    The
completion of the merger depends upon the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including, among others: 


the
Data Return shareholders must adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger, and, if required by the rules of Nasdaq, divine's stockholders
must approve the issuance of divine common stock in the merger;


the
registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part must have been declared effective by the SEC and must not be subject to a
stop order or a proceeding seeking a stop order;


no
law, injunction or order preventing the completion of the merger may be in effect;


no
breach of a representation or warranty resulting in a material adverse effect on either divine or Data Return may have occurred that has not been
waived;


each
party shall have performed or complied with its agreements and covenants in all material respects;


the
parties must make all necessary filings and receive all necessary approvals or consents of any governmental entity or third party, subject to certain
exceptions;


the
shares of divine common stock to be issued to you under the merger agreement must be authorized for listing on the Nasdaq National Market; and


Data
Return must have received a written opinion to the effect that the merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax purposes, and that opinion must not have been withdrawn. 

 Termination 
(page 89) 

    divine
and Data Return can jointly terminate the merger agreement at any time before completing the merger, even if Data Return's shareholders have approved the merger. Either divine
or Data Return can also terminate the merger agreement if: 


we
do not complete the merger before February 28, 2002 (subject to extension under certain circumstances);


a
governmental or legal restraint does not permit completion of the merger;


Data
Return's shareholders do not adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger at the special meeting; provided, however, Data Return does not
have the right to terminate
under these circumstances if it has violated its non-solicitation covenant contained in the merger agreement or its board has withdrawn its recommendation of 

the
merger. See "The Merger AgreementCovenants and AgreementsNo Solicitation of Alternative Transactions" on page 86; 


the
other party materially breaches its representations, warranties or covenants in the merger agreement and that breach has not been, or cannot be, cured
within 20 business days of the other party receiving notice of the breach; or


the
approval of divine's stockholders is needed under the rules of Nasdaq in order for divine to issue shares of its common stock to you to complete the
merger and that approval is not obtained; provided, however, divine does not have the right to terminate under these circumstances if its board fails to recommend the transaction to divine's
stockholders. 

    In
addition, divine may terminate the merger agreement without completing the merger if: 


Data
Return's board of directors or a committee of the board withdraws or modifies its approval or recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger;


Data
Return shall have failed to include in the proxy statement/prospectus the recommendation of its board of directors in favor of adoption of the merger
agreement;


in
response to a third-party tender offer or exchange offer, Data Return takes any action other than rejection of the offer;


Data
Return's board of directors recommends an alternative acquisition proposal;


Data
Return enters into an agreement regarding, or consummates, an acquisition transaction with a party other than divine; or


Data
Return's board of directors resolves to do any of the foregoing. 

    Further,
Data Return may terminate the merger agreement without completing the merger if: 


the
approval of divine's stockholders is needed in order for divine to issue shares of its common stock to you to complete the merger and the board of
directors of divine, or any committee thereof, shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Data Return its approval or recommendation of the merger or the merger agreement or fails
to include in this proxy statement/prospectus the recommendation of divine's board in favor of approval of the merger and the merger agreement; or


if
at any time prior to the completion of the merger, before or after the adoption of the merger agreement by the shareholders of Data Return, the closing
sale price of divine common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market is equal to or less than $0.329 for ten consecutive trading days. 

    Except
under the circumstances described below in "Termination Fee," all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions it
contemplates will be paid by the party incurring those expenses. 

 Termination Fee 
(page 90) 

    Data
Return has agreed to pay divine a termination fee of $1,700,000 if the merger agreement is terminated by: 


divine
or Data Return because the merger is not completed by February 28, 2002, solely as a result of the special meeting not occurring because of
an alternative acquisition proposal;


divine
or Data Return because Data Return shareholders do not adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger;


divine
because Data Return shall have breached or failed to perform any of the covenants or other agreements in the merger agreement or any representation
or warranty of Data Return shall have become untrue such that, in either case, certain conditions to the merger would not be satisfied, and that breach or failure to be true has not been or is not
capable of being cured within 20 business days following receipt by Data Return of notice of such failure or breach;


divine
because Data Return's board of directors withdraws or modifies its approval or recommendation of the merger or the merger agreement;


divine
because Data Return fails to include in this proxy statement/prospectus the recommendation of its board in favor of adoption of the merger
agreement;


divine
because in response to a third-party tender offer or exchange offer, Data Return's board of directors takes any action other than rejection of the
offer;


divine
because Data Return's board of directors recommends an alternative acquisition proposal; or


divine
because Data Return enters into an agreement regarding, or consummates, an acquisition transaction with a party other than divine. 

    divine
must pay Data Return a termination fee of $1,700,000 if Data Return terminates the merger agreement because the approval of divine's stockholders is needed in order for
divine to issue shares of its common stock to you to complete the merger, and divine's board of directors or a committee of the board withdraws or modifies its approval or recommendation of the merger
or the merger agreement or fails to include in this proxy statement/prospectus the recommendation of divine's board in favor of the merger agreement and the merger. 

 Expenses 
(page 91) 

    If
the merger agreement is terminated by Data Return because (1) divine breaches or fails to perform any of the covenants or other agreements contained in the merger agreement
or any representation or warranty of divine shall have become untrue such that, in either case, certain conditions to the merger would not be satisfied, and that breach or failure to be true has not
been or is incapable of being cured within 20 business days, or (2) the approval of divine's stockholders is needed in order for divine to issue shares of its common stock to you to complete
the merger, and divine's board of directors withdraws or modifies its approval or recommendation of the merger or the merger agreement or fails to include in this proxy statement/prospectus the
recommendation of divine's board in favor of the merger agreement 

and the merger, then divine must pay Data Return's expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement, up to a maximum of $500,000. 

    If
the merger agreement is terminated: 


by
either divine or Data Return because the shareholders of Data Return do not approve the merger and the merger agreement at the special meeting;


by
Data Return because the closing sale price of divine common stock is equal to or less than $0.329 for ten consecutive trading days;


by
divine because Data Return breaches or fails to perform any of the covenants or other agreements contained in the merger agreement or any representation
or warranty of Data Return shall have become untrue, such that, in either case, certain conditions to the merger would not be satisfied, and that breach or failure to be true has not been or is
incapable of being cured within 20 business days; or


by
divine because (1) Data Return's board of directors withdraws or modifies its approval or recommendation of the merger, (2) Data Return
fails to include in this proxy statement/prospectus the recommendation of its board of directors in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, (3) in response to a third party tender offer
or exchange offer, Data Return's board of directors takes any action other than rejection of the offer, (4) Data Return's board of directors recommends an alternative acquisition proposal,
(5) the board of directors of Data Return resolved to do any of the foregoing, or (6) Data Return enters into an agreement regarding, or consummates, any acquisition transaction with a
party other than divine; 

then
in each case Data Return must pay divine's expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement, up to a maximum of $500,000. 

 Conversion of Loans Under Credit Agreement 
(pages 91 and 93) 

    In
the event that: (1) either divine or Data Return terminates the merger agreement because the approval of divine's stockholders is needed in order for divine to issue shares
of its common stock to you to complete the merger, and divine has not obtained this approval; (2) Data Return terminates the merger agreement because divine breached or failed to perform any of
the covenants or other agreements contained in the merger agreement, or if any representation or warranty of divine shall have become untrue such that, in either case, certain conditions to the merger
would not be satisfied, and that breach or failure to be true has not been or is incapable of being cured within 20 business days following notice; or (3) Data Return terminates the
merger agreement because the approval of divine's stockholders is needed in order for divine to issue shares of its common stock to you to complete the merger, and divine's board of directors or a
committee of the board withdraws or modifies its approval or recommendation of the merger and the merger agreement, or fails to include in this proxy statement/prospectus the recommendation of
divine's board in favor of approval of the merger and the merger agreement, then in each case all loans and obligations owed by Data Return to divine under the credit agreement will automatically
convert into the number of common shares of Data Return equal to the aggregate amount of these loans and obligations (without duplication) then outstanding, divided by $0.94. 

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger 
(page 74) 

    When
you consider the Data Return board's recommendation in favor of the merger, you should be aware that a number of Data Return directors and executive officers may have interests
in the merger that differ from, or are in addition to, your interests, including severance payments, acceleration of vesting of options and indemnification. For a complete discussion of these
interests, see "The MergerInterests of Certain Persons in the Merger" beginning on page 74. 

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences 
(page 79) 

    You
generally will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on your exchange of common shares of Data Return for divine common stock. Tax matters are
very complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on the facts of your particular situation. You are urged to consult your own tax advisor as to the specific tax consequences
to you of the merger, including the applicable federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences. 

Accounting Treatment 
(page 73) 

    divine
will record the merger using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This means that for financial reporting
purposes, divine will treat both companies as one company beginning as of the date we complete the merger. In addition, under this method of accounting, divine will record the fair value of Data
Return's assets and liabilities on its consolidated financial statements, with the remaining purchase price in excess of the fair value of Data Return's net assets recorded as goodwill. 

Regulatory Matters 
(page 77) 

    Currently,
neither divine nor Data Return is required to file any information with the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice under the
provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in connection with the merger. We are not aware of any other governmental approvals or actions that are
required to complete the merger other than compliance with federal securities laws and Texas corporate law. 

Comparison of Rights 
(page 153) 

    If
we complete the merger, you will become a stockholder of divine. divine's charter and bylaws differ from those of Data Return, and, as a result, you will have different rights as a
divine stockholder. In addition, divine has a stockholders rights plan similar to Data Return's shareholder rights plan that entitles holders of its common stock, in certain instances, to purchase
shares of divine's series A junior participating preferred stock. 

Shareholder Voting Agreements
 (page 93) 

    divine
and certain shareholders of Data Return entered into shareholder voting agreements pursuant to which those shareholders have agreed to vote all of their common shares of
Data Return in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger. As of November 14, 2001, the shares subject to the shareholder voting 

agreements represented approximately 36% of the outstanding common shares of Data Return. 

Credit Agreement
 (page 93) 

    In
connection with the merger agreement, divine and Data Return entered into a credit agreement, pursuant to which divine has made loans totalling approximately $7.0 million to
Data Return and will, upon request, make additional loans to Data Return up to an aggregate of $12.8 million, subject to Data Return's compliance with certain financial covenants and other
provisions of the credit agreement. 

Risk Factors
 (page 26) 

    This
merger and your investment in divine common stock involve certain risks and uncertainties, including risks related to the integration of our companies, risks associated with a
fixed exchange ratio and risks relating to the combined entity (including Eprise Corporation, a Delaware corporation with which divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger on
September 17, 2001). See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 26 for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that you should consider before you decide whether to adopt and approve the
merger agreement and merger and become a divine stockholder. In determining whether to vote for the merger agreement and merger, you should also review the risks and uncertainties associated with
owning common shares of Data Return as a stand-alone company in "Information Regarding Data ReturnManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
OperationsRisk Factors" beginning on page 134. 

divine's Recent Developments 
(page 107) 

 Eprise Acquisition  

    In September 2001, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Eprise Corporation, a provider of enterprise content management and delivery
application software. Eprise provides software products and design and consulting services that enable businesses to create and publish effective Web content quickly and easily. Its core product,
Eprise Participant Server, enables a business organization to distribute this Web content management function among the appropriate individuals within the enterprise who have responsibility for
particular aspects of that Web content. These individuals need no knowledge of programming languages or other technical skills to use Eprise Participant Server, thereby minimizing a customer's
reliance on information technology professionals and other consultants. Under the terms of the Eprise merger agreement, we will issue a total of approximately 54,000,000 shares of our common
stock in exchange for all of the outstanding Eprise common stock, and Eprise will become one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Completion of the Eprise merger agreement is subject to a number of
conditions, including the approval of that merger by Eprise's stockholders and, if necessary, our stockholders, and expiration or termination of any waiting periods under any applicable antitrust
laws. 

 Open Market Acquisition  

    In October 2001, we completed our acquisition of Open Market, Inc., pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger we entered into with Open Market in
August 2001. Open Market is a provider of enterprise content management and delivery-application software. 

Companies use Open Market's software to build and operate websites, rich product catalogs, self-service applications, and web services for their distribution channels, marketplaces, and customers.
Under the terms of the Open Market merger agreement, we issued a total of approximately 44,455,000 shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding Open Market common and
preferred stock, and Open Market became one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

 eshare communications Acquisition  

    In October 2001, we completed our acquisition of eshare communications, Inc., pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger we entered into with
eshare in July 2001. eshare is a provider of customer-interaction management, or CIM, software products and services. These CIM software applications enable eshare's customers to effectively
manage new and existing customers across multiple communications channels, including voice, email, interactive web chat, and voice-over-internet protocol. Under the terms of the eshare merger
agreement, we issued a total of approximately 68,4345,000 shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding eshare common shares, and eshare became one of our wholly-owned
subsidiaries. 

 HostOne Acquisition  

    In October 2001, we acquired, through divine/Whittman-Hart, inc., one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, the assets of marchFIRST, Inc.'s
HostOne application hosting unit. We purchased these assets in exchange for providing operating funds to HostOne from April 12, 2001, the date that marchFIRST filed for bankruptcy, to
October 22, 2001, the date we acquired the HostOne assets. In addition, we agreed to issue to Microsoft Corporation a total of
8,196,722 shares of our common stock in exchange for the cancellation of debt owed by marchFIRST to Microsoft. 

 Intira Acquisition  

    In October 2001, we completed our purchase of substantially all of the assets of Intira Corporation. Intira provides information technology and network
infrastructure for online business applications and is based in Pleasanton, California. In exchange for these assets, we paid $1 million in cash, provided Intira with a $6.8 million
debtor-in-possession credit facility during its bankruptcy, and assumed certain obligations, which we intend to restructure on more favorable terms. We expect the acquisition of the Intira assets to
add to our capabilities in our Managed Applications business unit and other business units. 

 Synchrony Acquisition  

    In October 2001, we acquired Synchrony Communications, Inc., a leading customer relationship management suite provider. Synchrony's Internet-architected
software and remote-hosted services are used by Fortune 1000 companies and some of the world's largest outsourced teleservices providers. Synchrony's Hosted Anywhere solution provides the
market's only remote-hosted and licensed technology, enabling consistent, high-quality customer service, sales, and marketing across multiple communications channels that include analog phone, fax,
email, and chat. In exchange for all of the outstanding stock of Synchrony, we issued promissory notes to the former stockholders of Synchrony in the aggregate principal 

amount of approximately $6.88 million. The notes are due and payable on or before December 31, 2001. We have the option to pay the notes with cash, or by issuing a total of approximately
5,500,000 shares of our common stock to the former Synchrony stockholders. In addition, we issued warrants to purchase 2,000,000 shares of our common stock to the former stockholders of
Synchrony. 

 RoweCom Acquisition  

    In November 2001, we completed our acquisition of RoweCom Inc. pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization we entered into with
RoweCom in July 2001. RoweCom is a leading business-to-business provider of high-quality service and e-commerce solutions for purchasing and managing the acquisition of magazines,
newspapers, journals and e-journals, books, and other printed sources of commercial, scientific, and general interest information and analysis. RoweCom targets clients in knowledge-intense industries,
such as business and financial services; biomedical; academia; and the federal government; and corporate and professional services. Under the terms of the RoweCom merger agreement, we issued
approximately 10,158,000 shares of our common stock in exchange for all the outstanding RoweCom common stock, and RoweCom became one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

 Latin American Econetworks Acquisition  

    In November 2001, we acquired the 63% of the equity interests of Latin American Econetworks N.V. that we did not already own in exchange for
8,000,000 shares of our common stock. Latin American Econetworks (also known as Dolphin Interventures) had been one of our associated companies since July 2000, when we acquired a 37%
interest in it. Latin American Econetworks is an interdisciplinary venture capital firm focused on the telecommunications, media and technology sector in Latin America. As a result of this
transaction, Latin American Econetworks became one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

    We
anticipate that the integration of these companies into our products and services offering will help us to deliver a combination of software, technology-based solutions,
professional services and hosting/managed applications that allow businesses to increase efficiency, generate revenue, advance their brand and build customer loyalty.

    The following selected historical financial data for the period from September 22, 1997 (inception) through March 31, 1998 and each of the fiscal
years ended March 31, 1999 through 2001 has been derived from Data Return's audited consolidated financial statements, which were audited by Ernst & Young LLP. The financial data for the
six month periods ended September 30, 2000 and 2001 are derived from unaudited financial statements. The unaudited financial statements include all adjustments which Data Return considers
necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for those periods. You should not expect the results for the prior periods to be an indication of the results
to be achieved for future periods. This information is only a summary and you should read it together with Data Return's historical financial statements and related notes contained in the
prospectus/proxy statement. Please read the selected financial data set forth below in conjunction with "Information Regarding Data ReturnManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial

EBITDA
consists of loss from operations of $1,291, $13,558, $48,235, $22,743 and $27,958 plus depreciation and amortization of $129, $2,214, $15,516, $6,232 and $10,562 and
amortization of unearned stock-based compensation of $349, $1,779, $171, $125 and $74 for the years ended March 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 and for the six months ended September 30, 2000
and 2001, respectively. EBITDA does not represent funds available for management's discretionary use and is not intended to represent cash flow from operations as measured under generally accepted
accounting principles. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or net cash used in operating activities, but may be useful to investors as an indication of operating performance.
Data Return's calculations of EBITDA may not be consistent with calculations of EBITDA used by other companies including divine. 

Unaudited Selected Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information  

    The following unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial information describes the pro forma effect of divine's proposed acquisition of Data
Return on the: 


statements
of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2001 and the year ended December 31, 2000 of divine; and 

balance
sheet as of September 30, 2001 of divine. 

Because
Data Return's fiscal year ends on March 31, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information for the year ended December 31, 2000 includes Data Return's
historical information for its year ended March 31, 2001. The following unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial information also describes the pro forma effect of divine's
proposed acquisition of Eprise Corporation and its recently completed acquisitions of RoweCom Inc., eshare communications, Inc. and Open Market, Inc. discussed below. The purpose of this pro
forma financial information is to demonstrate how the combined financial statements of these businesses might have appeared if each of the mergers had been completed at the beginning of the periods
presented, or when otherwise indicated. 

    In
addition to the pending merger between divine and Data Return, on September 17, 2001, divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Eprise, which is a provider of
software products and design and consulting services that enable businesses to create and publish web content. In addition, on October 19, 2001, divine completed its acquisition of Open Market,
which provides enterprise content management and delivery application software to businesses and other organizations. Also, on October 23, 2001, divine completed its acquisition of eshare,
which provides customer interaction management, or CIM, products and services. Further, on November 6, 2001, divine completed its acquisition of RoweCom, which is a
business-to-business provider of e-commerce solutions for purchasing and managing the acquisition of magazines, newspapers, journals and e-journals,
books and other printed sources of commercial, scientific and general interest information and analysis. The following unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial information reflects
the acquisition of Data Return alone, the acquisition of Data Return, together with the completed acquisitions, and the acquisition of Data Return together with the acquisition of Eprise and the
completed acquisitions. 

    divine
has prepared the pro forma financial information using the purchase method of accounting for all of these transactions. Because the pro forma financial information is based
upon the financial condition and operating results of Data Return, Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market during periods when they were not under the control, influence or management of divine, the
information presented may not be indicative of the results that would have actually occurred had the acquisitions been completed as of the respective periods presented, nor is it indicative of future
financial or operating results. divine expects to incur reorganization and integration expenses as well as potential operating efficiencies as a result of the acquisitions of Data Return, Eprise,
RoweCom, eshare and Open Market. The unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial information does not give effect to any synergies that may occur due to the integration of Data Return,
Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market with divine, nor does it take into account the effect of any potential changes to accounting policies, including with respect to the recognition of revenues, of
the acquired entities after the mergers due to the integration of their businesses into divine's business model. The unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial information should be
read along with the historical financial statements of divine and the related notes, incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, the historical financial statements of Data Return
and the related notes, included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements of divine and the related notes, included elsewhere in
this proxy statement/prospectus.

Comparative Per Share Data  

    We have summarized below certain (1) comparative per share data of divine, Data Return, Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market on a historical basis
and (2) combined per share data on an unaudited pro forma basis after giving effect to the Data Return merger alone, as well as the Data Return, Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market mergers
together, using the purchase method of accounting as if the mergers occurred on January 1, 2000 and assuming that: 


1.9876
shares of divine common stock were issued in exchange for each outstanding common share of Data Return;


2.4233
shares of divine common stock were issued in exchange for each share of Eprise common stock outstanding;


0.75
of a share of divine common stock was issued in exchange for each share of RoweCom common stock outstanding;


3.12
shares of divine common stock were issued in exchange for each eshare common share outstanding; and


0.8326
of a share of divine common stock was issued in exchange for each share of Open Market common stock outstanding. 

    You
should read this data along with the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes of divine incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus
and of Data Return that are included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. We have presented the pro forma per share data for illustrative purposes only. This unaudited pro
forma combined per share data does not necessarily indicate the operating results that would have been achieved had the mergers been completed as of the beginning of the periods presented, or the
results of operations or financial position that we will experience in the future.

(1)
Historical
book value per share is computed by dividing stockholders' equity (deficit) by the number of shares of common stock, net of treasury shares, outstanding at the end of
each period.

(2)
Because
Data Return's fiscal year-end is March 31, net loss per share for the year ended March 31, 2001 is substituted for net loss per share for the year ended
December 31, 2000. Similarly, book value per share at period end for Data Return is calculated as of March 31, 2001 as opposed to December 31, 2000.

(3)
Data
Return's net loss per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2001 has been calculated by adding the net loss per share for the three months ended March 31,
2001 of $0.36, as reported in Data Return's 10-K filing for the year ended March 31, 2001, and the net loss per share for the six months ended September 30, 2001 of $0.80, as reported in
Data Return's 10-Q filing for the quarter ended September 30, 2001.

(4)
The
unaudited equivalent Data Return pro forma per share amounts are calculated by multiplying the unaudited combined pro forma per divine share amounts by the exchange ratio of
1.9876 shares of divine common stock for each outstanding common share of Data Return.

(5)
Pro
forma book value per share is computed by dividing pro forma stockholders' equity by the number of shares of divine common stock and the pro forma exchangeable shares
outstanding at the end of the period.

factors in voting on whether to adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger and, therefore, your related investment in divine common stock. For periods following the merger, we have assumed
the completion of the pending Eprise merger and references to the products, businesses, financial results or financial condition of divine and Data Return mean our combined enterprise and its
subsidiaries, including Eprise, as well as eshare, Open Market and RoweCom, each of which we recently acquired. We have divided the risks into three groups: risks relating to the proposed merger;
risks relating to the combined entity, including Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market; and risks relating to ownership of divine common stock. References to "we," "us" and "our" in
"Risks Relating to the Proposed Merger" refer to the combined divine/Data Return entity following completion of the Data Return merger. References to "we," "us" and "our" in
"Risks Relating to the Combined Entity" and "Risks Relating to Owning divine Common Stock" refer to the combined divine/Data Return/Eprise/RoweCom/eshare/Open Market entity
following completion of the merger and the Eprise merger, and giving effect to our recently completed acquisitions of eshare, RoweCom and Open Market. You should also carefully consider the risks and
uncertainties associated with Data Return as a stand-alone company described in "Information Regarding Data ReturnManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of OperationsRisk Factors" beginning on page 134. 

Risks Relating to the Proposed Merger  

The value of shares of divine common stock that you will receive in the merger will fluctuate based on the price of divine common
stock.  

    Under the merger agreement, the number of shares of divine common stock that you will receive in the merger for your shares of Data Return is fixed, subject to
an aggregate limitation that no more than 72,250,000 shares of divine common stock will be issued in connection with the merger. This means that the exchange ratio of 1.9876 will not be adjusted for
changes in the market price of either divine or Data Return common stock. However, the exchange ratio will be adjusted downward in the event that divine would otherwise be
required to issue more than 72,250,000 shares of divine common stock in the merger. Based on the number of common shares of Data Return outstanding as of November 14, 2001, divine would be required to
issue an aggregate of approximately 71,916,214 shares of divine common stock. However, Data Return may be required to issue additional common shares pursuant to exercise of outstanding stock options
and warrants. 

    The
value of the divine shares that you receive in the merger will depend on the market price of divine common stock at the time of completion of the merger, which may vary from the
market price on the date you submit your proxy and the date of the special meeting. Data Return may terminate the merger agreement at any time prior to the consummation of the merger, if divine's
closing stock price on Nasdaq is equal to or less than $0.329 for a period of at least ten consecutive trading days. The prices of divine and Data Return common stock historically have been volatile,
and we cannot assure you what the market prices of the divine common stock or Data Return common stock will be at the time of the merger. We advise you to obtain recent market quotations for divine
common stock and Data Return common stock before making any decision about the merger. 

We may be unable to integrate our operations and personnel successfully and, as a result, may not realize the expected benefits of the merger.  

    This merger requires the integration of our companies, which have previously operated independently. We may not accomplish this integration smoothly,
expeditiously, successfully, or at all. The successful combination of the companies will require significant effort, managerial resources, time and expense. divine and Data Return have different
systems and procedures in many operational areas that must be rationalized and integrated. Integration also may be difficult because divine is based in Chicago, Illinois and Data Return is presently
based in Irving, Texas. This integration may be further complicated by the simultaneous integration of Eprise's, RoweCom's, eshare's and Open Market's operations. While we integrate operations,
management may be distracted and employee uncertainty and lack of focus may disrupt our normal operations. As often occurs with mergers, during the pre-merger and integration phases,
competitors may intensify their efforts to recruit key employees. Employee uncertainty regarding the effects of the merger could also increase turnover. Failure to accomplish the integration of our
operations quickly and effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

If we are unable to integrate our products and technologies successfully on a timely basis, we may not be able to operate efficiently or realize the expected
benefits of the merger.  

    After the merger, we will need to integrate our products and technologies. This integration may be difficult and unpredictable because divine's and Data
Return's products were developed independently and without regard to this integration. In addition, divine has limited experience with the Internet hosting services provided by Data Return. Successful
integration will also require coordination of different development and engineering teams, as well as sales and marketing efforts and personnel. This integration may take longer than expected, and the
companies may be required to expend more resources on integration than anticipated. The need to expend additional resources on our integration would reduce the resources that would otherwise be
available to develop new products and technologies. If we cannot integrate our products and technologies successfully and on a timely basis, we may not be able to operate efficiently or realize the
expected benefits of the merger. 

Our customers and partners may react unfavorably to the merger, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  

    The merger may disrupt our customer and partner relationships. Uncertainty regarding the merger and our ability to effectively integrate our operations without
a significant reduction in the quality of product and service offerings may also cause some of our customers and partners to explore alternatives. Further, customers may defer purchasing decisions as
they evaluate the likelihood of our successful integration. Any significant delay or loss of business from significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

Officers and directors of Data Return have potential conflicts of interest in the merger.  

    Certain of Data Return's executive officers and directors have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests. These
interests, which include severance, indemnification and insurance protections and the ownership of options that will become exercisable for divine common stock, are described in more detail under the
caption "The MergerInterests of Certain Persons in the Merger" on page 74. 

After the merger, shareholders of Data Return will have different rights that may be less advantageous than their current rights.  

    Upon completion of the merger, you will become divine stockholders. Differences in Data Return's articles of incorporation and bylaws and divine's certificate
of incorporation and bylaws, as well as divine's stockholders rights plan, will result in changes to your rights when you become divine stockholders. See "Comparison of Rights of divine Stockholders
and Data Return Shareholders" beginning on page 153. You may conclude that your rights under divine's certificate of incorporation, bylaws and stockholders rights plan are more limited than
your current rights under Data Return's articles of incorporation, bylaws and shareholder rights plan. 

Risks Relating to the Combined Entity  

divine has been in business for only two years, has little operating history and has a new business strategy that may continue to
change, which makes it difficult to evaluate its business.  

    divine was formed in May 1999 and began operations as an Internet holding company engaged in business-to-business
e-commerce through a community of associated companies. divine announced a new strategy to focus on enterprise Web solutions in February 2001. Because divine has only recently begun
operating under this new business strategy, there is limited data upon which you can evaluate its prospects. As we continue to analyze business plans and internal operations in light of market
developments, we may decide to make further substantial changes in our business plan and organization. These changes in business strategy may include moving into areas in which divine has little or no
experience. Furthermore, our future business strategy will depend on our ability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses as we continue to seek to expand our portfolio of products and
services. We are, and will remain for the foreseeable future, subject to risks, expenses and uncertainties frequently encountered by young companies, and it will continue to be difficult to evaluate
our business and its likelihood of success. 

Our overall performance and quarterly operating results may fluctuate and will be affected by the revenues generated from Data Return's, Eprise's, RoweCom's,
eshare's and Open Market's products and services and RoweCom's need for additional capital.  

    We expect Data Return's, Eprise's, RoweCom's, eshare's and Open Market's revenues to comprise a significant portion of our revenues for the near future. In
particular, we expect RoweCom's revenues to represent a significant portion of our revenues because RoweCom historically has recognized as revenue its cost of the knowledge resources it sells plus the
fee retained by RoweCom. Fluctuations in the revenue generated from our offering of Data
Return's Internet hosting services, Eprise's and Open Market's content management solutions, RoweCom's knowledge resources and eshare's CIM solutions will likely impact our overall performance, and
risks relating to these Internet hosting services, content management solutions, knowledge resources, and CIM solutions may affect our success as a whole. divine's, Data Return's, Eprise's, RoweCom's,
eshare's and Open Market's revenues and results of operations have varied substantially from quarter to quarter. We expect large fluctuations in our future quarterly operating results due to a number
of factors, including: 


the
success of, and costs associated with, acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic relationships;


losses
or charges incurred by associated companies that may include significant write-downs, write-offs and impairment charges; 


the
level of product and price competition;


the
length of our sales and implementation processes;


the
size and timing of individual transactions;


seasonal
trends;


the
mix of products and services sold;


software
defects and other product quality problems;


the
timing of new product introductions and enhancements by us or our competitors;


customer
order deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products to be offered by us or our competitors;


changes
in foreign currency exchange rates;


customers'
fiscal constraints; and


general
economic conditions. 

    In
addition, RoweCom's revenue flow is seasonal in nature and as a result RoweCom periodically will have to rely on financing from divine or third parties to support its needs for
working capital. RoweCom has an established practice of paying some of its publishers thirty to sixty days before receipt of funds from customers. Consequently, RoweCom anticipates making
substantial expenditures in the fourth quarter of each year, while receiving the majority of its cash receipts relating to those purchases late in the first quarter of the following year. Given these
seasonal cash flow imbalances, if RoweCom has an unexpected demand for liquid capital, or does not have financing available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, when needed, it could have a
material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. 

We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never become profitable.  

    divine incurred net losses of approximately $9,407,000 for the period from inception on May 7, 1999 through December 31, 1999, approximately
$470,319,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, and approximately $189,939,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2001. The majority of these losses were related to the
consolidated operations of divine's associated companies and charges divine took to reduce the carrying value of these associated companies. In addition: 


Data
Return incurred net losses of approximately $1,284,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999, $11,688,000 for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2000, $48,778,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001, and $29,005,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2001;


Eprise
incurred net losses of approximately $5,261,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998, $6,600,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999,
$16,704,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $21,394,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2001;


RoweCom
incurred net losses of approximately $7,630,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998, $15,067,000 for the year ended December 31,
1999, $83,981,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $26,846,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2001; 


Open
Market incurred net losses of approximately $36,970,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998, $19,780,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1999, $37,796,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $23,010,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2001; and


eshare
incurred net losses of approximately $9,958,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999, $11,117,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000
and $4,658,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2001. 

We
expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, we expect our operating expenses to increase significantly as we continue to develop the infrastructure necessary to
implement our current business strategy and integrate acquired businesses. If our cash on hand and cash generated from our operations is insufficient to fund our business, we may need to raise
additional capital. If this capital is not available on favorable terms or at all, we could be required to significantly curtail our operations. Changes to our business strategy and product lines may
cause us to incur additional expenses. Our financial results will continue to be affected by the operations of divine's existing associated companies, some of which may cease operations in the future
if they are unable to generate positive cash flow. To the extent that our revenues do not increase at a sufficient rate, we may not be able to achieve and, if achieved, maintain profitability. 

If we do not successfully implement our acquisition strategy or address the risks associated with the acquisitions, our growth and ability to compete may be
impaired.  

    Our business strategy includes the acquisition of other businesses that are complementary to ours, including other providers of enterprise software products or
professional services. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices, consummate any acquisitions, including the proposed Eprise merger, or
successfully integrate any acquired businesses, including Eprise, RoweCom, eshare or Open Market, into our operations. Acquisitions, including the pending Eprise merger and the recently completed
acquisitions of RoweCom, Open Market and eshare, involve a number of special risks and challenges, including: 


diversion
of management's attention;


assimilation
of the operations and personnel of acquired companies;


incorporation
of acquired products into existing product lines;


adverse
short-term effects on reported operating results;


assumption
of the liabilities of acquired companies;


possible
loss of key employees; and


difficulty
of presenting a unified corporate image. 

If
we are unable to successfully implement our acquisition strategy or address the risks associated with acquisitions, our growth and ability to compete may be impaired. 

    If
we engage in future acquisitions, we might finance these acquisitions with available cash, the proceeds from possible debt financing, the issuance of additional common or preferred
stock, or a combination of the foregoing. We may not be able to arrange adequate financing on acceptable terms or at all. If we consummate one or more significant acquisitions by issuing additional
equity securities, the market price of our common stock could decline and our stockholders could suffer significant dilution. Furthermore, sellers may be reluctant to 

accept divine common stock as consideration at its recent price level and given its historical volatility, in which case our ability to complete further transactions could be significantly limited. 

    For
most of the businesses that we may acquire, we will likely have to record significant goodwill and other intangible assets, and generally accepted accounting principles may
require us to recognize substantial amortization charges on the other intangible assets, reducing our future reportable earnings. We will also have to periodically test our goodwill and other
intangible assets for impairment. If we determine that the value of the goodwill and/or the intangible assets has been impaired, we will be required to recognize substantial charges that would
adversely affect our operating results. In addition, these acquisitions could involve significant non-recurring acquisition-related charges, such as the write-off or
write-down of software development costs or other intangible items. 

Our failure to retain key personnel may adversely affect our business.  

    Our success depends partly upon our ability to retain senior executives and other key employees who are critical to the continued advancement, development and
support of our products and services and ongoing sales and marketing efforts. The loss of any key personnel or any significant group of employees could negatively affect our future business and
prospects. If our management does not succeed in their roles or we are not able to effectively allocate management responsibilities and cause our officers and senior managers to operate effectively as
a group, our business could be adversely affected. 

    Employee
morale and our ability to attract and retain qualified employees may also be adversely affected by the decline and substantial fluctuation in the market price of divine
common stock since its initial public offering, as many divine employees hold options with exercise prices far greater than divine's recent stock price. 

Revenues from our professional services division are difficult to predict because they are derived from project-based engagements.

    For
the nine months ended September 30, 2001, divine derived approximately 93% of its revenues from professional services. Almost all of these revenues were from project-based
client engagements, which vary in size and scope. As a result, the revenues of our professional services division are difficult to predict because a client that accounts for a significant portion of
these revenues in one period may not generate a similar amount of revenues, if any, in subsequent periods. In addition, because many of our professional services engagements involve sequential stages,
each of which may represent a separate contractual commitment, a
client may choose not to retain us for subsequent stages of an engagement or for new professional services projects. 

If we cannot keep our billable professionals engaged on client projects, our future revenues could decline and our operating results could be adversely
affected.  

    Virtually all the client contracts of our professional services division allow the client to terminate our services on relatively short notice and do not
guarantee us any specific or minimum amount of business from the client. To the extent that any significant clients decrease their use of our professional services, delay an engagement or terminate
their relationship with us, the revenues of our professional services division could decline substantially and our overall operating results could be adversely affected to the extent we are unable to
quickly redeploy our billable professionals to other client engagements. 

We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by us could hurt our business and financial
results.  

    The market for our products and services is intensely competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid change. As a result of this merger, the Eprise merger, and
the recently completed RoweCom, eshare and Open Market mergers, we will compete with a variety of companies that provide software solutions and professional services independently or on an integrated
basis. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by us could hurt our business and financial results. Furthermore, many of our
current and potential competitors have longer operating histories; significantly greater financial, technical, product development and marketing resources; greater name recognition and a larger
customer base than we do. 

    The
market for hosting and Internet services is highly competitive, and there are few substantial barriers to entry to keep competitors from entering this market. Data Return's
current and potential competitors vary by size, product offering and geographic region and may elect to partner with each other or with focused companies to deliver service on the Microsoft platform.
They include: 


Microsoft
advanced hosting providers;


web
and application hosting service providers;


application-specific
hosting service providers;


colocation
providers;


managed
service providers;


local,
regional and international Internet service providers;


local,
regional and international telecommunications companies;


systems
integrators and large information technology outsourcing companies;


multimedia
hosting companies; and


other
hardware, software and technology companies. 

    Data
Return's competitors may operate in one or more of these areas and include companies such as AboveNet, AT&T, British Telecommunications, Cable & Wireless, Concentric
Network, Critical Path, Dell, Digex, Exodus Communications, Globix, GTE, Genuity, IBM, Intel, HostPro, Level 3, Loudcloud, MCI Worldcom (including UUNET), Navisite, Qwest Communications
International, Usinternetworking, Verio and Yahoo! 

    Eprise
has five primary sources of competition: 


file-based
content management systems from providers such as Interwoven, Inc.;


legacy
document management systems from providers such as Documentum, Inc.;


specialized
application servers from providers such as Vignette Corporation;


other
specialized content management providers such as Stellent, Inc. (f/k/a Intranet Solutions); and


in-house
development efforts by potential clients and partners. 

    In
addition, Eprise currently partners with a number of companies that provide complementary products such as Web tools and application servers. Any of these companies 

might introduce competitive product offerings in the future. Also, larger companies with broader product offerings, such as Microsoft Corporation, may bundle their products to discourage users from
purchasing Eprise's products. 

    The
market for the sale of magazines, newspapers, journals and e-journals, books and other knowledge resources to businesses is intensely and increasingly competitive.
Although RoweCom has not yet had significant direct competition from other companies offering a service for purchasing and managing the acquisition of subscriptions and books with comparable
management control features, EBSCO Industries, Inc. has recently launched a desktop e-commerce service that is similar to RoweCom's kStore. Thus, we expect that significant
competition will develop in the near future with respect to RoweCom's knowledge resource products, and it may adversely impact our business. 

    eshare's
primary competitors in the field of integrated inbound/outbound telephony-based call management systems have been Davox Corporation, SER Systeme AG, formerly EIS
International, Inc., and Avaya, Inc., formerly Mosaix International, Inc. We will continue to compete primarily against Davox and Avaya in the collections segment of the outbound
call management systems market, and against SER Systeme in the telemarketing and telesales segments of the inbound/outbound call management systems market. We will also compete in the computer
telephony integration segment of the market, where principal competitors include Interactive Intelligence, Inc.; Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories/Alcatel; Stratasoft Corp.; Apropos
Technology; Castel, Inc. and CellIT, Inc., among others. In the future,
we may also face additional direct competition from private branch exchange/automatic call distribution vendors, other telecommunications equipment providers, telecommunications service providers,
computer hardware and software vendors and others. Furthermore, in the Internet-based CIM industry, our competitors will include eGain Communications Corporation; Kana Software, Inc.; Cisco
Systems, Inc.; Face Time Communications, Inc.; LivePerson, Inc.; People Support, Inc. and Siebel Systems, Inc. 

    Open
Market's primary competition in the e-business content management market includes in-house development efforts by prospective customers, other vendors of application software or
application development platforms and tools directed at interactive commerce and financial services, such as Art Technology Group, Inc.; BroadVision, Inc.; Documentum, Inc.; Interwoven, Inc. and
Vignette Corporation. In addition, larger companies with much broader product offerings, such as BEA Systems, Inc.; IBM Corporation; Microsoft Corporation and Oracle Corporation, may bundle their
products to discourage users from purchasing Open Market's products. Companies such as IBM, BEA Systems and iPlanet E-Commerce Solutions also may add content management functionality to
their application servers or introduce their own content management software. 

    divine
competes in various market segments that are extremely competitive, highly fragmented and subject to rapid change. While we offer an increasingly comprehensive range of
advanced enterprise solutions, we compete with various providers of one or more components of our solutions. In the enterprise portal software and services segment, according to Delphi Research and
the Yankee Group, the leading portal application makers in 2000 included: Plumtree Software, Inc.; Hummingbird Ltd.; Viador Inc.; Sequoia Software Corporation, acquired by Citrix
Systems, Inc.; and InfoImage, Inc., among others. We believe that additional competitors in the broader advanced enterprise solutions market include: IBM Corporation;
PeopleSoft, Inc.; BEA Systems, Inc.; Microsoft Corporation; Sybase, Inc.; Oracle Corporation; Computer Associates International, Inc.; Epicentric, Inc.;
BroadVision, Inc.; Vignette Corporation; Citrix Systems, Inc.; Open Text Corporation; Top Tier Software, Inc.; 

DataChannel, Inc.; Tibco Software Inc.; SAP AG; American Express Company and InfoSys Consulting Inc. 

If we do not expand our customer base, we may never become profitable and our stock price will likely decline.  

    The market for many of our products and services is newly emerging. As a result, we cannot accurately estimate the potential demand for them. We believe that
market acceptance of our products and services depends principally on our ability to: 


develop
or acquire products and services that meet changing customer needs in a timely fashion;


effectively
market our products and our services;


hire,
train, and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales and marketing personnel;


provide
high-quality and reliable customer support for our products;


distribute
and price our products and services in a manner that is more appealing to customers than that of our competitors;


develop
a favorable reputation among our customers, potential customers and participants in the software industry; and


withstand
downturns in general economic conditions or conditions that would slow corporate spending on software products and professional services. 

Our
inability to accomplish any of the foregoing may limit our ability to expand our customer base. If our customer base does not expand, we may never become profitable and our stock price will likely
decline. 

Our success depends upon the market for Internet services, which, along with the general economy, is experiencing a downturn.

    During
late 2000 and 2001, and particularly since September 11, 2001, the market for Internet services and technology has experienced a significant decline. This decline is at
least partly attributable to funding difficulties experienced by many smaller companies, a general
economic slowdown and instability in the financial markets. All of these developments have caused many of our current and potential clients to cancel, reduce and/or delay some projects. A prolonged
economic slowdown or continued uncertainty about the future of the market for Internet services will adversely affect our business and financial results. If demand for our products and services does
not improve, increased competition for business may result in significant decreases in the prices we charge for our products and services. The market for our products and services may not improve in a
timely manner or to the extent necessary to allow us to achieve and sustain profitability in the near future. 

Our success will depend upon the ability of our products to work with a large variety of hardware, software, database and networking systems.  

    The success of our products will depend on our ability to integrate our products and make them compatible with customer systems, particularly hardware systems,
operating systems and data sources, as well as, or better than, competing products. The success of our products will also depend on the ability of our existing products to work well with one another,
with new products we develop and with new software developed by third parties. We currently serve, and intend to continue to serve, a customer base with a wide variety of 

hardware, software, database and networking systems. If we cannot support an increasing number of systems in the future, we may not gain broad market acceptance. 

Customers will be less likely to accept our products if we are unable to introduce in a timely manner new software products and enhancements that meet industry
requirements.  

    The market for our software products is subject to rapid technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new product introductions and evolving
industry standards that may render our existing products and services obsolete. As a result, unforeseen changes in customer and technological requirements for application features, functions and
technologies could limit our ability to develop market share or could rapidly erode our position in those markets in which we have an established presence. Our growth and future operating results will
depend in part upon our ability to develop and introduce new applications that anticipate, meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer requirements, respond to
competitive products and achieve market acceptance. 

    New
products, platforms and language support can require long development and testing periods. New products or enhancements may not be released according to schedule or may
contain defects when released. Either situation could result in adverse publicity, loss of sales, delay in market acceptance of our products or customer claims against us, any of which could harm our
business. Our product acquisition, development and testing efforts have required, and are expected to continue to require, substantial investments. We may not possess sufficient resources to make
these necessary investments. 

    We
also expect to develop and introduce new and enhanced versions of products as an integrated suite. In addition to the risks and uncertainties inherent in the development and
introduction of new products, we will face significant challenges in developing and introducing new products and versions that work together effectively and allow customers to achieve the benefits of
a broader product offering. We may not be able to identify or overcome these challenges. 

If we cannot cross-sell the products and services of divine, Data Return, Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market to the other companies'
customers, we will not achieve one of the expected benefits of the mergers.  

    Assuming completion of the Data Return and Eprise mergers, we intend to offer the products and services of Data Return, Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market
to existing divine customers and the customers of each other acquired company, and divine's products to existing Data Return, Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market customers. One company's customers
may not have an interest in the other companies' products and services. If we fail to cross-market our products and services, we will not achieve one of the expected benefits of the mergers, and this
failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 

We expect that our future revenues and operating results will be adversely affected if the software application industry continues to evolve toward a
subscription-based model.  

    We expect that our revenue growth rates and operating results will be adversely affected as more customers require us to offer our products under a
subscription-based application service provider model. We currently sell software application solutions on a perpetual-license basis in exchange for an up-front license fee. Many of our
customers are attempting to reduce their up-front capital expenditures by purchasing software applications under a hosted subscription service model. Under the hosted model, the customer
subscribes to use an application from the software provider. Generally, the application is hosted on a server 

managed by the software provider or a third-party hosting service. We expect that subscription-based revenues will represent a substantial portion of future revenues generated by our software
applications and managed applications divisions. 

    Under
the subscription-based model, we generally will recognize revenue and receive payment ratably over the term of a customer's subscription. As a result, our revenue growth rate
under a subscription model may be less than what our revenue growth rate would be under a license model. In addition, the price of our services will be fixed at the time of entering into the
subscription agreement. If we are unable to adequately predict the costs associated with maintaining and servicing a customer's subscription, then the periodic expenses associated with a subscription
may exceed the revenues we recognize for the subscription in the same period, which would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if we are not successful in implementing the
subscription-based model, or if market analysts or investors do not believe that the model is attractive relative to our existing license model, our business could be impaired and our stock price
could decline. 

Our business may be adversely affected if there are defects in our software or we are unable to acquire third-party software or hardware that is
error-free.  

    Software products as complex as those that we offer may contain errors that could be detected at any point in the products' life cycles. divine, Data Return,
Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market have, in the past, discovered software errors in certain of their products and proprietary software tools, and have experienced delays in shipment or
implementation of products or services during the period required to correct these errors. Despite extensive testing by us and by current and potential customers, errors in our software may be found
in the future. This could result in a loss of, or delay in, market acceptance and sales; diversion of development resources; injury to our reputation or increased service and warranty cost. In
particular, the call center environment in which eshare operates is characterized by a wide variety of standard and non-standard configurations that make pre-release testing
for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time consuming and will limit our ability to uncover all defects prior to shipment and installation at a customer's location. We also license
certain software used in our products from third parties, and our products are designed to operate on certain hardware platforms manufactured by third parties. Third-party software or hardware may
contain errors that we are dependent upon others to correct. These errors could cause problems with the installation and operation of our products and our delivery of services, which could harm our
business. 

We may face potential liability to customers if our products or systems or our customers' systems fail.  

    Our network infrastructure and software, portal and application products and hosting and professional services are often critical to the operations of our
customers' businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to quantify. If one of our servers, systems or products or a customer's system fails, the customer could make a claim for substantial
damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. The limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable in all instances and may not otherwise protect us
from liability for damages. Our insurance coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims. In addition, the insurer might
disclaim coverage as to any future claim. If we experience one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or result in changes in our insurance policies, including
premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, our business and financial results could be hurt. 

We could lose our competitive advantage if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, and any related litigation could be costly and
time-consuming.  

    We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our
proprietary rights in our products and technology. These measures may not be adequate to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technology. As a result, unauthorized third parties may copy or
otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. We may not be able to detect all instances of infringement. Furthermore, we may be subject to additional risks as we enter into transactions in
countries where intellectual property laws are not well-developed or are poorly enforced. Legal protections of our rights may be ineffective in these countries. If we must engage in
litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, either domestically or in other countries, we could face substantial costs and diversion of resources, regardless of the final
outcome of such litigation. Any future attempt by us to enforce our intellectual property rights might not be successful or might result in royalties that do not exceed the cost of such enforcement
efforts. Even if we succeed in protecting our intellectual property, others may independently develop similar technologies or products that do not infringe on our intellectual property. 

Other companies may claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights, which could harm our business.  

    Although we believe our intellectual property is non-infringing, third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. We expect
that the risk of infringement claims will rise as the number of products and competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. To develop our
services or products, we may need to acquire licenses for intellectual property to avoid infringement of a third party's product. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms,
if at all. Former employers of our present and future employees may assert claims that these employees improperly disclosed confidential or proprietary information to us. Any such claims could be
time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management's attention and resources, cause product shipment delays or require us to pay money damages or enter into royalty
or licensing agreements. These royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In the event of a successful claim of product infringement against us and our
failure or inability to license the 

infringed or similar technology on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 

We may not be able to prevent online security breaches, which could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation and expose us to liability.  

    A party that is able to circumvent our security systems or the security systems of our customers could steal proprietary information or cause interruptions in
our operations. Security breaches could also damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. Our insurance policies have coverage limits and exclusions that
may prevent reimbursement for losses caused by security breaches. Furthermore, our servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.
We may need to expend significant additional capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches. Despite these efforts, we may not be able
to prevent all security breaches. 

Future government regulation could place financial burdens on our business.  

    Due to the Internet's popularity and increasing use, new laws and regulations may be adopted that could have an adverse effect on us. In particular, states may
impose discriminatory,
multiple or special taxes on the Internet because the previous moratorium on the application of these taxes ended on October 21, 2001. Because this moratorium ended, federal taxes may also be
imposed on the sale of goods over the Internet. These state and federal taxes could cause a decrease in the volume of e-commerce and, therefore, the demand for our products and services.
The enactment of any additional laws or regulations, including international laws and regulations, could impede the growth of the Internet and e-commerce, which could decrease our revenue
and place additional financial burdens on our business. 

    Federal,
state or foreign agencies have also adopted, and may continue to adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of outbound call processing systems. These laws or regulations
could limit the market for eshare's products or expose us to liability, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 

Legal restrictions relating to the privacy of Internet users and the collection and use of online data could limit the utility of the personalization
functionality of Eprise's, eshare's and Open Market's products and the products of Data Return's customers and, therefore, the attractiveness of those products to customers.  

    One of the principal features of Eprise's, eshare's and Open Market's products and the products of Data Return's customers is the ability to develop and
maintain profiles of online users to assist business managers in personalizing content and in displaying tailored commercial offers to specific online users. By limiting the means in which this
feature can be utilized, proposed and existing legal restrictions on the collection and use of information relating to Internet users could materially and adversely impact Data Return's, Eprise's,
eshare's and Open Market's products. For example, legislation has been proposed in some jurisdictions that would regulate the practice of placing small information files, or "cookies," on a user's
hard drive to gather information. Likewise, regulation of the practice of online preference marketing is also under consideration in many jurisdictions. Moreover, legislation regulating online and
offline data collection is already in place in the United States and elsewhere, including the European Union, and applicable to certain populations and in certain sectors. Although regulatory and
legislative efforts in this area are relatively new and still developing, they continue to gain attention, and continued regulation and legislation in this 

area could adversely affect the demand for Eprise's, eshare's and Open Market's products and the products of Data Return's customers. 

If we lost the services of Andrew J. Filipowski, our business could fail.  

    We believe that Andrew J. Filipowski, our chairman and chief executive officer, is critical to our success. If we lost the services of Mr. Filipowski,
our ability to promote our business and raise additional capital would be severely limited, and our business could fail. We do not maintain key-man life insurance on Mr. Filipowski. 

Our key personnel have entered into non-compete agreements that could prevent us from engaging in certain activities and acquiring interests in
some companies.  

    Andrew J. Filipowski, our chairman and chief executive officer; Michael P. Cullinane, our executive vice president, chief financial officer and
treasurer and a director; and Paul L. Humenansky, our president and chief operating officer and a director, have entered into consulting and non-compete agreements with PLATINUM 

technology
 International,

inc.
, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Computer Associates
International, Inc. These agreements prohibit Mr. Filipowski until June 29, 2007, and each of Messrs. Cullinane and Humenansky until June 29, 2004, from
participating or engaging, directly or indirectly, in the development, manufacture, marketing or distribution of any products or services offered by PLATINUM as of March 29, 1999, or any
products or services offered by PLATINUM after that date and in which they had actively participated. PLATINUM was, as of March 29, 1999, and continues to be, engaged in the business of
developing, marketing and supporting software products for managing information technology infrastructures and providing related professional services. As of March 29, 1999, PLATINUM also
offered products and services for the creation, deployment and management of Web content. Under these agreements, Messrs. Filipowski, Cullinane and Humenansky also are prohibited from
soliciting, or assisting another person to solicit or attempt to solicit, persons or entities that were current customers of PLATINUM or its affiliates before the end of the respective consulting
periods of Messrs. Filipowski, Cullinane and Humenansky, unless the solicitation of these customers is for goods or services unrelated to any activity that competes with PLATINUM. 

    To
manage divine's business effectively with respect to these agreements, divine has consulted with PLATINUM and Computer Associates before making any acquisition to confirm that a
breach of these agreements would not result. PLATINUM and Computer Associates have consented to this merger. These consulting and non-compete agreements could limit our business
opportunities, which could impair our success. 

Data Return relies on its strategic relationship with Level 3 Communications, LLC and if this relationship is terminated or deteriorates, our
business may suffer.  

    In July 1999, Data Return entered into a strategic relationship with Level 3 Communications, LLC, a communications and information
services company building an advanced facilities-based communications network to provide colocation, Internet connectivity and other services. As part of this relationship, Data Return has committed
to purchase a
fixed amount of services from Level 3, including, among other things, bandwidth, colocation space, and installation and maintenance services, over the next three years. Data Return will incur
these expenses regardless of its revenues or, in some circumstances, if the agreement is terminated. Data Return has also agreed that if Level 3 is capable of providing the services Data Return
requests, and if those services are substantially similar to other services Data Return purchases, Data Return will purchase 90% of these services from Level 3 through 

June 2004. Data Return is required to purchase these services from Level 3 even if these services are available at lower prices from alternative vendors. Data Return routes the network
traffic of its customers through multiple backbone providers to increase network performance. To do this, Data Return obtains Internet connectivity through a number of providers, and Level 3
may not be able to provide all of the connectivity services Data Return requires. As a result, Data Return may purchase less than the applicable percentage of these services from Level 3. 

    Data
Return also currently relies on Level 3 to provide substantially all of the data center capacity that Data Return needs to provide its hosting services, and in the future
Data Return may be required to purchase most of its data center capacity from Level 3. Further, Level 3 may provide personnel at these data centers to install equipment and assist with
support as necessary for Data Return to deliver service in these facilities. If Level 3 fails to provide this data center capacity or perform these services in a timely or effective manner, or
at all, we would be required to make alternative arrangements. If demand for colocation space increases, Level 3 may not be able or willing to provide the data center capacity we require to
deliver our services. If Data Return's relationship with Level 3 is terminated or if Level 3 does not provide the data center capacity that we need, or provide it on acceptable terms, we
would be required to seek arrangements with other data center providers or construct our own data centers. We cannot be certain that alternate data center capacity will be available on commercially
reasonable terms or at all. Data Return currently relies, and for the foreseeable future we will continue to rely, on Level 3 to provide a substantial part of Data Return's bandwidth and other
networking services. If we were unable to obtain these services from Level 3, we would be required to seek arrangements with other providers of these services, and we cannot be certain that
alternative services will be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 

Data Return's success depends on Microsoft's continued success, and the loss or deterioration of Data Return's relationship with Microsoft could harm our
business and have an adverse impact on our revenues.  

    Data Return focuses on advanced hosting services for Microsoft-based Internet technologies. If these technologies are not widely used building blocks for
advanced Internet sites in the future, the demand for Data Return's services could decrease and its business would be
adversely affected. The recently announced settlement of the federal antitrust case against Microsoft could cause the acceptance of Microsoft products to decrease. Except for Data Return's
relationship with Microsoft as a customer, and under the Development, License, and Co-Marketing Agreement, Data Return's relationship with Microsoft is generally informal. Data Return believes this
relationship provides it with access to developments in Microsoft products before they are generally available, which allows Data Return to maintain and enhance its technical expertise. If Data
Return's relationship with Microsoft deteriorates or if Data Return loses some of the status or privileges it currently enjoys, our technical expertise could be adversely affected. Data Return's
ability to market its services as a provider of advanced hosting services for Microsoft-based Internet technologies would also be adversely affected if Microsoft does not continue to confer
certifications and designations on Data Return, or changes its current certifications or designations. Data Return does not have a written agreement with Microsoft relating to all of these
certifications or designations. Some of Data Return's competitors also have received these certifications. Microsoft generally confers these certifications unilaterally and in its sole discretion and
could change them at any time. We cannot be certain that Data Return will continue to enjoy them. 

If the networks through which Data Return delivers services do not have sufficient capacity, reliability or security, we could lose customers and our business
would suffer.  

    Data Return's success partly depends upon the capacity, reliability and security of its network infrastructure, including the capacity leased from its network
suppliers. Data Return's network currently delivers service through Level 3, InterNap, AT&T, GTE, Netcom/Mindspring, PSINet, Qwest, Verio, MCI WorldCom, Inc., including UUNET
Technologies, Inc., Sprint Corporation, Digex Incorporated, Cable & Wireless plc and SAVVIS Communications Enterprises, LLC. Some of these suppliers also compete with Data Return. In the
future, we will be required to purchase most of our network capacity from Level 3 to the extent that it provides capacity substantially similar to the capacity of other providers. Data Return
depends on these companies to provide uninterrupted and error-free service through their telecommunications networks. If our customers' usage of telecommunications capacity increases, we will need to
make additional investments in our infrastructure to maintain adequate data transmission speeds, the availability of which may be limited or the cost of which may be significant. Data Return monitors
all network links to prevent their being utilized in excess of their recommended capacity. If our customers' usage increases and capacity is not available to us, our network may not be able to achieve
or maintain sufficiently high data transmission capacity, reliability or performance. In addition, our business would suffer if our network suppliers increased the prices for their services and we
were unable to pass along these increased costs to our customers. Any failure on our part or the part of our third-party suppliers to achieve or maintain high data transmission capacity, reliability
or performance could significantly reduce customer demand for our services and damage our business. 

Data Return may not be able to deliver its services and our business may suffer if our third-party suppliers do not provide us with key components of our
network infrastructure.  

    Data Return depends on other companies to supply key components of its network infrastructure. Any failure to obtain needed products or services in a timely
fashion or at an acceptable cost could adversely affect our business. Data Return buys servers, routers and switches on an as-needed basis and therefore does not carry significant inventories of them.
Data Return also has no guaranteed supply arrangements with its vendors. Currently Data Return only uses servers from Compaq and relies on Compaq to provide access to Compaq technical personnel. In
July 1999, Data Return entered into an agreement with Compaq under which Data Return agreed during the immediately following three years to purchase from Compaq the lesser of 2,000 servers or
the number of servers reasonably necessary to adequately operate Data Return's business consistent with its business plan. Through September 30, 2001, Data Return had purchased approximately
1,965 servers from Compaq under this agreement. In addition, Data Return relies on Cisco Systems, Inc. and others to supply equipment critical to Data Return's network, but Data Return does not
have a supply agreement with any of them. If this equipment were to become unavailable on terms acceptable to us, we would be forced to find alternative equipment. The inability to obtain equipment or
technical services from Compaq, Cisco or others on terms acceptable to us would force us to spend time and money selecting and obtaining new equipment, training our personnel to use different
equipment and deploying alternative components needed to integrate the new equipment, and as a result our business could be adversely affected. In addition, if our sole or limited source suppliers do
not provide products or components that comply with evolving Internet and telecommunications standards or that interoperate with other products or components Data Return uses, our business would be
harmed. 

If Reed Elsevier or any of the other suppliers with whom RoweCom does business stops providing knowledge resources to RoweCom on favorable terms, we may not be
able to satisfy customers' demands at acceptable prices.  

    The primary supplier of the magazines and journals whose subscriptions RoweCom sells is Reed Elsevier, which supplied titles accounting for approximately 16%
and 13% of RoweCom's sales for the year ended December 31, 1999 and 2000, respectively. RoweCom currently does not have a contract with Reed Elsevier. If Reed Elsevier stops offering RoweCom
knowledge resources on favorable terms, we may not be able to offer customers competitive prices on their orders. If Reed Elsevier were to cease providing RoweCom with knowledge resources, it would
not be possible to obtain replacements for many of the titles Reed Elsevier publishes at a comparable price, if at all, from another supplier. Either of these events could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, if any of the other suppliers with whom RoweCom does business decides not to provide RoweCom with knowledge resources or decides
to stop providing RoweCom
with knowledge resources on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

We may not be able to expand RoweCom's catalog of knowledge resources.  

    One of the key elements of RoweCom's strategy is to continue to expand its catalog of knowledge resources. RoweCom gains content through acquisitions and
strategic alliances and through contact with various suppliers. We may not be able to continue to gain available content through strategic alliances or directly from suppliers. In the event that we
are unable to continue to increase RoweCom's available content, we may: 


be
at a competitive disadvantage with respect to competitors that may compile greater libraries of available titles;


lose
clients that rely upon RoweCom as a single-source of knowledge resources; and


be
unable to increase the amount of revenue that is otherwise generated from particular clients. 

Any
of these effects could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. 

Delays in sales and the implementation cycle for CIM solutions and managed applications could adversely affect us.  

    If we experience delays in, or cancellation of, sales or implementations of CIM solutions and managed applications, our business and financial results could be
hurt. To sell these products, we generally must provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding their use and benefits. In addition, prospective customers generally make a
significant commitment of resources in connection with the implementation of these products. For these and other reasons, the length of time between the date of initial contact with the potential
customer and the installation and use of eshare products has generally been six months or more. Our implementation cycle could be lengthened in the future by delays over which we have little or no
control and increases in the size and complexity of our installations and in the number of third-party systems with which our products must integrate. In addition, any
unexpected delays in individual implementations could expose us to liability claims from our customers. 

We expect that our future operating results will be significantly dependent on a limited suite of Eprise, eshare and Open Market products and the market for
these products.  

    Eprise has historically derived substantially all of its revenues from licenses of, and services related to, Eprise Participant Server, and expects that
revenues from this product will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues for the foreseeable future. A decline in the price of Eprise Participant Server or Eprise's inability to
increase license sales of Eprise Participant Server would harm our business and operating results. In addition, our future financial performance would suffer if the successful development,
introduction and customer acceptance of enhanced versions of Eprise Participant Server and future products are not achieved. Failure to deliver the enhancements or products that customers want could
have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

    eshare
traditionally has derived a majority of its revenues from sales of its Conversations call center management product, its NetAgent Web-collaboration product and
related services and support. eshare introduced Conversations in 1999 and NetAgent in 1998. eshare is currently in the process of developing next generation CIM applications and expects to begin beta
trials in 2001. In the near term, we anticipate that a significant portion of our eshare-related revenue may be derived from eshare's Conversations and NetAgent product offerings and related services
and support. We intend to enhance these products and develop market-specific solutions. However, any factor adversely affecting the market for call center and Internet-based solutions in general, or
the Conversations and NetAgent products in particular, could hurt our business and financial results. We also may face potential charges resulting from the write-down of inventory of
outdated products that we cannot sell. 

    Open
Market expects to derive substantially all of its product license revenues in the future from its recently announced Content Server Enterprise Edition software. Our future growth
and profitability will depend on the successful release, introduction and customer acceptance of this new suite of products and future enhancements to this Open Market-related product. Any factors
adversely affecting the pricing of, demand for or market acceptance of this product, including competition or technological change, could cause our revenues to decline and our business and future
operating results to suffer. 

Eprise and eshare traditionally have relied on a few customers for a significant portion of their revenues.  

    Eprise typically derives a significant portion of its software license revenues in each quarter from a small number of relatively large orders. Although we do
not believe that the loss of any particular Eprise customer would have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, our operating results could be materially adversely affected if
Eprise was unable to complete one or more substantial license sales in any future period. In the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2000, Eprise's five largest customers accounted for
approximately 50%, 26%, 33%, and 34%, respectively, of its total revenues in those quarters. In the first, second and third quarters of 2001, Eprise's five largest customers accounted for
approximately 33%, 42%, and 35% of its total revenues, respectively. 

    eshare
has historically derived, and we believe that we will continue to derive, a significant portion of call center revenues in any period from a limited number of large corporate
clients. In 2000, eshare's five largest customers accounted for approximately 17% of its total revenues. During 1999, eshare's five largest customers accounted for approximately 28% of its total
revenues. The loss, deferral or cancellation of an order from one of these customers could have a significant impact on our operating results. eshare's current customers 

may not place additional orders and we may not obtain orders of similar magnitude from other customers. If we fail to retain any major customer of eshare, suffer any reduction, delay in or
cancellation of orders by any such customer or fail to market successfully CIM solutions to new customers, our business and financial results could be hurt. 

    Open Market is party to several securities class action lawsuits that may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain and
may harm our business.  

    Open Market and several of its former and present officers and directors are named as defendants in several class action complaints filed on behalf of certain
of its stockholders who purchased securities between November 8, 1999 and April 18, 2000. These complaints allege violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule
10b-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act. In particular, they allege, among other things, that during the putative class period, the defendants sought to mislead the investing public by overstating
Open Market's prospects and the quality of its products. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and other appropriate relief. Any resolution of this litigation in a manner adverse to Open Market
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the costs to us of defending this litigation or other related proceedings, even if
resolved in our favor, could be substantial. This litigation
could also substantially divert the attention of our management and resources in general. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of this litigation or other related proceedings
could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace. 

Our strategy to expand our international operations is subject to many risks that may prevent us from maintaining or increasing our international revenues.  

    RoweCom's sales outside the United States accounted for approximately 42% and 51% of its total revenues in 1999 and 2000, respectively. eshare's sales outside
the United States accounted for approximately 32% and 28% of its total revenues in 1999 and 2000, respectively. Open Market's sales outside of North America accounted for approximately 30% and 40% of
its total revenues in 1999 and 2000, respectively. A significant element of our business strategy is to expand our international presence through RoweCom's, eshare's and Open Market's operations and
sales channels in international markets. This projected expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources. Because of the difficulty in penetrating new markets, we may
not be able to maintain or increase international revenues. Our international operations will be subject to a number of inherent risks, which will increase as we expand our international operations,
including: 


significant
volatility in the level and timing of business;


the
impact of possible recessionary environments in economies outside the United States;


changes
in foreign legal and regulatory requirements;


changes
in tariffs;


the
costs of localizing products for foreign markets and integrating products with foreign system components;


longer
accounts receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection;


difficulties
and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations; 


reduced
protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;


potentially
adverse tax consequences;


political
and economic instability; and


the
higher cost of foreign service delivery. 

    Although
eshare's and Open Market's expenses incurred in foreign countries typically are denominated in the local currencies, revenues generated by eshare's and Open Market's
international sales typically are paid in U.S. dollars, British pounds or Euros. Although a significant portion of RoweCom's expenses in foreign countries are denominated in local currencies, a
portion of the expense for both its U.S. operations and its foreign countries is denominated in currencies other than the local currency. RoweCom enters into forward currency contracts primarily in
European, Australian and Canadian currencies to hedge its foreign-currency exposures. However, RoweCom does not hedge all foreign-currency exposure and existing forward currency contracts may not
adequately cover intended exchange gains and losses. We could experience fluctuations in currency exchange rates in the future that would have a material adverse impact on our international
operations. 

Our growth in operations will likely depend upon the successful development of direct and indirect sales channels.  

    Data Return, Eprise, eshare and Open Market primarily sell their products domestically through a direct sales force and internationally through both direct and
indirect sales channels. Data Return, Eprise, eshare and Open Market support customers with internal technical-support and outsourced customer-support staff. Our ability to achieve significant revenue
growth in the future will greatly depend on our ability to recruit and train sufficient technical and direct sales personnel and to outsource effectively our customer-support functions. Each of Data
Return, Eprise, eshare and Open Market has in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified sales and technical personnel. If we are unable to rapidly and
effectively expand Data Return's, Eprise's, eshare's and Open Market's technical staff and direct sales force, our business and financial results could be hurt. 

    We
believe that our future growth will also depend on our ability to continue to develop and maintain Data Return's, Eprise's, eshare's and Open Market's indirect sales channels,
including value added resellers, or VARs, and distributors. Additionally, our investment of significant resources to develop these indirect channels could adversely affect our operating results if
these efforts do not generate sufficient additional revenues. 

    If
we are unable to recruit and retain qualified VARs and distributors, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Increased indirect sales also could adversely affect our
average selling prices and result in lower gross margins because lower unit prices typically are charged on sales made through indirect channels. Sales of Eprise, eshare and Open Market products
through indirect channels will reduce our gross profits from our services because the VARs and distributors provide these services. 

    As
indirect sales increase, our direct contact with Eprise's and eshare's customer bases will decrease, and we may have more difficulty accurately forecasting sales, evaluating
customer satisfaction and recognizing emerging customer requirements. In addition, VARs and distributors may develop, acquire or market products competitive with our products. Our strategy of
marketing products directly to customers and indirectly through VARs and distributors may result in distribution channel conflicts. Our direct sales efforts may compete 

with those of our indirect channels and, to the extent different VARs and distributors target the same customers, VARs and distributors may also come into conflict with each other. Any channel
conflicts that develop may have a material adverse effect on our relationships with VARs and distributors or hurt our ability to attract new VARs and distributors. 

Risks Relating to Owning divine Common Stock  

If divine common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, the liquidity, visibility and price of divine common stock may
decrease.  

    Since divine's initial public offering in July 2000, divine common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq National Market. Shares of divine common stock
could be delisted from the Nasdaq
National Market if we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq National Market, including the minimum bid price of $1.00. As of November 14, 2001, the closing bid price
of our common stock had been below $1.00 for 47 consecutive trading days. If divine common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, we would be forced to list divine common stock on
the OTC Bulletin Board or some other quotation medium, depending upon our ability to meet the specific listing requirements of those quotation systems. If this happens, an investor might find it more
difficult to buy and sell, or to obtain accurate price quotations for, shares of divine common stock. This lack of visibility and liquidity could further decrease the price of divine common stock. In
addition, delisting from the Nasdaq National Market might negatively impact our reputation and, as a consequence, our business. On September 27, 2001, Nasdaq announced that it had suspended
until January 2, 2002 its $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq National Market. 

    The
merger agreements for this merger and the Eprise merger require divine to deliver shares of its common stock that have been authorized for listing on the Nasdaq National Market as
a condition to closing the applicable merger. If divine common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, each of Data Return and Eprise can (1) terminate its respective merger
agreement with divine or (2) continue with its respective merger, with holders of common stock of Data Return and Eprise as applicable, receiving shares of divine common stock that may have
diminished liquidity and visibility. 

The market price of divine common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, which could cause litigation against us and prevent you from reselling your
shares at or above the price at which you acquire them in the merger.  

    From divine's initial public offering in July 2000 through the date of this proxy statement/ prospectus, the price per share of divine common stock has
ranged from a high of $12.44 to a low of $0.42. The market price of divine common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations due to various
factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: 


quarterly
variations in operating results;


volatility
in the stock market;


volatility
in the general economy;


changes
in interest rates;


announcements
of acquisitions, technological innovations or new software, services or products by us or our competitors; and 


changes
in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts. 

In
addition, there have been large fluctuations in the prices and trading volumes of securities of many technology, Internet and CIM product and related professional-service companies. Broad market
and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock. As a result, you may be unable to resell your shares of divine common stock that you receive in the merger at or above the
prices at which you acquired them. In the past, volatility in the market price of a company's securities has often led to securities class action litigation. Such litigation could result in
substantial costs to us and divert our attention and resources, which could harm our business. Declines in the market price of divine common stock or failure of the market price to increase could also
harm our ability to retain key employees, our access to capital and other aspects of our business. 

Our stockholders rights plan and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could delay or deter tender offers or takeover
attempts that may offer you a premium for your common stock, which could adversely affect our stock price.  

    Our stockholders rights plan and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to
acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to you. These impediments include: 


the
rights issued in connection with the stockholders rights plan that will substantially dilute the ownership of any person or group that acquires 15% or
more of our common stock unless the rights are first cancelled or redeemed by our board of directors, in its discretion;


the
classification of our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms;


the
ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock with rights as it deems appropriate without stockholder approval;


a
requirement that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our chairman, president or a majority of our board of directors;


a
prohibition against action by written consent of our stockholders;


a
requirement that our stockholders comply with advance-notice provisions to bring director nominations or other matters before meetings of our
stockholders; and


the
adoption of a provision of Delaware law that prohibits us from entering into some business combinations with interested stockholders without the
approval of our board of directors. 

The
existence of the stockholders rights plan and these provisions may deprive you of an opportunity to sell your shares at a premium over prevailing prices. The potential inability of our
stockholders to obtain a control premium could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 

Our stock price may decline if a large number of shares are sold or there is a perception that these sales may occur.  

    The market price of our stock could decline as a result of additional sales of common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur. As of
November 14, 2001, there was an aggregate of 164,250,657 shares of restricted divine common stock that could be resold only 

through registration under the Securities Act or under an available exemption from registration, including the exemption provided by Rule 144. As of November 14, 2001, of those shares,
11,216,903 shares could be resold immediately under an effective registration statement on Form S-3; 83,899,310 were eligible for sale subject to the volume, manner of sale and
other
limitations of Rule 144; and the remaining 69,134,444 shares will become eligible for sale between November 14, 2001 and August 2002, subject to certain lock-up
agreements described below. 

The market price of divine common stock could decline as a result of the large number of shares that will become eligible for sale upon completion of this
merger and the Eprise merger.  

    Based upon 22,270,386 shares of Eprise common stock issued and outstanding on October 24, 2001 and the 2.4233 Eprise exchange ratio, divine will
issue approximately 53,968,000 shares of divine common stock upon completion of the Eprise merger. Based on these assumptions, an aggregate of approximately 96,935,059 shares of divine
common stock issued in this merger and the Eprise merger will be eligible for sale in the public market without restriction under the Securities Act, and an aggregate of approximately
28,948,981 shares of divine common stock issued in this merger and the Eprise merger to affiliates of Data Return and Eprise will be eligible for sale subject to the volume, manner of sale and
other limitations of Rule 145 or Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The market price of divine common stock could decline as a result of these sales or the perception that these sales
could occur. Under the terms of the merger agreement, divine will register the shares of divine common stock issued to affiliates on a registration statement on Form S-3 to be filed with the
SEC within 30 days after the completion of the merger. 

    Aleksander
Szlam, the chairman and chief executive officer of eshare, and Szlam Partners have agreed with divine that, until October 23, 2002 they will not offer to sell,
contract to sell, or otherwise sell, dispose of, loan, pledge or grant any rights with respect to the approximately 34,780,000 shares of divine common stock they received in connection with the eshare
merger, other than their right to sell shares directly to divine pursuant to the terms of their stockholder agreement with divine. Similarly, in connection with divine's acquisition of Emicom
Group, Inc., certain of the founders of Emicom have agreed that, until July 17, 2002, they will not offer to sell, contract to sell, or otherwise sell, dispose of, loan, pledge or grant
any rights with respect to the 6,179,104 shares of divine common stock they received in that transaction. Further, in connection with divine's acquisition from UBS AG of a 21% equity
interest in Parlano, Inc., UBS has agreed that, until September 28, 2002, UBS will not transfer during any three-month period more than 15% of the 3,596,007 shares of divine
common stock it received in that transaction. An early waiver of these lock-up agreements by us could permit sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock and could adversely
affect the trading price of our common stock.

THE DATA RETURN SPECIAL MEETING    

Proxy Statement/Prospectus  

    This proxy statement/prospectus is being mailed on or about             ,    to holders of record of Data Return
common shares as of the close of business on             ,    , and constitutes notice of the Data Return special meeting in conformity with the
requirements of the Texas Business Corporation Act. It is accompanied by a proxy card furnished in connection with the solication of proxies by the Data Return board of directors for use at the
special meeting and at any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting. 

Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting  

    The special meeting of Data Return's shareholders will be held on             ,    , at 10:00 a.m., local
time, at the Marriott Hotel located at 223 West Las Colinas Boulevard, Irving, Texas. 

Matters to be Considered at the Special Meeting  

    The purpose of the special meeting of Data Return's shareholders is to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the
merger. Holders of Data Return common shares may also consider and vote upon such other matters as may be properly brought before the Data Return special meeting, including any adjournment or
postponement of the special meeting. The merger cannot occur unless the holders of two-thirds of Data Return's common shares outstanding as of the record date vote in favor of the proposal to approve
and adopt the merger agreement and the merger. 

    The
Data Return board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger, and recommends that Data Return shareholders vote FOR the approval and adoption of the
merger agreement and the merger. 

Record Date for the Special Meeting; Voting Rights  

    Only holders of record of Data Return common shares at the close of business on the record date,             ,
    , are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, there were           common shares of Data Return outstanding
held by approximately    holders of record. Each holder of record of Data Return common shares on the record date will be entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be
voted upon at the special meeting. As of the record date, Data Return's directors and executive officers and their affiliates held            common shares of Data Return. Certain
shareholders, including directors, officers and their affiliates holding approximately   % of Data Return's common shares as of the record date have executed a shareholder voting
agreement with divine and agreed to vote their shares in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger. 

Quorum; Required Vote  

    The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding common shares of Data Return entitled to vote at the special meeting is
necessary to constitute a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes, which are executed proxies returned by a broker holding shares in a street name that indicate that the broker has not received
voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and does not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the
merger, will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. 

    Adoption
and approval of the merger agreement and the merger requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the common shares of Data Return outstanding as of the record date. 

Proxies  

    All properly executed proxies delivered and not properly revoked will be voted at the special meeting as specified in such proxies. If a shareholder does not
specify a choice, that shareholder's shares represented by a signed proxy will be voted "FOR" the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger. 

    Because
the required vote of the Data Return shareholders is based on the number of common shares of Data Return outstanding, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same
effect as a vote "AGAINST" the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger. 

Solicitation of Proxies  

    To vote by proxy, shareholders should complete the enclosed proxy card and mail it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. If your shares are held in an account
at a brokerage firm or bank, you must direct them on how to vote such shares. A broker or bank will vote shares only if given directions on how to vote by following the instructions provided by the
broker or bank. 

    Data
Return does not expect that any matter other than the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger will be brought before the special meeting. If, however, other
matters are properly presented, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment with respect to those matters. 

    The
cost of the solicitation of proxies from holders of Data Return common shares and all related costs will be borne by Data Return. In addition, Data Return may reimburse brokerage
firms and other persons representing beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding solicitation materials to such beneficial owners. Original solicitation of proxies by mail may be
supplemented by telephone, telecopy, e-mail or personal solicitation by directors, officers or other regular employees of Data Return. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or
other regular employees for these services. 

    Data
Return has retained           to assist in the solicitation of proxies. Data Return will pay           a fee of
$           and will reimburse
           for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Data Return has also agreed to indemnify           against certain liabilities arising
out of its engagement. 

    You
should not send in any Data Return share certificates with the proxy card. The exchange agent will mail a transmittal letter to you containing instructions for the surrender of
Data Return share certificates as soon as practicable after completion of the merger. 

Revocability of Proxies  

    If you are a shareholder of record and are giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation, you have the power to revoke and change your vote at any time by
(i) notifying Data Return in writing, at its principal offices, that you would like to revoke your proxy; (ii) submitting another proxy with a later date; or (iii) attending the
special meeting and voting in person (merely attending the special meeting will not revoke your previously granted proxy and change vote; you must cast a vote at the special meeting to revoke a proxy
and change the vote). 

    If
your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other fiduciary, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to such person or entity. 

THE MERGER    

    This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes material aspects of the proposed merger. Although we believe that the description covers the material
terms of the merger, this summary may not contain all the information that is important to you. You should, therefore, carefully read this entire proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents we
refer to, including the merger agreement attached as Appendix A, and incorporate by reference for a more complete understanding of the merger. 

Structure of the Merger  

    If the Data Return shareholders adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger, and all other conditions to the merger agreement are satisfied,
TD Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine, will merge into Data Return. As a result, TD Acquisition Corp. will cease its separate corporate existence and become a part of
Data Return, the surviving corporation, which will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine. We currently anticipate that we will complete the merger in               .

Background of the Merger  

    Data Return completed its initial public offering in October 1999. Approximately six months laterin the second quarter of
2000the economic climate in general and in particular for providers of information technology related goods and services began to deteriorate. As that deterioration accelerated,
information technology spending by Data Return's customers and prospective customers decreased substantially. This decrease adversely affected Data Return's ability to maintain and increase its sales.
The resulting operating losses and negative cash flows, coupled with a significant downturn in the public equity markets, significantly reduced Data Return's market capitalization and adversely
affected its long-term prospects. The pervasiveness of the declining market for providers of Web hosting services is demonstrated by the 98% decline in the "Web Hosting Stock Index" since
September 2000. Data Return has experienced operating losses and negative cash flows from operations in each quarterly and annual period since the company was incorporated in 1997. As of
September 30, 2001, Data
Return had an accumulated deficit of approximately $90.9 million. For additional information concerning Data Return's financial condition and results of operations during prior periods, see
"Information Regarding Data ReturnManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" beginning on page 119. For additional information
concerning the risks and uncertainties associated with Data Return as a stand-alone company see "Information Regarding Data ReturnManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of OperationsRisk Factors" beginning on page 134. 

    As
market and economic conditions began to deteriorate and to adversely affect the company in calendar 2000, Data Return's senior management team and board of directors began to
review and discuss various strategic alternatives that would enable the company to maximize shareholder value. In October 2000, Mr. Michael S. Shiff, an Executive Vice President of Data
Return, was approached by an executive of a subsidiary of a large telecommunications company about the possibility of Data Return entering into a strategic relationship with that subsidiary.
Mr. Shiff discussed the matter with other members of Data Return's senior management team, and, after consultation with Data Return's board of 

directors, the senior management team decided to meet with representatives of the telecommunications company. At this meeting, which occurred in November 2000, the telecommunications company suggested
that it would be interested in acquiring Data Return as part of its business strategy. Data Return's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Sunny C. Vanderbeck, informed the
telecommunications company that Data Return was not looking to sell the company, but would be willing to consider any strategic proposal that the telecommunications company might wish to make. 

    At
a special meeting held on November 9, 2000, the Data Return board of directors decided to engage Bear Stearns & Co., Inc. as a financial advisor to assist Data
Return in reviewing any proposal submitted by the telecommunications company and in identifying other possible strategic alternatives. Bear Stearns had previously worked with Data Return as the lead
manager for its initial public offering. Bear Stearns' knowledge of Data Return, its technology, products and markets, as well as Bear Stearns' reputation, background and experience, were important
factors in the board's decision to engage Bear Stearns for this purpose. 

    After
retaining Bear Stearns, Data Return's senior management asked Bear Stearns to approach certain third parties so that Data Return's board of directors could compare any strategic
transaction that might be proposed by the telecommunications company to other strategic alternatives that might exist, including potential alliances or other strategic commercial relationships and
potential business combinations. 

    Beginning
in November 2000, Data Return's senior management and other employees began meeting with representatives of Bear Stearns to review information about Data Return's
business and financial condition, as well as a list of parties that might be interested in pursuing an alliance or other strategic commercial relationship or business combination with Data Return. 

    Throughout
November and December 2000, Data Return continued to engage in preliminary discussions with the telecommunications company regarding a potential strategic
relationship, and Bear Stearns began to contact other parties to explore their interest in a strategic relationship with Data Return. 

    By
January 2001, it was apparent that Data Return and the telecommunications company would not enter into serious discussions regarding a strategic transaction because the
telecommunications company was involved in other strategic initiatives. However, by this time Bear Stearns had contacted a number of other parties and Data Return had engaged in preliminary meetings
with several of them. As a result, Data Return's senior management and board of directors determined that Bear Stearns should be allowed to continue to explore those possibilities. 

    Between
November 2000 and August 2001, Data Return or its financial advisors contacted more than 80 potential strategic and financial partners, about a possible
relationship or transaction with Data Return. Of these companies, Data Return had preliminary meetings with more than 20 companies and 16 companies conducted some level of legal and financial
due diligence. Data Return engaged in substantive contractual negotiations with two of these companiesdivine and the telecommunications company described below with whom Data Return was
not able to reach agreement on fundamental terms and conditions for a transaction. At its regular meetings throughout this period, Data 

Return's board of directors was kept apprised of the foregoing activities by senior management and the company's financial advisors. 

    In
June 2001, Data Return became involved in substantive negotiations with another large telecommunications company that was introduced to Data Return by Bear Stearns. From
July through September 2001, Data Return and this company held a series of meetings and discussions regarding the proposed terms of a strategic acquisition of Data Return. This
company also engaged in legal and financial due diligence relating to Data Return. In September and early October 2001, Data Return and its outside legal counsel, Baker Botts L.L.P.,
participated in a series of negotiations regarding the terms of proposed definitive agreements with respect to the acquisition of Data Return by this company. Data Return's board of directors met on
October 2, 2001 to discuss a possible transaction with this company and to be briefed on the material terms and conditions of that transaction. The Data Return board of directors also discussed
other alternatives, including a potential business combination with divine. As a result of Data Return's inability to reach agreement with the telecommunications company on certain fundamental terms
and conditions for the transaction, negotiations were terminated on October 5, 2001. 

    In
July 2001, Data Return engaged ABN AMRO Incorporated as a financial advisor to provide additional guidance as the company continued to consider its strategic alternatives. 

    On
July 31, 2001, Andrew Pojani of Adams, Harkness & Hill, Inc., divine's financial advisor, contacted Mr. Vanderbeck to ask him if Data Return would be
interested in talking to divine about entering into a strategic relationship with the company. Mr. Vanderbeck told Mr. Pojani that Data Return was reviewing its strategic alternatives
and, although Data Return was not looking for a buyer, it would be willing to consider any credible strategic proposal that divine might make. Mr. Pojani relayed this information to divine, and
after receiving an indication that divine was interested in discussions with Data Return, contacted Mr. Vanderbeck to schedule a subsequent meeting between the parties. Prior to
Mr. Pojani's conversations with Mr. Vanderbeck, Data Return and divine had had no prior dealings or commercial relationships. 

    On
August 6, 2001, divine and Data Return entered into a customary confidentiality agreement. On August 10, 2001, Mr. Vanderbeck, Mr. Stuart A.
Walker, Data Return's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Mr. Robert Stovall, Data Return's Vice President for financial planning, met with Mr. Alex Walker, divine's
Senior Vice President for mergers and acquisitions, Mr. Jim Dennedy, President of divine Managed Services, and Mr. Pojani at Data Return's headquarters in Irving, Texas. The parties
presented their respective business strategies and discussed the potential benefits of a combination of the two companies. 

    On
August 16, 2001, Mr. Alex Walker sent a letter to Mr. Vanderbeck indicating divine's interest in pursuing an acquisition of Data Return and outlining certain
of the proposed terms of such an acquisition. The letter also contained an exclusivity provision that would have precluded Data Return from talking with other parties concerning certain strategic
transactions. Data Return, through ABN AMRO, informed Mr. Pojani that Data Return was not interested in entering into an exclusivity agreement at that time but that the management team at Data
Return was willing to continue to meet with divine and discuss the possibilities and benefits of
a strategic transaction. The parties did not engage in substantive negotiations of the terms of a transaction at that time. In addition, it was understood by both parties that 

any transaction that might eventually result from further discussions between the parties would be subject to the approval of the boards of directors of both parties. 

    On
August 23, 2001, Mr. Vanderbeck, Mr. Shiff, Mr. Jason A. Lochhead, Data Return's Chief Technology Officer, Mr. Stovall and representatives
of ABN AMRO met with Mr. Andrew Filipowski, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of divine, Mr. Michael Cullinane, Chief Financial Officer of divine, Mr. Buster Brown, divine's
Vice President of Sales, Ms. Katherine Wolanyk, divine's Chief Alliance Officer, Mr. Alex Walker, and Mr. Dennedy in divine's offices in Lisle, Illinois. The next day, on
August 24, 2001, Mr. Dennedy and Mr. Pojani met with Mr. Vanderbeck, Ms. Michelle Chambers, Data Return's President, Mr. Shiff, Mr. Robert Prosen, Data
Return's Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Todd Steitle, Data Return's Senior Vice President of product development, Mr. Stovall, Data Return's Vice President of financial planning,
Mr. Dave Kramer, Data Return's director of technology, and representatives of ABN AMRO at Data Return's offices in Irving, Texas. At these meetings, the Data Return team made various financial,
sales and product presentations to the divine team, and representatives of divine presented to Data Return's management divine's strategy and business plan. 

    On
September 20, 2001, Mr. Vanderbeck and Mr. Stuart Walker had a conference call with Mr. Alex Walker to discuss the potential deal terms, including the
general terms of certain interim financing to be provided during the pendency of the transaction. 

    Mr. Alex
Walker sent Mr. Vanderbeck a proposed term sheet on September 22, 2001, setting forth the principal terms and conditions upon which divine proposed to
acquire Data Return, including a proposed structure of the transaction as a stock-for-stock merger of a subsidiary of divine into Data Return, a proposed method for calculating a fixed exchange ratio
for the newly issued shares of divine to be exchanged in the merger for outstanding shares of Data Return and the general terms of certain interim financing proposed to be provided by divine to Data
Return during the pendency of the merger transaction. 

    Mr. Vanderbeck
and other members of Data Return's senior management team spent the next several days reviewing and analyzing the proposal with the company's legal and financial
advisors. In addition, from September 20, 2001 through October 5, 2001, representatives of ABN AMRO engaged in discussion with representatives of Adams, Harkness & Hill
regarding a strategic transaction between Data Return and divine. 

    On
October 4, 2001, Data Return's board of directors held a special board meeting at which they discussed the various strategic alternatives available to Data Return, including
the proposal from divine. Also participating in this meeting were Mr. Stuart Walker and Mr. Mark Gunnin, Data Return's Vice President and General Counsel, and representatives of ABN
AMRO, Bear Stearns and Baker Botts. The board reviewed and discussed the basic terms of the transaction that had been proposed by divine. Mr. Vanderbeck noted that divine had required, as a
condition to proceeding with further discussions with Data Return regarding a possible transaction, that Data Return execute another mutual confidentiality agreement that contained an exclusivity
agreement that would be effective through October 26, 2001, unless divine proposed to alter any of the proposed terms. The board authorized Data Return's management to execute the mutual
confidentiality agreement and the exclusivity agreement and to proceed with appropriate due diligence efforts and the negotiation of definitive agreements. It was understood that execution of any
definitive agreement with respect to the proposed transaction would be subject to, among other things, 

the negotiation of mutually satisfactory definitive agreements, as well as approval by Data Return's and divine's respective boards of directors. 

    On
October 5, 2001, Messrs. Vanderbeck, Stuart Walker, Gunnin, Ms. Chambers and representatives of ABN AMRO had a conference call with Messrs. Alex Walker
and Dennedy and other representatives of divine to discuss final issues on the proposed terms and a timeline for completion of due diligence by each party and other items that were required to be
completed before a transaction could be submitted to the boards of directors of divine and Data Return. After the call, Data Return and divine each executed the mutual confidentiality agreement and
the exclusivity agreement described above. 

    During
the week of October 8, 2001, representatives of divine met with representatives of Data Return in Dallas, Texas for business and legal due diligence concerning Data
Return. On October 11, 12, 15, 16 and 17, 2001, representatives of Data Return met with representatives of divine in Lisle, Illinois for business and legal due diligence concerning divine. 

    On
October 10, 2001, Bell, Boyd & Lloyd LLC, outside legal counsel to divine, circulated the first draft of a definitive merger agreement for the acquisition of Data
Return to Data Return and Baker Botts. On October 11, 2001, Bell, Boyd & Lloyd circulated to Data Return and Baker Botts initial drafts of a credit agreement and related documents
germane to the interim financing to be provided by divine to Data Return during the pendency of the merger transaction. On October 18, 2001, Bell, Boyd & Lloyd circulated to Data Return
and Baker
Botts an initial draft of a shareholder voting agreement pursuant to which certain significant shareholders of Data Return would agree to vote their Data Return shares in favor of the merger with
divine and against any competing transaction. 

    Between
October 10 and October 26, 2001, representatives of divine and Data Return and their respective legal counsel engaged in a series of discussions to negotiate the
terms and conditions of the definitive merger agreement, shareholder voting agreement, credit agreement and other ancillary agreements. Throughout this period, both parties and their legal, financial
and accounting advisors continued their due diligence review of the other party's business, financial condition and operations. 

    On
October 26, 2001, Data Return's board of directors held a special meeting to review and discuss in detail the proposed transaction with divine. Also present were
Messrs. Stuart Walker and Gunnin and representatives from Baker Botts, ABN AMRO and Bear Stearns. At the meeting, Mr. Vanderbeck reviewed in detail the company's efforts to investigate,
analyze and pursue strategic alternatives and the factors underlying management's recommendation that Data Return should continue to pursue and enter into the proposed transaction with divine.
Representatives of ABN AMRO and Bear Stearns reviewed the history of their respective efforts to solicit alternative strategic transactions for Data Return, and the ABN AMRO representatives reviewed
and commented on the financial terms of the transaction proposed by divine, as well as the financial and stock price performance of divine. In addition, ABN AMRO stated that it was prepared to deliver
its opinion that, subject to various assumptions, matters considered and limitations, the proposed exchange ratio for the merger would from a financial point of view be fair to the shareholders of
Data Return. Mr. Stuart Walker and Mr. Gunnin also presented to the board the results of Data Return's due diligence review of divine. In addition, there was extensive discussion among
the directors and management of Data Return of the merger agreement, the shareholder voting agreement and the credit documents, which included Mr. Gunnin and representatives of Baker Botts 

discussing the material terms of these agreements, representatives of Baker Botts describing the directors' legal and fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed merger and Mr. Vanderbeck
and others responding to the questions posed by the directors relating to the proposed transaction. 

    During
this board meeting, representatives of ABN AMRO, Bear Stearns and Baker Botts met separately with the independent directors of Data Return to review the terms of the
transaction and its effect under existing employment agreements of certain officers of the company. Following this executive session, the independent directors advised the full board of directors that
the independent directors were unanimously in favor of proceeding with the
transaction with divine. Following further discussions and consideration of the factors and reasons described below under "Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Data Return Board
of Directors," the Data Return board unanimously determined that Data Return should proceed with the proposed transaction with divine. 

    Between
October 26 and October 31, 2001, representatives of divine and Data Return and their respective legal counsel continued negotiations with respect to the
definitive agreements and related disclosure schedules. 

    On
October 31, 2001, the divine board of directors held a special meeting to consider the terms of the proposed Data Return transaction and additional due diligence findings.
Representatives of divine's senior management also participated in the meeting. divine's transaction team led the discussion by summarizing the additional due diligence findings and reporting on the
status of the Data Return merger negotiations. After full discussion, divine's board of directors unanimously adopted and approved the Data Return merger agreement, related ancillary agreements and
the transactions contemplated by all of the foregoing, and unanimously recommended that, if necessary, the stockholders of divine approve the issuance of shares of divine common stock in the Data
Return merger. 

    On
November 1, 2001, the Data Return board of directors held a special meeting to review and consider the final terms of the proposed transactions with divine.
Messrs. Stuart Walker and Gunnin, as well as representatives of ABN AMRO, Bear Stearns and Baker Botts, also participated in the meeting. Mr. Gunnin reviewed the final changes to the
merger agreement, the credit agreement and related documents. Representatives of ABN AMRO orally expressed their opinion that, as of November 1, 2001 and based on and subject to various
assumptions, matters considered and limitations described in a written version of their opinion that would be forthcoming, the exchange ratio set forth in the definitive merger agreement was fair from
a financial point of view to the shareholders of Data Return. This opinion was subsequently confirmed in a letter delivered by ABN AMRO to Data Return, a copy of which is attached to this proxy
statement/prospectus as Appendix C. Following the presentations and further discussions, the Data Return board unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the credit agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Data Return and its shareholders, unanimously adopted and approved the merger agreement, the related agreements
and the transactions contemplated thereby, and unanimously recommended that the shareholders of Data Return adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger. 

    During
the evening of November 1, 2001, the merger agreement, the shareholder voting agreement, the credit agreement and the other ancillary documents were executed. 

    On November 2, 2001, prior to the opening of the Nasdaq National Market, divine and Data Return issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the merger and related
agreements. 

Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Data Return Board of Directors  

    Joint Reasons for the Merger.
  The boards of directors of divine and Data Return independently concluded that they
expect that the proposed merger will: 


afford
to each company the complementary strengths of the two individual companies;


provide
the combined company significant potential advantages and resources; and


enable
the combined company to address emerging strategic opportunities more quickly and effectively. 

divine
and Data Return have each identified additional reasons for the merger, as discussed below. You should note, however, that the potential benefits of the merger may not be fully realized, if at
all. See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 26. 

    divine's Reasons for the Merger.
  In addition to the anticipated joint benefits described above, divine believes that
Data Return's services, technology and client base are compatible with divine's enterprise Web solutions business strategy. divine also believes that the combination of Data Return's advanced hosting
services with divine's professional services, software services, software applications and sales and marketing infrastructure will enable the combined company to further its strategy of providing
Web-based technology, professional services, and managed applications that help global enterprises conveniently and cost-effectively manage information resources and engage
their constituencies. 

    Data Return's Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Data Return Board of Directors.
  The Data Return
board of directors has unanimously determined that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Data Return and its
shareholders and has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger. Accordingly, the Data Return board of directors unanimously recommends that the shareholders vote "FOR" adoption and
approval of the merger agreement and the merger. 

    In
reaching its determination, the Data Return board of directors considered a number of factors, including, without limitation, the following: 


the
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, net losses, assets, liabilities and prospects of Data Return, if it remains an independent
company;


the
financial and related terms of the merger and the merger agreement, including the fact that the provisions of the merger agreement are designed to
provide that Data Return's shareholders participate fully in any increase in the value of divine common stock;


the
fact that the market value of the shares of divine's class A common stock, based on the exchange ratio and the closing price of such shares on
the Nasdaq National Market on October 31, 2001, to be exchanged for each Data Return common share pursuant to the merger represents a premium of approximately 31.9% over the closing price of
the Data Return common shares on the Nasdaq National Market on October 31, 2001, and 

a
premium of approximately 59.1% over the average of the closing prices of the Data Return common shares for the last 30 days of trading prior to October 31, 2001; 


the
presentations of ABN AMRO Incorporated and Bear Stearns & Co., Inc., and the opinion of ABN AMRO Incorporated that, as of
November 1, 2001, and based on and subject to various assumptions, matters considered and limitations described in its opinion, the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement is fair from
a financial point of view to the shareholders of Data Return (Bear Stearns & Co., Inc. was not requested to provide an opinion with respect to the exchange ratio);


the
interim funding arrangements that divine has agreed to in the credit agreement between divine and Data Return, thereby providing assurance to Data
Return of its ability to finance its operations during the pendency of the merger transaction, and the fact that Data Return's shareholders will suffer no reduction in the exchange ratio tied to the
level of any interim borrowings from divine;


the
recent and historical stock price performance of the Data Return common shares and divine common stock;


the
potential strategic alternatives available to Data Return and the viability and risks associated with each alternative, including the prospects for
Data Return on a stand-alone basis and the substantial risks associated with obtaining additional capital and achieving and executing upon Data Return's business plan, both short-term and
long-term;


the
belief of Data Return's management that, based on its lengthy review of strategic alternatives and on the feedback from recent contacts with a number
of third parties in the Internet hosting, telecommunications and information technology industries to ascertain their level of interest in engaging in a business combination with Data Return, it is
unlikely that any party would propose an alternative transaction that would be more favorable to Data Return and its shareholders, and have the same likelihood of consummation, as the merger;


the
fact that the merger will present the opportunity for the holders of Data Return common shares to participate in a significantly larger and more
diversified company and, as stockholders of the combined company, to benefit from any future growth of the combined company;


the
terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the conditions to closing of the merger, including the absence of a condition based solely on a
material adverse change in Data Return's business following the announcement of the transaction, and the nature of the arm's-length negotiation of the merger agreement;


the
fact that, while the merger agreement prohibits Data Return from soliciting proposals concerning an acquisition of Data Return, the Data Return board
of directors, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, would be able to provide information to, and engage in negotiations with, a third party that makes an unsolicited superior acquisition proposal,
and that the Data Return board of directors would be able to withdraw its recommendation of the merger
agreement and the merger to the Data Return shareholders, if the board of directors determined that its fiduciary duties so required; 


the
likelihood that the merger would be consummated, including the limited nature of the conditions to closing the merger and the experience, reputation
and financial condition of divine and its history of successfully closing significant business combination transactions;


the
consents and approvals to consummate the merger, including the need for clearance of an S-4 Registration Statement by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the need for two-third's of Data Return's shareholders to approve the merger, the favorable prospects for receiving such consents and approvals, and the likely absence
of any required Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance;


the
fact that the merger has been structured in a manner so that it should qualify as a reorganization for federal income tax purposes, in which case Data
Return's shareholders generally would not recognize gain or loss;


the
strengths and weaknesses of divine's businesses and key attributes of the combined company in terms of, among other things, product and service
offerings, sales, customers, management and competitive position; and


the
risks and uncertainties associated with Data Return as a stand-alone company described under "Information Regarding Data
ReturnManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsRisk Factors" beginning on page 134. 

    The
Data Return board of directors believed that each of the above factors generally supported its determination and recommendation. The Data Return board of directors also considered
a number of potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the proposed merger, including: 


the
possibility that the merger would not be consummated;


the
amount of the termination fee and the events triggering payment of the termination fee under the merger agreement;


the
fact that the exchange ratio is fixed and will not change with decreases in the market price of divine's stock before the closing, provided that if the
market price of divine's class A common stock declines below $0.329 and remains at or below that level for 10 consecutive trading days, Data Return could terminate the merger agreement;


the
fact that divine's stock has experienced substantial price volatility over the past year;


the
fact that divine is curently trading below $1.00 per share and the risks associated with such market price, including the risk that divine could be
de-listed from the Nasdaq National Market and the risk that divine may declare a reverse stock split to increase its stock price;


the
risk that the combined company would perform significantly below expectations; and


the
risks described under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 26. 

    The
Data Return board of directors did not believe that the negative factors were sufficient, individually or in the aggregate, to outweigh the potential advantages of the merger. 

The foregoing discussion of the information and the factors considered by the Data Return board of directors is not meant to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered by the Data
Return board of directors. In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, the Data Return board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not,
quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determinations and recommendations. In addition, individual members of Data Return's board of directors
may have given different weights to different factors. 

Opinion of Financial Advisor to the Data Return Board of Directors  

    On November 1, 2001, ABN AMRO delivered its oral opinion to the board of directors of Data Return that, as of that date and based on and subject to
various assumptions, matters considered and limitations described in its opinion, the exchange ratio set forth in the Data Return merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the
shareholders of Data Return. ABN AMRO subsequently confirmed its oral opinion by delivery of its written opinion dated as of November 1, 2001. 

    The
full text of the written opinion of ABN AMRO, dated as of November 1, 2001, which sets forth the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations
on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Appendix C to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. 

ABN AMRO provided its opinion for the information and
assistance of Data Return's board of directors in connection with its consideration of the merger. The
ABN AMRO opinion is directed only to the fairness from a financial point of view to the shareholders of Data Return of the exchange ratio. The opinion does not address
Data Return's business decision to effect the merger or constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of Data Return shares should vote with respect to the
transaction.
 We urge you to read the opinion, including its assumptions, matters considered and qualifications, in its entirety. The summary of ABN AMRO's opinion set
forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. 

    In
connection with its opinion, ABN AMRO: 

i.
reviewed
the structure of the merger;

ii.
reviewed
an execution form of the merger agreement and certain related documents referred to therein and the financial terms of the merger;

iii.
reviewed
Data Return's Annual Report on Form 10-K for each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2001 and March 31, 2000, and
Data Return's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2001, December 31, 2000, September 30, 2000 and June 30, 2000, and
Data Return's unaudited quarterly financials for the period ended September 30, 2001, and other business information relating to Data Return prepared and provided to
ABN AMRO by the management of Data Return;

iv.
reviewed
divine's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, and divine's Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2001, and divine's preliminary unaudited quarterly financials for the 

period
ended September 30, 2001, and other business information relating to divine prepared and provided to ABN AMRO by the management of divine; 

v.
reviewed
certain other publicly available information concerning both Data Return and divine and the trading markets for their common stocks;

vi.
reviewed
certain internal information and other data relating to Data Return and divine, respectively, and their respective businesses and
prospects, including forecasts and projections, prepared by and provided to ABN AMRO by the respective managements of Data Return and divine;

vii.
participated
in discussions with Data Return and divine concerning the operations, business strategy, financial performance and prospects
for Data Return and divine, respectively;

viii.
analyzed
certain other proposals and indications of interest received by Data Return relating to potential strategic transactions other
than the merger;

ix.
reviewed
certain publicly available information concerning certain of divine's pending transactions;

x.
analyzed
the terms of certain prior acquisitions by divine and forecasts and projections on these acquisitions prepared and provided to
ABN AMRO by the management of divine;

xi.
compared
certain publicly available information concerning certain other companies engaged in businesses which ABN AMRO believed to be
generally comparable to both
Data Return and divine and the trading markets for certain of such other companies' securities;

xii.
compared
the proposed financial terms of the merger with the financial terms of certain other public transactions that ABN AMRO considered
to be relevant;

xiii.
analyzed
the recent reported closing prices and trading activity for Data Return common stock and divine common stock;

xiv.
reviewed
equity research analyst reports for Data Return and divine;

xv.
met
with certain of the respective officers and employees of Data Return and divine concerning their respective businesses and operations,
assets, present conditions and prospects, and undertook such studies, analyses and investigations, as ABN AMRO deemed appropriate; and

xvi.
discussed
the strategic rationale for the proposed business combination with the respective managements of Data Return and divine. 

    In
rendering its opinion, ABN AMRO assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information that it reviewed, and did not obtain, nor did it make
or assume responsibility for undertaking, any independent verification of such information. ABN AMRO assumed that financial data had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best then
available estimates and judgment of Data Return and divine as to the future financial performance of both Data Return and divine. ABN AMRO also relied upon, without independent
verification, the assessment by the respective managements of Data Return and divine of the strategic and other benefits expected to result from the 

merger. In addition, ABN AMRO assumed that the merger, as well as divine's pending transactions as described in its registration statements, would be consummated in accordance with the terms
set forth in the respective merger agreements, without default, waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement. ABN AMRO also
assumed that the merger would be treated as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes. 

    ABN
AMRO did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities of Data Return or divine, nor was it furnished with such evaluations or appraisals.
ABN AMRO's opinion was necessarily based on the economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to ABN AMRO as of, the date of its
opinion. ABN AMRO reserved, however, the right to withdraw, revise or modify its opinion based upon additional information that may be provided to or obtained by it after the issuance of the
opinion that suggests, in ABN AMRO's judgment, a material change in the assumptions upon which its opinion was based; provided that ABN AMRO disclaims any obligation to withdraw, revise
or modify its opinion or to advise any person of any such additional information. 

ABN AMRO was not asked to, nor did it, offer any opinion as to the material terms of the merger agreement (other than the exchange ratio) or any related
documents or the obligations thereunder, or the form of the merger. Furthermore, ABN AMRO did not express any opinion as to (i) the prices at which divine's common stock will trade
following the announcement or consummation of the merger, (ii) the continued listing of divine's common stock on the Nasdaq National Market, (iii) the availability to divine after the
merger of any additional capital resources and liquidity necessary to permit it to achieve its business plans, forecasts and projections or (iv) the ability of divine to remain a going concern
after giving effect to the merger.

    As
of October 31, 2001, one day prior to the date that ABN AMRO delivered its opinion to the board of directors of Data Return, the exchange ratio represented a fully
diluted equity value for Data Return of approximately $34.9 million and a fully diluted equity value per share of Data Return of approximately $0.86 per share (i.e.,
assuming conversion of all in-the-money options outstanding under the treasury method), based on the closing price of divine Class A common stock of $0.43 on October 31, 2001. The offer
represented an "enterprise value" (defined as fully diluted equity value plus debt, adjusted for the market value of public debt when appropriate, less cash) to book value per share multiple of 2.1x,
a latest quarter annualized, or LQA, revenue multiple of 1.15x, an estimated 2001 calendar year, or CY2001E, revenue multiple of 1.07x, a projected 2002 calendar year, or CY2002P, revenue multiple of
1.08x and a CY2002P earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, multiple of 13.4x. 

    Data
Return can terminate the merger agreement prior to the effective time of the merger if the closing sale price per share of divine class A common stock as reported on the
Nasdaq National Market is equal to or less than 70% of the closing price on November 1, 2001 (i.e., $0.329) for ten consecutive trading days. For the purpose of its "walk-away" valuation
analysis, ABN AMRO used a valuation equivalent to 70% of divine's closing share price as of
October 31, 2001 (i.e., $0.30). The termination, or "walk-away", valuation, as of October 31, 2001, represented a fully diluted equity value for Data Return of approximately
$24.3 million and a fully diluted equity value per share of Data Return common shares of 

approximately $0.60 per share. The walk-away valuation represented an enterprise value to book value per share multiple of 1.5x, an LQA revenue multiple of 0.93x, a CY2001E revenue multiple of
0.87x, a CY2002P revenue multiple of 0.87x and a 2002P EBITDA multiple of 10.8x. 

    Furthermore,
the market value of the shares of divine's class A common stock, based on the exchange ratio and the closing price of such shares on the Nasdaq National Market on
October 31, 2001, to be exchanged for each share of Data Return common shares pursuant to the merger represents a premium of approximately 31.9% over the closing price of
Data Return common shares on the Nasdaq National Market on October 31, 2001 of $0.65 per share and a premium of approximately 59.1% over the average of the closing prices of
Data Return common shares for the last 30 days of trading prior to October 31, 2001. At the walk-away valuation, the market value of the shares of divine's class A common
stock, based upon the exchange ratio and the closing price of such shares on the Nasdaq National Market on October 31, 2001, to be exchanged for each share of Data Return common shares pursuant
to the merger represents a discount of approximately (7.6%) over the closing price of Data Return common shares on the Nasdaq National Market on October 31, 2001, and a premium of
approximately 11.3% over the average of the closing prices of Data Return common shares for the last 30 days of trading prior to October 31, 2001. 

    The
material financial analyses used by ABN AMRO in connection with providing its November 1, 2001 opinion to Data Return's board of directors were: 


a
comparable public company analysis;


a
comparable transaction analysis;


a
discounted cash flow analysis;


a
takeover premium analysis;


a
relative contribution analysis;


a
"has/gets" analysis; and


a
historical exchange ratio analysis. 

    The
following is a summary of these financial analyses, but is not a complete description of all the analyses performed and factors considered by ABN AMRO in connection with its
opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary
set forth below, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying ABN AMRO's opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination,
ABN AMRO considered the results of all such analyses. These analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other
factors that could affect the public trading or acquisition values of the companies concerned. In addition, no company or transaction considered in the analyses described below is directly comparable
to Data Return or divine or their contemplated transaction. 

The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses. In order to fully understand ABN AMRO's financial analyses, the tables must be read together  

 with the text of each summary. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions
underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of ABN AMRO's financial analyses. Unless otherwise indicated, estimated financial data for divine and Data Return
were based on internal estimates of their respective managements.  

Comparable Public Company Analysis  

    ABN AMRO reviewed and compared certain financial information for Data Return to corresponding financial information, ratios and public market
multiples for the following eight publicly traded corporations in the Web hosting industry, each of which is different, in certain respects, from Data Return: 


Digex
Inc.


Equinix
Inc.


Exodus
Communications Inc.


Genuity,
Inc.


Globix
Corp.


Interland
Inc.


Loudcloud
Inc.


NaviSite
Inc. 

    The
valuation multiples for Data Return were calculated using the Data Return closing price on October 24, 2001 (the day before ABN AMRO's first presentation to Data
Return's board of directors). The multiples for Data Return were based on publicly available information and information provided by Data Return's management. The multiples for each of
the selected companies were based on the most recent publicly available information and projections from equity analyst reports. With respect to the selected companies, ABN AMRO considered the
following multiples, adjusted for the market value of public debt when appropriate: 


Enterprise
value as a multiple of LQA revenues,


Enterprise
value as a multiple of CY2001E revenues, and


Enterprise
value as a multiple of CY2002P revenues. 

    The results of these analyses are summarized as follows:

Comparable Transaction Analysis  

    ABN AMRO considered ratios of enterprise value to selected historical operating results in order to indicate multiples acquirors have been willing to pay for
companies in the Web hosting industry. In order to perform this analysis, ABN AMRO reviewed a number of transactions that it considered comparable to the merger. ABN AMRO selected these
transactions by choosing recent transactions involving sellers in the Web hosting market as well as markets that ABN AMRO found to be similar to Web hosting. For this analysis, ABN AMRO
examined publicly available information. These transactions consisted of the acquisitions of: 


Integra
SA by Genuity Inc.


Digital
Island Inc. by Cable & Wireless Plc


Interland
Inc. by Micron Electronics Inc.


ISION
Internet AG by Energis Plc


GlobalCenter
by Exodus Communications


Intermedia
Communications Inc. by WorldCom Inc.


Verio
Inc. by NTT Communications Corp.


Concentric
Network Corp. by NEXTLINK Communications Inc.


AboveNet
Communications Inc. by MetroMedia Fiber Network Inc. 

    Although
ABN AMRO considered all the above transactions, for its analyses and valuation it focused on those transactions that it considered to be the most relevant based upon business
mix and market conditions. These transactions were the acquisitions of: 


Integra
SA by Genuity Inc.


Digital
Island Inc. by Cable & Wireless Plc


Interland
Inc. by Micron Electronics Inc. 

    The
following table presents the median and range of enterprise value revenue multiples: 

Enterprise Value as a Multiple of:

Range

Median

LQA revenues

0.44x-0.98x

0.77x

    These multiples reflect the actual multiples at the time these three relevant deals were announced, adjusted for the decline in an index of Web
hosting companies (comprised of Digex, Equinix, Exodus Communications, Genuity, Globix, Interland, Loudcloud and NaviSite) from the date of announcement of the three deals to October 24, 2001. 

    The
following table presents, as of October 24, 2001, the median implied per share values and the range of implied per share values of Data Return's common shares, calculated
by using the
revenue multiples shown above, which have been adjusted for the decline in the index of Web hosting companies, and Data Return's LQA revenues: 

Implied per Share

Range

Median

LQA revenues

$

0.01-$0.66

$

0.41

    If ABN AMRO had not adjusted the three relevant transactions for the decline in the index of Web hosting companies, the median LQA revenue
multiple would have been 2.33x, and the implied median value per share, based on that higher median LQA revenue multiple, would have been $2.26. 

    None
of the transactions used in the foregoing analysis is identical to the merger. In evaluating the transactions, ABN AMRO made numerous assumptions with respect to the Web
hosting industry's performance and general economic conditions, many of which are beyond the control of Data Return or divine. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the median or range, is not in
itself a meaningful method of using comparable transaction data. 

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis  

    ABN AMRO performed a discounted cash flow analysis, using estimates provided by Data Return management, in order to derive an implied equity value per
share reference range and compared this range with the proposed offer price in the merger. This analysis was based on: 


the
present value of the estimated, unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Data Return could generate over the five-year period of fiscal year
2002 through fiscal year 2006, and


the
terminal value of Data Return based on a range of multiples applied to estimated 2006 EBITDA. 

    For
purposes of this analysis, ABN AMRO used discount rates of 20.0% to 30.0%, which were based on ABN AMRO's judgment of Data Return's estimated weighted average cost
of capital and the current yield to maturity on the public debt of comparable public companies including: Equinix, Exodus and Globix, and terminal 2006 EBITDA multiples of 4.0x to 8.0x, which were
derived by assuming perpetuity growth rates of 4.0% to 6.0% after fiscal year 2006. This analysis implied an equity value per share reference range for Data Return of approximately $0.56 to $2.96.
ABN AMRO noted that the proposed exchange ratio implied an offer price in the merger of $0.86 based on divine's closing stock price on October 31, 

2001, which was within the implied equity value per share reference range for Data Return. Although ABN AMRO employed a discounted cash flow analysis, it advised the board of directors
of Data Return that this analysis could be misleading due to the unknown predictability of future cash flows. 

Takeover Premium Analysis  

    ABN AMRO considered the premiums paid above a seller's share price in order to determine the additional value that acquirors, when compared to public
stockholders, are willing to pay for companies in a particular market segment. In order to perform this analysis, ABN AMRO reviewed a number of transactions involving publicly-held
telecommunications and technology companies. ABN AMRO selected these transactions by choosing transactions since January 1, 2001 with an enterprise value of $100 million or less.
These transactions consisted of the acquisition of:

    None of the transactions used in the foregoing analysis is identical to the merger. In evaluating the transactions, ABN AMRO made
numerous assumptions with respect to the industry performance and general economic conditions, many of which are beyond the control of Data Return or divine. Mathematical analysis, such as
determining the median or range, is not in itself a meaningful method of using takeover premium data. 

Relative Contribution Analysis  

    ABN AMRO reviewed estimated future operating revenues and other operating metrics for Data Return and divine provided by Data Return's and
divine's managements to determine the contribution of each of Data Return and divine to the combined company's operations, giving effect to divine's then pending acquisitions of Eprise, Open
Market, eshare Communications and RoweCom. During the preparation of these analyses, divine closed on the acquisitions of Open Market and eshare on October 19, 2001 and October 31, 2001,
respectively. Furthermore, on October 25, 2001, RoweCom shareholders approved the divine merger, thus giving the transaction a high probability of closure. ABN AMRO also reviewed such
estimated future operating revenues and other operating metrics without giving effect to the pending acquisitions of RoweCom and Eprise to determine the contribution of each of Data Return and
divine to the combined company's operations.

"Has/Gets" Analysis  

    ABN AMRO compared the pre-transaction value per common share of Data Return for a number of operating metrics with the value per common share of
Data Return after giving effect to the merger. During the preparation of these analyses, divine closed on the acquisitions of Open Market and eshare on October 19, 2001 and
October 31, 2001, respectively. Furthermore, on October 25, 2001, RoweCom shareholders approved the divine merger, thus giving the transaction a high probability of closure.
ABN AMRO also calculated the pro forma impact of the merger on the value per common share of Data Return giving effect only to divine's pending acquisitions of Open Market and eshare.

Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis  

    ABN AMRO reviewed the historical daily trading prices for Data Return's common shares and divine's common stock for the period from January 2,
2001 to October 24, 2001. Set forth below is a graph of the historical Data Return share price divided by divine's share price over such period. ABN AMRO's analysis indicated that the
sixty-day average of the historical Data Return share price divided by divine's share price was 0.72x, the sixty-day high was 1.24x, and the sixty day low was 0.36x, compared to the exchange
ratio of 1.9876x proposed in the merger. 

Miscellaneous  

    The analyses described above were prepared solely for the purpose of ABN AMRO providing its opinion to the Data Return board of directors as to
the fairness from a financial point of view of the exchange ratio to the shareholders of Data Return. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which
businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results or values are not necessarily indicative of actual future results or values, which may be significantly
more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. Because such analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or
their respective advisors, none of Data Return, divine, ABN AMRO or any other person assumes responsibility if future results or values are materially different from those forecast. 

    None
of the analyses performed by ABN AMRO was assigned greater significance by ABN AMRO than any other. ABN AMRO arrived at its ultimate opinion based on the results of
all analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole. ABN AMRO did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or method of analysis. 

    ABN
AMRO did not make any recommendation with respect to the exchange ratio, which was determined through negotiation between Data Return and divine. As described above,
ABN AMRO's opinion to the board of directors of Data Return was only one of many factors taken into consideration by the Data Return board of directors in its evaluation of the
Data Return merger agreement and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Data Return board of directors or management with respect to the merger or the exchange ratio
provided for in the merger agreement. 

    Data
Return selected ABN AMRO as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized full service securities firm that engages in securities trading and brokerage
activities, in addition to providing investment banking services, with substantial experience in similar transactions, and is familiar with Data Return and its business. In the ordinary course of its
business, ABN AMRO may actively trade or otherwise effect transactions in the securities of Data Return and divine and, accordingly, may hold a long or short position in such securities.
Furthermore, certain ABN AMRO employees may own Data Return and/or divine common stock. LaSalle Bank National Association, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ABN AMRO, is a lender to divine and has
received or will receive customary compensation as such. Moreover, divine provides certain software-related services to ABN AMRO, namely MindAlign, for which ABN AMRO pays customary
compensation to divine. 

    ABN
AMRO acted as financial advisor to Data Return in connection with the merger and will receive a customary fee for its services, a significant portion of which is contingent
upon consummation of the merger. Data Return has also agreed to reimburse ABN AMRO for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, subject to certain limitations, and to indemnify
ABN AMRO and related parties against liabilities, including liabilities under federal securities laws, relating to its engagement. 

Accounting Treatment  

    divine will record the merger using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This means that for
financial reporting purposes, divine will treat both companies as one company beginning as of the date we 

complete the merger. In addition, under this method of accounting, divine will record the fair value of Data Return's net assets on its consolidated financial statements, with the remaining
purchase price in excess of the fair value of Data Return's net assets recorded as goodwill. See "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements" beginning on page 95. 

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger  

    In considering the recommendation of the Data Return board of directors that Data Return shareholders adopt and approve the merger agreement and
the merger, you should be aware that certain directors and officers of Data Return have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as shareholders of
Data Return. The Data Return board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in adopting and approving the merger agreement and the merger. 

 Payment for Common Stock and Options  

    Each common share of Data Return held by officers and directors of Data Return will be treated like all other common shares of Data Return and
will be converted into the right to receive 1.9876 shares of divine common stock (subject to adjustment in certain limited circumstances). Stock options held by officers and directors of Data
Return will also be treated like all other options to purchase Data Return common shares, except for the acceleration of some options held by officers and directors pursuant to employment and
retention agreements, as described more fully below. Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding Data Return option will, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable plans and option
agreement, be terminated if the result of dividing the exercise price of the Data Return option by the exchange ratio is greater than the closing sale price of divine's common stock on the
trading day immediately preceding the effective time of the merger. The merger agreement also provides that outstanding employee stock options that are terminated will be replaced by options to
purchase divine common stock. If the result of dividing the exercise price of the Data Return option by the exchange ratio is less than or equal to the closing sale price of divine's stock on
the trading day immediately preceding the effective time of the merger, that option will automatically become an option to purchase divine common stock. Each such divine option will represent an
option to purchase the number of shares of divine common stock equal to the number of common shares of Data Return purchasable by the Data Return option multiplied by the exchange ratio
at an exercise price per share equal to the exercise price of the Data Return option divided by the exchange ratio. 

 Employment Agreements  

    A total of 18 officers of Data Return are parties to employment agreements with Data Return. Each of Sunny C. Vanderbeck, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
Michelle R. Chambers, President, Robert A. Prosen, Chief Operating Officer, Stuart A. Walker, Senior Vice PresidentChief Financial Officer, Jason A. Lochhead, Vice
PresidentChief Technology Officer, Mark C. Gunnin, Vice PresidentGeneral Counsel, Mark Bowles, Vice PresidentOperational Effectiveness, and Mark Warren, Vice
PresidentSoftware Development, has an employment agreement with Data Return. If any of these officers' employment with Data Return is terminated without cause (including constructive 

termination) within the 27 month period beginning three months prior to the merger and ending 24 months after the merger, he or she will be entitled to a lump sum payment equal to
one times (or in the case of Mr. Vanderbeck, Ms. Chambers, Mr. Prosen and Mr. Walker three times) the following items: 


the
highest annualized base salary earned during his or her employment with Data Return;


the
greater of (1) two times his or her largest bonus during the last two years and (2) 60% of the highest annualized base salary;


any
unpaid expense, reimbursement or accrued but unpaid salary or benefit; and


the
estimated cost of insurance coverage for the twelve months following termination. 

    If
the termination following the merger is voluntarily initiated by the officer, the base salary component of these cash severance payments will, in the case of Mr. Vanderbeck,
Ms. Chambers, Mr. Prosen, Mr. Walker and Mr. Gunnin, equal 75% and, in the case of Mr. Bowles, Mr. Lochhead and Mr. Warren equal 25%, of the severance
payment described above. 

    In
addition, upon consummation of the merger, 100% of the unvested options held by Mr. Vanderbeck, Ms. Chambers, Mr. Walker, Mr. Prosen and
Mr. Gunnin will automatically vest. In the case of Mr. Bowles, Mr. Lochhead and Mr. Warren, the portion of their unvested options that would have vested on the next vesting
date will immediately vest upon consummation of the merger, and the remainder of their unvested options shall be accelerated by one year. If Mr. Bowles, Mr. Lochhead or Mr. Warren
is constructively terminated or terminated without cause within the 27 month period beginning three months prior to the merger and ending 24 months after the merger, his unvested
options shall vest immediately. 

    Data
Return also has employment agreements with Tom Blair, Vice PresidentNorth American Sales, Lambert Mathieu, Vice PresidentFinancial Operations, Ken
Pedersen, Vice PresidentCustomer Service Delivery, Alonso Perales, Group Vice PresidentGlobal Alliances, Ed Pierson, Vice PresidentSystems Operations, Rob
Stovall, Vice PresidentFinancial Planning, and Rick Carey, Vice PresidentPeople and Organizational Development. Pursuant to these employment agreements, if any of these
officers is terminated without cause (including constructive termination) within the 27 month period beginning three months prior to the merger and ending 24 months after the
merger, each would be entitled to a lump sum payment equal to three months' salary and three months of insurance coverage (except for Mr. Perales, who would be entitled to
nine months' salary and nine months of insurance coverage). In addition, if any of these officers is employed 180 days after the merger is consummated or has been terminated other
than for cause before that date, 100% of his unvested options will immediately vest. 

    Data
Return also has employment agreements with Todd Steitle, Senior Vice PresidentProduct Development, Michael Shiff, Executive Vice President, and Ken Garber, Senior
Vice PresidentMarketing, Worldwide Sales and Business Development. Upon consummation of the merger, all of Mr. Shiff's unvested options will vest immediately, 50% of
Mr. Garber's outstanding unvested options will vest immediately and the remaining 50% will vest one year later, and all of Mr. Steitle's unvested options will vest immediately. In
addition, Mr. Garber 

is entitled to 12 months of salary and 100% of his unvested options will immediately vest if he is terminated without cause following consummation of the merger. 

    Assuming
all 18 of the officers with employment agreements are terminated immediately following the consummation of the merger, Data Return will be obligated to make lump sum cash
payments totaling approximately $4.9 million. 

    divine
has indicated that it intends to offer to enter into amendments to the employment agreements with certain of these officers but that it has not yet determined which officers or
the terms of the amendments. However, the merger agreement provides that divine will honor all employment agreements of Data Return currently in place, unless otherwise amended by the parties. 

 Retention Agreements  

    In addition to the employment agreements described above, Data Return has entered into retention agreements with four employees. These agreements provide that
if the applicable employee is employed 180 days after the merger or has been terminated other than for cause, 100% of his options will become immediately vested. 

 Indemnification and Insurance.  

    Upon completion of the merger, the surviving corporation will fulfill and honor all of Data Return's existing obligations to indemnify the officers and
directors of Data Return and its subsidiaries. In addition, the surviving corporation will indemnify Data Return's officers and directors for acts or omissions in such capacity occurring prior to the
completion of the merger. Further, for six years after the completion of the merger, the surviving corporation's articles of incorporation and bylaws will contain indemnification provisions as
favorable to the officers and directors of Data Return or its subsidiaries as the indemnification provisions in Data Return's current articles of incorporation and bylaws. 

    Upon
completion of the merger, the surviving corporation will provide for six years directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who were covered by Data
Return's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy as of the date of the merger agreement. However, the surviving corporation will not be required to spend more than 200% of the annual
premium currently paid by Data Return for that coverage. 

 Shareholder Voting Agreement  

    divine has entered into a shareholder voting agreement with Mr. Vanderbeck, Ms. Chambers, Mr. Lochhead, Mr. Walker and certain other
shareholders of Data Return. Each of these officers and directors has agreed, subject to certain terms and conditions of the voting agreement, to vote all of the common shares of Data Return owned by
him or her in favor of approval of the merger agreement and the merger and against any competing transaction. 

 Affiliate Registration Statement  

    divine has agreed to file a Form S-3 registration statement with the SEC within 30 days of the effective date of the merger in order to register
the shares of divine common stock issued to affiliates of Data Return, including executive officers and directors, in the merger. divine has agreed to maintain the effectiveness of the registration
statement for a period of one year after the effective time, unless divine reasonably determines that the Data Return affiliates will be able to sell all of their shares of divine common stock without
the registration statement within the three-month period following the termination of the effectiveness of the registration statement. 

 Guarantee of Loan  

    In January 2001, Data Return entered into a guarantee with a financial institution pursuant to which Data Return guaranteed up to $5.0 million of the margin
debt of a Texas family limited partnership (an estate planning entity) controlled by Sunny C. Vanderbeck, the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Data Return. In June 2001,
this guarantee was replaced with a new guarantee that reduced the amount to $2.0 million. On October 26, 2001, the financial institution sold the last of the stock securing the margin
debt and, on November 6, 2001, exercised its rights under the guarantee and took possession of the $2.0 million of Data Return cash and cash equivalents previously pledged to secure the
guarantee. Data Return has no further obligations with respect to this guarantee. Pursuant to a letter agreement with the limited partnership and Mr. Vanderbeck, the limited partnership
and Mr. Vanderbeck are required to repay the $2.0 million paid by Data Return under the guarantee. Mr. Vanderbeck has also granted to Data Return a security interest in certain
properties to secure this repayment obligation. This repayment obligation will survive the merger and continue to be an asset of the surviving corporation. 

Stock Ownership Following the Merger  

    As of November 14, 2001, divine had approximately 292,375,767 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Based upon 36,182,438
common shares of Data Return issued and outstanding on November 14, 2001 and the 1.9876 exchange ratio, divine will issue approximately 71,916,214 shares of divine common stock
upon completion of the Data Return merger. As a result, following completion of the merger, and assuming divine does not issue any additional shares of its common stock (in the pending Eprise
Corporation merger or otherwise), Data Return shareholders would own approximately 19.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of divine common stock. Assuming that divine (1) completes its
pending merger with Eprise Corporation and issues approximately 53,968,000 shares of divine common stock in that merger, and (2) does not issue any other shares of divine common
stock prior to the closing of this merger, the existing holders of these common shares of Data Return collectively will hold approximately 17.2% of divine common stock issued and outstanding after the
merger. 

Regulatory Matters  

    The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, which prevents specified transactions from
being completed until required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and specified waiting periods are
terminated or expire. Because the value of the divine common stock to be issued in the merger is, as of November 14, 2001, less than $50 million, no information or materials are required
to be so filed. If the value of the divine common stock to be issued in the merger were to increase and to exceed $50 million for at least 45 consecutive days prior to the closing of the
merger, we would be required to make the relevant filings, and the closing of the merger would be delayed until the specified waiting periods from the time of filing had terminated or expired. 

    The
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds, either before or after expiration of the waiting
period. Accordingly, at any time before or after the completion of the merger, either the 

Antitrust Division or the Federal Trade Commission could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, or other persons could take action under the
antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the merger. Additionally, at any time before or after the completion of the merger, any state could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems
necessary or desirable in the public interest. We cannot assure you that a challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail. 

Dissenters' Rights  

    You are not entitled to dissenters' rights or appraisal rights under Texas law in connection with the merger. 

Federal Securities Laws Consequences  

    The shares of divine common stock to be issued in connection with the merger will be registered under the Securities Act and will be freely transferable under
the Securities Act,
except for shares of divine common stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of Data Return on the date of the special meeting or of divine following completion of the merger.
Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under the common control of Data Return or divine, as applicable, and may include
executive officers, directors and significant stockholders of Data Return or divine, as applicable. Affiliates of Data Return may not sell their shares of divine common stock acquired in connection
with the merger except pursuant to: 


an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of those shares;


Rule 145
(or, for Data Return shareholders who become affiliates of divine, Rule 144) under the Securities Act; or


any
other applicable exemption under the Securities Act. 

    The
merger agreement provides that Data Return will use its reasonable efforts to obtain from each of its affiliates (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) a
written agreement providing that the affiliate will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any divine common stock issued to the affiliate pursuant to the merger, except in compliance with
Rule 145 or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. 

    divine's
registration statement, of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part, does not cover the resale of shares of divine common stock to be received by Data Return
affiliates in the merger. However, the merger agreement provides that the shares of divine common stock issued to Data Return affiliates will be registered on a registration statement on Form S-3
filed with the SEC within 30 days after the completion of the merger. divine has agreed to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-3 for 12 months
following the merger unless divine reasonably determines that all of the affiliates' shares could be sold without the registration statement during the three month period following the termination of
the effectiveness of the registration statement. 

Nasdaq National Market  

    The shares of divine common stock to be issued in connection with the merger are required to be approved for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market, subject
to official 

notice of issuance, before the completion of the merger. When the merger is completed, common shares of Data Return will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. For a discussion of the risks associated with the possible delisting of divine common stock on the Nasdaq National Market see "Risk FactorsRisks Relating
to Owning divine Common Stock" on page 46. 

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences  

    The following are the material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, applicable Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations and court decisions as in effect as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, all of which may change, possibly
with retroactive effect. 

    This
discussion only addresses United States federal income tax consequences of those shareholders who hold their Data Return common shares as capital assets. It does not address all
aspects of federal income taxation that may be important to you in light of your particular circumstances or if you are subject to special rules, such as: 


you
are not a citizen or resident of the United States;


you
are a financial institution or insurance company;


you
are a tax-exempt organization;


you
are a dealer or broker in securities;


you
hold your Data Return shares as part of a hedge, appreciated financial position, straddle or conversion transaction; or


you
acquired your Data Return shares by exercising options or otherwise as compensation. 

    This
discussion of material federal income tax consequences is not a complete analysis or description of all potential federal income tax consequences of the merger. This discussion
does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or are contingent on, individual circumstances. In addition, it does not address any non-income tax or any foreign, state or local tax
consequences of the merger. 

We strongly urge you to consult your own tax advisor to determine the particular United States federal, state, local or foreign tax consequences of the merger
to you.  

    Tax Opinion.
  The obligation of Data Return to consummate the merger is conditioned upon the receipt of a legal opinion
from Thompson & Knight L.L.P., special tax counsel to Data Return, that the merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and that this opinion of
counsel shall not have been withdrawn prior to closing. However, the merger agreement provides that if Thompson & Knight L.L.P. does not render this tax opinion, this condition will nonetheless
be deemed satisfied if regular counsel for Data Return or counsel to divine delivers a tax opinion to Data Return. The opinion of Thompson & Knight L.L.P. will rely on customary factual assumptions
and customary representations made by Data Return and divine. If any of the factual assumptions or representations relied upon by Thompson & Knight L.L.P. are inaccurate, the opinion may not
accurately describe the federal income tax treatment of the merger, and this discussion 

may not accurately describe the tax consequences of the merger. The opinion of Thompson & Knight L.L.P is not binding upon the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and it is possible that the
Internal Revenue Service or the courts will disagree with the opinion of Thompson & Knight L.L.P. Further, neither divine nor Data Return intends to obtain an IRS ruling on the tax consequences of the
merger. 

    Federal Income Tax Treatment of the Merger.
  The merger is intended to qualify as a "reorganization" under
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The discussion
immediately below "Federal Income Tax Consequences to Data Return Shareholders" assumes that the merger will qualify as a reorganization. 

    Federal Income Tax Consequences to Data Return Shareholders.
  Provided that the merger qualifies as a reorganization,
then for federal income tax purposes, subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications referred to herein: 


You
will not recognize any gain or loss upon the exchange of your Data Return common shares for shares of divine common stock in the merger.


You
will have a tax basis in the divine common stock you receive in the merger equal to the aggregate tax basis of the Data Return common shares you
surrender in the merger.


The
holding period for shares of divine common stock you receive in exchange for Data Return common shares in the merger will include the holding period
for the Data Return common shares you surrender in the merger. 

    Federal Income Tax Consequences to divine Stockholders.
  For federal income tax purposes, holders of divine common stock
will not recognize gain or loss on their divine common stock as a result of the merger. 

    Net Operating Losses.
  As of the effective date of the merger, Data Return estimates that it will have a net operating
loss carry forward of approximately $89.0 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The ability of the divine consolidated group to utilize pre-merger net operating losses of Data Return
may be limited because former Data Return shareholders will own less than fifty percent (50%) of the capital stock of divine after the merger. Accordingly, the merger will result in an "ownership
change" of Data Return as that term is defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and utilization of any net operating losses of Data Return will be subject to the limitations imposed by
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. 

The preceding discussion is intended only as a summary of material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger and does not purport to be a
complete analysis or discussion of all potential tax effects relevant thereto. Thus, you are urged to consult your own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to you of the merger, including
tax
return reporting requirements, the applicability and effect of foreign, federal, state, local and other applicable tax laws and the effect of any proposed changes in tax laws.  

THE MERGER AGREEMENT    

    The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A to this proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. The following is not a complete statement of all provisions of the merger agreement. Statements made in this proxy statement/prospectus
with respect to the terms of the merger agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the more detailed information set forth in the merger agreement. 

The Merger  

    Following the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger by Data Return's shareholders and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions
to the merger, TD Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine, will merge with and into Data Return. As a result of the merger, TD Acquisition Corp. will cease to exist, Data Return will
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine and you will become a stockholder of divine. The merger will become effective upon the filing of articles of merger with the Texas Secretary of State or at
any later time as may be specified in the articles of merger. We will file the articles of merger as soon as practicable after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to complete the merger, unless
divine and Data Return agree otherwise. We cannot assure you, however, that the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived or that the merger agreement will not be terminated. See
"Conditions of the Merger" and "Termination." 

    After
the merger: 


Data
Return's articles of incorporation will be amended to read as set forth in Exhibit C to the merger agreement, and will govern the surviving
corporation;


the
bylaws of TD Acquisition Corp. will become the bylaws of Data Return; and


the
officers and directors of TD Acquisition Corp. will become the officers and directors of Data Return. 

Consideration to be Received in the Merger  

    Upon completion of the merger, each issued and outstanding common share of Data Return will be exchanged for 1.9876 shares of divine common stock, subject to
adjustment. If the total number of common shares of Data Return outstanding immediately prior to the merger is greater than 36,350,372, the exchange ratio will be adjusted to equal the quotient of
(A) 72,250,000 divided by (B) the total number of common shares of Data Return outstanding at that time. Because there were only 36,182,438 common shares of Data Return outstanding as of
November 14, 2001, an additional 167,934 common shares of Data Return would have to be issued in order to trigger an adjustment in the exchange ratio. Data Return is prohibited under the terms of the
merger agreement from issuing additional shares except upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants and except to the extent approved by divine. Certain holders of options that are currently
in-the-money have contractually agreed not to exercise their options prior to the merger and none of Data Return's outstanding warrants are currently in-the-money. 

No Fractional Shares  

    divine will not issue fractional shares of divine common stock in the merger. Instead, any holder of Data Return common shares that would otherwise be entitled
to receive a fraction of a divine share in the merger will receive a number of divine shares rounded up or down to the nearest whole number (with fractions equal to or greater than 0.5 being rounded
up). 

Procedures for Exchange of Certificates  

    As soon as practicable after the merger, the exchange agent will mail to each registered holder of Data Return common shares (1) a letter of transmittal
and (2) instructions for surrendering Data Return share certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of
divine common stock. Upon surrendering to the exchange agent a Data Return share certificate along with a duly executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, you will be entitled to
receive a certificate representing the whole number of shares of divine common stock that you have the right to receive. 

    If
any Data Return share certificate has been lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed, divine will require the owner of that lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed Data Return share
certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and may require the owner to deliver a bond as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the exchange agent, divine or Data Return with
respect to such Data Return share certificate. 

You should not surrender your Data Return share certificates for exchange until you receive a letter of transmittal and instructions from the exchange agent.  

 Treatment of Outstanding Options  

    Each outstanding option to purchase common shares of Data Return under Data Return's stock option plans with an exercise price that, when divided by the
exchange ratio, is greater than the closing sale price of divine common stock on the trading day immediately prior to the completion of the merger, will be canceled to the extent permitted by the
applicable option agreement and option plan and applicable law. Each outstanding Data Return option with an exercise price that, when divided by the exchange ratio, is less than or equal to the
closing sale price of divine common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the completion of the merger, will be converted into an option to purchase divine common stock with an exercise price
equal to the exercise price of the Data Return option divided by the exchange ratio, for a number of shares of divine common stock determined by multiplying the number of common shares of Data Return
subject to the Data Return option by the exchange ratio. For those out-of-the money Data Return options that are terminated, divine will grant replacement options to purchase a total of approximately
14,383,000 shares of divine common stock, less the number of shares of divine common stock that are subject to options issued upon conversion of in-the-money Data Return options and less the product
of the exchange ratio multiplied by the number of common shares of Data Return issued upon exercise of Data Return options between November 1, 2001 and the date the merger is consummated. As of
October 31, 2001, Data Return had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 9,600,000 common shares of Data Return, with exercise prices ranging from $0.02 to $84.81.
Based on the 1.9876 exchange ratio and the closing sale price of divine common stock of $0.52 as of November 14, 2001, only 5,209,123 of those options were in-the-money at that time. 

    In addition, the merger agreement provides that the shares of divine common stock issuable upon exercise of these options will be registered on a registration statement on
Form S-8 filed with the SEC within 30 days after the completion of the merger. 

Treatment of Outstanding Warrants  

    Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding warrant to purchase common shares of Data Return will be converted into a warrant to purchase a number of
shares of divine common stock at an exercise price as determined in accordance with the terms of the warrant. As of November 14, 2001, Data Return had outstanding warrants to purchase
(1) 340,910 common shares of Data Return at an exercise price of $11.00 per share, and (2) 5,000 common shares of Data Return at an exercise price of $49.1875 per share. Upon completion
of the merger, assuming an exchange ratio of 1.9876, the first warrant will convert into a warrant to purchase approximately 677,593 shares of divine common stock at an exercise price of approximately
$5.53 per share and the second warrant will convert into a warrant to purchase approximately 9,938 shares of divine common stock at an exercise price of approximately $24.75 per share.

    No Solicitation of Alternative Transactions.
  Until completion of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement,
Data Return has agreed not to: 


solicit,
initiate or take any action to facilitate or encourage a "company acquisition proposal," as defined below; or


engage
in, or enter into, any negotiations or discussions concerning any company acquisition proposal. 

    However,
prior to approval of the merger agreement by Data Return's shareholders, in response to an unsolicited company acquisition proposal (1) that is, or may lead to, a
company superior proposal, as defined below, (2) that did not result from Data Return's breach of its obligations not to solicit alternative transactions, and (3) that the board of
directors of Data Return determines in good faith (after consultation with and based upon the advice of its outside counsel) that in light of such company acquisition proposal, if Data Return fails to
participate in such discussions and negotiations with, or provide nonpublic information to, the party making such proposal, there is a reasonable probability that the board of directors of Data Return
would be in violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and provided that Data Return promptly (in any event within 24 hours) provides notice to divine of its intent to do so, Data Return
may participate in discussions regarding any company acquisition proposal, and may provide nonpublic information to the other party making the company acquisition proposal, in order to be informed and
make a determination with respect to that proposal. In such event, Data Return shall promptly inform divine of the material terms and conditions of such company acquisition proposal, including the
identity of the person or entity making such company acquisition proposal, and promptly keep divine informed of the status, including any material change to the terms, of any such company acquisition
proposal. 

    A
"company acquisition proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer by a third party relating to any: 


merger,
consolidation, business combination, or similar transaction involving Data Return or any subsidiary of Data Return;


sale,
lease or other disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise, of any assets of Data Return or any
subsidiary of Data Return in one or more transactions;


issuance,
sale, or other disposition of (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities (or options,
rights or warrants to purchase such securities, or securities convertible into such securities) of Data Return or any subsidiary of Data Return;


liquidation,
dissolution, recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to Data Return or any of its subsidiaries; or


tender
offer or exchange offer for Data Return securities; 

that
would result in a third party (or its stockholders) acquiring more than 50% of the voting power of Data Return, or assets representing more than 50% of Data Return's consolidated net income, net
revenue or assets, or any transaction similar in form, substance or purpose to 

any transaction listed above; or any public announcement of an agreement, proposal, plan or intention to enter into any transaction listed above. 

    A
"company superior proposal" means any offer, not solicited by Data Return after the date of the merger agreement, to engage in a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation
or similar transaction that would result in a third party owning more than fifty percent of the common shares of Data Return (or the common shares of the surviving company in a
merger), or all or substantially all of the assets of Data Return, and that the Data Return board of directors determines in good faith has a reasonable likelihood of closing and otherwise on terms
that the Data Return board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and considering other matters that it deems relevant)
would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to Data Return shareholders than the merger, taking into account, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Data Return board of
directors after consultation with its financial advisor, the availability to the person making the company superior proposal of the financial means to conclude the transaction. 

    Neither
the Data Return board of directors nor any committee thereof may, except as required by its fiduciary duties as determined in good faith thereby (after consultation with and
based on the advice of its outside counsel), (1) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to divine, the approval or recommendation by the Data Return board of
directors of the merger and the merger agreement, (2) approve, recommend or otherwise support or endorse any company acquisition proposal, or (3) cause Data Return to enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement with respect to any company acquisition proposal. Data Return is not prohibited from taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Data Return shareholders if, in the
good faith judgment of the Data Return board of directors (after consultation with and based upon the advice of its outside counsel), such disclosure is necessary for the board of directors to comply
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. 

    Other Covenants.
  The merger agreement contains certain other covenants and agreements, including agreements relating to
preparation and distribution of this proxy statement/prospectus, access to information, public announcements, maintenance of insurance and cooperation regarding certain filings with governmental and
other agencies and organizations. In addition, the merger agreement contains a general covenant requiring each of the parties to use its commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate the merger and to
ensure that the merger is treated as a tax-free reorganization. The merger agreement also contains covenants regarding Data Return's benefit plans and other employment matters. 

Conditions to the Merger  

    The obligations of divine, TD Acquisition Corp. and Data Return to consummate the merger are subject to a number of customary conditions, including the
following: 


adoption
and approval of the merger agreement and merger by the requisite vote by the shareholders of Data Return and, if necessary, approval by the
stockholders of divine of the issuance of shares of divine common stock in the merger;

exceptions. 

    In
addition, the obligation of Data Return to consummate the merger is subject to the condition that Data Return shall have received a written opinion from its special tax counsel
stating that the merger will constitute a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and that opinion shall not
have been withdrawn; however, if special tax counsel to Data Return does not render that opinion, the condition shall be deemed to be satisfied with respect to Data Return if Data Return's regular
counsel or if counsel for divine renders such opinion. 

    In
addition, the obligations of each of divine and Data Return to consummate the merger are subject to the condition that: 


at
or prior to the effective time the other party's representations and warranties set forth in the merger agreement that are qualified as to materiality
or material adverse effect shall be true and correct, and those that are not so qualified shall be true and correct in all material
respects, in each case except as contemplated by the merger agreement, except, in all cases where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the other party;


the
other party shall have performed or complied in all material respects with its agreements and covenants required to be performed or complied with under
the merger agreement as of or prior to the completion of the merger; and


each
party shall have received a certificate from an executive officer of the other party to the effect that the foregoing conditions have been satisfied. 

Indemnification and Insurance  

    The merger agreement provides that after we complete the merger, the surviving corporation will honor existing indemnification obligations of Data Return,
indemnify directors and officers of Data Return or its subsidiaries for acts or omissions occurring prior to the merger and provide indemnification arrangements for Data Return's officers and
directors that are at least as favorable as those in Data Return's current articles of incorporation and bylaws for a period of six years after the merger. In addition, the surviving corporation will
provide for six years after the merger directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who were covered by Data Return's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy as of
the date of the merger agreement. However, the surviving corporation will not be required to spend more than 200% of the annual premium currently paid by Data Return for that coverage.

this approval; (2) Data Return terminates the merger agreement because divine breached or failed to perform any of the covenants or other agreements contained in the merger agreement, or if any

aggregate amount of these loans and obligations (without duplication) then outstanding, divided by $0.94. 

Expenses  

    If the merger agreement is terminated by Data Return (1) because divine breaches or fails to perform any of the covenants or other agreements contained

Amendments  

    Subject to the applicable provisions of Texas corporate law, at any time prior to completion of the merger, divine and Data Return, by resolution of their
respective boards of directors, may modify or amend the merger agreement by written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of each company. The merger agreement provides,
however, that after approval of the merger by Data Return's shareholders, no amendment that requires further shareholder approval can be made without approval of Data Return's shareholders. 

AGREEMENTS RELATED TO THE MERGER    

    The following summary of certain agreements related to the Data Return merger agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the agreements. This
summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you. We therefore urge you to read the full text of these agreements. 

The Shareholder Voting Agreements  

    As an inducement for divine and TD Acquisition Corp. to enter into the merger agreement, each of Nathan Landow Family Limited Partnership, DCR Technology
Fund I, Ltd., OHG Technology, Ltd., Sunny C. Vanderbeck, Michelle R. Chambers, Jason A. Lochhead, Stuart A. Walker, and Level 3
Communications, LLC, as beneficial owners of common shares of Data Return, have entered into shareholder voting agreements with divine. Under the shareholder voting agreements, these
shareholders agreed to vote all of the common shares covered by the shareholder voting agreements in favor of the merger, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. In addition, these shareholders each irrevocably appointed divine as his, her or its lawful attorney and proxy. The proxy grants divine, or any nominee of divine, the limited right to vote
all of the common shares of Data Return covered by the shareholder voting agreements in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and any transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. In addition, these shareholders have further agreed, with limited exception, not to offer, sell, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of any of their common shares of Data Return until the
termination of the shareholder voting agreements, which will occur upon the termination of the merger agreement. As of November 14, 2001, the shares subject to the shareholder voting agreements
represented approximately 36% of the outstanding common shares of Data Return that are entitled to vote at the special meeting. 

    The
shareholder voting agreements are incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, and copies are attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement/prospectus. 

The Credit Agreement  

    In connection with the merger agreement, divine and Data Return entered into a credit agreement, pursuant to which divine has made loans to Data Return of
approximately $7.0 million and will, upon request, make additional loans to Data Return up to an aggregate of $12,800,000, subject to Data Return's compliance with certain financial covenants.
To evidence the loan, Data Return executed and delivered to divine a note in the principal amount of $12,800,000. Any amount that is outstanding under the credit agreement accrues interest at an
annual rate of the lower of 10% or the maximum amount allowed by law. As security for the funds loaned by divine to Data Return under this credit agreement, Data Return executed a security agreement
granting divine security interests in certain assets and property of Data Return. 

    In
the event that the merger agreement is terminated because (1) divine breaches or fails to perform any of the covenants or other agreements contained in the merger agreement,
or any representation or warranty of divine becomes untrue such that, in either case, certain conditions to the merger would not be satisfied, and such breach or failure to be true has not been or is
incapable of being cured within 20 business days following notice or, (2) if the vote of divine's stockholders is necessary, divine's stockholders do not approve the merger or the 

board of directors of divine fails to recommend the merger to divine's stockholders, the amounts owed to divine under the credit agreement would be converted into the number of common shares of Data
Return equal to the outstanding principal amount of the loans, plus accrued interest, divided by $0.94, which is the product of (A) the trailing five-day volume weighted average
price of divine common stock as of November 1, 2001, multiplied by (B) the exchange ratio of 1.9876. If the merger agreement is terminated because (1) Data Return's shareholders
do not approve the merger; (2) Data Return breaches the merger agreement; (3) the board of directors of Data Return withdraws or modifies its recommendation of the merger and the merger
agreement to the shareholders of Data Return; (4) Data Return fails to include in the proxy statement/prospectus the recommendation of its board of directors in favor of adoption of the merger
agreement; (5) in response to a third-party tender offer or exchange offer, Data Return's board of directors takes any action other than rejection of the offer; (6) Data Return's board
of directors recommends an alternative acquisition proposal; (7) Data Return's board of directors resolves to do any of the foregoing; (8) Data Return enters into an agreement
regarding, or consummates, an acquisition transaction with a party other than divine; or (9) the merger is not consummated by February 28, 2002 (March 31, 2002, in certain
circumstances), the amounts owed to divine under the credit agreement would become due 90 days from the date of that termination. If Data Return terminates the merger agreement because the
closing sale price of divine common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market is equal to or less than $0.329 for ten consecutive trading days, the amounts
owed to divine under the credit agreement would become due 180 days from the date of such termination. 

    The
amount available to be borrowed by Data Return under the credit agreement from time to time equals $12,800,000 less the sum of (1) the principal amount of all loans made
under the agreement (regardless of whether such amounts have been repaid or remain outstanding) and (2) the Available Amount. The "Available Amount" means (A) from the date of the credit
agreement to but excluding November 15, 2001, $5,500,000, (B) from November 15, 2001 to but excluding December 15, 2001, $2,750,000 and (C) from December 15,
2001 to and including the termination date, $0. The credit agreement is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. 

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED
  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

    The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements describe the pro forma effect of divine's proposed acquisition of Data Return on the: 


statements
of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2001 and the year ended December 31, 2000 of divine; and


balance
sheet as of September 30, 2001 of divine. 

Because
Data Return's fiscal year ends on March 31, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 includes Data Return's historical
information for its year ended March 31, 2001. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements also describe the pro forma effect of divine's proposed acquisition of
Eprise Corporation and its recently completed acquisitions of RoweCom Inc., eshare communications, Inc., and Open Market, Inc. discussed below. The purpose of these pro forma
financial statements is to demonstrate how the combined financial statements of these businesses might have appeared if each of the mergers had been completed at the beginning of the periods
presented, or when otherwise indicated. 

    In
addition to the pending merger between divine and Data Return, on September 17, 2001, divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with Eprise
Corporation, which is a provider of software products and design and consulting services that enable businesses to create and publish Web content. On October 19, 2001, divine completed its
acquisition of Open Market, which provides content-driven e-business solutions to enterprises. Also on October 23, 2001, divine completed its acquisition of eshare, which provides
customer interaction management products and services. Further, on November 6, 2001, divine completed its acquisition of RoweCom, which is a business-to-business provider of
e-commerce solutions for purchasing and managing the acquisition of magazines, newspapers, journals and e-journals, books and other printed sources of commercial, scientific and general
interest information and analysis. The following unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements reflect the acquisition of Data Return alone, the acquisition of Data Return together with the other completed acquisitions, and the acquisition of Data Return
together with the acquisition of Eprise and the other completed acquisitions. 

    divine
has prepared the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements using the purchase method of accounting for all these transactions. Because the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements are based upon the financial condition and operating results of Data Return, Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market during periods when they were not under the
control, influence or management of divine, the information presented may not be indicative of the results that would have actually occurred had the acquisitions been completed as of the respective
periods presented, nor is it indicative of future financial or operating results. divine expects to incur reorganization and integration expenses as well as potential operating efficiencies as a
result of the acquisitions of Data Return, Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not give effect to any synergies that may occur
due to the integration of Data Return, Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market with divine, nor do they take into account the effect of any potential changes to accounting policies, including with
respect to the recognition of revenues, of the acquired entities after the mergers due to the integration of their businesses into divine's business model. The unaudited pro forma 

condensed combined financial statements should be read along with the historical financial statements of divine and the related notes, incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, and
the historical financial statements of Data Return and the related notes, included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. 

    Certain
assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets of Data Return, Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market have been reclassified to conform to the divine line item
presentation in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet. Certain expenses and other deductions in the consolidated statements of operations of Data Return, Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and
Open Market have been reclassified to conform to the divine line item presentation in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements  

1.
Basis
of Presentation 

    The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2001 gives effect to the acquisitions of Data Return, Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market as if
they occurred on that date. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 and the nine months ended September 30, 2001 give
effect to the acquisitions of Data Return, Eprise, RoweCom, eshare, and Open Market as if they had occurred on January 1, 2000. 

    The
following summarizes information concerning the estimated purchase price allocation for the acquisitions of Data Return, Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market.

    The
purchase prices include $500,000 of estimated acquisition costs relating to each acquisition. The Data Return purchase price also includes up to $12,800,000 in temporary
financing expected to be paid by divine to Data Return in conjunction with a secured credit facility signed in connection with the Data Return merger agreement. As of the date of this
prospectus, divine had funded $7,050,000 of this credit facility. The Open Market purchase price also includes $6,150,000 paid by divine to Open Market in conjunction with a secured credit facility
signed in connection with the Open Market merger agreement. 

    In
the Data Return merger, divine will issue 1.9876 shares of divine common stock for each outstanding share of Data Return common stock. Additionally, outstanding "in the
money" Data Return options will be converted, at the 1.9876 exchange ratio, to options to buy shares of divine common stock. Additional options to buy shares of divine common stock will be granted to
holders of "out of the money" Data Return options. Per the Data Return merger agreement, the number of divine options given as consideration in this merger will not exceed 14,382,923. For purposes of
the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, the assumed fair value of divine common stock issued in the Data Return merger for purchase accounting purposes is $0.45, which
represents the average of the closing price of
divine's common stock on the first day the agreed upon terms of the Data Return merger were announced by divine (November 2, 2001) and the three business days before and after the announcement
date. 

    In
the Eprise merger, divine will issue 2.4233 shares of divine common stock for each outstanding share of Eprise common stock. Additionally, outstanding Eprise warrants and
options will generally be converted to warrants or options to buy shares of divine common stock, generally at the 2.4233 exchange ratio. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements, the number of shares, options and warrants assumed to be issued by divine in the Eprise merger has been calculated based on the number of Eprise shares, options and warrants
outstanding as of November 14, 2001. For the Eprise merger, the assumed fair value of divine common stock for purchase accounting purposes is $0.71, which represents the average of divine's
closing price on the first day the agreed upon 

terms of the Eprise merger were announced by divine (September 18, 2001) and the three business days before and after the announcement date. 

    In
the RoweCom merger, divine issued approximately 10,158,000 shares of divine common stock and assumed options and warrants to purchase shares of divine common stock, with
exercise prices ranging from $0.45 to $9.68 per share. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, the assumed fair value of divine common stock issued in the
RoweCom merger for purchase accounting purposes is $1.44, which represents the average of the closing price of divine's common stock on the first day the agreed upon terms of the RoweCom merger were
announced by divine (July 9, 2001) and the three business days before and after the announcement date. 

    The
merger between divine and eshare was a stock-for-stock transaction. A total of approximately 68,435,000 shares of divine common stock were issued in
the eshare merger and fully vested options to purchase a total of approximately 3,681,000 shares of divine common stock were issued in the eshare merger, with exercise prices ranging from $0.14
to $0.56 per share. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, the assumed fair value of divine common stock issued in the eshare merger for purchase accounting
purposes is $0.52, which is the "divine average closing price", or the average of the closing sale price per share of divine's common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market for the ten
consecutive trading days ending two trading days prior to the closing date of the eshare merger (October 23, 2001). The divine average closing price was used to determine the conversion ratio
for eshare shares in the eshare merger. 

    In
the Open Market merger, divine issued approximately 44,455,000 shares of divine common stock and assumed options and warrants to purchase a total of approximately 9,787,000
shares of divine common stock, with exercise prices ranging from $0.63 to $66.06 per share. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, the assumed fair value of
divine common stock issued in the Open Market merger for purchase accounting purposes is $1.26, which represents the average of the closing price of divine's common stock on the first day the agreed
upon terms of the Open Market merger were announced by divine (August 16, 2001) and the three business days before and after the announcement date. 

    The
effects of the Data Return, Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market mergers have been presented using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the purchase price was
allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon management's best preliminary estimate of fair value with any excess purchase price being allocated to goodwill or other
identifiable intangibles. In the Eprise merger, the excess fair value of net assets acquired over the purchase price has been applied first to the writedown of noncurrent assets, with the remainder
recorded in retained earnings, reflecting the extraordinary gain generated by negative goodwill and that would have been realized by divine had the merger been completed on September 30, 2001.
This gain is not reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price may be subject to further adjustments, as
divine finalizes its allocation of purchase price in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The pro forma adjustments related to the purchase price allocation of the acquisitions
represent management's best estimate of the effects of these transactions. 

2.
Pro
Forma Balance Sheet Adjustments 

(a)

the assumed issuance of 71,916,214 shares of divine common stock and the elimination of Data Return's equity in consolidation. Also reflects the establishment 

by
divine of goodwill and other intangible assets of $28,830,000, which represents the value of shares of divine common stock issued, and cash assumed to be paid by divine under a secured credit
facility with Data Return, in excess of the estimated fair value of Data Return's tangible net assets as of September 30, 2001. 

(b)
Reflects
the issuance of options to purchase 14,382,923 shares of divine common stock, which represents the number of Data Return options as of November 14,
2001, as converted
per the merger agreement. The Black-Scholes fair value of these options was $5,832,000 and has been included as a component of the purchase price. 
(c)
Reflects
divine's estimated acquisition costs of $500,000 for each of the acquisitions. 
(d)
Reflects
the issuance of 10,158,420 shares of divine common stock and the elimination of RoweCom's equity in consolidation. Also reflects the elimination of RoweCom's stand-alone
goodwill and other intangible assets of $15,528,000 and the establishment by divine of goodwill and other intangible assets of $59,798,000, which represents the value of shares of divine common stock
assumed to be issued in excess of the estimated fair value of RoweCom's tangible net assets as of September 30, 2001. 
(e)
Reflects
the issuance of warrants to purchase 3,752,602 shares of divine common stock, representing the number of RoweCom warrants outstanding as of November 6, 2001,

tax assets of $11,899,000 and stand-alone goodwill and other intangible assets of $3,302,000, and the establishment by divine of goodwill and other intangible assets of $9,511,000, which represents
the value of shares of divine common stock issued in excess of the estimated fair value of eshare's tangible net assets as of September 30, 2001. 
(g)
Reflects
the issuance of options to purchase 3,681,285 shares of divine common stock. This is the number of "in-the-money" eshare options as of October 23, 2001, as converted
per the merger agreement. The Black-Scholes fair value of these options is $1,642,000 and has been included as a component of the purchase price. 
(h)
Accounts
payable and accumulated deficit have been adjusted to eliminate the unpaid balance for software sold by eshare to Brandango, a consolidated associated company of divine
that ceased operations in 2000. Accumulated deficit is affected instead of accounts receivable, because eshare wrote off this unpaid balance prior to September 30, 2001. 
(i)
Reflects
the effect of real estate options which are dependent on the closing of the merger of divine with eshare. divine has entered into agreements with Szlam Partners, L.P. and
Melita
House, Inc., pursuant to which divine will pay approximately $3,703,000 and $2,047,000, respectively, for ten-year options to purchase eshare's U.S. and United Kingdom headquarters. 
(j)

noncurrent assets of $4,379,000 and the realization by divine of an extraordinary gain of $7,035,000 (prior to the reduction in extraordinary gain described in adjustment (m) below), which
represents the estimated fair value of Eprise's tangible net current assets as of September 30, 2001 in excess of the value of shares of divine common stock, and options and warrants to
purchase divine common stock, assumed to be issued. 
(m)
Reflects
the issuance of options and warrants to purchase 4,725,459 shares of divine common stock, which represents the number of Eprise options and warrants outstanding as

3.
Pro
Forma Statement of Operations Adjustments 

    The
pro forma statement of operations adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2000 consist of: 

(n)
Selling,
general and administrative expenses have been adjusted to reflect the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the Data Return, RoweCom,
eshare, and Open Market acquisitions over an estimated useful life of three years, and to eliminate the historical amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets recorded by RoweCom, eshare and
Open Market. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, approved by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board on June 29, 2001, goodwill acquired in transactions completed after June 30, 2001 will not be amortized. As the eshare, Open Market, and RoweCom acquisitions were completed in the
fourth quarter of 2001, and the Data Return acquisition is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2001, divine's operating results will not reflect any goodwill amortization expense related
to these acquisitions. Note that SFAS No. 142 will require the amortization of intangible assets with determinable useful lives, which are generally intangible assets other than goodwill, over
the estimated useful life of those assets. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets of Data Return, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market have not yet been
allocated between in-process research and development charges, goodwill, and other intangible assets. For purposes of the pro forma condensed combined statements of operations, the entire excess
purchase price is considered to be other intangible assets and therefore is amortizable. 

(o)
Product
revenues have been adjusted to reflect the sale, during 2000, of software by eshare to Brandango. The sale price of the software was approximately $1,815,000. Of this
amount, $403,000 had been depreciated and $1,412,000 had been written off to impairment expenses when Brandango ceased operations later in 2000. 
(p)
Reflects
the removal of the income tax benefit of eshare, which would not have been recorded if the eshare merger had occurred on January 1, 2000. 
(q)
Reflects
the elimination of the accretion of dividends on Eprise's redeemable preferred stock. 

    The
pro forma statement of operations adjustments for the nine months ended September 30, 2001 consist of: 

(r)
Selling,
general and administrative expenses have been adjusted to reflect the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the Data Return, RoweCom,
eshare and Open Market acquisitions over a useful life of three years, and to eliminate the historical amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets recorded by RoweCom, eshare and
Open Market. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, approved by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board on June 29, 2001, goodwill acquired in transactions completed after June 30, 2001 will not be amortized. As the eshare, Open Market, and RoweCom acquisitions were completed in the
fourth quarter of 2001 and the Data Return acquisition is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2001, divine's operating results will not reflect any goodwill amortization expense related
to these acquisitions. Note that SFAS No. 142 will require the amortization of intangible assets with determinable useful lives, which are generally intangible assets other than goodwill, over
the estimated useful life of those assets. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets of Data Return, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market have not yet been
allocated between in-process research and development charges, goodwill, and other intangible assets. For purposes of the pro forma condensed combined statements of operations, the entire excess
purchase price is considered to be other intangible assets and therefore is amortizable. 
(s)
Reflects
the removal of the income tax benefits of RoweCom and eshare, which would not have been recorded if the RoweCom merger and eshare merger had occurred on January 1,
2000. 
(t)
Reflects
the elimination of the accretion of dividends on Open Market's redeemable preferred stock. 

INFORMATION REGARDING DIVINE    

Overview  

 Business  

    divine, inc. provides a combination of Web-based technology, professional services and managed applications capabilities designed to allow
clients to deploy advanced Web solutions for the extended enterprise that are integrated with their business strategies and existing software and technical systems. Our enterprise Web solutions offer
businesses the ability to improve collaboration, workflow and business relationships. We provide technology, software, professional services and managed applications through four business units: 


divine Enterprise Portal Solutions
uses business portal platform technology to provide
businesses with real-time, integrated access to internal and external information to create industry-specific solutions that streamline data searching and retrieval over intranets,
extranets, company databases and the Internet.


divine Software Applications
deploys products that focus on collaboration, workflow and
relationship management. Our robust platform supports effective customer interaction, improved management of the flow of information and powerful enterprise collaboration.


divine Professional Services
applies expertise in technology, infrastructure and marketing
services across a broad spectrum of leading technologies combined with an understanding of how to design and deploy solutions that drive business results.


divine Managed Applications
builds, hosts, manages, monitors and secures an enterprise's
critical applications with an emphasis on customers that require assurance of high availability of applications and a single point of accountability. 

    We
focus on Global 5000 and high-growth middle market companies, and government agencies and educational institutions, and currently serve over 20,000 customers. We expect that
our revenues in future periods will be generated principally through these core operations. 

    Our
principal offices are located at 1301 North Elston Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60622, telephone (773) 394-6600. Our home page is located on the Web at
http://www.divine.com, where you can find additional information about us and our associated companies; however, that information generally is not targeted at investors and is not part of this proxy
statement/prospectus. All references to "we," "us," "our" and "divine" refer to divine, inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

 Historical Information  

    We began as divine interVentures, inc. on June 30, 1999, engaging in business-to-business e-commerce through
a community of associated companies in which we invested. From September 30, 1999 to December 31, 2000, we acquired interests in 40 associated companies, established a total of 13
associated companies when we identified opportunities consistent with our business strategy, and also further developed our operational procedures and capabilities. 

    In February 2001, we announced our strategy to primarily focus on enterprise Web solutions, and changed our name to divine, inc. We no longer reflect separately our
interests in our remaining associated companies that provide Web-based technology, software, professional services and managed applications. Instead, the operations of these businesses are
a part of
our core business strategy. Other of our associated companies offer software and services focused on e-commerce and vertical markets, which we include in our divine interVentures segment.
As of September 30, 2001, there were 23 companies in our divine interVentures segment. 

 Our Strategy  

    Our objective is to become the leading provider of enterprise Web solutions that offer global businesses the ability to improve collaboration, workflow and
business relationships by delivering a powerful combination of technology, software, services and managed applications capabilities. As the flow of information becomes more liberated and more complex,
we believe that a new type of solution provider is required to unite all of the skills and emerging technologies needed to create advanced enterprise Web solutions that position companies to go beyond
the processing of transactions and operate at the leading edge of their industries. In order to achieve this objective, we have adopted the following key elements of our strategy: 


Become a recognized leader in advanced enterprise solutions
. We currently serve over 20,000 customers
consisting of predominantly Global 5000 and high-growth middle-market companies, and government agencies and educational institutions. These customers are serviced by one or more of our
four principal business units. By expanding our relationships with these customers, we can enhance our reputation and visibility and capitalize on cross-selling opportunities with their customers,
suppliers, partners and distributors.


Develop, acquire and integrate offerings and solutions
. We plan to focus on the development, acquisition
and integration of components that can be combined to form a powerful set of services, technology and hosting capabilities that can advance and extend our customers' businesses to include
external and internal business communities.


Target a specific customer base
. We plan to target customers whom we believe can benefit most readily from
greater collaboration, more efficient workflow and better management of business relationships between their customers, employees, partners, suppliers, prospects and sources of information. We believe
that these customers are primarily concentrated in information-intensive businesses such as the financial services, insurance, energy, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and telecommunications industries.


Support and complement our solutions through alliances with business partners.
 We intend to establish
strategic alliances with a number of companies like our strategic alliance with
Computer Associates International, Inc., or CA, which is also one of our strategic investors. CA's professional expertise enhances the range and quality of our Professional Services and CA's
Jasmine
ii
 Portal Software is a key component of our Enterprise Portal Solutions. We believe that strategic alliances will enable us to improve our
ability to attract and retain customers who prefer to deal with larger, more stable solutions providers, provide additional channels for our products, and enable us to build industry-specific
solutions for our customers. 


Position divine as a technology owner and solutions integrator
. We plan to differentiate divine from other
solutions delivery organizations by positioning divine as a technology owner and solutions integrator. We intend to gain a strategic advantage by acquiring and developing innovative technologies and
making these part of our broader solutions in order to leverage their full potential. 

Recent Developments  

 Eprise Acquisition  

    In September 2001, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Eprise Corporation, a provider of enterprise content management and delivery
application software. Eprise provides software products and design and consulting services that enable businesses to create and publish effective Web content quickly and easily. Its core product,
Eprise Participant Server, enables a business organization to distribute this Web content management function among the appropriate individuals within the enterprise who have responsibility for
particular aspects of that Web content. These individuals need no knowledge of programming languages or other technical skills to use Eprise Participant Server, thereby minimizing a customer's
reliance on information technology professionals and other consultants. Under the terms of the Eprise merger agreement, we will issue a total of approximately 54,000,000 shares of our common stock in

INFORMATION REGARDING DATA RETURN    

BUSINESS  

Company Overview  

    Data Return provides advanced managed hosting services based on Microsoft technologies. Data Return provides these services to businesses seeking to outsource
the deployment, maintenance and support of their complex web sites. Data Return's services include providing, configuring, operating and maintaining the hardware, software and network technologies
necessary to implement and support these web sites. It also offers additional services options, such as scalability and architecture testing, storage solutions and a suite of security services,
including firewalls. 

    Data
Return was incorporated in August 1997 by three former Microsoft product support engineers, and, as of September 30, 2001, hosted applications for approximately 707
customers across many industries. Its customers range in size from large Fortune 500 companies to smaller businesses, both conventional and web-based. Data Return customers include Compaq, H&R Block,
Microsoft, RadioShack.com, Texas Instruments and The World Bank. Data Return's advanced hosting services are designed for customers deploying sophisticated, high-end Internet applications that require
a professionally-managed environment incorporating high performance network access, advanced system monitoring and technical support in secure, fault-tolerant facilities. 

    Microsoft,
Compaq Computer Corporation and Level 3 have invested in Data Return. Data Return believes its relationships with these companies enhance its credibility with
potential
customers and provide Data Return with early access to new products, superior technical services, training and new business opportunities. 

Data Return's Solution  

    Data Return is an advanced hosting provider dedicated to delivering scalable, reliable and high performance hosting services on the Microsoft platform. By
combining experience in managing Microsoft-based Internet technologies, a scalable deployment architecture and high performance content delivery, Data Return has developed a family of services
designed to address a wide range of customer needs. 

 Advanced Managed Services  

    Managing the deployment of business-critical web applications requires an in-depth understanding of the underlying software, hardware and network technologies.
Data Return uses its expertise in Microsoft technologies to provide management services for its customers' hosting needs, including: 


recommendations
on standardized system architecture;


installation,
configuration and stress testing of hardware and software;


ongoing
maintenance of hardware and software, including content back-ups and system upgrades;


a
broad array of system and network monitoring and reporting services; and


technical
support designed to respond to both simple and complex system issues. 

 Scalable Deployment Architecture  

    Data Return's customers require system architecture that is flexible and can be expanded to meet increasing demand. Data Return offers scalable deployment
architecture for the Microsoft platform that enables customers to migrate to more robust service offerings, such as high-end multi-server clustered solutions and clustering across multiple data
centers, as their site traffic grows. The flexibility of this architecture allows Data Return to offer a wide range of hosting solutions to its customers. 

 High Performance Content Delivery  

    Overall application performance is an essential component to deploying an Internet-based application successfully. There are many factors that contribute to
overall performance including the configuration and architecture for hardware, software and Internet access. Data Return's private networking architecture bypasses the congested public exchange
points, such as the Metropolitan Area Exchanges and Network Access Points, increasing speed and reliability. 

 Pre-Packaged Solutions for Advanced Hosting  

    Data Return has standardized its services into packages with defined pricing and feature sets that can be used stand-alone or as components in a larger
solution. These solutions include hardware, maintenance and network connectivity. Data Return believes these pre-packaged solutions provide a more complete alternative than colocation. Colocation
arrangements typically involve a vendor supplying space for the server and Internet connections and some level of professional services, often on an hourly basis. With colocation, the customer is
usually responsible for defining and implementing the deployment architecture. Data Return's pre-packaged solutions enable its customers to outsource these responsibilities to it for their Internet,
extranet or intranet applications. 

Data Return's Services  

    Data Return packages its hosting services into standardized, definable product offerings that it believes include features desired by a wide range of customers
from Fortune 2000 companies to smaller, web-focused businesses. Data Return's services are designed to be comprehensive in terms of feature sets and to address customers' outsourcing needs for a wide
variety of requirements, including: 


customers
accessing public web sites on the Internet;


employees
accessing private web sites through intranets; and


partners
and other designated user groups accessing private or public web sites through extranets. 

 Offerings  

    Data Return's advanced Microsoft hosting services allow it to support the Internet, intranets and extranets for both commercially developed applications and
custom-developed applications. To address this wide variety of customer requirements, Data Return has developed three distinct categories within its service family  clustered,
dedicated and shared. Data Return also offers a variety of additional services such as firewalls and other security 

services, private circuits, data storage offerings, and a scalability center that includes architecture, testing and stress labs. It also offers just the managed services portion of its hosting
solution to some customers. Under these arrangements, Data Return provides the monitoring, maintenance and management of the infrastructure and the customer provides its own servers, co-location and
bandwidth. Data Return can also provide these services from the data centers of other providers or in its customers' data centers. For example, Data Return is currently providing managed services for
customers in AboveNet facilities. Because it leverages Data Return's expertise in Microsoft technologies, Data Return believes that this offering is a natural extension of its traditional hosting
services. 

Clustered Hosting Services.
 For customers that deploy e-commerce enabled or other business-critical applications and expect high
traffic volumes or require a high level of availability for their applications, Data Return has developed a family of clustered hosting services, including multi-site clusters. Data Return's clustered
service plans distribute content and functionality across multiple servers or, in the case of multi-site clusters, across multiple data centers. This technology allows customers' applications to scale
beyond a single server or data center. Additionally, Data Return's clustering services are designed to allow its customers' business-critical applications to continue operating in the event a server
fails. These services are designed to provide enhanced system performance and system reliability for application and database services. 

Dedicated Hosting Services.
 Dedicated hosting services are designed for customers with complex requirements and high traffic volumes
who are seeking greater control over the server environment but who do not require clustered servers. Data Return's dedicated service plans provide each customer with its own server. These service
plans offer a number of advantages over shared hosting packages, including: 


improved
service reliability and content delivery by limiting each server to a single developer environment; and


greater
flexibility in configuration of the specific server environment. 

Data
Return offers several dedicated service options that range from entry-level web servers to high performance, multi-processor database servers. 

Shared Hosting Services.
 Shared hosting services, Data Return's entry level service plan, are for customers with relatively low volumes
of traffic. Data Return has designed its shared hosting package to minimize the cost for customers by providing these services on a server shared by multiple customers. This service plan includes many
standard features and options for database support, commerce support and media services. 

Customers  

    Data Return typically provides hosting services directly to end user customers, both traditional enterprises and Internet-focused businesses. However, it also
provides hosting services to application service providers, web site development firms and other organizations that bundle Data Return's solution with a service or product they provide to their end
user customers. Data Return's customers are located primarily in North America and Europe. As of September 30, 2001, Data Return hosted applications for approximately 707 customers
ranging from Fortune 500 companies and small- and medium-sized businesses to start-up 

businesses, including Internet-focused businesses. The following were among Data Return's top customers based on monthly recurring revenue at the end of September 2001: 

Goldpocket Interactive

H & R Block

Match.com (a subsidiary of

Ticketmaster)

Radio Shack

Americredit

Portum Gmbh

Engelhard

Texas Instruments

Compaq

Opus-i

InformIT.com

Codigent.com

Fallon Interactive (bmwusa.com

and bmwfilms.com)

Regency Voice Systems

American Medical Security

    During fiscal 2001, Goldpocket Interactive, Inc. accounted for 18% of revenue. Data Return's current monthly revenue from Goldpocket is less than it was in
fiscal 2001. Data Return's results of operations will be adversely affected if it loses the revenues it expects to be generated by this customer. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue
during fiscal 2001, 2000 or 1999. 

Key Relationships  

 Level 3  

    Data Return entered into a five-year relationship with Level 3 in July 1999. Level 3 is a communications and information services company that is
building an advanced facilities-based communications network through which it provides colocation, Internet connectivity and other services. This strategic relationship allows Data Return to leverage
its advanced hosting and managed application services with its U.S. data center infrastructure. Data Return has agreed that if Level 3 can provide substantially similar services to those Data
Return requests, Data Return will purchase 90% of these services from Level 3 through June 2004. Data Return routes the network traffic of its customers through multiple backbone
providers to increase network performance. To enable Data Return to do this, Data Return obtains Internet connectivity through a number of providers, and Level 3 may not be able to provide all
of the connectivity services that Data Return requires. As a result, Data Return may purchase less than the applicable percentages of these services from Level 3. Under the agreement with
Level 3, Data Return is required to purchase at least an additional $7.6 million of bandwidth and colocation services over the next four years. Data Return's commitment is $400,000 per quarter
through July 2002, $600,000 per quarter during the next 12 months and $1.0 million per quarter during the final 12 months of the agreement. Data Return has exceeded its purchase commitment to
Level 3 in every quarter since the minimum commitment took effect. The prices Data Return will pay Level 3 for the services over the term of the agreement are based upon Level 3's
then-current prices to other companies purchasing similar quantities. Level 3 can terminate the agreement if Data Return defaults and does not cure the default within 30 days of notice or upon
a change of control that results in Data Return being owned by a competitor of Level 3. Level 3 has acquired 1,952,940 common shares of Data Return in exchange for $5.0 million in credit
for future bandwidth purchases in excess of the quarterly purchase commitment. At September 30, 2001, Data Return had utilized approximately $1,400,000 of the credit. 

 Compaq  

    Data Return uses Compaq servers to provide the hardware platform for its advanced hosting services. Data Return's relationship with Compaq provides direct
contact with product development engineers and management at multiple levels within the Compaq organization. In July 1999, Data Return entered into a three-year agreement with Compaq under
which Data Return agreed to purchase from Compaq the lesser of 2,000 servers or the number of servers reasonably necessary to adequately operate Data Return's business consistent with its business
plan. Data Return is required to purchase these servers only if Compaq provides financing for the servers on competitive terms, if the price, performance and quality of the Compaq servers is
reasonably satisfactory to Data Return and if Compaq commits to deliver these servers on the schedule Data Return requests. Through September 30, 2001, Data Return had purchased approximately
1,965 servers under this agreement. Compaq also owns 1,171,764 common shares of Data Return. 

 Microsoft  

    In September 1999, Data Return entered into a development, license and co-marketing agreement with Microsoft. Under this agreement, Data Return licensed
proprietary installation tools for third-party hosted applications to Microsoft. Microsoft owns 454,546 common shares of Data Return and a warrant to acquire an additional 340,910 common shares of
Data Return at an exercise price of $11 per share. 

    Data
Return is recognized by Microsoft as one of the leading providers of advanced hosting services on the Microsoft platform. Data Return believes that one of its key competitive
advantages is the level of customer service and support that it can provide as a result of this relationship. However, except for the relationship with Microsoft under this development, license and
co-marketing agreement, Data Return does not have an agreement with Microsoft to continue this relationship, and Microsoft could discontinue its relationship with Data Return at any time. 

Marketing and Sales  

    Data Return's marketing efforts are primarily focused on building the Data Return brand while generating demand for its services. Data Return devotes most of
its marketing resources to direct mail and telemarketing targeted at Information Technology decision-makers and
advertising in magazines targeted at developers and information service professionals. Data Return also advertises online and exhibits at trade shows and conferences. 

    Data
Return's sales force included 22 quota-bearing sales representatives at October 31, 2001. Each outside salesperson's territory included one or more Level 3
gateways. 

Customer Support  

    Data Return believes a critical element of customer service is providing a high level of technical expertise within both customer support and systems
organizations. Data Return's technical support engineers are expected to be proficient in at least: 


one
major network operating system;


two
applications from Data Return's supported product list; and 


either
one programming language or one database application. 

    All
systems are monitored and maintained on a 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or 24x7, basis. Data Return provides business-critical customer support on a 24x7 basis. Data Return
also provides customer support for other issues from 9AM-8PM Central Time Monday through Friday and 9AM-6PM Saturday and Sunday via both telephone and electronic request forms. Response times are
published on Data Return's support web site and are prioritized according to severity levels. Data Return has also created dedicated support teams that are available on a 24x7 basis to customers with
especially complex deployments. These dedicated support teams provide a direct line of communication for Data Return's customers, which it believes provides a superior level of service. 

    Data
Return has also developed a web-based customer care application, called the Customer Service Center, or CSC. Customers can access specific information about their application
through the CSC, including application availability and performance, incident histories, account balances and payment histories and scheduled maintenance. Customers can also use the CSC to notify Data
Return of upcoming events or changes to their configuration. 

Infrastructure  

    Data Return uses a platform that is comprised mostly of Internet-related software products running on Microsoft's Windows 2000 and NT operating systems and
Compaq servers. It primarily uses F5 clustering switches and load balancers along with Cisco switches and routers to connect its servers to the Internet. By focusing on standard platforms, Data Return
gains efficiency and effectiveness in terms of training, documentation, spare parts and overall support. Data Return also maintains some hosting services running on other software platforms. In
addition, Data Return supports application level services such as BizTalk, SQL Server, Application Center, Active Server Pages and Commerce Server. Specifically, Data Return's infrastructure consists
of the following key elements: 


secure,
carrier-class data centers;


a
scalable server platform;


automated
deployment processes;


monitoring
and systems management; and


an
advanced high performance network. 

 Secure, Carrier-Class Data Centers  

    Data Return's primary data center is located within Level 3's Dallas gateway. Security for the data center is provided with a guard and entry
restriction via access device. Power to the building is provided by redundant connections from separate transformers. The data center is also equipped with fire suppressant systems, environmental
control systems and redundant networking hardware. The Level 3 facility provides Data Return with access to Level 3's worldwide IP network. Data Return also offers hosting services from
other Level 3 gateways and provides managed services to customers in data centers of other providers. 

 A Scalable Server Platform  

    Data Return's standard platform for service delivery uses Compaq servers. These servers generally run the Windows 2000 or NT operating system along with
various application software, such as Microsoft SQL Server or Microsoft Internet Information Server. Compaq's Distributed Internet Server Array (DISA) architecture leverages the clustering and load
balancing features of the Windows 2000 or Windows NT server platforms. This architecture enables Data Return to support scalable, highly-available Internet-enabled applications. In addition, by
focusing on standard platforms, Data Return believes that it can gain efficiency and effectiveness in terms of training, documentation, spare parts and overall support. 

 Automated Deployment Processes  

    Data Return configures and tests its hardware and software through the use of both commercially available and internally built tools. The software installation
process consists of a series of unattended scripts and batch files providing a fast, consistent and repeatable configuration. As the server is provisioned with user accounts, web sites and file
transfer protocol sites, the automated script also tests each step to evaluate whether the server is functioning correctly. Data Return also manually tests the installation process to further evaluate
the quality and integrity of the installation. 

 Monitoring and Systems Management  

    Data Return combines commercial tools and internally built applications to provide monitoring, analysis and reporting of application, service and hardware
performance on a 24x7 basis. Systems administration and management is remotely performed using an interface that encrypts all client-server communication with an encryption algorithm for added
security. Additionally, through the CSC, Data Return's customers can perform the most commonly performed web site administrative tasks. The CSC also allows customers to electronically submit more
advanced administrative tasks and support requests to Data Return's service and support group. 

 Advanced High Performance Network  

    Data Return has based its network hardware on Cisco and F5 technologies. Data Return's network consists of multiple, diverse connections to the Internet that
currently provide Data Return with local access to multiple leading backbone providers. These multiple connections allow Data Return to increase both performance and reliability by routing traffic
over private connections to bypass congested public exchange points such as the Metropolitan Area Exchanges and Network Access Points. In addition to increased performance, Data Return's network
architecture reduces dependency on any one network provider, increasing network availability for its customers. Data Return's network security solutions include firewalls, encryption techniques,
virtual private networks and other security technologies and techniques. 

Competition  

    The markets in which Data Return operates are highly competitive, and competition is increasing because few apparent substantial barriers to entry exist in the
Internet hosting market. Although it is impossible to quantify Data Return's relative competitive position in 

this market, many of Data Return's competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, greater name recognition and
more established relationships in the industry than Data Return has. Data
Return expects that it will face competition from existing competitors as well as new market entrants in the future. The primary competitive factors in this market are: 


technical
expertise in developing and delivering advanced hosting solutions;


quality
of service, including network capability, scalability, reliability and functionality;


customer
service;


number
and quality of sales personnel;


variety
of services and products offered;


price;


brand
name recognition;


Internet
system engineering and technical expertise;


timing
of introductions of value-added services and products;


network
security;


relationships
with partners; and


financial
resources. 

    Data
Return's current and potential competitors vary by size, product offering and geographic region and may elect to partner with each other or with focused companies like Data
Return to deliver service on the Microsoft platform. They include: 


Microsoft
advanced hosting providers;


web
and application hosting service providers;


application-specific
hosting service providers;


colocation
providers;


managed
service providers;


local,
regional and international Internet service providers;


local,
regional and international telecommunications companies;


systems
integrators and large information technology outsourcing companies;


multimedia
hosting companies; and


other
hardware, software and technology companies. 

    Data
Return's competitors may operate in one or more of these areas and include companies such as AboveNet, AT&T, British Telecommunications, Cable & Wireless, Concentric
Network, Critical Path, Dell, Digex, Exodus Communications, Globix, GTE, Genuity, HostPro, IBM,
Intel, Level 3, Loudcloud, MCI WorldCom (including UUNET), Navisite, Qwest Communications International, Usinternetworking, NTT/Verio and Yahoo! 

EMPLOYEES  

    As of October 31, 2001, Data Return had 315 employees. None of Data Return's employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Data Return
believes that its relations with its employees are good. 

PROPERTIES  

    Data Return's corporate headquarters are currently located in Irving, Texas and consist of approximately 101,000 square feet of office space of which the
majority is leased until May 31, 2003 with the lease on the remaining space expiring May 31, 2006. Data Return also has an office in Dallas, Texas, consisting of 10,500 square feet of
office space that is leased until May 31, 2004. 

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

    On November 2, 2001, CyberGuard Corporation filed a lawsuit against Data Return in the United States District Court of the Southern District of
Florida alleging a contract breach by Data Return. CyberGuard is seeking, among other remedies, damages of approximately $4.2 million. Data Return will vigorously defend itself against
these claims. Data Return does not believe that this lawsuit will negatively impact its financial condition. 

    According
to a press release dated November 15, 2001, Data Return, certain of its directors (Sunny C. Vanderbeck, Michelle Chambers, and Jason Lochhead), and certain
underwriters of Data Return's initial public offering have been named as defendants in a class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. According
to the press release, the complaint, which alleges certain securities law violations and that the prospectus for Data Return's initial public offering failed to disclose certain arrangements
between the underwriters and certain purchasers of Data Return common shares in the initial public offering, was filed on behalf of purchasers of Data Return common shares from October 27, 1999
through December 6, 2000. Data Return has not been served in this proceeding and has not received a copy of the complaint. 

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

You should read the following discussion together with the financial statements and other financial information included in this proxy
statement/prospectus. This report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Data Return's actual results may differ materially from those projected in the
forward-looking statements. Data Return's fiscal year ends on March 31.  

Overview  

    Data Return provides advanced Internet hosting services based on Microsoft technologies. Data Return provides these services to businesses seeking to outsource
the deployment, maintenance and support of their complex web sites. Its services include providing, configuring, operating and maintaining the hardware, software and network technologies necessary to
implement and support these web sites. 

    Data
Return derives substantially all of its revenue from hosting and managed services. This includes revenue from Data Return's dedicated server offerings, including clustered
servers, and its shared server offering. With Data Return's dedicated server offerings, each server is dedicated to providing service to one customer. In a clustered configuration, Data Return
utilizes two or more dedicated servers to distribute content and functionality across multiple servers or, in the case of multi-site clusters, across multiple data centers. Hosting and managed
services revenue also includes shared hosting, in which more than one customer shares the same server. Historically, Data Return has also derived a nominal amount of revenue from technical reviews and
the resale of software and other products. Currently, most of Data Return's advanced hosting and managed services revenues are generated from recurring monthly fees. Substantially all of the remainder
is derived from one-time set-up fees for installation and from sales of services, such as time and materials billing and certain lab or consulting services. 

    Services
are billed on a monthly basis and, except as described below, are recognized as the service is performed. As a result of Data Return's adoption of Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, revenues from set-up, or installation, services are recognized over the initial term of the customer contract. See "Recent
Accounting Pronouncements" for a description of Data Return's adoption and the effect of SAB 101 and "Results of Operations  Comparison of six-month periods ended September 30,
2000 and 2001  Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle" and "Results of Operations  Comparison of fiscal 2001 and 2000  Cumulative effect of change
in accounting principle" for a discussion of the effect of this change in accounting principle during fiscal 2001. 

    Data
Return's expenses are comprised of: 


cost
of revenue, which consists primarily of compensation and related expenses for technical operations, broadband services expenses, space in data centers
and depreciation of equipment; 

general
and administrative, which consists primarily of compensation and related expenses and occupancy costs; 


marketing
and sales, which consists primarily of compensation and related expenses, advertising expenses and occupancy costs; 

product
research and development, which consists primarily of compensation and related expenses and occupancy costs; and 

stock-based
compensation, which relates to employee stock options granted at prices less than fair value. 

    Data
Return has incurred significant losses since its inception and, as of September 30, 2001, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $90.9 million. Data Return intends to
continue to invest in marketing and sales and the continued development of its network infrastructure
and technology. Data Return expects to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future.

Comparison of quarters ended September 30, 2001 and 2000  

 Revenues  

    Data Return's revenues decreased $196,000 to $12,160,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2001, from $12,356,000 for the quarter ended
September 30, 2000. The decrease is a result of Data Return's continued loss of customers. Dedicated hosting revenue and managed services fees increased $177,000 to $10,381,000, or 85.4% of
revenue, for the 

quarter ended September 30, 2001 from $10,204,000, or 82.6% of revenue, for the quarter ended September 30, 2000. Shared hosting revenue decreased $133,000 to $613,000, or 5.0% of
revenue, for the quarter ended September 30, 2001 from $746,000, or 6.0% of revenue, for the quarter ended September 30, 2000. The continued shift towards dedicated revenues reflects
Data Return's focus on its dedicated hosting and managed services product offerings. Set-up fees decreased $226,000 to $714,000, or 5.9% of revenue, for the quarter ended September 30, 2001
from $940,000, or 7.6% of revenue, for the quarter ended September 30, 2000, due to a decline in new customer orders. 

 Cost of revenue  

    Data Return's cost of revenue increased $314,000 to $11,839,000, or 97.4% of revenue, for the quarter ended September 30, 2001 from $11,525,000, or
93.3% of revenue, for the quarter ended September 30, 2000. The increase in cost of revenue was due primarily to increases in communication and bandwidth expenses, and increases in depreciation
and amortization expenses, offset by decreases in personnel and related costs and facilities related expenses. Communication and bandwidth expenses increased $1,197,000 to approximately $3,181,000, or
26.2% of revenue, for the quarter ended September 30, 2001 from $1,984,000, or 16.1% or revenue, for the quarter ended September 30, 2000 due to increased usage by Data Return's
customers. In particular, one customer accounted for a significant portion of the increase.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased approximately $1,041,000 to $3,990,000, or 32.8% of revenue, for the quarter ended September 30, 2001 from $2,949,000, or 22.7% of revenue, for
the quarter ended September 30, 2000, as Data Return added approximately $15.3 million in computer and related equipment since September 30, 2000. Personnel and related expenses
decreased approximately $1,754,000 to $3,789,000, or 31.2% of revenue, for the quarter ended September 30, 2001 from $5,543,000, or 44.9% of revenue, for the quarter ended September 30,
2000, as Data Return decreased its systems and customer support personnel to 158 at September 30, 2001 from 251 at September 30, 2000. Facilities expense decreased approximately
$267,000 to $229,000 as Data Return terminated leases on office space due to decreases in personnel. 

 General and administrative  

    General and administrative expense decreased $486,000 to $5,269,000, or 43.3% of revenue, during the quarter ended September 30, 2001 from $5,755,000,
or 46.6% of revenue, during the quarter ended September 30, 2000. The decrease is primarily due to decreases in personnel and related expenses, professional services expense, and facilities
expense offset by an increase in bad debt expense. Bad debt expense increased $581,000 to $1,150,000, or 9.5% of revenue, in the quarter ended September 30, 2001 as many of Data Return's
customers ceased operations or reduced or eliminated the website operations hosted by Data Return. Personnel and related expenses decreased $1,168,000 to $1,783,000, or 14.7% of revenue, for
the quarter ended September 30, 2001 from $2,951,000, or 23.9% of revenue, for the quarter ended September 30, 2000 due to a decrease in general and administrative personnel to
56 employees at September 30, 2001 from 138 employees at September 30, 2000. Professional service expense decreased $229,000 to $226,000 for the quarter ended
September 30, 2001 from $455,000 due to the completion of various projects and the reduction of contract employees. Facilities expense decreased $180,000 to $430,000 as Data Return
terminated leases on office space as a result of decreases in personnel. 

 Marketing and sales  

    Marketing and sales expense decreased $2,379,000 to $4,671,000, or 38.4% of revenue, during the quarter ended September 30, 2001 from $7,050,000, or
57.1% of revenue, for the quarter ended September 30, 2000. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in marketing and sales personnel to 76 at September 30, 2001 from 90 at
September 30, 2000, decreases in sales
commissions, and to decreases in advertising costs. Personnel and related expenses, including sales commissions, decreased $1,665,000 to $2,955,000, or 24.3% of revenue, for the quarter ended
September 30, 2001 from $4,620,000, or 37.4% of revenue, for the quarter ended September 30, 2000. Advertising costs decreased $1,228,000 to $767,000 for the quarter ended
September 30, 2001 from $1,995,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2000. 

 Product research and development  

    Product research and development expense remained constant at $1,115,000, or 9.2% of revenue, during the quarter ended September 30, 2001 compared to
$1,113,000, or 9.0% of revenue, during the quarter ended September 30, 2000. 

 Stock-based compensation  

    Deferred stock compensation was recorded in connection with the grant of employee stock options below fair value in 1998 and 1999. Amortization of stock-based
compensation totaled $59,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2001 and $25,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2000. The amortization of stock-based compensation is based on the
vesting schedule of stock options held by Data Return's employees. 

 Restructuring costs  

    On August 11, 2001, Data Return initiated a voluntary separation benefit program to reduce its workforce. 108 employees were approved for
this program. Restructuring costs relating to this program, consisting of severance pay and benefits, were $1,343,000 during the quarter ended September 30, 2001. 

 Other income (expense)  

    Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income on Data Return's cash balances and investments in marketable securities and interest
expense on its outstanding notes payable and capital lease obligations. Interest earned on its cash and cash equivalents decreased $941,000 to $148,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2001
from $1,089,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2000. This decrease was due primarily to having lower cash balances for investments as cash has been used to fund operating losses. During
the quarter ended September 30, 2001, interest expense increased $247,000 to $788,000 related primarily to equipment acquired under capital leases during the last four quarters. 

 Income taxes  

    No provision for federal income taxes has been recorded as Data Return has incurred net operating losses since its inception. Data Return has
recorded a valuation allowance against all of its net deferred tax asset, which is primarily attributable to net operating loss carry 

forwards, due to uncertainty that it will generate sufficient taxable income during the carry forward period to realize the benefit of its net deferred tax asset. 

 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  

    Effective April 1, 2000, Data Return changed its method of accounting for set-up fees in accordance with SAB 101. Data Return recorded a
cumulative effect adjustment of $1.6 million as of April 1, 2000 and amortized set-up fees into revenues during fiscal 2001. Set-up fees are now amortized over the longer of the length
of the customer contract and the estimated life of the customer contract. 

 Net loss  

    Net loss increased $212,000 to $12,776,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2001 from $12,564,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2000. As
more fully discussed above, the increased net loss is primarily attributable to the decrease in revenues. 

 EBITDA  

    EBITDA, as defined below, increased $2,669,000 to negative $6,693,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2001 from negative $9,362,000 for the quarter
ended September 30, 2000. The increase is primarily attributable to the cost reduction efforts described above. Data Return expects to generate negative EBITDA for fiscal 2002. Costs
associated with Data Return's personnel and Data Return's fixed commitments will continue to represent a large portion of its expenses. 

    EBITDA
for the quarters ended September 30, 2001 and 2000 consists of loss from operations of $12,136,000 and $13,112,000 plus depreciation and amortization of $5,384,000 and
$3,715,000 and amortization of unearned stock-based compensation of $59,000 and $25,000, respectively. EBITDA does not represent funds available for management's discretionary use and is not intended
to represent cash flow from operations as measured under generally accepted accounting principles. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or net cash used in operating
activities, but may be useful to investors as an indication of operating performance. This caption excludes components that are significant in understanding and assessing the results of operations and
cash flows. In addition, EBITDA is not a term defined by generally accepted accounting principles and, as a result, Data Return's calculations of EBITDA may not be consistent with calculations
of EBITDA used by others. However, Data Return believes that EBITDA is relevant and useful information that is often reported and widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties
in the advanced hosting industry. Accordingly, Data Return is disclosing this information to permit a more comprehensive analysis of its operating performance, as an additional meaningful
measure of performance and liquidity and to provide additional information with respect to its ability to meet future working capital requirements. 

Comparison of six-month periods ended September 30, 2001 and 2000  

 Revenues  

    Data Return's revenues increased $4,307,000 to $25,743,000 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2001 from $21,436,000 for the six-month period
ended September 30, 

2000. The increase is as a result of an increase in the number of customers and the growth in revenues from some existing customers. Dedicated hosting revenue and managed services fees increased
$4,790,000 to $21,852,000, or 84.9% of revenue, for the six-month period ended September 30, 2001 from $17,062,000, or 79.6% of revenue, for the six-month period ended September 30,
2000. Shared hosting revenue decreased $264,000 to $1,274,000, or 4.9% of revenue, for the six-month period ended September 30, 2001 from $1,538,000, or 7.2% of revenue, for the six-month
period ended September 30, 2000. These changes reflect Data Return's continued focus on its dedicated hosting and managed services product offerings. Set-up fees decreased $402,000 to
$1,435,000, or 5.6% of revenue, for the six-month period ended September 30, 2001 from $1,837,000, or 8.6% of revenue, for the six-month period ended September 30, 2000, due to a decline
in new customer orders. 

 Cost of revenue  

    Data Return's cost of revenue increased $4,461,000 to $24,997,000, or 97.1% of revenue, for the six-month period ended September 30, 2001 from
$20,536,000, or 95.8% of revenue, for the six-month period ended September 30, 2000. The increase in cost of revenue was due primarily to increases in communication and bandwidth expenses, and
increases in depreciation and amortization expenses offset by decreases in personnel and related costs and facilities related expenses. Communication and bandwidth expenses increased $3,466,000 to
approximately $6,724,000 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2001 from $3,258,000 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2000. This was due to Data Return having
purchased higher-performance bandwidth from more costly vendors to support Data Return's business activities and increased usage by its customers. Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased approximately $2,841,000 to $7,850,000 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2001, as Data Return added approximately $15.3 million in computer and related
equipment since September 30, 2000. Personnel and related expenses decreased approximately $1,467,000 to $8,581,000, or 33.3% of revenue, for the six-month period ended September 30,
2001 from $10,049,000, or 46.9% of revenue, for the six-month period ended September 30, 2000, as Data Return decreased its systems and customer support personnel to 158 at
September 30, 2001 from 251 at September 30, 2000. Facilities expense decreased approximately $412,000 to $438,000 as Data Return terminated leases on office space due to the
decrease in personnel. 

 General and administrative  

    General and administrative expense increased $1,219,000 to $11,205,000, or 43.5% of revenue, during the six-month period ended September 30, 2001 from
$9,986,000, or 46.6% of revenue, during the six-month period ended September 30, 2000. The increase is primarily due to increases in bad debt expense, other taxes expense, depreciation and
amortization expense, and facilities expense, offset by decreases in personnel and related expenses, and professional services expense. Bad debt expense increased $1,074,000 to $1,864,000 in the
six-month period ended September 30, 2001 as many of Data Return's customers ceased operations or reduced or eliminated the website operations hosted by Data Return. Other taxes,
which include primarily property tax, were $677,000 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2001. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $508,000 to $1,218,000 in the six-month
period ended September 30, 2001, due to increased computer and office equipment necessary to support the growth of its business. Facilities expense increased $330,000 to $1,212,000 as a result
of Data Return's move into a larger facility and the growth 

in the average number of general and administrative employees during the first quarter of fiscal 2001. Personnel and related expenses decreased $1,179,000 to $4,290,000, or 16.7% of revenue, for the
six-month period ended September 30, 2001 from $5,469,000, or 25.5% of revenue, for the six-month period ended September 30, 2000 due to a decrease in the number of general and
administrative personnel to 56 employees at September 30, 2001 from 138 employees at September 30, 2000. Professional services expense decreased $557,000 to $456,000 for
the six-month period ended September 30, 2001 due to the completion of various projects and the reduction of contract employees. 

 Marketing and sales  

    Marketing and sales expense decreased $90,000 to $11,557,000, or 44.9% of revenue, during the six-month period ended September 30, 2001 from
$11,647,000, or 54.3% of revenue, during the six-month period ended September 30, 2000. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in marketing and sales personnel and related expenses, a
decrease in sales commissions due
to lower sales, and an increase in depreciation expenses. Personnel and related expenses, including sales commissions, decreased $631,000 to $6,803,000, or 26.4% of revenue, for the six-month period
ended September 30, 2001 from $7,434,000, or 34.7% of revenue, for the six-month period ended September 30, 2000. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $494,000 to $655,000
for the six-month period ended September 30, 2001 due to Data Return's move into a larger facility. Data Return decreased its marketing and sales personnel to 76 at
September 30, 2001 from 90 at September 30, 2000. 

 Product research and development  

    Product research and development expense increased $449,000 to $2,334,000, or 9.1% of revenue, during the six-month period ended September 30, 2001 from
$1,885,000, or 8.8% of revenue, during the six-month period ended September 30, 2000. The increase was due primarily to an increase in product research and development personnel and related
expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses. Personnel and related expenses increased $292,000 to $1,865,000, or 7.2% of revenue, for the six-month period ended September 30, 2001 from
$1,573,000, or 7.3% of revenue, for the six-month period ended September 30, 2000. Depreciation and amortization increased $64,000 to $136,000 for the six-month period ended
September 30, 2001 from $72,000 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2000. 

 Stock-based compensation  

    Deferred stock compensation was recorded in connection with the grant of employee stock options below fair value in 1998 and 1999. Amortization of stock-based
compensation totaled $74,000 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2001 and $125,000 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2000. The amortization of stock-based
compensation is based on the vesting schedule of stock options held by Data Return's employees. 

 Restructuring costs  

    Restructuring costs totaled $3,534,000 during the six month ended September 30, 2001. The May 10, 2001 restructuring plan resulted in estimated
costs associated with termination of leases and asset write-offs of $1,690,000 and severance costs of $501,000. The August 11, 2001 restructuring plan resulted in severance and benefit costs of
$1,343,000. 

    On May 10, 2001, Data Return initiated a restructuring plan intended to reduce its workforce and eliminate excess office space and furniture and fixtures at its headquarters.
On May 11, 2001, Data Return reduced its workforce by 94 employees. Data Return renegotiated the lease for its headquarters facilities and anticipates that it will
renegotiate certain excess furniture and fixtures leases. Data Return has also recorded a charge for the net book value of leasehold improvements related to the excess office space at its
headquarters facilities. The reduction in workforce was a result of slower than anticipated growth and increased process and other operational efficiencies. 

    On
August 11, 2001, Data Return initiated a voluntary separation benefit program to reduce its workforce. 108 employees were approved for the program. 

 Other income (expense)  

    Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income on Data Return's cash balances and investments in marketable securities and interest
expense on its outstanding notes payable and capital lease obligations. Interest earned on Data Return's cash and cash equivalents decreased $1,760,000 to $555,000 for the six-month period
ended September 30, 2001 from $2,315,000 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2000. This decrease was due primarily to having lower cash balances for investments as cash has been
used to fund operating losses. During the six-month period ended September 30, 2001, interest expense increased $616,000 to $1,602,000 related primarily to equipment acquired under capital
leases during the last four quarters. 

 Income taxes  

    No provision for federal income taxes has been recorded as Data Return has incurred net operating losses since its inception. Data Return have
recorded a valuation allowance against all of its net deferred tax asset, which is primarily attributable to net operating loss carry forwards, due to uncertainty that it will generate sufficient
taxable income during the carry forward period to realize the benefit of its net deferred tax asset. 

 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  

    Effective April 1, 2000, Data Return changed its method of accounting for set-up fees in accordance with SAB 101. Data Return
recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $1.6 million as of April 1, 2000 and amortized set-up fees into revenues during fiscal 2001. Set-up fees are now amortized over the longer of
the length of the customer contract and the estimated life of the customer contract. 

 Net loss  

    Net loss increased $5,965,000 to $29,005,000 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2001 from $23,040,000 for the six-month period ended
September 30, 2000. As more fully discussed above, the increased net loss is primarily attributable to increased expenses. 

 EBITDA  

    EBITDA, as defined above, decreased $936,000 to negative $17,322,000 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2001 from negative $16,386,000 for the
six-month period ended 

September 30, 2000. The decrease is primarily attributable to costs associated with anticipated growth partially offset by cost reduction efforts. Data Return expects to generate
negative EBITDA for fiscal 2002. Costs associated with Data Return's personnel and Data Return's fixed commitments will continue to represent a large portion of its expenses
during its anticipated expansion. EBITDA for the six-month periods ended September 30, 2001 and 2000 consists of loss from operations of $27,958,000 and $22,743,000 plus depreciation and
amortization of $10,562,000 and $6,232,000 and amortization of unearned stock-based compensation of $74,000 and $125,000, respectively. 

Comparison of fiscal 2001 and 2000

 Revenues  

    Data Return's revenues increased $38,235,000 to $50,068,000 for fiscal 2001 from $11,833,000 for fiscal 2000. Dedicated hosting revenue increased $35,370,000
to $41,839,000, or 83.6% of revenue, for fiscal 2001 from $6,469,000, or 54.7% of revenue, for fiscal 2000. Shared hosting revenue increased $631,000 to $2,911,000, or 5.8% of revenue, for fiscal 2001
from $2,280,000, or 19.3% of revenue, for fiscal 2000. Set-up fees increased $1,072,000 to $3,722,000, or 7.4% of revenue, for fiscal 2001 from $2,650,000, or 22.4% of revenue, for fiscal 2000.
Revenues from testing and other lab services were $352,000 during fiscal 2001 reflecting the opening of Data Return's scalability lab in September 2000. The increase was primarily due to the
addition of new customers that generated higher average monthly revenues. Growth from some existing customer accounts also contributed. 

 Cost of revenue  

    Data Return's cost of revenue increased $36,167,000 to $45,444,000, or 90.8% of revenue, for fiscal 2001 from $9,277,000, or 78.4% of revenue, for fiscal 2000.
The increase in cost of revenue was due primarily to increases in personnel and related costs, depreciation and amortization expenses, communication and bandwidth expenses, other hardware and software
equipment costs, facilities and travel and professional services. Personnel and related expenses increased approximately $15,408,000 to $20,439,000, or 40.8% of revenue, for fiscal 2001 from
$5,031,000, or 42.5% of revenue, for fiscal 2000, as Data Return increased its systems operations and customer support personnel to 237 at March 31, 2001 from 167 at March 31, 2000.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased approximately $10,574,000 to $12,250,000 for fiscal 2001, from $1,676,000 for fiscal 2000, as Data Return added approximately $23.5 million in computer
and related equipment since March 31, 2000. Data Return's communication and bandwidth expenses increased $6,772,000 to approximately $8,107,000 for fiscal 2001 from $1,335,000 for fiscal 2000
to support its increased business activities. Other hardware and software equipment costs increased $1,194,000 to $1,695,000 for fiscal 2001 to support the growth in Data Return's business. Facilities
costs increased $1,159,000 to $1,427,000 for fiscal 2001 due to a move into a larger facility in September 1999. Travel and professional services increased $207,000 and $309,000, to $291,000
and $404,000, respectively, for fiscal 2001. 

 General and administrative  

    General and administrative expense increased $15,843,000 to $23,418,000, or 46.8% of revenue, during fiscal 2001 from $7,575,000, or 64.0% of revenue, during
fiscal 2000. The increase is primarily due to increases in personnel and related expenses, bad debt, 

depreciation, professional services, facilities, supplies, insurance, travel, tax expense and amortization of warrants granted to vendors. Personnel and related expenses increased $5,835,000 to
$10,475,000, or 20.9% of revenue, for fiscal 2001 from $4,640,000, or 39.2% of revenue, for fiscal 2000. Data Return increased its number of employees in general and administrative functions to 117
employees at March 31, 2001 from 89 employees at March 31, 2000. Bad debt expense increased $3,020,000 to $3,547,000 as many of Data Return's customers, particularly Internet-based
businesses, ceased operations or reduced or eliminated the web site operations hosted by Data Return. Depreciation expense increased $1,416,000 to $1,801,000 for fiscal 2001, which is a result of
increased internal equipment necessary to support the growth of Data Return's business. Professional services fees increased approximately $1,057,000 to $1,556,000 for fiscal 2001 from $499,000 in the
comparable period in 2000. Expenses for facilities, supplies, insurance and travel increased $1,852,000, $420,000, $353,000 and $74,000, to $2,298,000, $561,000, $568,000 and $518,000, respectively,
for fiscal 2001 as a result of Data Return's move into a larger facility and to support the growth in general and administrative employees. Tax expense increased to $403,000 for fiscal 2001 due to
franchise and other state and local taxes. Amortization costs related to the warrants Data Return issued to Microsoft in September 1999 and Sicola Martin in March 2000 increased $375,000
to $553,000 in fiscal 2001. 

 Marketing and sales  

    Marketing and sales expense increased $18,280,000 to $24,492,000, or 48.9% of revenue, during fiscal 2001 from $6,212,000, or 52.5% of revenue, during fiscal
2000. The increase was due primarily to an increase in marketing and sales personnel and related expenses, advertising costs, including agency fees, promotional items, printing and trade shows,
travel, depreciation, and facilities expenses. Personnel and related expenses increased $10,168,000 to $14,715,000, or 29.4% of revenue, for fiscal 2001 from $4,547,000, or 38.4% of revenue, for
fiscal 2000. Advertising costs increased $5,232,000 to $6,078,000 for fiscal 2001 from $846,000 for fiscal 2000. Costs in this category include expenses for advertising, promotional items, printing,
trade shows, and fees paid to advertising, public relations and other creative agencies. Travel expenses increased $1,423,000 to $1,685,000 for fiscal 2001 as a result of the
growth in the marketing and sales personnel. Depreciation and facilities expenses increased $732,000 and $657,000, to $732,000 and $781,000, respectively, for fiscal 2001 due to Data Return's move
into a larger facility. Data Return increased its marketing and sales personnel to 114 at March 31, 2001 from 52 at March 31, 2000. 

 Product research and development  

    Product research and development expense increased $4,230,000 to $4,778,000, or 9.5% of revenue, during fiscal 2001 from $548,000, or 4.6% of revenue, during
fiscal 2000. The increase was due primarily to an increase in product research and development personnel and related expenses, facilities, depreciation and travel expenses. Personnel and related
expenses increased $3,379,000 to $3,860,000, or 7.7% of revenue, for fiscal 2001 from $481,000, or 4.1% of revenue, for fiscal 2000. Data Return increased its number of employees in product research
and development to 63 at March 31, 2001 from 17 at March 31, 2000. Facilities, depreciation and travel expenses increased $327,000, $178,000 and $87,000 to $346,000, $180,000 and
$127,000, respectively, for fiscal 2001 as a result of Data Return's move into a larger facility and the increase in the number of product research and development employees. 

 Stock-based compensation  

    Deferred stock compensation was recorded in connection with the grant of employee options below fair value in 1998 and 1999. Amortization of stock-based
compensation totaled $171,000 for fiscal 2001 and $1,779,000 for fiscal 2000. The amortization of stock-based compensation is based on the vesting schedule of options held by Data Return's employees. 

 Other income (expense)  

    Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income on Data Return's cash balances and investments in marketable securities and interest expense on
its outstanding notes payable
and capital lease obligations. Interest earned on Data Return's cash and cash equivalents increased $1,558,000 to $3,749,000 for fiscal 2001 from $2,191,000 for fiscal 2000. This increase was due
primarily to the closing of Data Return's initial public offering in October 1999, which resulted in higher cash balances available for investment for the majority of fiscal 2001. During fiscal
2001, interest expense increased $2,345,000 to $2,666,000 related primarily to equipment acquired under capital leases during the previous four quarters. 

 Income taxes  

    No provision for federal income taxes has been recorded as Data Return has incurred net operating losses since its inception. Data Return has recorded a full
valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset, which is primarily attributable to net operating loss carry forwards, due to uncertainty that Data Return will generate sufficient taxable
income during the carry forward period to realize the benefit of its net deferred tax asset. 

 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  

    Effective April 1, 2000, Data Return changed its method of accounting for set-up fees in accordance with SAB 101. The net effect on fiscal 2001 of the
change in accounting principle was to reduce Data Return's net loss by $408,000. Data Return recognized set-up revenues of $3.7 million under the new method of revenue recognition, including the $1.6
million cumulative adjustment that was recorded as of April 1, 2000 and amortized into income in fiscal 2001. Data Return would have recognized $3.3 million in set-up revenue under the prior
method. With the adoption of SAB 101, there was no impact on Data Return's operations or cash flow. See " Recent Accounting Pronouncements" for a description of Data Return's adoption and
the effect of SAB 101. 

 Net loss  

    Net loss increased to $48,778,000 for fiscal 2001 from $11,688,000 for fiscal 2000. As more fully discussed above, the increased net loss is primarily
attributable to increased costs as Data Return continued to build its business for anticipated growth. 

 EBITDA  

    EBITDA, as defined above, decreased $23,012,000 to negative $32,548,000 for fiscal 2001 from negative $9,565,000 for fiscal 2000. The decrease is primarily
attributable to costs associated with Data Return's growth strategy. EBITDA for fiscal 2001 and 2000 consists of losses from operations of $48,235,000 and $13,558,000 plus depreciation and
amortization of 

$15,516,000 and $2,214,000 plus amortization of unearned stock-based compensation of $171,000 and $1,779,000, respectively. 

Comparison of fiscal 2000 and 1999  

 Revenues  

    Data Return's revenues increased $9,944,000 to $11,833,000 for fiscal 2000 from $1,889,000 for fiscal 1999. Dedicated hosting revenue increased $5,840,000 to
$6,469,000, or 54.7% of revenue, for fiscal 2000 from $629,000, or 33.3% of revenue, for fiscal 1999. Shared hosting revenue increased $1,343,000 to $2,280,000, or 19.3% of revenue, for fiscal 2000
from $937,000, or 49.6% of revenue, for fiscal 1999. Set-up fees increased $2,384,000 to $2,650,000, or 22.4% of revenue, for fiscal 2000 from $266,000, or 14.1% of revenue, for fiscal 1999. The
increase was primarily due to the addition of new customers that generated higher average monthly revenues. Organic growth from some existing customer accounts also contributed. 

 Cost of revenue  

    Data Return's cost of revenue increased $8,172,000 to $9,277,000, or 78.4% of revenue, for fiscal 2000 from $1,105,000, or 58.5% of revenue, for fiscal 1999.
The increase in cost of
revenue was due primarily to increases in personnel and related costs, including employee recruiting fees, depreciation, bandwidth, other hardware and software equipment costs, facilities, travel and
professional services. The increase as a percent of revenue was partially attributable to Data Return incurring these costs in advance of revenues. Personnel and related expenses increased
approximately $4,489,000 to $5,031,000, or 42.5% of revenue, for fiscal 2000 from $542,000, or 28.7% of revenue, for fiscal 1999, as Data Return increased its systems and customer support personnel to
167 at March 31, 2000 from 19 at March 31, 1999. Depreciation expense increased approximately $1,587,000 to $1,676,000 for fiscal 2000 as Data Return added approximately $23.2 million in
computer and related equipment since March 31, 1999. Data Return's broadband services expenses increased $994,000 to approximately $1,335,000 for fiscal 2000 from $342,000 for fiscal 1999, to
support its increased business activities. Other hardware and software equipment costs increased $439,000 to $501,000 for fiscal 2000 to support the growth in Data Return's business. Facilities
expense increased $268,000 during fiscal 2000 as a result of its move into a larger facility and the growth in employees and as a result of the addition of a customer build center. Travel and
professional services increased $84,000 and $95,000, respectively, for fiscal 2000 reflecting the increased geographic dispersion of Data Return's customer base. 

 General and administrative  

    General and administrative expense increased $6,514,000 to $7,575,000, or 64.0% of revenue, during fiscal 2000 from $1,061,000, or 56.2% of revenue, during
fiscal 1999. The increase is primarily due to increases in personnel and related expenses, including employee recruiting fees, travel, professional services, depreciation, amortization of warrant,
facilities, supplies, insurance and bad debt. Personnel and related expenses increased $4,012,000 to $4,640,000, or 39.2% of revenue, for fiscal 2000 from $628,000, or 33.3% of revenue, for fiscal
1999. Data Return increased its number of employees in general and administrative functions to 89 employees at March 31, 2000 from eight employees at March 31, 1999. Travel expenses
increased approximately $400,000 to $444,000, or 3.8% of revenue, for fiscal 2000 from $44,000, or 2.4% of revenue, for fiscal 1999. Professional services fees increased approximately 

$414,000 to $499,000 for fiscal 2000 from $85,000 in the comparable period in 1999. Depreciation expense increased $344,000 in fiscal 2000, which is a result of increased internal equipment necessary
to support the growth of Data Return's business. Amortization of product development costs related to the warrant Data Return issued to Microsoft in September 1999 increased $178,000.
Facilities, supplies, and insurance expense increased $338,000, $136,000 and $208,000, respectively, as a result of Data Return's move into a larger facility and the growth in general and
administrative employees. Bad debt expense increased $493,000. 

 Marketing and sales  

    Marketing and sales expense increased $5,549,000 to $6,212,000, or 52.5% of revenue, during fiscal 2000 from $663,000, or 35.1% of revenue, during fiscal 1999.
The increase was due primarily to an increase in marketing and sales personnel and related expenses, including employee recruiting fees and advertising costs. Personnel and related expenses increased
$4,176,000 to $4,547,000, or 38.4% of revenue, for fiscal 2000 from $370,000, or 19.6% of revenue, for fiscal 1999. Advertising costs increased $549,000 to $846,000 for fiscal 2000 from $296,000 for
fiscal 1999. Data Return increased its marketing and sales personnel to 52 at March 31, 2000 from six at March 31, 1999. 

 Product research and development  

    Product research and development expense increased $546,000 to $548,000, or 4.6% of revenue, during fiscal 2000 from $2,000, or .1% of revenue, during fiscal
1999. The increase was due primarily to an increase in product research and development personnel and related expenses, facilities costs, depreciation and travel expenses. Personnel and related
expenses increased $479,000 to $481,000, or 4.1% of revenue, for fiscal 2000 from $2,000, or .1% of revenue, for fiscal 1999. Data Return increased its number of employees in product research and
development to 17 at March 31, 2000 from 1 at March 31, 1999. Facilities costs, depreciation and travel expenses increased $19,000, $2,000, and $40,000, respectively, as a result of Data
Return's move into a larger facility and the increase in the number of product research and development employees. 

 Stock-based compensation  

    Deferred stock compensation was recorded in connection with the grant of employee stock options below fair value. Amortization of stock-based compensation
totaled $1,779,000 for fiscal 2000 and $349,000 for fiscal 1999. The amortization of stock-based compensation is based on the vesting schedule of stock options held by Data Return's employees. Stock
based compensation in fiscal 2000 includes the effect of options whose vesting was accelerated to the date of Data Return's initial public offering, which closed in November 1999. 

 Other income (expense)  

    Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income on Data Return's cash balances and interest expense on its outstanding notes payable and capital
lease obligations. Interest earned on its cash and cash equivalents increased $2,171,000 to $2,191,000 for fiscal 2000 from $20,000 for fiscal 1999. This increase was due primarily to the closing of
Data Return's initial public offering in October 1999, which resulted in larger cash balances available for investment. During fiscal 2000, Data Return increased interest expense $308,000 

to $321,000 related primarily to equipment capital leases entered into in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. 

 Income taxes  

    No provision for federal income taxes has been recorded as Data Return has incurred net operating losses since its inception. Data Return has recorded a
valuation allowance against all of its net deferred tax asset, which is primarily attributable to net operating loss carry forwards, due to uncertainty that it will generate sufficient taxable income
during the carry forward period to realize the benefit of its net deferred tax asset. 

 Net loss  

    Net loss increased $10,404,000 to $11,688,000 for fiscal 2000 from $1,284,000 for fiscal 1999. As more fully discussed above, the increased net loss is
primarily attributable to increased costs as Data Return continued to build its business for anticipated growth. 

 EBITDA  

    EBITDA, as defined above, decreased $8,723,000 to negative $9,565,000 for fiscal 2000 from negative $813,000 for fiscal 1999. The decrease is primarily
attributable to costs associated with Data Return's growth strategy. EBITDA consisted of losses from operations of $13,558,0000 and $1,291,000 plus depreciation and amortization of $2,214,000 and
$129,000 plus amortization of unearned stock-based compensation of $1,779,000 and $349,000 for fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

    Data Return has historically financed its operations primarily through sales of equity securities and capital leases. Since its inception, Data Return has
raised $15.9 million through private placements of its common stock. In November 1999, Data Return raised $85.9 million in net proceeds from its initial public offering. As of
October 31, 2001, Data Return had cash and cash equivalents of $8.9 million. 

    Net
cash used in Data Return's operating activities for the six-month period ended September 30, 2001 was $15.4 million. The net cash used in operations was comprised
primarily of working capital requirements and Data Return's net loss, net of depreciation and amortization. Net cash provided by investing activities was $22.2 million for the six-month
period ended September 30, 2001 and consisted of the sale of marketable debt securities of $25.4 million and purchases of property and equipment of approximately $2.6 million.
Data Return's purchases of property and equipment consisted primarily of equipment to provide services to its customers. Data Return acquired $3.1 million in computer and related
equipment under capital leases for the six-month period ended September 30, 2001. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $4.7 million for the six-month period ended
September 30, 2001 and consisted primarily of principal payments on Data Return's notes payable and capital leases. 

    Total borrowings under Data Return's notes payable and capital lease obligations as of September 30, 2001 were approximately $29.4 million. 

    In
December 1999 Data Return entered into a revolving credit facility with Bank One, Texas, N.A. This $2.0 million credit facility matured on July 31,
2001, and Data Return did not renew it. Data Return did not borrow any amounts under the facility. 

    Under
Data Return's agreement with Level 3, Data Return is required to purchase at least an additional $7.6 million of bandwidth and colocation services over the
next three years. Data Return's quarterly commitment was $300,000 per quarter through July 2001, is $400,000 per quarter through July 2002 and is $600,000 per quarter during the
next 12 months and $1.0 million per quarter during the final 12 months of the agreement. 

    During
the quarter ended September 30, 2001, Data Return began to implement a cost savings plan with an objective of becoming substantially cash flow breakeven at current
revenue levels by reducing cash outflows. As part of this plan, Data Return reduced its real estate lease expenses by $193,000 per month, personnel expenses by $961,000 per month and
discretionary expenses by $296,000 per month. Data Return expects to begin to realize the full effect of these costs savings during the quarter ending December 31, 2001.
Data Return expected to negotiate a reduction of its other fixed operating expenses (including capital leases). As a result, it was not making its lease payments, or was making partial lease
payments, under these leases and was in default under these leases at September 30, 2001. Because the restructuring of these leases would likely have impacted its capital structure, Data Return
did not negotiate the restructuring while it was engaged in the negotiations that resulted in the execution of the merger agreement. 

    In
connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Data Return entered into a credit agreement with divine on November 1, 2001 pursuant to which divine has agreed
to make available to Data Return interim financing of up to a maximum of $12.8 million. Outstanding balances bear interest at 10%. The facility is secured by all of Data Return's
assets other than certain assets that are already encumbered or cannot be pledged. The credit facility contains standard events of default and other covenants. Data Return received its first
advance, in the amount of $4.3 million, on November 5, 2001, and plan to use a substantial portion of such amount to make past-due payments to its capital lease vendors.
Data Return currently expects
that its cash and investment balances available at September 30, 2001 and the amounts available to it under the credit agreement should be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital
expenditure requirements at least through the end of its current fiscal year (March 31, 2002). However, Data Return's ability to access the remaining amounts is subject to its meeting certain
financial covenants and other conditions. In addition, under certain circumstances, divine would be entitled to either restrict Data Return's borrowing ability or declare the entire unpaid
balance due, or both. Data Return expects the merger agreement to close in January 2002, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. 

    If
the merger agreement is terminated, in addition to funding Data Return's ongoing expenses, Data Return could be required to repay outstanding amounts under the credit
agreement and, under certain circumstances, termination fees and expenses totaling $2.2 million. If divine terminates the merger agreement because Data Return has breached a covenant or
agreement or a representation or warranty, or its board of directors withdraws its recommendation of the merger or takes certain actions with respect to another acquisition proposal,
Data Return would be required to repay all outstanding amounts within 90 days 

after the termination date. If Data Return terminates the merger agreement because divine's stock price closes for 10 consecutive trading days below $0.329, Data Return would be
required to repay all outstanding amounts within 180 days after the termination date. If Data Return terminates the merger agreement because divine has breached a covenant or agreement or
representation or warranty or divine's board of directors withdraws its recommendation of the merger, all outstanding amounts convert to Data Return common shares at $0.94 per share. If
Data Return is required to repay outstanding loans from divine and some or all of the other expenses as a result of the termination of the merger agreement, Data Return would be required
to raise a significant amount of capital and the covenants in the credit agreement with divine prohibit us from raising additional capital or incurring additional debt without repaying divine in full.
As a result, it is likely that, if the merger agreement is terminated and the outstanding loans did not convert to equity, Data Return would not be able to continue as a going concern unless it
were able to raise this additional capital quickly. In any event, Data Return would be required to significantly curtail its operations to allow it to continue to operate while it attempted to
secure additional sources of capital. If Data Return requires additional financing for any reason, there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to it on acceptable
terms, or at all. Further, if Data Return raises additional funds through the issuance of additional equity securities, the percentage ownership of Data Return's shareholders would be
substantially diluted. Any new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the Data Return common shares. 

Risk Factors  

    In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, including the section entitled "Risk Factors"
beginning on page 26, you should also consider the following risks associated with owning Data Return common shares. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks
Data Return faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Data Return, or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair its business operations. If any of the
following risks actually occur, Data Return's financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. 

Data Return's business and stock price may be adversely affected if the merger with divine is not completed.  

    If the merger with divine is not completed, Data Return could be subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect its business and stock price. First,
Data Return would not realize the strategic benefits of the enhanced financial and competitive position it expects to realize from being part of a combined company with divine. Second, the
diversion of its management's attention from the day to day business and the disruption to its employees and its relationships with customers as a result of efforts and uncertainties relating to the
anticipated merger may detract from its ability to grow revenues and minimize costs. Third, under certain circumstances Data Return could be required to pay divine a termination fee equal to
$1,700,000 and up to $500,000 of its transaction related expenses, as well as its own transaction expenses and up to $12.8 million that Data Return may, under certain circumstances,
borrow from divine under its credit facility with divine. 

If the merger agreement is terminated and the outstanding loans under the credit agreement with divine become payable, Data Return may not be able to
raise enough capital to repay the loans, which could result in its inability to continue as a going concern.  

    If the merger agreement is terminated, in addition to funding its ongoing expenses, Data Return would be required to repay outstanding amounts under the credit
agreement and, under certain circumstances, termination and other fees and expenses totaling $2.2 million. If divine terminates the merger agreement because Data Return has breached a covenant
or agreement or representation or warranty or its board of directors withdraws its
recommendation of the merger or takes certain actions with respect to another acquisition proposal, Data Return would be required to repay all outstanding amounts within 90 days after
the termination date. If Data Return terminates the merger agreement because divine's stock price closes for ten consecutive trading days below $0.329, it would be required to repay all
outstanding amounts within 180 days after the termination date. If Data Return is required to repay outstanding loans from divine or some or all of the other expenses as a result of the
termination of the merger agreement, it would be required to raise a significant amount of capital and the covenants in the credit agreement with divine prohibit Data Return from raising
additional capital or incurring additional debt without repaying divine in full. As a result, it is likely that, if the merger agreement is terminated and the outstanding loan balance is not converted
into equity, Data Return would not be able to continue as a going concern unless it were able to raise this additional capital quickly. In any event, Data Return would be required to
significantly curtail its operations to allow it to continue to operate while attempting to secure additional sources of capital. If Data Return requires additional financing for any reason,
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, if Data Return raises additional funds through the issuance of additional
equity securities, the percentage ownership of its shareholders would be substantially diluted. Any new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of Data Return's
common shares. 

Data Return has a history of substantial losses, and it anticipates continuing losses.  

    Data Return has experienced operating losses and negative cash flows from operations in each quarterly and annual period since incorporating in 1997. It
experienced net losses of approximately $12.8 million, or negative 105% of revenues, for the quarter ended September 30, 2001. As of September 30, 2001, Data Return had an
accumulated deficit of approximately $90.9 million. It is required to purchase an additional $800,000 of colocation and bandwidth services from Level 3 during the fiscal 2002.
Data Return expects to incur operating losses for at least the next fiscal year. Data Return cannot assure you that it will ever be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis or that, if
it achieves profitability, it will be sustainable. 

Data Return's business and prospects are difficult to evaluate because it has a limited operating history and its business model is still evolving.  

    It is difficult to evaluate Data Return's business operations and prospects because of its limited operating history and the pace of change in its business.
Data Return was incorporated in August 1997 and commenced operations in September of that year with a focus on hosting services, and its business model is still new and evolving. The
revenue and income potential of Data Return's business is unproven. Its limited operating history and the 

relative newness of the industry in which it operates makes predicting future results difficult. Data Return may not be able to successfully implement its business plan or adapt it to changes
in the market. If Data Return is not able to do so, its business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected. 

Data Return's quarterly and annual results may fluctuate, resulting in fluctuations in the price of Data Return common shares.  

    Data Return's operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future on a quarterly and annual basis. Because of these fluctuations, comparisons of
Data Return's operating results from period to period are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance. Data Return expects to
experience significant fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of its control. The following factors could affect Data Return's operating results: 


demand
for Data Return's services;


size
and timing of customer installations and related payments;


reliable
services and network availability;


ability
and costs associated with increasing network and data center capacity;


fluctuations
in data and voice communications costs;


fluctuations
in hardware and software costs;


timing
and magnitude of capital expenditures and other expenses;


costs
relating to operations;


customer
retention and satisfaction;


introduction
by third parties, including Data Return's competitors, of new products and services;


termination
or reduction of services by customers, including terminations by customers that do not have sufficient funding to continue their operations,
either at all or at the level contemplated by Data Return's agreements with them;


customer
discounts and credits;


timing
and success of marketing efforts and service introductions by Data Return;


changes
in Data Return's pricing policies or those of its competitors;


retention
of Data Return's key personnel; and


economic
conditions specific to the hosting industry, as well as general economic conditions. 

A portion of Data Return's operating costs are fixed. If Data Return's revenues do not exceed its costs, Data Return's operating results will suffer.  

    A portion of Data Return's operating costs are fixed at certain minimum levels, including its expenses for data center capacity, depreciation, interest,
hardware lease payments, minimum bandwidth charges, real estate lease payments and personnel. Therefore, its results 

of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenue. Data Return will have to pay these fixed costs regardless of its revenues and its results of operations and financial
condition would be adversely affected, if Data Return's revenues are not at the level it expect. Furthermore, many of Data Return's customers are relatively new business, or
Internet-focused business initiatives of more established companies, and these businesses or initiatives may have negative cash flows or may not be successful, or both. As a result, Data Return
may not be able to collect revenues for the services it provides on a timely basis or at all. 

    For
these and other reasons, in future periods Data Return's operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could result in widely
varying share prices and negatively affect the market price of Data Return common shares. 

Data Return's customer base includes a significant number of businesses that currently face increasing difficulty in obtaining funding to support their
operations.  

    Many of Data Return's customers are businesses, including Internet-based businesses, that have traditionally been initially funded by venture capital firms and
then through public securities offerings. Funding alternatives for these businesses have become more limited than in the past. The unproven business models of many of Data Return's customers
and the uncertain economic climate make their continued viability uncertain. Many of these customers have ceased or reduced their operations, and it has become increasingly difficult for
Data Return to collect its accounts receivable from these businesses. If the market for technology and Internet-based businesses is not supported by the private and public investors who have
funded these customers or if their business models prove to be unsuccessful, Data Return faces the risk that these customers may cease, curtail or limit web site operations hosted by
Data Return. If this continues to occur, Data Return would likely experience a loss of revenue associated with these customers and will then have to increase sales to other businesses in
order to preserve and grow its revenue. If Data Return is successful in increasing sales to other businesses, it will incur the expenses associated with these new customers, such as sales and
marketing expenses, including commissions, and implementation costs. As a result, to preserve and grow its revenue, Data Return will have to increase sales by substantially more than the amount
of lost revenue. 

Because Data Return operates in a new and evolving market with uncertain prospects for growth, it may be unable to sustain growth in
Data Return's customer base and its operating results may suffer.  

    Data Return's market is new and rapidly evolving. Growth in demand for and acceptance of advanced hosting services is highly uncertain. Businesses may not be
aware of the potential benefits of outsourcing or may find it less expensive, more secure or otherwise preferable to host their web sites internally. Internet technologies, such as e-commerce
applications, which require advanced hosting, may not g
