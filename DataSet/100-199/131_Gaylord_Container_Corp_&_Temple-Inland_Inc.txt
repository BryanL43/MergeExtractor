                               SUMMARY TERM SHEET

     Temple-Inland Acquisition Corporation is offering to purchase all of the
outstanding common stock of Gaylord Container Corporation for $1.80 in cash. The
following are some of the questions you, as a stockholder of Gaylord, may have
and answers to those questions. We urge you to read carefully the remainder of
this Offer to Purchase and the accompanying Letter of Transmittal in their
entirety because the information in this summary term sheet is not complete.
Additional important information is contained in the remainder of this Offer to
Purchase and the accompanying Letter of Transmittal.

WHO IS OFFERING TO BUY MY SECURITIES?

     Our name is Temple-Inland Acquisition Corporation. We are a Delaware
corporation formed for the purpose of making a tender offer for all of the
shares of common stock of Gaylord and have carried on no other business other
than in connection with the merger agreement among Temple-Inland Inc., Gaylord
and ourselves. We are an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Temple-Inland
Inc., a Delaware corporation whose shares of common stock are listed on the New
York Stock Exchange and the Pacific Exchange. Temple-Inland is a holding company
that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries. The business of
Temple-Inland is divided among three groups: paper, which manufactures
corrugated packaging products; building products, which manufactures a wide
range of building products and manages Temple-Inland's forest resources of
approximately 2.2 million acres of timberland in Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, and
Alabama; and financial services, which consists of savings bank, mortgage
banking, real estate, and insurance brokerage activities. See the "Introduction"
and Section 8.

WHAT ARE THE CLASSES AND AMOUNTS OF SECURITIES SOUGHT IN THE OFFER?

     We are seeking to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of
Class A common stock of Gaylord, which constitutes all of its outstanding common
stock, and the rights to purchase preferred stock associated with those shares.
See the "Introduction" and Section 1.

HOW MUCH ARE YOU OFFERING TO PAY FOR MY SHARES? WHAT IS THE FORM OF PAYMENT?
WILL I HAVE TO PAY ANY FEES OR COMMISSIONS?

     We are offering to pay $1.80 per share, net to you in cash, without
interest. If you are the record owner of your shares and you tender your shares
to us in the offer, you will not have to pay brokerage fees or similar expenses.
However, if you own your shares through a broker or other nominee, and your
broker tenders your shares on your behalf, your broker or nominee may charge you
a fee for doing so. You should consult your broker or nominee to determine
whether any charges will apply. See the "Introduction."

DO YOU HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MAKE PAYMENT?

     Temple-Inland Inc., our parent company, will provide us with sufficient
funds to purchase all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn in the tender
offer and to provide funding for the merger, which is expected to follow the
successful completion of the tender offer in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement. The Offer is not conditioned on our
obtaining any financing. Temple-Inland Inc. will obtain its funds pursuant to a
term credit facility from Citibank, N.A. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. See
Section 9 for a description of our financing arrangements.

IS YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION RELEVANT TO MY DECISION TO TENDER MY SHARES IN THE
TENDER OFFER?

     We do not think our financial condition is relevant to your decision
whether to tender your shares in the offer because the form of payment consists
solely of cash, and our offer is not contingent upon our receipt of financing.
See Section 9 for a description of our financing arrangements.

HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO TENDER MY SHARES IN THE OFFER?

     You will have until 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Friday, October
26, 2001, to tender your shares in the offer, unless the offer is extended. If
you cannot deliver everything that is required in order to make a valid tender
by that time, you may be able to use a guaranteed delivery procedure, which is
described later in this Offer to Purchase. See Section 3.

CAN THE OFFER BE EXTENDED AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES?

     Subject to the terms of the merger agreement and applicable law, we can
extend the offer at any time and from time to time in our sole discretion. We
have agreed in the merger agreement that we may extend and re-extend the offer
without Gaylord's consent if any of the conditions to the offer have not been
satisfied or waived at the scheduled expiration date. However, without Gaylord's
consent we may not extend the offer beyond December 28, 2001 unless required to
so extend the offer pursuant to regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

     In addition, after we have purchased shares tendered in the offer, we may
elect to provide a "subsequent offering period" if less than 90% of the shares
outstanding on a fully-diluted basis were properly tendered and not withdrawn. A
subsequent offering period, if one is provided, will be an additional period of
from 3 to 20 business days, beginning after we have purchased shares tendered
during the offer, during which stockholders may tender, but not withdraw, their
shares and receive the offer consideration for those shares promptly after they
are tendered. See Section 1 for more details on our ability to extend the offer.

HOW WILL I BE NOTIFIED IF THE OFFER IS EXTENDED?

     If we extend the offer, we will inform Computershare Trust Company of New
York (the depositary for the offer) of that fact and will make a public
announcement of the extension not later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on
the next business day after the day on which the offer was previously scheduled
to expire. See Section 1.

WHAT ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER?

     We are not obligated to purchase any shares that are validly tendered
unless:

     - the number of shares validly tendered and not withdrawn before the
       expiration date of the offer, together with the shares then owned by
       Temple-Inland and Temple-Inland Acquisition Corporation, represents at
       least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis
       (this condition is called the "minimum stock condition" and cannot be
       waived by us);

     - the depositary receives the valid and unwithdrawn tender of at least 90%
       in aggregate principal amount of each series of the Company's outstanding
       9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007, 9 3/4% Senior Notes due 2007 and 9 7/8%
       Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008, pursuant to Temple-Inland's separate
       offers to purchase such notes;

     - there is no material adverse change in Gaylord or its business; and

     - the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under
       applicable antitrust laws has occurred.

     The offer is also subject to a number of other conditions. We can waive any
of the conditions to the offer without Gaylord's consent, except the minimum
stock condition. See Section 15.

HOW DO I TENDER MY SHARES?

     To tender shares, you must deliver the certificates representing your
shares, together with a completed letter of transmittal, to Computershare Trust
Company of New York, the depositary for the offer, not later than the time the
offer expires. If your shares are held in street name, the shares can be
tendered by your nominee through The Depository Trust Company. If you are unable
to deliver any required document or

instrument to the depositary by the expiration of the tender offer, you may gain
some extra time by having a broker, a bank or other fiduciary that is a member
of the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program or other eligible
institution guarantee that the missing items will be received by the depositary
within three New York Stock Exchange trading days. For the tender to be valid,
however, the depositary must receive the missing items within that three trading
day period. See Section 3.

UNTIL WHAT TIME MAY I WITHDRAW PREVIOUSLY TENDERED SHARES?

     You may withdraw shares at any time until the offer has expired and, if we
have not agreed to accept your shares for payment by Monday, November 26, 2001,
you may withdraw them at any time after that date until we accept shares for
payment. This right to withdraw, however, will not apply to the subsequent
offering period discussed in Section 1. See Section 4.

HOW DO I WITHDRAW PREVIOUSLY TENDERED SHARES?

     To withdraw shares, you must deliver a written notice of withdrawal, or a
facsimile of one, with the required information to the depositary while you
still have the right to withdraw the shares. See Section 4.

DOES THE GAYLORD BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMEND THE OFFER?

     We are making the offer pursuant to the merger agreement, which has been
unanimously approved by the Gaylord board of directors. The board of directors
of Gaylord unanimously (1) determined that the terms of the offer and the merger
are fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders of Gaylord, (2)
approved the offer, the merger and the merger agreement and (3) recommends that
Gaylord's stockholders accept the tender offer, tender their shares pursuant to
the tender offer and approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger. See
the "Introduction."

IF TWO-THIRDS OF THE SHARES ARE TENDERED AND ACCEPTED FOR PAYMENT, WILL GAYLORD
CONTINUE AS A PUBLIC COMPANY?

     No. Following the purchase of shares in the offer we expect to consummate
the merger. If the merger takes place, Gaylord will no longer be publicly owned.
Even if for some reason the merger does not take place, after we purchase all of
the tendered shares, there may be so few remaining stockholders and publicly
held shares that Gaylord common stock will no longer be eligible to be traded on
the American Stock Exchange, there may not be a public trading market for
Gaylord stock and Gaylord may cease making filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission or otherwise cease being required to comply with the SEC
rules relating to publicly held companies. See Section 13.

WILL THE TENDER OFFER BE FOLLOWED BY A MERGER IF ALL OF THE GAYLORD SHARES ARE
NOT PURCHASED IN THE OFFER?

     Yes. If we accept for payment and pay for at least two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of Gaylord, Temple-Inland Acquisition Corporation will be
merged with and into Gaylord. If that merger takes place, Temple-Inland will
indirectly own all of the issued and outstanding shares of Gaylord, and all
remaining stockholders of Gaylord (other than Temple-Inland, its subsidiaries
and stockholders properly exercising dissenters' rights) will receive $1.80 per
share in cash (or any other higher price per share that is paid in the offer).
See the "Introduction."

IF I DECIDE NOT TO TENDER, HOW WILL THE OFFER AFFECT MY SHARES?

     If the merger described above takes place, stockholders not tendering in
the offer will receive the same amount of cash per share that they would have
received had they tendered their shares in the offer, subject to any dissenters'
rights properly exercised under Delaware law. Therefore, if the merger takes
place, the only difference to you between tendering your shares and not
tendering your shares is that you will be paid earlier if you tender your shares
and you will have waived your dissenters' rights under Delaware law. If the
merger does not take place, however, the number of stockholders and the number
of

shares of Gaylord that are still in the hands of the public may be so small that
there no longer will be an active public trading market (or, possibly, there may
not be any public trading market) for the Gaylord common stock. Also, as
described above, Gaylord may cease making filings with the SEC or otherwise
being required to comply with the SEC rules relating to publicly held companies.
See the "Introduction" and Section 13.

WHAT IS THE MARKET VALUE OF MY SHARES AS OF A RECENT DATE?

     On September 27, 2001, the last trading day before we announced and
commenced the offer and the possible merger, the last sale price of Gaylord
common stock reported on the American Stock Exchange was $0.69 per share. We
advise you to obtain a recent quotation for shares of Gaylord common stock in
deciding whether to tender your shares. See Section 6.

WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TENDERING MY SHARES?

     The receipt of cash for shares pursuant to the offer or the merger will be
a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and possibly
for state, local and foreign income tax purposes as well. In general, a
stockholder who tenders shares pursuant to the offer or receives cash in
exchange for shares pursuant to the merger will recognize gain or loss for
United States federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount of cash received and the stockholder's adjusted tax basis in
the shares sold pursuant to the offer or exchanged for cash pursuant to the
merger. If the shares exchanged constitute capital assets in the hands of the
stockholder, such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss. In general, capital
gains recognized by an individual will be subject to a maximum United States
federal income tax rate of 20% if the shares were held for more than one year,
and if held for one year or less they will be subject to tax at ordinary income
tax rates. See Section 5.

TO WHOM MAY I SPEAK IF I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TENDER OFFER?

     You may call our information agent D. F. King & Co., Inc. at (800) 549-6650
(toll-free). See the back cover of this Offer to Purchase.

To the Holders of Shares of Common Stock
of Gaylord Container Corporation:

                                  INTRODUCTION

     Temple-Inland Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"Purchaser") and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Temple-Inland Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), hereby offers to purchase all outstanding
shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $.0001 per share (the "Common Stock"),
of Gaylord Container Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
together with the associated rights to purchase preferred stock issued pursuant
to the Rights Agreement, dated June 12, 1995 (the "Rights Agreement"), between
the Company and Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as rights agent (the "Rights"
and, together with the Common Stock, the "Shares") at a price of $1.80 per
Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon (the "Offer Price"),
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Offer to Purchase
and in the related Letter of Transmittal (which, together with any amendments or
supplements hereto or thereto, collectively constitute the "Offer").

     The Offer is being made pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of September 27, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement") among Parent, the Purchaser
and the Company. The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that the
Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"). At the
effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), the Company will continue
as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"), indirectly
wholly-owned by Parent. Pursuant to the Merger, each Share outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares owned beneficially or
of record by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent or held in the treasury of the
Company, all of which will be canceled, and other than Shares that are held by
stockholders, if any, who properly exercise their dissenters' rights under the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL")), shall be converted into the
right to receive the per Share price paid in the Offer in cash, without interest
(the "Merger Consideration"). The Merger Agreement is more fully described in
Section 11, which also contains a discussion of the treatment of stock options.
We are not asking for a proxy and you are requested not to send us a proxy. Any
solicitation of proxies will be made only pursuant to separate proxy
solicitation materials complying with the requirements of Section 14(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").

     Tendering stockholders who are record owners of their Shares and tender
directly to the Depositary (as defined below) will not be obligated to pay
brokerage fees or commissions or, except as otherwise provided in Instruction 6
of the Letter of Transmittal, stock transfer taxes with respect to the purchase
of Shares by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. Stockholders who hold their
Shares through a broker or bank should consult such institution as to whether it
charges any service fees. Parent or the Purchaser will pay all charges and
expenses of Computershare Trust Company of New York, as depositary (the
"Depositary"), and D. F. King & Co., Inc., as information agent (the
"Information Agent"), incurred in connection with the Offer. See Section 18.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY (THE "COMPANY BOARD") HAS UNANIMOUSLY
(1) DETERMINED THAT THE TERMS OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER ARE FAIR TO AND IN THE
BEST INTERESTS OF THE STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY, (2) APPROVED THE OFFER, THE
MERGER AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND (3) RECOMMENDS THAT THE COMPANY'S
STOCKHOLDERS ACCEPT THE OFFER, TENDER THEIR SHARES PURSUANT TO THE OFFER AND
APPROVE AND ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER.

     Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc. ("Deutsche Banc") and Rothschild Inc.
("Rothschild"), the Company's financial advisors, each has delivered to the
Company Board its written opinion dated September 27, 2001, to the effect that,
as of such date and based on and subject to the matters stated in such opinions,
the per Share cash to be received in the Offer and the Merger by the holders of
Shares is fair from a financial point of view to such holders (other than Parent
and its affiliates). The full text of each written opinion, which describes the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the
review undertaken, is included as an annex to the Company's Solicitation/
Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (the "Schedule 14D-9") under the
Exchange Act, which

is being mailed to stockholders concurrently herewith. Stockholders are urged to
read carefully the full text of each opinion in its entirety.

     THE OFFER IS CONDITIONED UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (1) THERE BEING VALIDLY
TENDERED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE OFFER AND NOT WITHDRAWN PRIOR TO
THE EXPIRATION DATE THAT NUMBER OF SHARES THAT, TOGETHER WITH THE SHARES THEN
OWNED BY PARENT AND THE PURCHASER, REPRESENTS AT LEAST TWO-THIRDS OF THE THEN
OUTSTANDING SHARES ON A FULLY DILUTED BASIS (THE "MINIMUM STOCK CONDITION"), (2)
THE RECEIPT BY THE DEPOSITARY OF THE VALID AND UNWITHDRAWN TENDER OF THE
COMPANY'S 9 3/8% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2007, 9 3/4% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2007 AND 9 7/8%
SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE 2008 (COLLECTIVELY, THE "NOTES") (AND RELATED
CONSENTS) REPRESENTING AT LEAST 90% IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE
OUTSTANDING NOTES OF EACH SERIES (THE "MINIMUM NOTE CONDITION"), PURSUANT TO
PARENT'S, OR ITS DESIGNEE'S, SEPARATE OFFERS TO PURCHASE SUCH NOTES (THE "NOTES
TENDER OFFERS"), AND (3) THE WAITING PERIOD UNDER THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO
ANTITRUST IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 1976, AS AMENDED, AND THE REGULATIONS THEREUNDER
(THE "HSR ACT"), HAVING EXPIRED OR BEEN TERMINATED (THE "HSR CONDITION"). PLEASE
READ SECTION 15, WHICH SETS FORTH IN FULL THE CONDITIONS TO THIS OFFER.

     For purposes of the Offer, "on a fully diluted basis" means, as of any
time, on a basis that includes the number of Shares that are actually issued and
outstanding plus the maximum number of Shares that the Company may be required
to issue pursuant to obligations under stock options (other than the options to
be cancelled pursuant to the Merger Agreement), warrants and other rights or
securities convertible into shares of Common Stock, whether or not currently
exercisable, except for the Rights and Shares issuable to Parent pursuant to the
Stock Option Agreement between the Company and Parent, to the extent Parent has
not exercised its option.

     Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company has represented to Parent
that, on September 26, 2001, (1) 55,971,493 Shares were issued and outstanding,
(2) 1,854,403 Shares were subject to the exercise of stock options, (3) 827,135
Shares (which are included in the number outstanding in clause (1)) were subject
to the exercise of warrants, and (4) 2,130,500 Shares (which are included in the
number outstanding in clause (1)) were restricted shares of Common Stock.
Neither Parent, the Purchaser nor any person listed on Schedule I hereto (except
as set forth thereon) beneficially owns any Shares. Accordingly, the Purchaser
believes that the Minimum Stock Condition would be satisfied if approximately
38,550,597 Shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the
Expiration Date, though the number required to meet the Minimum Stock Condition
will likely be lower due to the cancellation of certain stock options pursuant
to Section 3.4(a) of the Merger Agreement. See Section 13.

     The Merger Agreement provides that promptly upon the purchase of and
payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer, as a result of which Parent and its
affiliates will own beneficially at least a majority of the then outstanding
Shares, Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded
up to the next whole number, on the Company Board that equals the product of (1)
the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the
directors designated by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement) and (2) the
percentage that the number of Shares so purchased bears to the total number of
Shares then outstanding. Parent intends to choose its designees to the Company
Board from those persons listed in Schedule I hereto. The Company has agreed,
upon request of the Purchaser, promptly to increase the size of the Company
Board or exercise its best efforts to secure the resignations of such number of
directors, or both, as is necessary to enable Parent's designees to be so
elected to the Company Board and, subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, to cause Parent's designees to be so
elected; provided, however, that until the Effective Time there shall be at
least two members of the Company Board who are directors as of the date of the
Merger Agreement and are not employees of the Company. See Section 11.

     In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company Board has amended
the Rights Agreement to render the Rights and the Rights Agreement inapplicable
to the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.

     The Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions,
including, if required, the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement by the
affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the

outstanding Shares. If the Minimum Stock Condition is satisfied, the Purchaser
would have sufficient voting power to approve the Merger without the affirmative
vote of any other stockholder of the Company. The Company has agreed, if
required, to cause a meeting of its stockholders to be held as promptly as
practicable following consummation of the Offer for the purposes of considering
and taking action upon the approval of the Merger and the approval and adoption
of the Merger Agreement. See Section 11.

     THIS OFFER TO PURCHASE AND THE RELATED LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL CONTAIN
IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE ANY DECISION IS MADE
WITH RESPECT TO THE OFFER.

                                THE TENDER OFFER

1. TERMS OF THE OFFER.

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (including, if
the Offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of such extension or
amendment), the Purchaser will accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly
tendered prior to the Expiration Date and not properly withdrawn as permitted
under Section 4. The term "Expiration Date" means 12:00 midnight, New York City
time, on October 26, 2001, unless the Purchaser, in accordance with the Merger
Agreement, extends the period during which the Offer is open, in which event the
term "Expiration Date" means the latest time and date on which the Offer, as so
extended, expires.

     The Offer is conditioned upon the satisfaction of the Minimum Stock
Condition, the Minimum Note Condition and the other conditions set forth in
Section 15. The Purchaser may waive any or all of the conditions to its
obligation to purchase Shares pursuant to the Offer (other than the Minimum
Stock Condition). If by the initial Expiration Date or any subsequent Expiration
Date any or all of the conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied or
waived, subject to the provisions of the Merger Agreement, the Purchaser may
elect to (1) terminate the Offer and return all tendered Shares to tendering
stockholders, (2) waive all of the unsatisfied conditions (other than the
Minimum Stock Condition) and, subject to any required extension, purchase all
Shares validly tendered by the Expiration Date and not properly withdrawn or (3)
extend the Offer and, subject to the right of stockholders to withdraw Shares
until the new Expiration Date, retain the Shares that have been tendered until
the expiration of the Offer as extended.

     Without the consent of the Company, the Purchaser will not make any change
that (1) changes the form or amount of consideration to be paid in the Offer
(other than by adding consideration), (2) imposes conditions to the Offer in
addition to the conditions to the Offer set forth in Section 15, (3) changes or
waives the Minimum Stock Condition or (4) amends any other term of the Offer in
a manner materially adverse to the holders of Shares.

     Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Purchaser may, without
the consent of the Company, extend the Offer beyond the scheduled Expiration
Date if any of the conditions to the Purchaser's obligation to accept for
payment and to pay for the Shares shall not be satisfied or, to the extent
permitted by the Merger Agreement, waived. The Purchaser, however, may not
extend the Offer beyond December 28, 2001, without the consent of the Company,
except that Parent may extend the Expiration Date after December 28, 2001 as
required to comply with any rule, regulation or interpretation of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Pursuant to Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange
Act, the Purchaser may, subject to certain conditions, provide a subsequent
offering period following the expiration of the Offer on the Expiration Date (a
"Subsequent Offering Period"). A Subsequent Offering Period is an additional
period of time from three business days to 20 business days in length, beginning
after the Purchaser purchases Shares tendered in the Offer, during which
stockholders may tender, but not withdraw, their Shares and receive the Offer
Price. Pursuant to Rule 14d-7 under the Exchange Act, no withdrawal rights apply
to Shares tendered during a Subsequent Offering Period and no withdrawal rights
apply during the Subsequent Offering Period with respect to Shares tendered in
the Offer and accepted for payment. During a Subsequent Offering Period, the
Purchaser will promptly purchase and pay for any Shares tendered at the same
price paid in the Offer.

     Subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the
provisions of the Merger Agreement, the Purchaser also expressly reserves the
right, in its sole discretion, at any time or from time to time, (1) to
terminate the Offer if any of the conditions set forth in Section 15 has not
been satisfied and (2) to waive any condition to the Offer (other than the
Minimum Stock Condition) or otherwise amend the Offer in any respect, in each
case by giving oral or written notice of such extension, termination or waiver
or amendment to the Depositary and by making a public announcement thereof. If
the Purchaser accepts for payment any Shares pursuant to the Offer, it will
accept for purchase all Shares validly tendered prior to the Expiration Date and
not properly withdrawn, and will promptly purchase all Shares so accepted for
payment.

     The rights reserved by the Purchaser by the preceding paragraph are in
addition to the Purchaser's rights pursuant to Section 15. Any extension, delay,
termination, waiver or amendment will be followed as promptly as practicable by
public announcement thereof, such announcement in the case of an extension to be
made no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after
the previously scheduled Expiration Date, in accordance with the public
announcement requirements of Rule 14e-1(d) under the Exchange Act. Subject to
applicable law (including Rules 14d-4(d) and 14d-6(c) under the Exchange Act,
which require that material changes be promptly disseminated to stockholders in
a manner reasonably designed to inform them of such changes) and without
limiting the manner in which the Purchaser may choose to make any public
announcement, the Purchaser shall have no obligation to publish, advertise or
otherwise communicate any such public announcement other than by issuing a press
release to the Dow Jones News Service.

     If the Purchaser extends the Offer or if the Purchaser is delayed in its
acceptance for payment of or payment for Shares or it is unable to pay for
Shares pursuant to the Offer for any reason, then, without prejudice to the
Purchaser's rights under the Offer, the Depositary may retain tendered Shares on
behalf of the Purchaser, and such Shares may not be withdrawn except to the
extent tendering stockholders are entitled to withdrawal rights as described
herein under Section 4. However, the ability of the Purchaser to delay the
payment for Shares that the Purchaser has accepted for payment is limited by
Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, which requires that a bidder pay the
consideration offered or return the securities deposited by or on behalf of
stockholders promptly after the termination or withdrawal of such bidder's
offer, unless such bidder elects to offer a Subsequent Offering Period and pays
for Shares tendered during the Subsequent Offering Period in accordance with
Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act.

     If the Purchaser makes a material change in the terms of the Offer or the
information concerning the Offer, or if it waives a material condition of the
Offer, the Purchaser will disseminate additional tender offer materials and
extend the Offer to the extent required by Rules 14d-4(d) and 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act. The minimum period during which an offer must remain open
following material changes in the terms of the Offer, other than a change in
price, percentage of securities sought or inclusion of or changes to a
soliciting fee, will depend upon the facts and circumstances, including the
materiality, of the changes. In the SEC's view, an offer should remain open for
a minimum of five business days from the date the material change is first
published, sent or given to stockholders, and, if material changes are made with
respect to information that approaches the significance of price and share
levels, a minimum of ten (10) business days may be required to allow for
adequate dissemination to stockholders. Accordingly, if, prior to the Expiration
Date, the Purchaser decreases the number of Shares being sought or increases the
consideration offered pursuant to the Offer, and if the Offer is scheduled to
expire at any time earlier than the tenth business day from the date that notice
of such increase or decrease is first published, sent or given to stockholders,
the Offer will be extended at least until the expiration of such tenth business
day.

     The Company has provided the Purchaser with a list of the stockholders of
the Company and security position listings for the purpose of disseminating the
Offer to holders of Shares. This Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of
Transmittal will be mailed to record holders of Shares whose names appear on the
Company's stockholder list and will be furnished, for subsequent transmittal to
beneficial owners of Shares, to brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust
companies and similar persons whose names, or the names of whose nominees,
appear on the stockholder list or, if applicable, who are listed as participants
in a clearing agency's security position listing.

2. ACCEPTANCE FOR PAYMENT AND PAYMENT FOR SHARES.

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (including, if
the Offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any such extension
or amendment) and the satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions to the Offer
set forth in Section 15, the Purchaser will accept for payment and will pay for,
as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date, all Shares validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn on or prior to the Expiration Date. Subject to the
Merger Agreement and compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, the
Purchaser expressly reserves the right to delay acceptance for payment of Shares
in order to comply in whole or in part with any applicable law. See Section 16.

     In all cases, payment for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer
will be made only after timely receipt by the Depositary of (1) the certificates
evidencing such Shares (the "Share Certificates") or timely confirmation (a
"Book-Entry Confirmation") of a book-entry transfer of such Shares into the
Depositary's account at The Depository Trust Company (the "Book-Entry Transfer
Facility") pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 3, (2) the Letter of
Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with
any required signature guarantees or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an
Agent's Message (as defined below) in lieu of the Letter of Transmittal and (3)
any other documents required under the Letter of Transmittal.

     For purposes of the Offer, the Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted
for payment, and thereby purchased, Shares validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn as, if and when the Purchaser gives oral or written notice to the
Depositary of the Purchaser's acceptance for payment of such Shares pursuant to
the Offer. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, payment
for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made by deposit of
the Offer Price therefor with the Depositary, which will act as agent for
tendering stockholders for the purpose of receiving payments from the Purchaser
and transmitting such payments to tendering stockholders whose Shares have been
accepted for payment. If, for any reason whatsoever, acceptance for payment of
any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer is delayed, or Purchaser is unable to
accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, then, without
prejudice to the Purchaser's rights under Section 1 hereof, the Depositary may,
nevertheless, on behalf of the Purchaser, retain tendered shares, and such
Shares may not be withdrawn, except to the extent that the tendering
stockholders are entitled to withdrawal rights as described in Section 4 and as
otherwise required by Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act.

     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL INTEREST ON THE OFFER PRICE FOR SHARES BE PAID,
REGARDLESS OF ANY DELAY IN MAKING SUCH PAYMENT.

     If any tendered Shares are not accepted for payment for any reason pursuant
to the terms and conditions of the Offer, or if Share Certificates are submitted
evidencing more Shares than are tendered, Share Certificates evidencing
unpurchased Shares will be returned, without expense to the tendering
stockholder (or, in the case of Shares tendered by book-entry transfer into the
Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility pursuant to the
procedure set forth in Section 3, such Shares will be credited to an account
maintained at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility), as promptly as practicable
following the expiration or termination of the Offer.

     The Purchaser reserves the right to transfer or assign, in whole or from
time to time in part, to one or more of its affiliates, the right to purchase
all or any portion of the Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, but any such
transfer or assignment will not relieve the Purchaser of its obligations under
the Offer and will in no way prejudice the rights of tendering stockholders to
receive payment for Shares validly tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to
the Offer.

3. PROCEDURES FOR TENDERING SHARES.

     Valid Tenders.  In order for a stockholder validly to tender Shares
pursuant to the Offer, either (1) the Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile
thereof), properly completed and duly executed, together with any required
signature guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's
Message in lieu of the Letter of Transmittal) and any other documents required
by the Letter of Transmittal must be

received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover
of this Offer to Purchase and either the Share Certificates evidencing tendered
Shares must be received by the Depositary at such address or such Shares must be
tendered pursuant to the procedure for book-entry transfer described below and a
Book-Entry Confirmation must be received by the Depositary, in each case prior
to the Expiration Date, or (2) the tendering stockholder must comply with the
guaranteed delivery procedures described below.

     The term "Agent's Message" means a message, transmitted by the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility to, and received by, the Depositary and forming a part of a
Book-Entry Confirmation, that states that the Book-Entry Transfer Facility has
received an express acknowledgment from the participant in the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility tendering the Shares that are the subject of such Book-Entry
Confirmation, that such participant has received and agrees to be bound by the
terms of the Letter of Transmittal and that Purchaser may enforce such agreement
against such participant.

     Book-Entry Transfer.  The Depositary will establish an account with respect
to the Shares at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility for purposes of the Offer
within two business days after the date of this Offer. Any financial institution
that is a participant in the system of the Book-Entry Transfer Facility may make
a book-entry delivery of Shares by causing the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to
transfer such Shares into the Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer
Facility in accordance with the Book-Entry Transfer Facility's procedures for
such transfer. However, although delivery of Shares may be effected through
book-entry transfer at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility, either the Letter of
Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed,
together with any required signature guarantees, or an Agent's Message in lieu
of the Letter of Transmittal, and any other required documents, must, in any
case, be received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the
back cover of this Offer to Purchase prior to the Expiration Date, or the
tendering stockholder must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedure
described below.

     DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY DOES NOT
CONSTITUTE DELIVERY TO THE DEPOSITARY.

     Signature Guarantees.  No signature guarantee is required on the Letter of
Transmittal (1) if the Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder
of the Shares tendered therewith, unless such holder has completed either the
box entitled "Special Delivery Instructions" or the box entitled "Special
Payment Instructions" on the Letter of Transmittal or (2) if the Shares are
tendered for the account of a firm which is participating in the Security
Transfer Agents Medallion Program, the New York Stock Exchange Medallion
Signature Guarantee Program or the Stock Exchange Medallion Program (each an
"Eligible Institution" and collectively "Eligible Institutions"). In all other
cases, all signatures on a Letter of Transmittal must be guaranteed by an
Eligible Institution. See Instruction 1 of the Letter of Transmittal. If a Share
Certificate is registered in the name of a person or persons other than the
signer of the Letter of Transmittal, or if payment is to be made or delivered
to, or a Share Certificate not accepted for payment or not tendered is to be
issued, in the name of a person other than the registered holder(s), then the
Share Certificate must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate duly executed
stock powers, in either case signed exactly as the name(s) of the registered
holder(s) appear on the Share Certificate, with the signature(s) on such Share
Certificate or stock powers guaranteed by an Eligible Institution as provided in
the Letter of Transmittal. See Instructions 1 and 5 of the Letter of
Transmittal.

     Guaranteed Delivery.  If a stockholder desires to tender Shares pursuant to
the Offer and the Share Certificates evidencing such stockholder's Shares are
not immediately available or such stockholder cannot deliver the Share
Certificates and all other required documents to the Depositary prior to the
Expiration

Date, or such stockholder cannot complete the procedures for delivery by
book-entry transfer on a timely basis, such Shares may nevertheless be tendered;
provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied:

          (1) such tender is made by or through an Eligible Institution;

          (2) a properly completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed
     Delivery, substantially in the form made available by Purchaser, is
     received prior to the Expiration Date by the Depositary as provided below;
     and

          (3) the Share Certificates (or a Book-Entry Confirmation) evidencing
     all tendered Shares, in proper form for transfer, in each case together
     with the Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly completed
     and duly executed, with any required signature guarantees (or, in the case
     of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message), and any other documents
     required by the Letter of Transmittal are received by the Depositary within
     three New York Stock Exchange trading days after the date of execution of
     such Notice of Guaranteed Delivery.

     The Notice of Guaranteed Delivery may be delivered by hand, mail or
facsimile transmission to the Depositary and must include a guarantee by an
Eligible Institution in the form set forth in the form of Notice of Guaranteed
Delivery made available by Purchaser.

     In all cases, Shares shall not be deemed validly tendered unless a properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof) (or,
in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message in lieu of the Letter
of Transmittal) is received by the Depositary.

     THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF SHARE CERTIFICATES, THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND
ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER
FACILITY, IS AT THE OPTION AND RISK OF THE TENDERING STOCKHOLDER, AND THE
DELIVERY WILL BE DEEMED MADE ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY
(INCLUDING, IN THE CASE OF A BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER, A BOOK-ENTRY CONFIRMATION). IF
DELIVERY IS BY MAIL, REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, PROPERLY
INSURED, IS RECOMMENDED. IN ALL CASES, SUFFICIENT TIME SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO
ENSURE TIMELY RECEIPT.

     Determination of Validity.  All questions as to the validity, form,
eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance for payment of any tender
of Shares will be determined by the Purchaser, in its sole discretion, which
determination shall be final and binding on all parties. The Purchaser reserves
the absolute right to reject any and all tenders determined by it not to be in
proper form or the acceptance for payment of which may, in the opinion of its
counsel, be unlawful. The Purchaser also reserves the absolute right to waive
any defect or irregularity in the tender of any Shares of any particular
stockholder, whether or not similar defects or irregularities are waived in the
case of other stockholders. No tender of Shares will be deemed to have been
validly made until all defects and irregularities have been cured or waived to
the satisfaction of the Purchaser. None of Parent, the Purchaser, the
Depositary, the Information Agent or any other person will be under any duty to
give notification of any defects or irregularities in tenders or incur any
liability for failure to give any such notification. The Purchaser's
interpretation of the terms and conditions of the Offer (including the Letter of
Transmittal and the instructions thereto) will be final and binding.

     Other Requirements.  By executing the Letter of Transmittal as set forth
above, a tendering stockholder irrevocably appoints designees of the Purchaser
as such stockholder's proxies, each with full power of substitution, in the
manner set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, to the full extent of such
stockholder's rights with respect to the Shares tendered by such stockholder and
accepted for payment by the Purchaser (including, with respect to any and all
other Shares or other securities issued or issuable in respect of such Shares on
or after the date of this Offer). All such proxies shall be considered coupled
with an interest in the tendered Shares. Such appointment will be effective
when, and only to the extent that, the Purchaser accepts such Shares for
payment. Upon such acceptance for payment, all prior proxies given by such
stockholder with respect to such Shares (or such other Shares or securities)
will be revoked without further action, and no subsequent proxies may be given
nor any subsequent written consent executed by such stockholder (and, if given
or executed, will not be deemed to be effective) with respect thereto. The
designees of the Purchaser will, with respect to the Shares and other securities
for which the

appointment is effective, be empowered to exercise all voting and other rights
of such stockholder as they in their sole discretion may deem proper at any
annual or special meeting of the Company's stockholders or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, by written consent in lieu of any such meeting or
otherwise. The Purchaser reserves the right to require that, in order for Shares
to be deemed validly tendered, immediately upon the Purchaser's payment for such
Shares, the Purchaser must be able to exercise full voting rights with respect
to such Shares.

     The tender of Shares pursuant to any one of the procedures described above
will constitute the tendering stockholder's acceptance of the Offer, as well as
the tendering stockholder's representation and warranty that such stockholder
has the full power and authority to tender and assign the Shares tendered, as
specified in the Letter of Transmittal. The Purchaser's acceptance for payment
of Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer will constitute a binding agreement
between the tendering stockholder and the Purchaser upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of the Offer.

     Backup Withholding.  In order to avoid "backup withholding" of U.S. federal
income tax on payments of cash pursuant to the Offer, a stockholder tendering
Shares in the Offer must, unless an exemption applies, provide the Depositary
with such stockholder's correct taxpayer identification number ("TIN") on a
Substitute Form W-9 and certify under penalties of perjury that such TIN is
correct and that such stockholder is not subject to backup withholding. If a
stockholder does not provide such stockholder's correct TIN or fails to provide
the certifications described above, the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") may
impose a penalty on such stockholder and payment of cash to such stockholder
pursuant to the Offer may be subject to backup withholding at a rate equal to
the fourth lowest rate applicable to ordinary income of unmarried individuals
(for payments made after August 6, 2001 and before January 1, 2002, the backup
withholding rate is 30.5%). All stockholders surrendering Shares pursuant to the
Offer should complete and sign the main signature form and the Substitute Form
W-9 included as part of the Letter of Transmittal to provide the information and
certification necessary to avoid backup withholding (unless an applicable
exemption exists and is proved in a manner satisfactory to the Purchaser and the
Depositary). Certain stockholders (including, among others, all corporations and
certain foreign individuals and entities) are not subject to backup withholding.
Noncorporate foreign stockholders should complete and sign the main signature
form and a Form W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for
United States Tax Withholding, a copy of which may be obtained from the
Depositary, in order to avoid backup withholding. See Instruction 9 to the
Letter of Transmittal.

4. WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS.

     Tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable, except that
such Shares may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Expiration Date and,
unless theretofore accepted for payment by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer,
may also be withdrawn at any time after Monday, November 26, 2001 (or such later
date as may apply if the Offer is extended). However, Shares tendered in any
Subsequent Offering Period may not be withdrawn.

     For a withdrawal to be effective, a written, telegraphic or facsimile
transmission notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the Depositary at
one of its addresses set forth on the back cover page of this Offer to Purchase.
Any such notice of withdrawal must specify the name, address and TIN of the
person who tendered the Shares to be withdrawn, the number of Shares to be
withdrawn and the name of the registered holder of such Shares, if different
from that of the person who tendered such Shares. If Share Certificates
evidencing Shares to be withdrawn have been delivered or otherwise identified to
the Depositary, then, prior to the physical release of such Share Certificates,
the serial numbers shown on such Share Certificates must be submitted to the
Depositary and the signature(s) on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed
by an Eligible Institution, unless such Shares have been tendered for the
account of an Eligible Institution. If Shares have been tendered pursuant to the
procedure for book-entry transfer as set forth in Section 3 hereof, any notice
of withdrawal must specify the name and number of the account at the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility to be credited with the withdrawn Shares.

     If the Purchaser extends the Offer, is delayed in its acceptance for
payment of the Shares or is unable to accept Shares for payment pursuant to the
Offer for any reason, then, without prejudice to the Purchaser's rights under
the Offer, the Depositary may, nevertheless, on behalf of the Purchaser, retain
tendered Shares, and such Shares may not be withdrawn except to the extent that
tendering stockholders are entitled to withdrawal rights as described herein.

     All questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of
any notice of withdrawal will be determined by the Purchaser, in its sole
discretion, whose determination will be final and binding. None of Parent, the
Purchaser, the Depositary, the Information Agent or any other person will be
under duty to give notification of any defects or irregularities in any notice
of withdrawal or incur any liability for failure to give any such notification.

     Withdrawals of Shares may not be rescinded. Any Shares properly withdrawn
will thereafter be deemed not to have been validly tendered for purposes of the
Offer. However, withdrawn Shares may be re-tendered at any time prior to the
Expiration Date by following one of the procedures described in Section 3
hereof.

     No withdrawal rights will apply to Shares tendered during any Subsequent
Offering Period and no withdrawal rights apply during the Subsequent Offering
period with respect to Shares tendered in the Offer and accepted for payment.
See Section 1.

5. CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS.

     The receipt of cash pursuant to the Offer or the Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and may also be a taxable transaction under
applicable state, local or foreign income or other tax laws. Generally, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, a tendering stockholder will recognize gain or loss
equal to the difference between the amount of cash received by the stockholder
pursuant to the Offer or the Merger and the stockholder's aggregate adjusted tax
basis in the Shares tendered by the stockholder and purchased pursuant to the
Offer or converted into cash in the Merger, as the case may be. Gain or loss
will be calculated separately for each block of Shares tendered and purchased
pursuant to the Offer or converted into cash in the Merger, as the case may be.

     If tendered Shares are held by a tendering stockholder as capital assets,
gain or loss recognized by such stockholder will be capital gain or loss, which
will be long-term capital gain or loss if such stockholder's holding period for
the Shares exceeds one year. In the case of a tendering noncorporate
shareholder, long-term capital gains will be eligible for a maximum U.S. federal
income tax rate of 20%. In addition, there are limits on the deductibility of
capital losses.

     A stockholder (other than certain exempt stockholders including, among
others, all corporations and certain foreign individuals) that tenders Shares
may be subject to backup withholding at a rate equal to the fourth lowest rate
applicable to ordinary income of unmarried individuals (for payments made after
August 6, 2001 and before January 1, 2002, the backup withholding rate is 30.5%)
unless the stockholder provides its TIN and certifies under penalties of perjury
that such TIN is correct (or properly certifies that it is awaiting a TIN) and
certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise
complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. A
stockholder that does not furnish a required TIN or that does not otherwise
establish a basis for an exemption from backup withholding may be subject to a
penalty imposed by the IRS. See "Backup Withholding" under Section 3. Each
stockholder should complete and sign the Substitute Form W-9 included as part of
the Letter of Transmittal so as to provide the information and certification
necessary to avoid backup withholding.

     If backup withholding applies to a stockholder, the Depositary is required
to withhold on payments made to such stockholder at a rate equal to the fourth
lowest rate applicable to ordinary income of unmarried individuals (for payments
made after August 6, 2001 and before January 1, 2002, the backup withholding
rate is 30.5%). Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount
of the backup withholding can be credited against the U.S. federal income tax
liability of the person subject to the

backup withholding, provided that the required information is given to the IRS.
If backup withholding results in an overpayment of tax, a refund can be obtained
by the stockholder by filing a U.S. federal income tax return.

     The foregoing discussion is based on the Code, regulations issued
thereunder, judicial decisions and administrative rulings, all of which are
subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion does not
address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to
particular stockholders in light of their individual circumstances or to
stockholders who are subject to special rules, such as: non-U.S. persons;
financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; insurance companies; dealers
or brokers in securities or currencies; stockholders who acquired their shares
upon the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation; or
stockholders who hold their shares as part of a hedge, straddle, synthetic
security, conversion transaction, integrated investment or other risk-reduction
transaction.

     THE SUMMARY OF TAX CONSEQUENCES SET FORTH ABOVE IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION
ONLY AND IS BASED ON THE LAW IN EFFECT ON THE DATE HEREOF. STOCKHOLDERS ARE
URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS TO DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR TAX
CONSEQUENCES TO THEM (INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF ANY STATE, LOCAL,
OR FOREIGN INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS) OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER.

funds provided by future operations, and to refinance any outstanding borrowings
on or prior to the maturity date. While Parent has no specific arrangements in
this regard at this time, Parent currently expects that it will be able to
obtain any refinancing on commercially reasonable terms at the time.

10. BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER; PAST CONTACTS OR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE COMPANY.

     During January 2000, financial advisors of the Company contacted Parent's
management and others regarding the Company's desire to present financial
information to Parent and others to ascertain interest in a potential
transaction involving the Company.

     On January 19, 2000, Parent entered into a confidentiality agreement with
the Company. In such agreement Parent agreed not to, and not to encourage or
assist others to, for a period of two years, (1) acquire any voting securities
or assets of the Company, (2) propose any form of business combination or
similar transaction relating to the Company, (3) participate in any proxy
solicitation of the Company's voting securities, (4) participate in a group with
respect to the Company's voting securities, (5) discuss with third parties any
of the foregoing, (6) disclose any intention or plan inconsistent with the
foregoing, (7) seek control of the management, board of directors or policies of
the Company or (8) request the Company to amend such provisions in the
confidentiality agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company. The
agreement provides for such standstill provisions to terminate upon the earlier
of (a) the execution of an agreement by the Company providing for a sale of all
or substantially all of the Company's assets or a combination of the Company
with another entity other than one in which the stockholders of the Company
immediately before such combination hold immediately after the combination, at
least 51% of the voting securities of the combined entity or (b) any group shall
have commenced a tender or exchange offer intending to acquire 51% or more of
the Company's capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors or
acquired or announced an intention to acquire such a controlling interest.

     After execution of the confidentiality agreement, the Company provided
certain information to Parent. Following review of that information, Parent
determined that the expected enterprise value of the Company and any potential
offer by Parent to enter into a transaction with the Company would not be
sufficient to satisfy the Company's debtholders' and equityholders'
expectations. Parent elected not to enter into negotiations for a transaction at
that time and returned the material received by Parent to the Company.

     Between March 2000 and November 2000, Kenneth Jastrow, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of Parent, and Marvin A. Pomerantz, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of the Company, engaged in occasional preliminary discussions
about a possible transaction between Parent and the Company.

     On November 7, 2000, representatives of Salomon Smith Barney met with
senior management of Parent to discuss the attractiveness and viability of
Parent acquiring the Company.

     On November 13, 2000, Salomon Smith Barney sent follow-up information to
Parent's senior management.

Iowa, to discuss the initial concept for structuring a transaction.

     On December 8, 2000, Parent's Board of Directors met by telephone, and
Salomon Smith Barney presented information regarding the value, timing and
structure of a proposed transaction. Parent's Board of Directors authorized the
officers of Parent to further pursue the transaction, to continue negotiations
and to conduct appropriate due diligence.

     On December 15, 2000, Mr. Jastrow met with Mr. Pomerantz and Daniel P.
Casey, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, in Chicago at
which meeting Mr. Jastrow delivered a letter dated December 14, 2000 to Mr.
Pomerantz to propose a business combination in which Parent would acquire all of
the outstanding stock of the Company. The proposal also contemplated the
retirement of the Company's debt.

     On December 20, 2000, Parent executed an engagement letter with Salomon
Smith Barney to advise Parent in connection with the possible acquisition of the
Company. Later that day, the Company's and Parent's financial advisors met by
conference call to review the value, timing and structure of the transaction.

     On December 28, 2000, and on January 5, 2001, Parent's financial advisors
sent letters to Mr. Pomerantz with additional information regarding market
conditions, additional back-up information and additional information addressing
open issues.

transaction proposed by Parent. The Company's senior management and financial

diligence and met with representatives to discuss the potential transaction and
outline further due diligence requirements.

     On March 13, 2001, the Company executed an engagement letter with Deutsche

exploration of strategic alternatives. This letter superceded the Company's
prior engagement letter with Deutsche Banc dated December 9, 1999.

     On March 19, 2001, representatives of Parent performed further due
diligence review of information assembled by the Company.

     On March 27, 2001, the Company executed an engagement letter with
Rothschild pursuant to which Rothschild would serve as co-financial advisor for
the purpose of rendering financial advice to the Company in connection with a
possible strategic transaction. This letter superceded the Company's prior
engagement letter with Rothschild dated March 27, 2000.

     On March 29, 2001, Mr. Jastrow and Mr. Pomerantz met by phone, and Mr.
Jastrow advised that based on concerns about the Company's chemical release
litigation, Parent did not desire to proceed further at that time with
negotiations of a possible transaction on terms previously discussed.

     On May 1, 2001, Mr. Jastrow met with Mr. Pomerantz in Burnet, Texas to
continue to discuss a possible transaction between Parent and the Company.

     On May 4, 2001, a meeting of Parent's Board of Directors was held at which

findings and Mr. Casey updated Mr. Warner on the status of the Company's

the Company's financial advisors indicated to the Board that Parent had renewed

to the transaction and other related matters, the Board directed management to
continue to pursue Parent's transaction proposal.

     On June 6, 2001, at a regular meeting of the Company's Board of Directors,
Mr. Pomerantz reviewed the status of the negotiations with Parent.

     On June 7, 2001, Messrs. Jastrow and Warner met with Messrs. Pomerantz and
Casey in Des Moines, Iowa to discuss the pricing and timing of a potential
transaction.

     On June 13, 2001, Messrs. Jastrow and Warner met with Messrs. Pomerantz and
Casey in Des Moines, Iowa to further discuss a potential transaction.

     On June 15, 2001, at a special meeting of the Company's Board of Directors,
the Board was updated on the negotiations with Parent. Mr. Pomerantz reported
that management had met recently with Parent's

representatives and that Parent was currently proposing simultaneous equity and
debt tender offers, each contingent upon the success of the other, in which
Parent would offer a combination of cash and Parent stock for all of the
Company's outstanding stock. The Board then discussed the terms, structure and
value of the new proposed transaction and other related matters. The Company's

     On September 7, 2001, the Company's Board of Directors held a special
meeting at which it considered the proposed financial terms and conditions of
the Offer and the Merger. At that meeting, the Company's legal advisors again
reviewed the directors' fiduciary duties in considering the proposed transaction
and the principal terms and conditions of the proposed transaction, including
the principal terms and conditions of the proposed Merger Agreement and the
amendment to the Rights Agreement. Members of the Company's management reviewed
with the Board the Company's business, market conditions and prospects. The
Company's financial advisors further updated and advised the Board on financial
valuation matters and each of Deutsche Banc and Rothschild provided its oral
opinion (subsequently confirmed in writing) to the Board that, as of the date of
such opinion and subject to the assumptions made, matters considered and
limitations on the review undertaken set forth in its written opinion, the $1.80
in cash per Share to be received by the stockholders in the Offer and the Merger
was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The Board then
discussed the presentations and the drafts of the various documents it had
received at this and other Board meetings and further discussed the terms and
conditions of other business combinations in the Company's industry deemed
relevant, the scope and history of the Company's negotiations with Parent and
certain other matters. The Board then declared that the Offer and Merger were
fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company's stockholders, unanimously
adopted, approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger and the amendment to the Rights Agreement and unanimously resolved to
recommend that the stockholders of the Company accept the offer and tender their
Shares. The Board then formed the Subcommittee, consisting of Messrs. Pomerantz
and Casey, and delegated to the Subcommittee the authority to approve any final
changes to the Merger Agreement and related documents.

     On September 27, 2001, the Company's Subcommittee of the Board acted by
unanimous written consent and approved the changes and modifications to the
form, terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement and related documents
occurring since September 7, 2001.

     On September 27, 2001, Parent's Board of Directors acted by unanimous
written consent and declared that the Offer and Merger were fair to, and in the
best interests of, Parent and its stockholders and unanimously adopted, approved
and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Offer, the Merger, and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

     On September 27, 2001, the Merger Agreement was executed by Parent, the
Purchaser and the Company.

     On September 27, 2001, Parent and the Company issued a joint press release
announcing the transaction.

     On September 28, 2001, the Purchaser commenced the Offer.

     During the Offer, Parent and the Purchaser intend to have ongoing contacts
with the Company and its directors, officers and stockholders.

11. THE MERGER AGREEMENT; OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.

  The Merger Agreement

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Merger
Agreement, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to the Tender Offer Statement
on Schedule TO filed by Parent and the Purchaser pursuant to Rule 14d-3 of the
General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act with the SEC in connection
with the Offer (the "Schedule TO"). The summary is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the Merger Agreement, which is incorporated by reference herein.

     The Offer.  The Merger Agreement provides for the making of the Offer. The
obligation of the Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the Minimum
Stock Condition, the Minimum Note Condition, the HSR Condition and certain other
conditions that are described in Section 15.

     The Notes Tender Offers.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of the Merger Agreement, but in no event
later than five business days after the first public announcement of the
execution thereof, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Merger Agreement, Parent or its designee will commence the Notes Tender Offers.
In connection with such Notes Tender Offers, Parent intends to solicit consents
to amend, eliminate or waive certain sections of the Indenture relating to the
9 3/8% Senior Notes, dated as of February 23, 1998 among the Company, the
guarantors party thereto and State Street Bank and Trust Company, as trustee,
the Indenture relating to the 9 3/4% Senior Notes, dated as of June 12, 1997
among the Company, the guarantors party thereto and Fleet National Bank, as
trustee, and the Indenture relating to the Senior Subordinated Notes, dated as
of February 23, 1998 among the Company, the guarantors party thereto and Chase
Bank of Texas, National Association, as trustee (collectively, the
"Indentures"), as set forth in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation
Statement made by Parent or its designee in connection with the Notes Tender
Offers (as amended from time to time, the "Notes Offer to Purchase").

     Parent's obligation to accept for payment and pay for the Notes and related
consents tendered pursuant to the Notes Tender Offers is subject to the
conditions that (1) the aggregate principal amount of each series of Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Notes Tender
Offers, combined with the Notes already owned by Parent, the Purchaser and their
affiliates, constitutes at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of each
of the 9 3/8% Senior Notes, the 9 3/4% Senior Notes and the Senior Subordinated
Notes outstanding at the expiration of the Notes Tender Offer with respect to
each of such series of Notes, (2) Parent receives consents from at least a
majority of the outstanding principal amount of each series of the Notes and (3)
other conditions (including, without limitation, the Minimum Stock Condition).
See Section 15. The Notes Tender Offers shall be made at an amount in cash set
forth in the Notes Offer to Purchase. In the Merger Agreement, Parent expressly
reserved the right to waive any condition (including without limitation the
Minimum Note Condition), to increase the price payable for each Note and related
consent tendered in the Notes Tender Offers, and to make any other changes in
the terms and conditions of the Notes Tender Offers; provided, however, that,
without the consent of the Company, no change may be made which decreases the
price payable for each Note and related consent tendered in the Notes Tender
Offers, which increases the Minimum Note Condition, which eliminates the Minimum
Stock Condition, which amends or eliminates any section of the Indentures, that
by the terms thereof, requires approval of the holders of 100% of the
outstanding principal amount of the Notes, which otherwise modifies or amends
the conditions to the Notes Tender Offers or any other term of the Notes Tender
Offers in a manner that is materially adverse to the tendering holders of the
Notes, which imposes additional conditions to the Notes Tender Offers, or which
extends the expiration date of the Notes Tender Offers beyond December 28, 2001
(except that Parent may extend the expiration date of the Notes Tender Offers
after December 28, 2001 as required to comply with any rule, regulation or
interpretation of the SEC or to coincide with the termination date of the
Offer); provided, however, that Parent expressly reserved the right, in its sole
discretion, to reduce the minimum percentage of any series of Notes to be
purchased in the Notes Tender Offers. Subject to the terms and conditions of the
Notes Tender Offers (including, without limitation, the Minimum Note Condition),
Parent has agreed to accept for payment and to pay for, as promptly as
practicable after expiration of the Notes Tender Offers, all Notes and related
consents validly tendered and not withdrawn.

     At such time as Parent receives consents from at least a majority of each
series of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, the Company has agreed
to execute, and to cause the guarantors party to the Indentures to execute, and
to use all reasonable efforts to cause the trustees under the Indentures to
execute, supplemental indentures (the "Supplemental Indentures") in order to
give effect to the amendments of the Indentures contemplated in the Notes Tender
Offers documents; provided, however, that notwithstanding the fact that the
Supplemental Indentures will become effective upon such execution,

the proposed amendments set forth therein (the "Proposed Amendments") will not
become operative unless and until the Minimum Note Condition is satisfied or
waived and all other conditions to the Notes Tender Offers set forth in Section
15 have been satisfied or waived by Parent and Parent accepts all Notes (and
related consents) validly tendered for purchase and payment pursuant to the
Notes Tender Offers. In such event, the parties to the Merger Agreement have
agreed that the Proposed Amendments will be deemed operative as of immediately
prior to such acceptance for payment, and Parent will thereafter be obligated to
make all payments for the Notes (and related consents) so tendered.

     Directors.  The Merger Agreement provides that upon the acceptance for
payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer, as a result of which Parent or the
Purchaser beneficially own at least a majority of the outstanding Shares, Parent
shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next
whole number, on the Company Board that equals the product of (1) the total
number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the directors
designated by Parent pursuant to this sentence) and (2) the percentage that the
number of Shares so purchased bears to the total number of Shares then
outstanding. In furtherance thereof, the Company will, upon request of the
Purchaser, use its best efforts promptly either to increase the size of the
Company Board or to secure the resignations of such number of directors, or
both, as is necessary to enable Parent's designees to be elected to the Company
Board and will cause Parent's designees to be elected; provided, however, that
until the Effective Time there will be at least two members of the Company Board
who are directors as of the date of the Merger Agreement and are not employees
of the Company ("Independent Directors"). If the number of Independent Directors
is reduced below two for any reason whatsoever, any remaining Independent
Directors (or Independent Director) shall be entitled to designate persons to
fill the vacancies who will be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes
of the Merger Agreement or, if no Independent Director then remains, the other
directors will designate two persons to fill the vacancies who may not be
stockholders, affiliates, associates or employees of Parent or the Purchaser,
and such persons will be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of the
Merger Agreement. In the event that Parent's designees constitute a majority of
the directors on the Company Board, the affirmative vote of a majority of the
Independent Directors will be required after the acceptance for payment of
Shares pursuant to the Offer and prior to the Effective Time, to (1) amend or
terminate the Merger Agreement by the Company, (2) cause the Company to extend
or waive the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
Parent or the Purchaser under the Merger Agreement, (3) waive any of the
Company's rights under the Merger Agreement, or (4) take any other action under
or in connection with the Merger Agreement if such action materially and
adversely affects holders of Shares other than Parent or the Purchaser;
provided, that if, notwithstanding reasonable efforts set forth above to ensure
that at least two directors are Independent Directors, there are no Independent
Directors, such actions (except for any amendments, modification or waiver of
Sections 2.3 or 8.1 of the Merger Agreement) may be effected by unanimous vote
of the entire Company Board.

     The Merger.  The Merger Agreement provides that as soon as practicable
after the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions to the Merger set
forth therein, at the Effective Time the Purchaser will be merged with and into
the Company. Following the Merger, the separate existence of the Purchaser will
cease, and the Company will continue as the Surviving Corporation, indirectly
wholly-owned by Parent.

     If required by the DGCL, the Company shall call and hold a meeting of its
shareholders (the "Company Shareholders' Meeting") promptly following
consummation of the Offer for the purpose of voting upon the approval of the
Merger Agreement. At any such meeting all outstanding Shares then owned by
Parent or the Purchaser or any subsidiary of Parent will be voted in favor of
approval of the Merger.

     Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each Share outstanding immediately before
the Effective Time (other than Shares owned beneficially or of record by Parent
or any subsidiary of Parent or held in the treasury of the Company, all of which
will be canceled, and other than Shares that are held by shareholders, if any,
who properly exercise their appraisal rights under the DGCL) will be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration except as described below.
Shareholders who perfect their right to appraisal of their Shares under the DGCL
shall be entitled to the amounts determined pursuant to such proceedings. See
Section 12.

     To the extent any of the Company Redeemable Exchangeable Warrants (the
"Warrants") remain unexercised as of the Effective Time, these Warrants will be
exercisable only for that amount of cash that is paid and issued to the Trustee
(designated pursuant to the Trust Agreement between the Company and The Bank of
New York, as successor trustee to Harris Trust and Savings Bank) in payment for
the Shares held by the Trustee immediately theretofore obtainable upon exercise
of such Warrants.

     Representations and Warranties.  The Merger Agreement contains customary
representations and warranties of the parties thereto, including representations
by the Company as to its corporate existence and power, capitalization,
corporate authorizations, subsidiaries, required stockholder vote, SEC filings,
financial statements, absence of undisclosed liabilities, books and records,
inventory, absence of certain changes (including any events having a material
adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), business, assets,
liabilities, prospects or results of operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, excluding effects from general economic
conditions, general securities market conditions or conditions affecting the
Company's industry generally), government authorizations, absence of litigation,
compliance with laws, employee matters, labor matters, environmental matters,
taxes, intellectual property, state takeover laws, material contracts, customers
and suppliers, regulation as a utility, qualifying facility, title to

        forth in Annex I to the Merger Agreement or any of the conditions to the
        Merger set forth in Article IX of the Merger Agreement not being
        satisfied, or that would make any representation or warranty of the
        Company contained in the Merger Agreement inaccurate in any respect at,
        or as of any time prior to, the Effective Time, or that would materially
        impair the ability of the Company, Parent, the Purchaser or the holders
        of Shares to consummate the Offer or the Merger in accordance with the
        terms of the Merger Agreement or materially delay such consummation;

             (13) plan, announce, implement or effect any material reduction in
        labor force, lay-off, early retirement program, severance program or

             (14) enter into an agreement, contract, commitment or arrangement
        to do any of the foregoing, or to authorize, recommend, propose or
        announce an intention to do any of the foregoing; and

          (c) the Company shall take all reasonable actions to obtain judicial
     approval of the Settlement Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement).

     Parent Covenant with Respect to the Purchaser.  Parent agrees that it will
take all action necessary to cause the Purchaser to perform its obligations
under the Merger Agreement (including ensuring that the Purchaser will at the
appropriate times have sufficient funds to consummate the Offer and the Merger)
and to consummate the Offer, the Notes Tender Offers and the Merger on the terms
and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.

     Company Stockholders Meeting; Company Proxy Statement.  The Merger
Agreement provides that, if approval of the Company's stockholders is required
by applicable law in order to consummate the Merger other than pursuant to
Section 253 of the DGCL, the Company shall as promptly as practicable following
the acceptance of Shares pursuant to the Offer (1) duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders
Meeting") for the purpose of considering and taking action upon the Merger
Agreement and the Merger; and (2) prepare and file with the SEC a proxy
statement. Once the Company Stockholders Meeting has been called and noticed,
the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting
(other than for the absence of a quorum) without the consent of Parent.

     In the event that the Purchaser acquires, in the aggregate, at least 90% of
the outstanding Shares in the Offer, or otherwise, Parent, the Purchaser and the
Company shall take all necessary actions to cause

the Merger to be come effective, as soon as practicable after the expiration of
the Offer, without a meeting of stockholders of the Company, in accordance with
Section 253 of the DGCL.

     Access; Confidentiality.  The Company agrees that, subject to applicable
law and upon reasonable request, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
subsidiaries to, afford to Parent, and to its officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisers and other representatives, full access during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all their
respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel (including for
the purpose of interviewing such personnel in connection with the integration
process) and records and their accountants' work papers and, during such period,
the Company shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, furnish promptly
to Parent (1) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal
or state securities laws, (2) a copy of each material tax return, report and
information statement filed by it during such period, and (3) all other
information concerning its business, assets, properties and personnel as Parent
may reasonably request.

     Employee Stock Options and Benefit Plans.  The Merger Agreement contains
several provisions that address existing option plans, options outstanding under
those plans and benefit plans. These provisions are described in detail under
"Employee Stock Options" and "Employee Benefit Arrangements" in Section 13.

     No Solicitation.  The Merger Agreement provides that neither the Company
nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates shall (and the Company shall cause the
officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents of the Company, each
of its subsidiaries and each affiliate of the Company, including, but not
limited to, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, not to), directly or
indirectly, encourage, solicit, participate in or initiate discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any person or group (other
than Parent, any of its affiliates or representatives) concerning any
Acquisition Proposal (defined below), except that nothing in the Merger
Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (1) taking and
disclosing to the Company's stockholders a position with respect to a tender or
exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, or (2) making such disclosure to the Company's
stockholders as, in the good faith judgment of the Board, after receiving advice
from outside counsel, is required under applicable law, provided that the
Company may not, except as permitted by Section 6.4(b) of the Merger Agreement,
withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, the recommendation of the
Company's Board of Directors that the stockholders of the Company accept the
Offer, tender their Shares to the Purchaser and approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement and the Merger (the "Recommendations") or its position with respect to
the Offer or the Merger or approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or enter into any agreement with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal. The Company has agreed to immediately cease any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties previously
conducted with respect to any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to the time of acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer, the
Company may furnish information concerning its business, properties or assets to
any corporation, partnership, person or other entity or group pursuant to
appropriate confidentiality agreements, and may negotiate and participate in
discussions and negotiations with such entity or group concerning an Acquisition
Proposal if:

          (x) such entity or group has on an unsolicited basis submitted a bona
     fide written proposal to the Company Board relating to any such transaction
     which the Company Board determines in good faith, represents a superior
     transaction to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and
     which is not subject to the receipt of any necessary financing; and

          (y) in the opinion of the Company Board such action is required to
     discharge the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable law,
     determined only after receipt of:

             (i) advice from the Company's investment banking firm that the
        Acquisition Proposal is superior, from a financial point of view, to the
        Offer and the Merger (which advice may include analysis of the
        enterprise value if the Company's Board has been advised by independent
        legal counsel that its fiduciary duties requires them to do so), and

             (ii) advice from independent legal counsel to the Company that the
        failure to provide such information or access or to engage in such
        discussions or negotiations would cause the Company Board to violate its
        fiduciary duties under applicable law.

The Company has agreed to promptly, but in any event within one business day,
notify Parent of the existence of any proposal, discussion, negotiation or
inquiry received by the Company, and the Company has agreed to promptly, but in
any event within one business day, communicate to Parent the terms of any
proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry which it may receive (and to
immediately provide to Parent copies of any written materials received by the
Company in connection with such proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry)
and the identity of the party making such proposal or inquiry or engaging in
such discussion or negotiation. The Company has agreed to promptly provide to
Parent any non-public information concerning the Company provided to any other
party which was not previously provided to Parent.

     The Merger Agreement also provides that neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (1) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or the Purchaser, the Recommendations or
the approval by the Company Board or any such committee of the Offer, the Merger
Agreement or the Merger, (2) approve or recommend or propose to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (3) enter into any agreement with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the time of
acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Company Board may
withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of the Offer, the Merger
Agreement or the Merger, approve or recommend a Superior Proposal (as defined
below), or enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, in each
case at any time after the fifth business day following Parent's receipt of
written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board has
received a Superior Proposal which it intends to accept, specifying the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, identifying the person making
such Superior Proposal, but only if the Company shall have caused its financial
and legal advisors to negotiate with Parent to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement as would enable the Company to
proceed with the transactions contemplated therein on such adjusted terms.

     The Merger Agreement defines "Acquisition Proposal" to mean any proposal or
offer to acquire all or a substantial part of the business or properties of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or 15% or more of any capital stock of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, whether by merger, tender offer, exchange
offer, sale of assets or similar transactions involving the Company or any
subsidiary, division or operating or principal business unit of the Company.
"Superior Proposal" means an Acquisition Proposal which satisfies both
subparagraph (x) and subparagraph (y) of the first paragraph of this section.

     Indemnification; Insurance.  The Merger Agreement provides that from and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will indemnify and hold
harmless (including the advancement of expenses to) each present and former
director and officer of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and
Gaylord Container de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (the "Indemnified Parties") for claims
made within six years following the Effective Time for acts or omissions
occurring on or prior to the Effective Time to the extent provided in the
Company's Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws and indemnity agreements in
effect on the date of the Merger Agreement; provided that such indemnification
shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable
law.

     The Merger Agreement further provides that, for not less than four years
from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained, at Parent's
election, either (1) the Company's current directors' and officers' insurance
and indemnification policy to the extent it provides coverage for events
occurring prior to the Effective Time for all Indemnified Parties, (2) a new
policy providing substantially similar coverage, or (3) a "tail" policy on the
Company's existing directors and officers insurance and indemnification policy,
so long as the annual premiums do not exceed 150% of the amount per annum paid
by the Company in its last full fiscal year, or to obtain as much insurance as
can be obtained for the amount of such premiums.

     Conditions to the Merger.  The obligations of Parent, the Purchaser and the
Company to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction of the
following conditions at or prior to the Effective Time:

          (1) if required by the DGCL, the approval of the Merger Agreement and
     the Merger by the stockholders of the Company in accordance with such law;

          (2) the Purchaser shall have purchased all Shares validly tendered and
     not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer;

          (3) the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and any applicable
     foreign antitrust or competition laws and regulations shall have expired or
     been terminated; and

          (4) no judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or
     regulation, entered, enacted, promulgated, enforced or issued by any court
     or other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction or other legal
     restraint or prohibition shall be in effect preventing or prohibiting
     consummation of the Merger.

     Termination.  The Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Effective Time:

          (1) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

          (2) by either Parent or the Company if (a) (i) the Offer shall have
     been terminated or expired without any Shares being purchased pursuant
     thereto, or (ii) the Purchaser has not accepted for payment any Shares
     pursuant to the Offer by December 28, 2001, so long as the terminating
     party is not the cause of the failure of the Offer; (b) any governmental
     entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other
     action (which order, decree, ruling or other action the parties to the
     Merger Agreement shall use their reasonable efforts to lift), which
     permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the acceptance for
     payment of, or payment for, Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger and
     such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and
     non-appealable;

          (3) by the Company (i) in connection with entering into a definitive
     agreement as permitted by the "No Solicitation" section discussed above,
     provided the Company has complied with all provisions of such section,
     including the notice provisions, and that the Company makes simultaneous
     payment to Parent of the termination fee described below, or (ii) if Parent
     or the Purchaser shall have breached in any material respect any of their
     respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
     contained in the Merger Agreement, which breach cannot be or has not been
     cured, in all material respects, within 10 days after the giving of written
     notice of such breach to Parent or the Purchaser, as applicable.

          (4) by Parent (i) if prior to the purchase of Shares by the Purchaser
     pursuant to the Offer, the Company Board shall have withdrawn, modified or
     changed in a manner adverse to Parent or the Purchaser the Recommendations
     or its approval of the Offer, the Merger Agreement or the Merger or shall
     have recommended an Acquisition Proposal or shall have executed an
     agreement in principle or definitive agreement relating to an Acquisition
     Proposal or similar business combination with a person or entity other than
     Parent, the Purchaser or their affiliates; (ii) if prior to the purchase of
     Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Company shall have breached any
     representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the
     Merger Agreement which would give rise to the failure of a condition to the
     Offer described in subsections (f) and (g) of Annex I thereof; (iii) the
     Offer is not commenced within 5 business days after the first public
     announcement of the Merger Agreement because of the failure of any of the
     conditions set forth in Annex I thereof being satisfied; or (iv) there is a
     failure to satisfy the condition set forth in clause (j) of Annex I to the
     Merger Agreement within 20 business days following commencement of the
     Offer.

     If the Merger Agreement is terminated, there shall be no other liability on
the part of Parent, the Purchaser or the Company except liability for fraud or
willful breach of the Merger Agreement prior to the termination thereof and
except for fees payable in connection with termination.

     Fees and Expenses.  Except as otherwise specified below, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby will be paid by the party incurring such expenses.

     In the event that (1) the Company terminates the Merger Agreement as
described in subsection 3(i) above under "Termination" or (2)(x) either the
Company or Parent terminates or abandons the transactions as described in
subsection 2(a) above under "Termination" and prior thereto there shall have
been publicly announced another Acquisition Proposal; or (y) Parent terminates
or abandons the transactions as described in subsection 4(i) or (ii) above under
"Termination"; then the Company shall immediately pay Parent a fee equal to $20
million (the "Termination Fee") plus an amount equal to the actual and
reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Parent and the
Purchaser in connection with the Offer, the Notes Tender Offers, the Merger, the
Merger Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby
up to a maximum amount of $2.5 million in the aggregate (the "Expense
Reimbursement"). The Merger Agreement provides that the Termination Fee and
Expense Reimbursement shall be paid in same day funds concurrently with the
execution of an agreement referred to in subsection 3(i) above under
"Termination" or in the case of clause (2) of this paragraph no later than the
date of consummation of any Acquisition Proposal within 12 months of the
termination of the Merger Agreement; provided, however, if an Acquisition
Proposal is not consummated within 12 months of the termination of the Merger
Agreement, no such payments required by clause (2) above shall be required to be
paid. The Merger Agreement provides that no Termination Fee or Expense
Reimbursement shall be payable if Parent or the Purchaser is in material breach
of its representations, warranties or obligations under the Merger Agreement at
the time its right to terminate the Merger Agreement accrued.

     Amendment.  Prior to the closing date of the Merger, the Merger Agreement
may be amended by written agreement of the parties thereto, by action taken by
their respective Boards of Directors; provided, that after adoption of the
Merger Agreement by stockholders of the Company, there shall be no amendment to
the Merger Agreement that would reduce the amount or change the form of
consideration into which each Share shall be converted upon consummation of the
Merger.

  Stockholders Agreement

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Stockholders
Agreement (the "Stockholders Agreement"), dated as of September 27, 2001, by and
among Parent, the Purchaser and certain stockholders of the Company, a copy of
which is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO. The summary is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the Stockholders Agreement, which is incorporated by
reference herein.

     As a condition and inducement to Parent and the Purchaser's entering into
the Merger Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company (each a "Stockholder")
who own an aggregate of 6,672,480 Shares (excluding Shares subject to options
but including restricted stock that will vest immediately prior to or upon
consummation of the Offer), representing approximately 11.9% of the Shares
outstanding on September 26, 2001, concurrently with the execution and delivery
of the Merger Agreement entered into the Stockholders Agreement. The
Stockholders are each of the Company's directors, Michael J. Keough, Lawrence G.
Rogna, Jeffery B. Park and Mid-America Group, Ltd., an affiliate of Marvin A.
Pomerantz. Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, each of the Stockholders has
agreed to validly tender into the Offer promptly all Shares subject to the
Stockholders Agreement. Each Stockholder agreed not to withdraw his or her
Shares so tendered unless the Offer is terminated or expired. Each of the
Stockholders has granted Parent an irrevocable proxy with respect to the voting
of such Shares in favor of the Merger and against any action or agreement which
would impede, interfere with or prevent the Merger.

     Each of the Stockholders has agreed that, prior to the termination of the
Stockholders Agreement pursuant to its terms, such Stockholder will not (1)
transfer, or consent to the transfer, of any or all of the Shares beneficially
owned by such Stockholder; (2) enter into any contract, option or other
agreement or understanding with respect to any transfer of any or all of the
Shares beneficially owned by such

Stockholder or any interest therein; (3) grant any proxy, power-of-attorney or
other authorization in or with respect to the Shares beneficially owned by such
Stockholder; (4) deposit the Shares beneficially owned by such Stockholder into
a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to
the Shares beneficially owned by such Stockholder or (5) take any other action
that would in any way restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of such
Stockholder's obligations under the Stockholders Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby.

     The Stockholders Agreement, and all rights and obligations of the parties
thereto, shall terminate immediately upon the earlier of (1) the termination of
the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (2) the Effective Time or (3)
the written mutual consent of the parties thereto.

  Stock Option Agreement

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Stock Option
Agreement (the "Option Agreement"), dated as of September 27, 2001, by and
between Parent and the Company, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to the
Schedule TO. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Option
Agreement, which is incorporated by reference herein.

     Pursuant to the Option Agreement, the Company granted to Parent an
irrevocable option (the "Company Option") to purchase up to such number of
newly-issued Shares of Company common stock (the "Company Option Shares") as is
equal to 19.9% of the Shares outstanding on the date of exercise of the option
at a purchase price per Share of $1.80, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in the Option Agreement.

     The Option Agreement provides that, at any time or from time to time prior
to the termination of the Company Option in accordance with the terms of the
Option Agreement, Parent (or its designee) may exercise the Company Option, in
whole or in part, if on or after the date of the Option Agreement, the Purchaser
accepts for payment pursuant to the Offer Shares constituting more than
two-thirds but less than 90% of the Shares then outstanding on a fully diluted
basis and the exercise of the Company Option would result in Parent and its
affiliates holding 90% or more of the Shares outstanding on a fully diluted
basis.

     Parent's obligation to purchase Shares and the Company's obligation to
issue Shares upon any exercise of the Company Option is subject (at its
election) to the conditions that (1) no preliminary or permanent injunction or
other order against the purchase, issuance or delivery of the Shares issued by
any federal, state or foreign court of competent jurisdiction shall be in effect
(and no action or proceeding shall have been commenced or threatened for
purposes of obtaining such an injunction or order) and (2) any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act and any foreign antitrust or competition laws
and regulations shall have expired and (3) there shall have been no material
breach of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the other
party contained in the Option Agreement or the Merger Agreement; provided,
however, that any failure by Parent to purchase Shares, or any failure by the
Company to issue Shares, upon exercise of the Company Option at any closing of
such purchase as a result of the nonsatisfaction of any of such conditions shall
not affect or prejudice Parent's right to purchase such Shares upon the
subsequent satisfaction of such conditions.

     The Option Agreement shall terminate and the Company Option shall expire
upon the earlier of (1) the Effective Time and (2) the termination of the Merger
Agreement.

12. PURPOSE OF THE OFFER; PLANS FOR THE COMPANY.

     Purpose of the Offer.  The purpose of the Offer is to acquire control of,
and the entire equity interest in, the Company. The purpose of the Merger is to
acquire all outstanding Shares not tendered and purchased pursuant to the Offer.
If the Offer is successful, the Purchaser intends to consummate the Merger as
promptly as practicable.

     The Company Board has approved the Merger and adopted the Merger Agreement.
Depending upon the number of Shares purchased by the Purchaser pursuant to the
Offer, the Company Board may be

required to submit the Merger Agreement to the Company's stockholders for
approval at a stockholder's meeting convened for that purpose in accordance with
the DGCL. If stockholder approval is required, the Merger Agreement must be
approved by two-thirds of all votes entitled to be cast at such meeting. If the
Minimum Stock Condition is satisfied, the Purchaser will have sufficient voting
power to approve the Merger Agreement at the stockholders' meeting without the
affirmative vote of any other stockholder.

     If the Purchaser acquires at least 90% of the Shares pursuant to the Offer,
the Merger may be consummated without a stockholders' meeting and without the
approval of the Company's stockholders. The Merger Agreement provides that the
Purchaser will be merged into the Company and that the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Purchaser will be the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation following the Merger.

     Under the DGCL, holders of Shares do not have appraisal rights as a result
of the Offer. In connection with the Merger, however, stockholders of the
Company may have the right to dissent and demand appraisal of their Shares under
the DGCL. Dissenting stockholders who comply with the applicable statutory
procedures under the DGCL will be entitled to receive a judicial determination
of the fair value of their Shares (exclusive of any element of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger) and to receive payment of
such fair value in cash. Any such judicial determination of the fair value of
the Shares could be based upon considerations other than or in addition to the
price per Share paid in the Merger and the market value of the Shares. In
Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated, among other things,
that "proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered
acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should
be considered in an appraisal proceeding. Stockholders should recognize that the
value so determined could be higher or lower than the price per Share paid
pursuant to the Offer or the consideration per Share to be paid in the Merger.
Moreover, the Purchaser may argue in an appraisal proceeding that, for purposes
of such a proceeding, the fair value of the Shares is less than the price paid
in the Offer or the Merger. See Section 17.

     Plans for the Company.  Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement,
promptly upon the purchase of and payment for any Shares by the Purchaser
pursuant to the Offer, Parent currently intends to seek maximum representation
on the Company Board, subject to the provision in the Merger Agreement that if
Shares are purchased pursuant to the Offer, there shall be until the Effective
Time at least two members of the Company Board who are directors as of the date
of the Merger Agreement and not employees of the Company.

     Except as otherwise provided herein, it is expected that, initially
following the Merger, the business and operations of the Company will, except as
set forth in this Offer to Purchase, be continued substantially as they are
currently being conducted. Parent will continue to evaluate the business and
operations of the Company during the pendency of the Offer and after the
consummation of the Offer and the Merger and will take such actions as it deems
appropriate under the circumstances then existing. Parent intends to seek
additional information about the Company during this period. Thereafter, Parent
intends to review such information as part of a comprehensive review of the
Company's business, operations, capitalization and management with a view to
optimizing development of the Company's potential in conjunction with Parent's
business.

     Except as described above or elsewhere in this Offer to Purchase, the
Purchaser and Parent have no present plans or proposals that would relate to or
result in (1) any extraordinary corporate transaction involving the Company or
any of its respective subsidiaries (such as a merger, reorganization,
liquidation, relocation of any operations or sale or other transfer of a
material amount of assets), (2) any sale or transfer of a material amount of
assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (3) any material change in the
Company's capitalization or dividend policy, or (4) any other material change in
the Company's corporate structure or business.

13. CERTAIN EFFECTS OF THE OFFER.

     Market for the Shares.  The purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer will
reduce the number of holders of Shares and the number of Shares that might
otherwise trade publicly, which could adversely affect the liquidity and market
value of the remaining Shares held by stockholders other than the Purchaser. The
Purchaser cannot predict whether the reduction in the number of Shares that
might otherwise trade publicly would have an adverse or beneficial effect on the
market price for, or marketability of, the Shares or whether such reduction
would cause future market prices to be greater or less than the Offer Price.

     Stock Quotation.  Depending upon the number of Shares purchased pursuant to
the Offer, the Shares may no longer meet the standards for continued listing on
the American Stock Exchange. According to the American Stock Exchange's
published guidelines, the American Stock Exchange would consider delisting the
Shares if any one or more of the following conditions should exist: (1) the
number of Shares publicly held is less than 200,000; (2) the total number of
public shareholders is less than 300; or (3) the aggregate market value of
publicly held Shares is less than $1 million. According to representations made
by the Company in the Merger Agreement, as of September 26, 2001, there were
55,971,493 Shares issued and outstanding. Based upon information available to
Parent, as of the date of the Offer there are approximately 545 record holders
of Shares.

     If, as a result of the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise, the Shares no longer meet the requirements of the American Stock
Exchange for continued listing and the listing of the Shares is discontinued,
the market for the Shares could be adversely affected.

     If the American Stock Exchange were to delist the Shares, it is possible
that the Shares would continue to trade on another securities exchange or in the
over-the-counter market and that price or other quotations would be reported by
such exchange or through other sources. The extent of the public market for such
Shares and the availability of such quotations would depend, however, upon such
factors as the number of stockholders and/or the aggregate market value of such
securities remaining at such time, the interest in maintaining a market in the
Shares on the part of securities firms, the possible termination of registration
under the Exchange Act as described below and other factors.

     Margin Regulations.  The Shares are currently "margin securities" under the
Regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
"Federal Reserve Board"), which has the effect, among other things, of allowing
brokers to extend credit on the collateral of the Shares. Depending upon factors
similar to those described above regarding the market for the Shares and stock
quotations, it is possible that, following the Offer, the Shares would no longer
constitute "margin securities" for the purposes of the margin regulations of the
Federal Reserve Board and therefore could no longer be used as collateral for
loans made by brokers.

     Exchange Act Registration.  The Shares are currently registered under the
Exchange Act. Such registration may be terminated upon application of the
Company to the SEC if the Shares are neither listed on a national securities
exchange nor held by 300 or more holders of record. Termination of registration
of the Shares under the Exchange Act would substantially reduce the information
required to be furnished by the Company to its stockholders and to the SEC and
would make certain provisions of the Exchange Act no longer applicable to the
Company, such as the short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16(b) of
the Exchange Act, the requirement of furnishing a proxy statement pursuant to
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with stockholders' meetings and
the related requirement of furnishing an annual report to stockholders and the
requirements of Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act with respect to "going
private" transactions. Furthermore, the ability of "affiliates" of the Company
and persons holding "restricted securities" of the Company to dispose of such
securities pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, may be impaired or eliminated. If registration of the Shares under the
Exchange Act were terminated, the Shares would no longer be "margin securities"
or be eligible for inclusion on the American Stock Exchange. Parent and the
Purchaser currently intend to seek to cause the Company to terminate the
registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as soon after consummation of
the Offer as the requirements for termination of registration are met.

     Employee Stock Options.  The Merger Agreement provides that prior to
consummation of the Offer, the Company shall take all necessary action to: (1)
terminate, effective not later than the Effective Time, all of the Option Plans
(as defined in the Merger Agreement), (2) cancel, effective not later than the
Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted
under the Gaylord Container Corporation 1997 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan and
the Gaylord Container Corporation Outside Director Stock Option Plan, that is
outstanding and unexercised as of such time, (3) cancel, effective not later
than the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock granted under all Option Plans held by certain senior officers of
the Company, including Messrs. Casey, Keough and Rogna, that is outstanding and
unexercised as of such time, and (4) use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain consents of the individual holders to cancel, effective not later than
the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock granted under all Option Plans that is outstanding and unexercised as of
such time and that is not otherwise canceled pursuant to the foregoing clauses
(2) and (3) (it being understood that the failure of the Company to obtain the
consent of any such holder, after a good faith effort, shall not be deemed a
breach of such clause (4)). The Company also agrees to take all action
reasonably necessary to approve the disposition of the Company Options and other
awards so as to exempt such dispositions under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act.

     Employee Benefit Arrangements.  The Merger Agreement provides that during
the period commencing on the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary
thereof, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide employees of
the Company and the Company's subsidiaries who were employees of the Company or
the Company's subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time employee
benefits that are substantially no less favorable in the aggregate than either
those currently provided by the Company and the Company's subsidiaries to such
employees as of the date of the Merger Agreement or those provided from time to
time by Parent and its subsidiaries to their other similarly situated employees;
provided, however, that, during such one-year period, the benefit provided to
any such employee under any tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan in which
the employee participates shall be no less than that determined under the
formula in effect under the Gaylord Container Retirement Plan as in effect on
the date of the Merger Agreement taking into account both (1) the years of
service recognized for such employee under such Retirement Plan as of the
closing date of the Merger and (2) such employee's service with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary of Parent after the closing date of the
Merger during such one-year period; provided, further, that the provisions of
the Merger Agreement described in this section "Employee Benefit Arrangements"
will not restrict Parent's or the Surviving Corporation's ability to change any
benefit plans in the future.

     The Merger Agreement also provides that, to the extent that any benefit
would become payable in respect of consummation of the Offer, under any Benefit
Plan (as defined in the Merger Agreement) required to be disclosed in Section
4.12(m) of the company disclosure schedule delivered by the Company pursuant to
the Merger Agreement, the Company shall, prior to the initial expiration of the
Offer, take all actions necessary: (1) to the extent it may unilaterally do so,
to amend all such Benefit Plans to provide that any benefit that would have been
required to be paid in respect of the Offer will instead become payable in
respect of the Merger, (2) to the extent not amended under the preceding clause
(1), to amend all of its Benefit Plans with respect to certain senior executives
and others such that any benefit that would have been required to be paid in
respect of the Offer will instead become payable in respect of the Merger, (3)
to amend the Company's Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and the phantom
stock grants to the extent such Benefit Plans apply to any individuals other
than the senior executives and other individuals referenced above, such that any
benefit that would have been required to be paid in respect of the Offer will
instead become payable in respect of the Merger, but, with respect to the
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, providing such individuals with a
payment for the time value of money in respect of the period between the Offer
and the Merger using a discount rate based on U.S. treasuries with the most
comparable maturities such that no benefit under that plan has been reduced
(provided that nothing in the Merger Agreement shall prohibit the Company from
continuing to make periodic payments under and in accordance with the
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan to any specified individual who is
receiving such periodic payments as of the date of the Merger Agreement until

such time as such individual's benefit is paid out in full by reason of the
consummation of the Merger), and (4) to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of each affected individual to amend the Company's Management
Incentive Plan and each individual Severance Compensation Agreement (as amended)
with respect to such individual, to the extent it applies to any individuals
other than the senior executives and other individuals referenced above, such
that any benefit that otherwise would have been required to be paid in respect
of the Offer will instead become payable in respect of the Merger (it being
understood that the failure to obtain the consent of any such beneficiary, after
a good faith effort, shall not be deemed a breach of this clause (4)). After the
Appointment Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and prior to the Effective
Date, Parent agrees not to, and to cause the Company not to, terminate the
employment of certain senior officers of the Company, including Messrs.
Pomerantz, Casey, Keough and Rogna, or any individual who consents to the
amendment described in clause (4) above.

     The Merger Agreement also provides that from and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as applicable,
shall honor each Benefit Plan that provides for severance (including without
limitation change of control and termination agreements) in accordance with its
terms (as amended in accordance with the second paragraph of this section
"Employee Benefit Arrangements", if applicable); provided that the provisions of
the Merger Agreement described in this paragraph will not prevent Parent or the
Surviving Corporation from causing such benefit to be amended or terminated in
accordance with its terms.

     The Merger Agreement provides that for purposes of any employee benefit
plan or arrangement maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
subsidiary of Parent, Parent shall recognize (or cause to be recognized) service
with the Company and the Company's subsidiaries and any predecessor entities
(and any other service credited by the Company under similar benefit plans) for
purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate; provided that the retirement
benefit shall be calculated as provided in the first paragraph of this section
"Employee Benefit Arrangements".

     Pomerantz Employment Agreement.  The Company currently has an employment
agreement with Marvin A. Pomerantz, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the
Company. The agreement, originally memorialized by a written agreement dated
June 1, 1997, as amended March 1, 2000, was set to expire in December 2000, but
it has been extended by oral agreement between Mr. Pomerantz and the Company
through December 31, 2001. The agreement provides that if Mr. Pomerantz's
employment is terminated (for any reason other than death, disability or serious
misconduct) or if Mr. Pomerantz resigns for good reason, he will be entitled to
receive his current base salary ($900,000 per annum) through the term of his
employment agreement (December 31, 2001). The employment agreement also provides
for supplemental retirement payments equal to 50% of his average base salary and
bonus for the four highest years of service, less primary Social Security
benefits and any amounts payable under the Company's retirement plan. In the
event of a change in control of the Company, Mr. Pomerantz is entitled to
receive a lump sum payment equal to the actuarial equivalent (on an after-tax
basis) of the supplemental retirement payments he would be entitled to receive
had he retired on the date of the change in control. The purchase by Parent and
the Purchaser of Shares in the Offer would constitute a change in control under
his employment agreement. However, as explained above in the section "Employee
Benefit Arrangements," the Company and Mr. Pomerantz have agreed to amend his
employment agreement so that any benefit that would be paid to Mr. Pomerantz as
a result of the consummation of the Offer will instead become payable upon
consummation of the Merger. Mr. Pomerantz's lump sum payment upon consummation
of the Merger will be approximately $8.0 million.

     Severance Agreements; Management Incentive Plan Payments.  The Company
currently has Severance Compensation Agreements (each, a "Severance Agreement")
with 63 executives, including Daniel P. Casey (Vice Chairman and Chief Financial
Officer), Michael J. Keough (President and Chief Operating Officer) and Lawrence
G. Rogna (Senior Vice President), but excluding Mr. Pomerantz. Each Severance
Agreement provides that if the employment of the executive is terminated (other
than by reason of death, disability, retirement, cause or voluntary resignation)
within 24 months after a change in control of the Company, the executive will
receive (1) a severance payment equal to two times (or three times in the case
of Messrs. Casey, Keough and Rogna) the sum of the executive's annual base
salary plus the

executive's target bonus under the Company's Management Incentive Plan and (2)
certain other benefits for two years (or three years in the case of Messrs.
Casey, Keough and Rogna) including, without limitation, continued life, medical,
dental, disability and accident insurance and outplacement services. The
consummation of the Offer would constitute a change in control under each
Severance Agreement. However, as explained above in the section "Employee
Benefit Arrangements," the Company and certain senior executives, (including
Messrs. Casey, Keough and Rogna) have agreed to amend the Severance Agreements
so that any benefit that would be paid to the executives as a result of the
consummation of the Offer will instead become payable upon consummation of the
Merger, and the Company has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause all other Severance Agreements to be amended in this same way. If all of
these executives were terminated within 24 months after a change in control, the
aggregate amount of severance payments under the Severance Agreements would be
approximately $27.3 million, of which Messrs. Casey, Keough and Rogna would
receive approximately $1.9 million, $1.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively.

     The Company currently maintains a Management Incentive Plan which provides
for variable compensation based upon achievement of certain earnings before
interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") targets by the
Company under which 39 executives participate. Each Severance Agreement provides
that, in the event of a change in control of the Company (as described in the
preceding paragraph of this section "Severance Agreements; Management Incentive
Plan Payments"), the Company's Management Incentive Plan will be terminated and
pro-rata payments will be made to the executives as follows: (1) a projection of
EBITDA for the fiscal year shall be established by the Board, (2) the projected
EBITDA will create a pool of award monies based on the current formula of 1.6%,
(3) the pool shall be pro-rated based on the number of weeks of the fiscal year
completed at the date of termination of the Company's Management Incentive Plan
and (4) the pool shall be distributed to all participating executives on the
payroll as of the termination date of the Company's Management Incentive Plan in
proportion to each executive's target incentive. Since the Company's current
fiscal year ends on September 30, 2001, each executive will be entitled to
receive incentive payments due under the Management Incentive Plan in the normal
course for fiscal 2001 in addition to the pro rata change in control payments,
if any, due with respect to the portion of fiscal 2002 completed at the date of
termination of the Management Incentive Plan. The Company will establish the
forecasted EBITDA used to determine the amount of these pro rata change in
control payments based on actual EBITDA used to calculate payments for fiscal
2001.

     Employment Letter Agreements.  The Company currently has letter agreements
with Messrs. Casey, Keough and Rogna and four other executives which provide
that upon completion of the two years (or three years in the case of Messrs.
Casey, Keough and Rogna) of benefits coverage provided under the Severance
Agreements, such executive may elect to continue medical and dental coverage
indefinitely by paying the full premium incurred by the successor for the
coverage selected.

     Promissory Notes.  The Company made loans to seven executives that are each
party to a Severance Agreement in order to facilitate certain relocations. Each
of these executives (who do not include any of Messrs. Pomerantz, Casey, Keough
or Rogna) executed a promissory note in favor of the Company. If an executive
becomes entitled to receive a severance payment under his Severance Agreement,
the Company will forgive all principal and accrued interest owing under his
promissory note. The aggregate original principal amount of these promissory
notes was $555,000.

     Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.  The Company's Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") covering Messrs. Casey, Rogna and Keough and
five other current or former executives (including Dale E. Stahl, an employee of
Parent and former employee of the Company) provides for supplemental retirement
payments of up to 60% of their average base salary and bonus for the four
highest of the last 10 years prior to retirement, less primary Social Security
benefits and any amounts payable under the Company's retirement plan.
Supplemental payments range from 35% (at age 55) to 60% (at age 65) of average
base salary and bonus. In the event of a change in control of the Company, the
executives will be entitled to receive in a lump sum the actuarial equivalent
(on an after-tax basis) of the supplemental retirement payments. The lump sum
payment payable upon a change in control to an

executive who has not attained age 55 will be calculated as if such executive
had attained such age. The consummation of the Offer would constitute a change
in control under the SERP. However, as explained above in the section "Employee
Benefit Arrangements," the Company has agreed to amend the SERP generally to
provide that benefits will become payable under the SERP on account of
consummation of the Merger and not consummation of the Offer. The aggregate
amount of lump sum SERP payments payable to these eight current or former
executives upon consummation of the Merger will be approximately $15.4 million,
of which Messrs. Casey, Keough, Rogna and Stahl would receive approximately $3.6
million, $1.8 million, $2.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively.

     Hayford Retirement Payments.  In the event of a change in control of the
Company, Warren J. Hayford, a director of the Company, will be entitled to
receive in a lump sum the actuarial equivalent (on an after-tax basis) of the
supplemental retirement payments he is currently receiving under his prior
employment agreement with the Company. The consummation of the Offer would
constitute a change in control under this arrangement. However, as explained
above in the section "Employee Benefit Arrangements," the Company and Mr.
Hayford have agreed to amend his prior employment agreement so that any benefit
that would be paid to Mr. Hayford as a result of the consummation of the Offer
will instead become payable upon consummation of the Merger. Mr. Hayford's lump
sum payment upon consummation of the Merger will be approximately $3.8 million.

     Excise Tax Reimbursements.  In the event Messrs. Pomerantz or Hayford or
any executive covered by a Severance Agreement becomes subject to any excise tax
imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), the Company is obligated to pay to such executive, not later than 30
days after a change in control of the Company (within the meaning of the Code),
a gross-up payment in an amount equal to (1) any excise tax to which such
executive becomes subject and (2) all federal income, state income, payroll or
other taxes to which the executive becomes subject with respect to the gross-up
payment. The aggregate amount of these gross-up payments will be approximately
$5.9 million, of which Messrs. Pomerantz, Hayford, Casey, Keough and Rogna will
receive approximately $0, $0, $1.4 million, $1.5 million and $0.9 million,
respectively. These payments will be deferred as described above in the section
"Employee Benefit Arrangements."

     Restricted Stock.  The Company has granted an aggregate of 2,130,500 shares
of restricted, including 270,000, 310,000 and 135,000 shares of restricted stock
granted to Messrs. Casey, Keough and Rogna, respectively. All restrictions on
this restricted stock will lapse upon a change in control of the Company. The
consummation of the Offer would constitute a change in control for purposes of
this lapsing.

     Phantom Stock.  The 1,000 phantom stock units granted to Mary Sue Coleman,
Harve A. Ferrill, John E. Goodenow, David B. Hawkins, Warren J. Hayford and
Ralph L. MacDonald Jr., each a non-employee director of the Company, will vest
upon a change in control of the Company or when such person ceases to be a
director of the Company. The consummation of the Offer would constitute a change
in control for purposes of this vesting. However, as explained above in the
section "Employee Benefit Arrangements," the Company and such persons have
agreed to amend the phantom stock agreements so that a change in control that
would be triggered upon consummation of the Offer will instead be triggered upon
consummation of the Merger.

     Deferred Director Fees.  Messrs. Ferrill, Goodenow, Hawkins, Kolb and
MacDonald have elected to defer all cash fees payable for their service on the
Board until they cease to be directors or file a written revocation of their
election. Such deferred fees accrue gain or loss as if the deferred fees were
used to acquire Common Stock at a 15% discount from the closing price at the
beginning of each fiscal year. In the event that Messrs. Ferrill, Goodenow,
Hawkins, Kolb and MacDonald cease to be directors in connection with the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger, the deferred fees shall become payable.

14. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.

     The Company has not declared or paid dividends on the Shares during the
past two years. As discussed in Section 11, the Merger Agreement provides that
from the date of the Merger Agreement to the Effective Time, without the prior
written approval of Parent, the Company will not and will not permit

any of its subsidiaries to declare, set aside or pay dividends on, or make any
other distributions in respect of, any of its capital stock.

15. CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, the Purchaser shall not
be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, pay for, and may postpone the acceptance for payment of
and payment for Shares tendered, and, except as set forth in the Merger
Agreement, terminate the Offer as to any Shares not then tendered if (1) the HSR

     compel Parent or the Purchaser or their respective subsidiaries and

     consummation of the Offer, the Merger, the Notes Tender Offers or the
     performance of any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
     Agreement, the Stock Option Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement or the

     injunction enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated or deemed applicable to
     the Offer or the Merger, or any other action shall be taken by any
     governmental entity, that is reasonably likely to result, directly or

     American Stock Exchange or in the Nasdaq National Market, for a period in
     excess of three hours (excluding any coordinated trading halt triggered
     solely as a result of a specified decrease in a market index for a period
     of less than two days and suspensions or limitations resulting solely from
     physical damage or interference with such exchanges not related to market
     conditions), (ii) a declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension

     time of the commencement of the Offer, a material acceleration or worsening
     thereof; or

          (d) there shall have occurred a material adverse effect on the
     condition (financial or otherwise), business, assets, liabilities,
     prospects or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries
     taken as a whole, excluding effects from general economic conditions,
     general securities market conditions or conditions affecting the Company's
     industry generally, or the announcement of the Merger Agreement or the
     transactions contemplated thereby (a "Company Material Adverse Effect"); or

          (e) the Company Board or any committee thereof (i) shall have
     withdrawn, modified or changed in a manner adverse to Parent or the
     Purchaser its approval or recommendation of the Offer, the Merger Agreement

     shall have executed an agreement in principle or definitive agreement
     relating to an Acquisition Proposal from, or similar business combination
     with, a person or entity other than Parent, the Purchaser or their
     affiliates; or

          (f) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
     in the Merger Agreement that are qualified as to materiality shall not be
     true and correct and any such representations and warranties that are not
     so qualified shall not be true and correct in any material respect, in each
     case as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the scheduled
     expiration of the Offer, such that the aggregate effect of all such
     breaches of representations and warranties shall have had or is reasonably
     likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect and such breach has not
     been cured within 10 days after Parent gives written notice thereof to the
     Company or the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.12(m)
     and 4.15 and the last sentence of Section 4.11 of the Merger Agreement
     shall not be true and correct; or

          (g) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect
     any material obligation or to comply in any material respect with any
     agreement or covenant of the Company to be performed or complied with by it
     under the Merger Agreement and such breach has not been cured within 10
     days after Parent gives written notice thereof to the Company; or

          (h) all consents necessary to the consummation of the Notes Tender
     Offers, the Offer or the Merger including, without limitation, consents
     from parties to loans, contracts, leases or other agreements shall not have
     been obtained, other than consents the failure of which to obtain would not
     have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken
     as a whole; or

          (i) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
     its terms; or

          (j) in the 20 business days following commencement of the Offer, the
     environmental due diligence conducted by Parent shall have discovered a
     condition or conditions at one or more of the Company's converting
     facilities or the Company's mills located in Pine Bluff, Arkansas,
     Bogalusa, Louisiana and Antioch, California (in the case of the Pine Bluff
     and Bogalusa mills, such due diligence investigation is to be conducted in
     accordance with the procedures set forth on Exhibit C to the Merger
     Agreement) that in the reasonable judgment of Parent will require
     remediation or other expenditures in an aggregate amount in excess of $5
     million, with respect to the converting facilities and the Pine Bluff and
     Bogalusa mills, and in excess of $10 million, with respect to the Antioch
     mill;

     which in the sole judgment of Parent or Purchaser, in any such case, and
     regardless of the circumstances (including any action or inaction by Parent
     or Purchaser) giving rise to such condition makes it inadvisable to proceed
     with the Notes Tender Offers or the Offer and/or with such acceptance for
     payment of or payment for Shares.

     The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and the
Purchaser, may be waived by Parent or the Purchaser, in whole or in part, at any
time and from time to time in the sole discretion of Parent or the Purchaser.
The failure by Parent or the Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such
right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and
from time to time.

16. CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS; REGULATORY APPROVALS.

     General.  The Purchaser is not aware of any material pending legal
proceeding relating to the Offer. Except as described in this Section 16, based
on its examination of publicly available information filed by the Company with
the SEC and other publicly available information concerning the Company, the
Purchaser is not aware of any governmental license or regulatory permit that
appears to be material to the Company's business that might be adversely
affected by the Purchaser's acquisition of Shares as contemplated herein or of
any approval or other action by any governmental, administrative or regulatory
authority or agency, domestic or foreign, that would be required for the
acquisition or ownership of Shares by the Purchaser or Parent as contemplated
herein. Should any such approval or other action be required, the Purchaser
currently contemplates that, except as described below under "State Takeover
Statutes," such approval or other action will be sought. While the Purchaser
does not currently intend to delay acceptance for payment of Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer pending the outcome of any such matter, there can be no
assurance that any such approval or other action, if needed, would be obtained
or would be obtained without substantial conditions or that if such approvals
were not obtained or such other actions were not taken, adverse consequences
might not result to the Company's business, or certain parts of the Company's
business might not have to be disposed of, any of which could cause the
Purchaser to elect to terminate the Offer without the purchase of Shares
thereunder under certain conditions. See Section 15.

     State Takeover Statutes.  A number of states have adopted laws that
purport, to varying degrees, to apply to attempts to acquire corporations that
are incorporated in, or that have substantial assets, stockholders, principal
executive offices or principal places of business or whose business operations
otherwise have substantial economic effects in, such states. The Company,
directly or through subsidiaries, conducts business in a number of states
throughout the United States, some of which have enacted such laws.

     In Edgar v. MITE Corp., the Supreme Court of the United States invalidated
on constitutional grounds the Illinois Business Takeover Statute which, as a
matter of state securities law, made takeovers of corporations meeting certain
requirements more difficult. However, in 1987, in CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of
America, the Supreme Court held that the State of Indiana could, as a matter of
corporate law, constitutionally disqualify a potential acquiror from voting
shares of a target corporation without the prior approval of the remaining
stockholders where, among other things, the corporation is incorporated in, and
has a substantial number of stockholders in, the state. Subsequently, in TLX
Acquisition Corp. v. Telex Corp., a Federal District Court in Oklahoma ruled
that the Oklahoma statutes were unconstitutional insofar as they apply to
corporations incorporated outside Oklahoma in that they would subject such
corporations to inconsistent regulations. Similarly, in Tyson Foods, Inc. v.
McReynolds, a Federal District Court in Tennessee ruled that four Tennessee
takeover statutes were unconstitutional as applied to corporations incorporated
outside Tennessee. This decision was affirmed by the United States Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

     The Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. In
general, Section 203 of the DGCL ("Section 203") prevents an "interested
stockholder" (including a person who has the right to acquire 15% or more of the
corporation's outstanding voting stock) from engaging in a "business
combination" (defined to include mergers and certain other actions) with a
Delaware corporation for a period of three years following the date such person
became an interested stockholder. The Company Board approved for purposes of
Section 203 the entering into by the Purchaser, Parent and the Company of the
Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby
and has taken all appropriate action so that Section 203, with respect to the
Company, will not be applicable to Parent and the Purchaser by virtue of such
actions.

     If any government official or third party should seek to apply any state
takeover law to the Offer or the Merger or other business combination between
the Purchaser or any of its affiliates and the Company, the Purchaser will take
such action as then appears desirable, which action may include challenging the
applicability or validity of such statute in appropriate court proceedings. In
the event it is asserted that one or more state takeover statutes is applicable
to the Offer or the Merger and an appropriate court does not

determine that it is inapplicable or invalid as applied to the Offer or the
Merger, the Purchaser might be required to file certain information with, or to
receive approvals from, the relevant state authorities or holders of Shares, and
the Purchaser might be unable to accept for payment or pay for Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer, or be delayed in continuing or consummating the Offer or
the Merger. In such case, the Purchaser may not be obligated to accept for
payment or pay for any tendered Shares. See Section 15.

     United States Antitrust Compliance.  Under the HSR Act and the rules that
have been promulgated thereunder by the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"),
certain acquisition transactions may not be consummated unless certain
information has been furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (the "Antitrust Division") and the FTC and certain waiting period
requirements have been satisfied. The purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer
is subject to such requirements.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the HSR Act, the Purchaser expects to file
a Notification and Report Form with respect to the Offer and Merger with the
Antitrust Division and the FTC on or about September 28, 2001. As a result, the
waiting period applicable to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer is
scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, 15 days after such
filing. However, prior to such time, the Antitrust Division or the FTC may
extend the waiting period by requesting additional information or documentary
material relevant to the Offer from the Purchaser. If such a request is made,
the waiting period will be extended until 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the
tenth day after substantial compliance by the Purchaser with such request.
Thereafter, such waiting period can be extended only by court order.

     The Antitrust Division and the FTC scrutinize the legality under the
antitrust laws of transactions such as the acquisition of Shares by the
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. At any time before or after the consummation of
any such transactions, the Antitrust Division or the FTC could take such action
under the antitrust laws of the United States as it deems necessary or desirable
in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the purchase of Shares
pursuant to the Offer or seeking divestiture of the Shares so acquired or
divestiture of substantial assets of Parent or the Company. Private parties
(including individual States) may also bring legal actions under the antitrust
laws of the United States. The Purchaser does not believe that the consummation
of the Offer will result in a violation of any applicable antitrust laws.
However, there can be no assurance that a challenge to the Offer on antitrust
grounds will not be made, or if such a challenge is made, what the result will
be. See Section 15, including conditions with respect to litigation and certain
governmental actions and Section 11 for certain termination rights.

17. APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

     If the Merger is consummated, stockholders of the Company may have the
right to dissent and demand appraisal of their Shares under the DGCL. See
Section 12. Under the DGCL, dissenting stockholders who comply with the
applicable statutory procedures will be entitled to receive a judicial
determination of the fair value of their Shares (exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger) and to
receive payment of such fair value in cash, together with a fair rate of
interest, if any. Any such judicial determination of the fair value of the
Shares could be based upon considerations other than or in addition to the Offer
Price, the consideration per Share to be paid in the Merger and the market value
of the Shares, including asset values and the investment value of the Shares.
Stockholders should recognize that the value so determined could be higher or
lower than the price per Share paid pursuant to the Offer or the consideration
per Share to be paid in the Merger.

18. FEES AND EXPENSES.

     Salomon Smith Barney is acting as the Dealer Manager in connection with the
Offer, the Notes Tender Offers and Parent's proposed acquisition of the Company.
Salomon Smith Barney will receive reasonable and customary compensation for its
services relating to the Offer and the Notes Tender Offers and will be
reimbursed for certain out-of-pocket expenses. Parent, the Purchaser and Inland
Container Corporation I have agreed to indemnify Salomon Smith Barney and
certain related persons against certain liabilities and expenses in connection
with its engagement, including certain liabilities under the federal securities
laws.

     Parent and the Purchaser have retained D. F. King & Co., Inc. to be the
Information Agent and Computershare Trust Company of New York to be the
Depositary in connection with the Offer. The Information Agent may contact
holders of Shares by mail, telephone, telecopy, telegraph and personal interview
and may request banks, brokers, dealers and other nominees to forward materials
relating to the Offer to beneficial owners of Shares.

     The Information Agent and the Depositary each will receive reasonable and
customary compensation for their respective services in connection with the
Offer, will be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will be
indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses in connection therewith,
including certain liabilities under federal securities laws.

     None of Parent or the Purchaser will pay any fees or commissions to any
broker or dealer or to any other person (other than to the Dealer Manager, the
Depositary and the Information Agent) in connection with the solicitation of
tenders of Shares pursuant to the Offer. Brokers, dealers, commercial banks and
trust companies will, upon request, be reimbursed by the Purchaser for customary
mailing and handling expenses incurred by them in forwarding offering materials
to their customers.

19. MISCELLANEOUS.

     The Offer is not being made to (nor will tenders be accepted from or on
behalf of) holders of Shares in any jurisdiction in which the making of the
Offer or the acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the laws of such
jurisdiction. However, the Purchaser may, in its discretion, take such action as
it may deem necessary to make the Offer in any such jurisdiction and extend the
Offer to holders of Shares in such jurisdiction.

     NO PERSON HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO GIVE ANY INFORMATION OR TO MAKE ANY
REPRESENTATION ON BEHALF OF PARENT OR THE PURCHASER NOT CONTAINED HEREIN OR IN
THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND, IF GIVEN OR MADE, SUCH INFORMATION OR
REPRESENTATION MUST NOT BE RELIED UPON AS HAVING BEEN AUTHORIZED.

     The Purchaser has filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO pursuant to Rule 14d-3 of the General Rules and Regulations under the
Exchange Act, together with exhibits furnishing certain additional information
with respect to the Offer, and may file amendments thereto. In addition, the
Company has filed with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9, together with exhibits, pursuant to Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act, setting forth the recommendations of the Company Board with
respect to the Offer and the reasons for such recommendations and furnishing
certain additional related information. A copy of such documents, and any
amendments thereto, may be examined at, and copies may be obtained from, the SEC

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     The undersigned hereby tenders to Temple-Inland Acquisition Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the "Purchaser") and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary
of Temple-Inland Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Parent"), the
above-described shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $.0001 per share (the
"Common Stock"), of Gaylord Container Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), including the associated rights to purchase preferred stock issued
pursuant to the Rights Agreement (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) (the
"Rights" and, together with the Common Stock, the "Shares"), pursuant to the
Purchaser's offer to purchase all outstanding Shares for $1.80 per Share, net to
the seller in cash, without interest thereon, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated September 28, 2001 (the
"Offer to Purchase"), and in this Letter of Transmittal (which, together with
the Offer to Purchase and any amendments or supplements thereto or hereto,
collectively constitute the "Offer"). The undersigned understands that the
Purchaser reserves the right to transfer or assign, in whole or from time to
time in part, to one or more of its affiliates, the right to purchase all or any
portion of the Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, but any such transfer or
assignment will not relieve the Purchaser of its obligations under the Offer and
will in no way prejudice the rights of tendering stockholders to receive payment
for Shares validly tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer.
Receipt of the Offer is hereby acknowledged.

     The Company has distributed one Right for each outstanding Share pursuant
to the Rights Agreement. The Rights are currently evidenced by and trade with
certificates evidencing the Common Stock. The Company has taken such action so
as to make the Rights Agreement inapplicable to the Purchaser and its affiliates
and associates in connection with the Merger Agreement (as defined below) and
the transactions contemplated thereby.

     The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of September 27, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"), among the Parent, the
Purchaser and the Company.

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (and if the Offer
is extended or amended, the terms of any such extension or amendment), and
effective upon acceptance for payment of the Shares tendered herewith in
accordance with the terms of the Offer, the undersigned hereby sells, assigns
and transfers to, or upon the order of, the Purchaser all right, title and
interest in and to all of the Shares that are being tendered hereby (and any and
all dividends, distributions, rights, other Shares or other securities issued or
issuable in respect thereof with a record date before, and a payment date after
the Expiration Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) (collectively,
"Distributions") and irrevocably constitutes and appoints Computershare Trust
Company of New York (the "Depositary") the true and lawful agent and
attorney-in-fact of the undersigned with respect to such Shares (and all
Distributions), with full power of substitution (such power of attorney being
deemed to be an irrevocable power coupled with an interest), to (i) deliver
certificates for such Shares (and any and all Distributions) or transfer
ownership of such Shares (and any and all Distributions) on the account books
maintained by The Depository Trust Company, together, in any such case, with all
accompanying evidences of transfer and authenticity, to or upon the order of the
Purchaser, (ii) present such Shares (and any and all Distributions) for transfer
on the books of the Company, and (iii) receive all benefits and otherwise
exercise all rights of beneficial ownership of such Shares (and any and all
Distributions), all in accordance with the terms of the Offer.

     By executing this Letter of Transmittal, the undersigned hereby irrevocably
appoints Kenneth M. Jastrow, II, Dale E. Stahl and M. Richard Warner in their
respective capacities as officers or directors of the Purchaser, and any
individual who shall thereafter succeed to any such office of the Purchaser, and
each of them, and any other designees of the Purchaser, the attorneys-in-fact
and proxies of the undersigned, each with full power of substitution, to vote at
any annual or special meeting of the Company's stockholders or any adjournment
or postponement thereof or otherwise in such manner as each

such attorney-in-fact and proxy or his or her substitute shall in his or her
sole discretion deem proper with respect to, to execute any written consent
concerning any matter as each such attorney-in-fact and proxy or his or her
substitute shall in his or her sole discretion deem proper with respect to, and
to otherwise act as each such attorney-in-fact and proxy or his or her
substitute shall in his or her sole discretion deem proper with respect to, all
of the Shares (and any and all Distributions) tendered hereby and accepted for
payment by the Purchaser. This appointment will be effective if and when, and
only to the extent that, the Purchaser accepts such Shares for payment pursuant
to the Offer. This power of attorney and proxy are irrevocable and are granted
in consideration of the acceptance for payment of such Shares in accordance with
the terms of the Offer. Such acceptance for payment shall, without further
action, revoke any prior powers of attorney and proxies granted by the
undersigned at any time with respect to such Shares (and any and all
Distributions), and no subsequent powers of attorney, proxies, consents or
revocations may be given by the undersigned with respect thereto (and, if given,
will not be deemed effective). The Purchaser reserves the right to require that,
in order for the Shares or other securities to be deemed validly tendered,
immediately upon the Purchaser's acceptance for payment of such Shares, the
Purchaser must be able to exercise full voting, consent and other rights with
respect to such Shares (and any and all Distributions), including voting at any
meeting of the Company's stockholders.

     The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has
full power and authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer the Shares
tendered hereby and all Distributions and that, when the same are accepted for
payment by the Purchaser, the Purchaser will acquire good, marketable and
unencumbered title thereto and to all Distributions, free and clear of all
liens, restrictions, charges and encumbrances and the same will not be subject
to any adverse claims. The undersigned shall, upon request, execute and deliver
any additional documents deemed by the Depositary or the Purchaser to be
necessary or desirable to complete the sale, assignment and transfer of the
Shares tendered hereby and all Distributions. In addition, the undersigned shall
remit and transfer promptly to the Depositary for the account of the Purchaser
all Distributions in respect of the Shares tendered hereby, accompanied by
appropriate documentation of transfer, and, pending such remittance and transfer
or appropriate assurance thereof, the Purchaser shall be entitled to all rights
and privileges as owner of each such Distribution and may withhold the entire
purchase price of the Shares tendered hereby or deduct from such purchase price,
the amount or value of such Distribution as determined by the Purchaser in its
sole discretion.

     All authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred shall survive the
death or incapacity of the undersigned, and any obligation of the undersigned
hereunder shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, personal
representatives, trustees in bankruptcy, successors and assigns of the
undersigned. Except as stated in the Offer to Purchase, this tender is
irrevocable.

     The undersigned understands that the valid tender of the Shares pursuant to
any one of the procedures described in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase and in
the Instructions hereto will constitute a binding agreement between the
undersigned and the Purchaser upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
the Offer (and if the Offer is extended or amended, the terms or conditions of
any such extension or amendment). Without limiting the foregoing, if the price
to be paid in the Offer is amended in accordance with the Merger Agreement, the
price to be paid to the undersigned will be the amended price notwithstanding
the fact that a different price is stated in this Letter of Transmittal. The
undersigned recognizes that under certain circumstances set forth in the Offer
to Purchase, the Purchaser may not be required to accept for payment any of the
Shares tendered hereby.

     Unless otherwise indicated herein in the box entitled "Special Payment
Instructions," please issue the check for the purchase price of all of the
Shares purchased and/or return any certificates for the Shares not tendered or
accepted for payment in the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appearing above
under "Description of Shares Tendered." Similarly, unless otherwise indicated
herein in the box entitled "Special Delivery Instructions," please mail the
check for the purchase price of all of the Shares purchased and/or return any
certificates for the Shares not tendered or not accepted for payment (and any
accompanying documents, as appropriate) to the address(es) of the registered
holder(s) appearing above under "Description of Shares Tendered." In the event
that the boxes entitled "Special Payment Instructions" and "Special Delivery
Instructions" are both completed, please issue the check for the purchase price
of

all Shares purchased and/or return any certificates evidencing Shares not
tendered or not accepted for payment (and any accompanying documents, as
appropriate) in the name(s) of, and deliver such check for the purchase price
and/or return any such Share certificates (and any accompanying documents, as
appropriate) to, the person(s) so indicated. Unless otherwise indicated herein
in the box entitled "Special Payment Instructions," please credit any Shares
tendered herewith by book-entry transfer that are not accepted for payment by
crediting the account at The Depository Trust Company. The undersigned
recognizes that the Purchaser has no obligation, pursuant to the "Special
Payment Instructions," to transfer any Shares from the name of the registered
holder thereof if the Purchaser does not accept for payment any of the Shares so
tendered.

                                  INSTRUCTIONS

             FORMING PART OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

     1. Guarantee of Signatures.  No signature guarantee is required on this
Letter of Transmittal (a) if this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the
registered holder(s) (which term, for purposes of this Section, includes any
participant in The Depository Trust Company's systems whose name appears on a
security position listing as the owner of the Shares) of Shares tendered
herewith, unless such registered holder(s) has completed either the box entitled
"Special Payment Instructions" or the box entitled "Special Delivery
Instructions" on this Letter of Transmittal or (b) if such Shares are tendered
for the account of a financial institution (including most commercial banks,
savings and loan associations and brokerage houses) that is a participant in the
Security Transfer Agents Medallion Program, the New York Stock Exchange
Medallion Signature Guarantee Program or the Stock Exchange Medallion Program or
by any other "eligible guarantor institution," as such term is defined in Rule
17Ad-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (each, an
"Eligible Institution"). In all other cases, all signatures on this Letter of
Transmittal must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. See Instruction 5.

     2. Requirements of Tender.  This Letter of Transmittal is to be completed
by stockholders if certificates are to be forwarded herewith or, unless an
Agent's Message is utilized, if tenders are to be made pursuant to the procedure
for tender by book-entry transfer set forth in Section 3 of the Offer to
Purchase. Share Certificates evidencing tendered Shares, or timely confirmation
(a "Book-Entry Confirmation") of a book-entry transfer of shares into the
Depositary's account at The Depository Trust Company, as well as this Letter of
Transmittal (or a facsimile hereof), properly completed and duly executed, with
any required signature guarantees, or an Agent's Message in connection with a
book-entry transfer, and any other documents required by this Letter of
Transmittal, must be received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set
forth herein prior to the Expiration Date (as defined in Section 1 of the Offer
to Purchase). Stockholders whose Share Certificates are not immediately
available, or who cannot complete the procedure for delivery by book-entry
transfer on a timely basis or who cannot deliver all other required documents to
the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date, may tender their Shares by properly
completing and duly executing a Notice of Guaranteed Delivery pursuant to the
guaranteed delivery procedure set forth in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase.
Pursuant to such procedure: (a) such tender must be made by or through an
Eligible Institution; (b) a properly completed and duly executed Notice of
Guaranteed Delivery, substantially in the form made available by the Purchaser,
must be received by the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date; and (c) the
Share Certificates (or a Book-Entry Confirmation) evidencing all tendered
Shares, in proper form for transfer, in each case together with this Letter of
Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with
any required signature guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry delivery, an
Agent's Message) and any other documents required by this Letter of Transmittal,
must be received by the Depositary within three New York Stock Exchange trading
days after the date of execution of such Notice of Guaranteed Delivery. If Share
Certificates are forwarded separately to the Depositary, a properly completed
and duly executed Letter of Transmittal must accompany each such delivery.

     THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, SHARE CERTIFICATES
AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH THE DEPOSITORY
TRUST COMPANY, IS AT THE OPTION AND THE RISK OF THE TENDERING STOCKHOLDER, AND
THE DELIVERY WILL BE DEEMED MADE ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY
(INCLUDING, IN THE CASE OF BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER, RECEIPT OF A BOOK-ENTRY
CONFIRMATION). IF DELIVERY IS BY MAIL, REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT
REQUESTED, PROPERLY INSURED, IS RECOMMENDED. IN ALL CASES, SUFFICIENT TIME
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY.

     No alternative, conditional or contingent tenders will be accepted and no
fractional Shares will be purchased. All tendering stockholders, by execution of
this Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile hereof), waive any right to receive
any notice of the acceptance of their Shares for payment.

     3. Inadequate Space.  If the space provided herein under "Description of
Shares Tendered" is inadequate, the Share Certificate numbers and/or the number
of Shares and any other required information should be listed on a separate
signed schedule attached hereto.

     4. Partial Tenders (not applicable to stockholders who tender by book-entry
transfer).  If fewer than all of the Shares evidenced by any Share Certificate
delivered to the Depositary herewith are to be tendered hereby, fill in the
number of Shares that are to be tendered in the box entitled "Number of Shares
Tendered." In this case, new Share Certificates for the Shares that were
evidenced by your old Share Certificates but were not tendered by you, will be
sent to you, unless otherwise provided in the appropriate box on this Letter of
Transmittal, as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date. All Shares
represented by Share Certificates delivered to the Depositary will be deemed to
have been tendered for purchase unless otherwise indicated.

     5. Signatures on Letter of Transmittal, Stock Powers and Endorsements.  If
this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the Shares
tendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond with the name(s) as written on
the face of the certificate(s) without alteration, enlargement or any change
whatsoever.

     If any of the Shares tendered by this Letter of Transmittal are held of
record by two or more joint owners, all such owners must sign this Letter of
Transmittal.

     If any of the tendered Shares are registered in different names on several
certificates, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many separate
Letters of Transmittal as there are different registrations of Share
Certificates.

     If this Letter of Transmittal or any Share Certificates or stock powers are
signed by a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact,
officer of a corporation or other person acting in a fiduciary or representative
capacity, such person should so indicate when signing, and proper evidence
satisfactory to the Purchaser of the authority of such person so to act must be
submitted.

     If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the
Shares listed and transmitted hereby, no endorsements of Share Certificates or
separate stock powers are required unless payment is to be made or certificates
for Shares not tendered or not accepted for payment are to be issued in the name
of a person other than the registered holder(s). Signatures on any such Share
Certificates or stock powers must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.

     If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by a person other than the
registered holder(s) of the Share Certificates listed and transmitted hereby,
the Share Certificate(s) must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock
powers, in either case signed exactly as the name(s) of the registered holder(s)
appear(s) on the Share Certificate(s). Signature(s) on any such Share
Certificates or stock powers must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.

     6. Stock Transfer Taxes.  Except as otherwise provided in this Instruction
6, the Purchaser will pay all stock transfer taxes with respect to the transfer
and sale of any Shares to it or its order pursuant to the Offer. If, however,
payment of the purchase price is to be made to, or if Share Certificates not
tendered or not accepted for payment are to be registered in the name of, any
person other than the registered holder(s), or if tendered Share Certificate(s)
are registered in the name of any person other than the person(s) signing this
Letter of Transmittal, the amount of any stock transfer taxes (whether imposed
on the registered holder(s) or such other person) payable on account of the
transfer to such other person will be deducted from the purchase price of such
Shares purchased unless evidence satisfactory to the Purchaser of the payment of
such taxes, or exemption therefrom, is submitted.

     Except as provided in this Instruction 6, it will not be necessary for
transfer tax stamps to be affixed to the Share Certificate(s) tendered hereby.

     7. Special Payment and Delivery Instructions.  If a check for the purchase
price of any Shares accepted for payment is to be issued in the name of, and/or
certificates for Shares not tendered or not accepted for payment are to be
issued in the name of and/or returned to, a person other than the person(s)
signing this Letter of Transmittal or if a check is to be sent, and/or such
certificates are to be returned, to a person other than the person(s) signing
this Letter of Transmittal or to an address other

than that shown in this Letter of Transmittal, the appropriate boxes on this
Letter of Transmittal must be completed.

     8. Substitute Form W-9.  A tendering stockholder is required to provide the
Depositary with a correct Taxpayer Identification Number ("TIN") on Substitute
Form W-9, which is provided under "Important Tax Information" below, and to
certify, under penalties of perjury, that such TIN is correct, that such
stockholder is not subject to backup withholding of federal income tax, and that
such stockholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). If a
tendering stockholder is subject to backup withholding, the tendering
stockholder must cross out Item (Y) of Part 3 of the Certification Box of the
Substitute Form W-9. Failure to provide the information on the Substitute Form
W-9 may subject the tendering stockholder to backup withholding on any payments
made to such stockholder at a rate equal to the fourth lowest rate applicable to
ordinary income of unmarried individuals (for payments made after August 6, 2001
and before January 1, 2002, the backup withholding rate is 30.5%), but such
withholdings will be refunded if such stockholder provides a TIN within 60 days.

     Certain stockholders (including, among others, all corporations and certain
foreign individuals and entities) are not subject to backup withholding.
Noncorporate foreign stockholders should submit an appropriate and properly
completed IRS Form W-8BEN, a copy of which may be obtained from the Depositary,
in order to avoid backup withholding. See the enclosed "Guidelines for
Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9" for more
instructions.

     9. Requests for Assistance or Additional Copies.  Questions and requests
for assistance or additional copies of the Offer to Purchase, this Letter of
Transmittal, the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery, IRS Form W-8BEN and the
Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute
Form W-9 may be directed to the Information Agent or Dealer Manager at the
addresses and phone numbers set forth below, or from brokers, dealers,
commercial banks or trust companies.

     10. Waiver of Conditions.  Subject to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement, the Purchaser reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
waive, at any time or from time to time, any of the specified conditions of the
Offer, in whole or in part, in the case of any Shares tendered (other than the
Minimum Condition, as defined in the Merger Agreement).

     11. Lost, Destroyed or Stolen Certificates.  If any Share Certificate has
been lost, destroyed or stolen, the stockholder should promptly notify
Computershare Trust Company of New York in its capacity as transfer agent for
the Shares (telephone number: (800) 245-7630). The stockholder will then be
instructed as to the steps that must be taken in order to replace the
certificate. THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND RELATED DOCUMENTS CANNOT BE
PROCESSED UNTIL THE PROCEDURES FOR REPLACING LOST OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES HAVE
BEEN FOLLOWED.

     IMPORTANT:  THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL (OR A MANUALLY SIGNED FACSIMILE
HEREOF) TOGETHER WITH ANY REQUIRED SIGNATURE GUARANTEES, OR, IN THE CASE OF A
BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER, AN AGENT'S MESSAGE, AND ANY OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, MUST
BE RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE AND EITHER
CERTIFICATES FOR TENDERED SHARES MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY OR SHARES
MUST BE DELIVERED PURSUANT TO THE PROCEDURES FOR BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER, IN EACH
CASE PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE, OR THE TENDERING STOCKHOLDER MUST COMPLY WITH
THE PROCEDURES FOR GUARANTEED DELIVERY.

                           IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

     Under the federal income tax law, a stockholder whose tendered Shares are
accepted for payment is required to provide the Depositary with such
stockholder's correct TIN on the Substitute Form W-9 below. If such stockholder
is an individual, the TIN is such stockholder's Social Security Number. If such
stockholder is subject to backup withholding, such stockholder must cross out
Item (Y) of Part 3 on the Substitute Form W-9. If the Depositary is not provided
with the correct TIN, such stockholder may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed
by the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, payments that are made to such
stockholder may be subject to backup withholding at a rate equal to the fourth
lowest rate applicable to ordinary income of unmarried individuals (for payments
made after August 6, 2001 and before January 1, 2002, the backup withholding
rate is 30.5%).

     Certain stockholders (including, among others, all corporations and certain
foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and reporting
requirements. In order for a foreign individual to qualify as an exempt
recipient, such individual must submit an appropriate and properly completed IRS
Form W-8BEN, attesting to that individual's exempt status. Such a Form W-8BEN
may be obtained from the Depositary. Exempt stockholders, other than foreign
individuals, should furnish their TIN, write "Exempt" in Part 2 of the
Substitute Form W-9 below and sign, date and return the Substitute Form W-9 to
the Depositary. See the enclosed Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer
Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9 for additional instructions.

     If backup withholding applies, the Depositary is required to withhold on
any payments made to the stockholder at a rate equal to the fourth lowest rate
applicable to ordinary income of unmarried individuals (for payments made after
August 6, 2001 and before January 1, 2002, the backup withholding rate is
30.5%). Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the tax liability
of persons subject to withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld.
If backup withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be
obtained from the Internal Revenue Service.

PURPOSE OF SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9

     To prevent backup withholding on payments that are made to a stockholder
with respect to Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer, the stockholder is
required to notify the Depositary of such stockholder's correct TIN by
completing the form below certifying that the TIN provided on Substitute Form
W-9 is correct (or that such stockholder is awaiting a TIN).

WHAT NUMBER TO GIVE THE DEPOSITARY

     The stockholder is required to give the Depositary the Social Security
Number of the record holder of the Shares. If the Shares are in more than one
name, or are not in the name of the actual owner, consult the enclosed
Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute
Form W-9 for additional guidelines on which number to report. If the tendering
stockholder has not been issued a TIN and has applied for a number or intends to
apply for a number in the near future, the stockholder should check the box in
Part 1(b), sign and date the Substitute Form W-9. If the box in Part 1(b) is
checked, the Depositary will withhold at a rate equal to the fourth lowest rate
applicable to ordinary income of unmarried individuals (for payments made after
August 6, 2001 and before January 1, 2002, the backup withholding rate is 30.5%)
on payments made for the stockholder, but such withholdings will be refunded if
the tendering stockholder provides a TIN within 60 days.

  THE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT 12:00 MIDNIGHT, NEW YORK CITY
        TIME, ON FRIDAY, OCTOBER 26, 2001, UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED.

                                                              September 28, 2001

To Brokers, Dealers, Commercial Banks, Trust Companies and Other Nominees:

     We have been appointed by Temple-Inland Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the "Purchaser") and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of
Temple-Inland Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Parent"), to act as Dealer
Manager in connection with the Purchaser's offer to purchase all outstanding
shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $.0001 per share (the "Common Stock"),
of Gaylord Container Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
including the associated rights to purchase preferred stock issued pursuant to
the Rights Agreement (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) (the "Rights" and,
together with the Common Stock, the "Shares"), at a purchase price of $1.80 per
Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated September
28, 2001 (the "Offer to Purchase"), and in the related Letter of Transmittal
(which, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, collectively
constitute the "Offer") enclosed herewith.

     Holders of Shares whose certificates for such Shares (the "Share
Certificates") are not immediately available, who cannot complete the procedures
for book-entry transfer on a timely basis, or who cannot deliver all other
required documents to Computershare Trust Company of New York (the "Depositary")
prior to the Expiration Date (as defined in Section 1 of the Offer to Purchase)
must tender their Shares according to the guaranteed delivery procedures set
forth in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase.

     The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, (1) there being validly
tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer and not withdrawn prior to
the Expiration Date that number of Shares that, together with the Shares then
owned by the Parent and the Purchaser, represents at least two-thirds of the
outstanding Shares, on a fully diluted basis (as defined in the Offer to
Purchase), (2) the receipt by the Depositary of the valid and unwithdrawn tender
of the Company's 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007, 9 3/4% Senior Notes due 2007 and
9 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 (collectively, the "Notes") (and
related consents) representing at least 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes of each series, pursuant to the Parent's, or its designee's,
separate tender offers for such Notes, and (3) the waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the
regulations thereunder having expired or been terminated. The Offer is subject
to certain other conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase. Please read the
Introduction and Sections 1 and 15 of the Offer to Purchase, which set forth in
full the conditions to the Offer.

     Please furnish copies of the enclosed materials to those of your clients
for whose accounts you hold Shares registered in your name or in the name of
your nominee.

     Enclosed for your information and use are copies of the following
documents:

          1. Offer to Purchase, dated September 28, 2001;

          2. Letter of Transmittal for your use in accepting the Offer and
     tendering Shares and for the information of your clients (manually signed
     facsimile copies of the Letter of Transmittal may be used to tender
     Shares);

          3. Notice of Guaranteed Delivery to be used to accept the Offer if
     Share Certificates are not immediately available or if such certificates
     and all other required documents cannot be delivered to the Depositary, or
     if the procedures for book-entry transfer cannot be completed on a timely
     basis;

          4. The letter to stockholders of the Company from Marvin A. Pomerantz,
     Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, together
     with a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 filed with
     the Securities and Exchange Commission by the Company, which includes the
     recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company that stockholders
     accept the Offer and tender their Shares to the Purchaser pursuant to the
     Offer;

          5. A printed form of letter that may be sent to your clients for whose
     accounts you hold Shares registered in your name or in the name of your
     nominee, with space provided for obtaining such clients' instructions with
     regard to the Offer;

          6. Guidelines of the Internal Revenue Service for Certification of
     Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9; and

          7. Return envelope addressed to the Depositary.

     The Company's Board of Directors has unanimously (1) determined that the
terms of the Offer and the Merger (as defined below) are fair to, and in the
best interests of, the stockholders of the Company, (2) approved the Offer, the
Merger and the Merger Agreement (as defined below), and (3) recommends that the
Company's stockholders accept the Offer, tender their Shares pursuant to the
Offer and approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger.

     The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of September 27, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"), among the Parent, the
Purchaser and the Company. The Merger Agreement provides, among other things,
that the Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger") as
soon as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver of each of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement. Following the
Merger, the Company will continue as the surviving corporation, indirectly
wholly-owned by the Parent, and the separate corporate existence of the
Purchaser will cease.

     In order to take advantage of the Offer, (i) a duly executed and properly
completed Letter of Transmittal and any required signature guarantees, or an
Agent's Message (as defined in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase) in connection
with a book-entry delivery of Shares, and other required documents should be
sent to the Depositary and (ii) Share Certificates representing the tendered
Shares should be delivered to the Depositary, or such Shares should be tendered
by book-entry transfer into the Depositary's account maintained at The
Depository Trust Company, all in accordance with the instructions set forth in
the Letter of Transmittal and the Offer to Purchase.

     If holders of Shares wish to tender, but it is impracticable for them to
forward their Share Certificates or other required documents prior to the
Expiration Date or to comply with the book-entry transfer procedures on a timely
basis, a tender may be effected by following the guaranteed delivery procedures
specified in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase.

     The Purchaser will not pay any fees or commissions to any broker or dealer
or other person (other than the Depositary, the Information Agent and the Dealer
Manager as described in the Offer to Purchase) for soliciting tenders of Shares
pursuant to the Offer. The Purchaser will, however, upon request, reimburse you
for customary mailing and handling costs incurred by you in forwarding the
enclosed materials to your customers.

     The Purchaser will pay or cause to be paid all stock transfer taxes
applicable to its purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, except as otherwise
provided in Instruction 6 of the Letter of Transmittal.

     WE URGE YOU TO CONTACT YOUR CLIENTS AS PROMPTLY AS POSSIBLE. PLEASE NOTE
THAT THE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT 12:00 MIDNIGHT, NEW YORK
CITY TIME, ON FRIDAY, OCTOBER 26, 2001, UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED.

PRIVACY ACT NOTICE.--Section 6109 requires most recipients of dividend,

who must report the payments to IRS. IRS uses the numbers for identification
purposes. Payers must be given the numbers whether or not recipients are
required to file tax returns. Beginning January 1, 1993, payers must generally
withhold 30.5% (subject to adjustment in future years) of taxable interest,
dividend, and certain other payments to a payee who does not furnish a taxpayer
identification number to a payer. Certain penalties may also apply.

PENALTIES

(1) PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO FURNISH TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER.--If you fail
to furnish your taxpayer identification number to a payer, you are subject to a
penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure is due to reasonable
cause and not to willful neglect.
(2) FAILURE TO REPORT CERTAIN DIVIDEND AND INTEREST PAYMENTS.--If you fail to
include any portion of an includible payment for interest, dividends, or
patronage dividends in gross income, such failure will be treated as being due
to negligence and will be subject to a penalty of 5% on any portion of an
under-payment attributable to that failure unless there is clear and convincing
evidence to the contrary.
(3) CIVIL PENALTY FOR FALSE INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO WITHHOLDING.--If you
make a false statement with no reasonable basis which results in no imposition
of backup withholding, you are subject to a penalty of $500.
(4) CRIMINAL PENALTY FOR FALSIFYING INFORMATION.--Falsifying certifications or
affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including fines and/or
imprisonment.

JOINT PRESS RELEASE ISSUED BY THE PARENT

                      TEMPLE-INLAND INC. TO ACQUIRE GAYLORD
                              CONTAINER CORPORATION

         AUSTIN, TEXAS, September 27, 2001 -- Temple-Inland Inc.
("Temple-Inland") and Gaylord Container Corporation ("Gaylord") today announced
the signing of a definitive merger agreement by which Temple-Inland will acquire
Gaylord. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Temple-Inland will begin
cross-conditional tender offers for all of Gaylord's outstanding shares and
outstanding 9-3/8% Senior Notes due 2007 (the "9-3/8% Senior Notes"), 9-3/4%
Senior Notes due 2007 (the "9-3/4% Senior Notes"), and 9-7/8% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2008 (the "9-7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes" and,
collectively with the 9-3/8% Senior Notes and the 9-3/4% Senior Notes, the
"Notes"). Certain outstanding bank debt and other senior secured debt
obligations of Gaylord will be paid or otherwise satisfied. Assuming that all
shares and all Notes are tendered, the total consideration for the transaction
is approximately $786 million, consisting of $1.80 per share, or approximately
$100 million, to purchase the outstanding shares of Gaylord, and approximately
$686 million to acquire all the Notes and to satisfy the bank debt and other
senior secured debt obligations.

         This transaction is contingent upon, among other things: (i) at least
two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Gaylord being validly tendered and not
withdrawn prior to the expiration date of the offer, and (ii) at least 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of each series being validly
tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the offer. The transaction
is also subject to regulatory approval and satisfaction or waiver of customary
closing conditions. This transaction is not conditioned upon financing.
Temple-Inland has received a financing commitment from Citibank, N.A. to fund
its offer for all outstanding shares of Gaylord, to acquire all the Notes, to
satisfy the bank debt and other senior secured debt obligations, and to pay
costs and expenses associated with the transaction. The tender offers for the
outstanding stock and for the Notes are both scheduled to expire on October 26,
2001, but one or both may be extended by Temple-Inland under certain conditions.

         In announcing the transaction, Kenneth M. Jastrow, II, chairman and
chief executive officer of Temple-Inland said, "The addition of Gaylord will
extend our market reach, add to our customer base and provide increased
operational efficiency. In addition, this acquisition enhances our industry
position and furthers our strategic objective to grow our company with the
addition of high-quality assets."

         Marvin Pomerantz, chairman and chief executive officer of Gaylord
stated, "We are very pleased that our outstanding operating team will be joining
forces with one of the industry's premier companies. The combination of our two
companies will create an organization that will be among the very best in the
industry."

         Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, a subsidiary of
Temple-Inland will commence a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding
shares of Gaylord at a price of $1.80 per share in cash. Gaylord's Board of
Directors has unanimously recommended that its shareholders accept the offer and
tender their shares. Gaylord's Board of Directors has received

fairness opinions from Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc. and Rothschild Inc., its
financial advisors, stating that the consideration to be received by Gaylord's
shareholders is fair from a financial point of view to such shareholders.

         A subsidiary of Temple-Inland will also commence a cash tender offer
and consent solicitation for each series of Notes. The purchase price per $1,000
in principal amount of Notes is equal to the amount indicated in the table
below. In addition, if a Note is tendered prior to the consent payment deadline
and not withdrawn, a consent payment in the amount indicated in the table below
will be paid to the holder of the Note. The consent payment deadline is 12:00
midnight, New York City time, on October 12, 2001. The consent solicitation
seeks consent from the holders of each series of Notes to amend the indentures
governing the Notes to eliminate certain restrictive covenants and other
contractual obligations of Gaylord. Salomon Smith Barney Inc. will act as
dealer/manager for Temple-Inland in connection with the Notes tender offer.

                      TEMPLE-INLAND ACQUISITION CORPORATION
                     AN INDIRECT, WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF
                               TEMPLE-INLAND INC.

         Temple-Inland Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"Purchaser") and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Temple-Inland Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), is offering to purchase all outstanding shares
of Class A Common Stock, par value $.0001 per share (the "Common Stock"), of
Gaylord Container Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), together
with the associated rights to purchase preferred stock issued pursuant to the
Rights Agreement (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) (the "Rights" and,
together with the Common Stock, the "Shares"), at a price of $1.80 per Share,
net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon (the "Offer Price"), upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase,
dated September 28, 2001 (the "Offer to Purchase"), and the related Letter of
Transmittal (which, together with any amendments or supplements thereto,
collectively constitute the "Offer"). Following consummation of the Offer, the
Purchaser intends to effect the Merger described below.

THE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT 12:00 MIDNIGHT, NEW YORK CITY
TIME, ON FRIDAY, OCTOBER 26, 2001, UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED.

         The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, (1) there being
validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer and not withdrawn
prior to the Expiration Date (as defined below) that number of Shares that,
together with the Shares then owned by Parent and the Purchaser, represents at
least two-thirds of the then outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis (the
"Minimum Stock Condition"), (2) the receipt by Computershare Trust Company of
New York (the "Depositary") of the valid and unwithdrawn tender of the Company's
9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007, 9 3/4% Senior Notes due 2007 and 9 7/8% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2008 (collectively, the "Notes") (and related consents)
representing at least 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes
of each series (the "Minimum Note Condition"), pursuant to Parent's, or its
designee's, separate tender offers for such Notes, and (3) the waiting period
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as

amended, and the regulations thereunder, having expired or been terminated (the
"HSR Condition"). The Offer is also subject to other terms and conditions set
forth in the Offer to Purchase.

         The Offer is being made pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of September 27, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"), among Parent, the
Purchaser and the Company. The Merger Agreement provides, among other things,
that the Purchaser will be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company. At
the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), the Company will
continue as the surviving corporation, indirectly wholly-owned by Parent.
Pursuant to the Merger, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Shares owned beneficially or of record by Parent or
any subsidiary of Parent or held in the treasury of the Company, all of which
will be canceled, and other than Shares that are held by stockholders, if any,
who properly exercise their dissenters' rights under the Delaware General
Corporation Law), shall be converted into the right to receive the per Share
price paid in the Offer in cash, without interest.

         As a condition and inducement to Parent's and the Purchaser's entering
into the Merger Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company (each a
"Stockholder") who have voting power and dispositive power with respect to an
aggregate of 6,672,480 Shares, representing approximately 11.9% of the Shares
outstanding on September 26, 2001, concurrently with the execution and delivery
of the Merger Agreement entered into a Stockholders Agreement (the "Stockholders
Agreement"), dated as of September 27, 2001, with Parent and the Purchaser.
Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, each of the Stockholders has agreed,
among other things, to validly tender into the Offer promptly, all Shares
subject to the Stockholders Agreement, and to grant Parent an irrevocable proxy
with respect to the voting of such Shares in favor of the Merger, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in the Stockholders Agreement. In
addition, as a condition and inducement to Parent's and the Purchaser's entering
into the Merger Agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of the
Merger Agreement, the Company and Parent entered into a Stock Option Agreement,
dated as of September 27, 2001 (the "Option Agreement"), pursuant to which,
among other things, the Company granted Parent an irrevocable option (the
"Option") to purchase up to such number of newly-issued Shares as is equal to
19.9% of the Shares outstanding on the date of exercise of the Option at a
purchase price per Share of $1.80, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in the Option Agreement.

         THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY HAS UNANIMOUSLY (1) DETERMINED
THAT THE TERMS OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER ARE FAIR TO AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS
OF THE STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY, (2) APPROVED THE OFFER, THE MERGER AND THE
MERGER AGREEMENT AND (3) RECOMMENDS THAT THE COMPANY'S STOCK-HOLDERS ACCEPT THE
OFFER, TENDER THEIR SHARES PURSUANT TO THE OFFER AND APPROVE AND ADOPT THE
MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER.

         For purposes of the Offer, the Purchaser will be deemed to have
accepted for payment, and thereby purchased, Shares validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn as, if and when the Purchaser gives oral or written notice to
the Depositary of the Purchaser's acceptance for payment of such Shares pursuant
to the Offer. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, payment
for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made by deposit of
the Offer Price therefor with the Depositary, which will act as agent for
tendering stockholders for the purpose of receiving payments from the Purchaser
and transmitting such payments to tendering stockholders whose Shares have been
accepted for payment. In all cases, payment for Shares accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer will be made only after timely receipt by the Depositary
of (1) the certificates evidencing such Shares (the "Share Certificates") or
confirmation of a book-entry transfer of such Shares into the Depositary's
account at The Depository Trust Company (the "Book-Entry Transfer Facility")
pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Offer to Purchase, (2) the Letter of
Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with
any required signature guarantees or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an
Agent's Message (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) in lieu of the Letter of
Transmittal and (3) any other documents required under the Letter of
Transmittal.

         Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Purchaser may,
without the consent of the Company, extend the Offer beyond the scheduled
Expiration Date if any of the conditions to the Purchaser's obligation to accept
for payment and to pay for the Shares shall not be satisfied or, to the extent
permitted by the Merger Agreement, waived. The Purchaser, however, may not
extend the Offer beyond December 28, 2001 without the consent of the Company,
except that Parent may extend the Expiration Date after December 28, 2001 as
required to comply with any rule, regulation or interpretation of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The term "Expiration Date" means 12:00
midnight, New York City time, on October 26, 2001, unless the Purchaser, in
accordance with the Merger Agreement, extends the period during which the Offer
is open, in which event the term "Expiration

Date" means the latest time and date on which the Offer, as so extended,
expires. Pursuant to Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, the Purchaser may,
subject to certain conditions, provide a subsequent offering period following
the expiration of the Offer on the Expiration Date (a "Subsequent Offering
Period"). A Subsequent Offering Period is an additional period of time from
three business days to 20 business days in length, beginning after the Purchaser
purchases Shares tendered in the Offer, during which stockholders may tender,
but not withdraw, their Shares and receive the Offer Price. Pursuant to Rule
14d-7 under the Exchange Act, no withdrawal rights apply to Shares tendered
during a Subsequent Offering Period and no withdrawal rights apply during the
Subsequent Offering Period with respect to Shares tendered in the Offer and
accepted for payment. There can be no assurance that the Purchaser will provide
a Subsequent Offering Period. Subject to the applicable rules and regulations of
the SEC and the provisions of the Merger Agreement, the Purchaser also expressly
reserves the right, in its sole discretion, at any time or from time to time,
(1) to terminate the Offer if any of the conditions set forth in Section 15 of
the Offer to Purchase has not been satisfied and (2) to waive any condition to
the Offer (other than the Minimum Stock Condition) or otherwise amend the Offer
in any respect, in each case by giving oral or written notice of such extension,
termination, waiver or amendment to the Depositary and by making a public
announcement thereof. Any extension, delay, termination, waiver or amendment
will be followed as promptly as practicable by public announcement thereof. Such
announcement in the case of an extension will be made no later than 9:00 a.m.,
New York City time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled
Expiration Date, in accordance with the public announcement requirements of Rule
14e-1(d) under the Exchange Act.

         Tendering stockholders who are record owners of their Shares and tender
directly to the Depositary will not be obligated to pay brokerage fees or
commissions or, except as otherwise provided in Instruction 6 of the Letter of
Transmittal, stock transfer taxes with respect to the purchase of Shares by the
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. Stockholders who hold their Shares through a
broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee should consult
such institution as to whether it charges any service fees. Parent or the
Purchaser will pay all charges and expenses of the Depositary, Salomon Smith
Barney, which is acting as Dealer Manager for the Offer (the "Dealer Manager")
and D. F. King & Co., Inc., which is acting as Information Agent for the Offer
(the "Information Agent"), incurred in connection with the Offer.

         Tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable, except
that such Shares may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Expiration Date and,
unless theretofore accepted for payment by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer,
may also be withdrawn at any time after November 26, 2001 (or such later date as
may apply if the Offer is extended). However, Shares tendered in any Subsequent
Offering Period may not be withdrawn. For a withdrawal to be effective, a
written, telegraphic or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal must be
timely received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back
cover page of the Offer to Purchase. Any such notice of withdrawal must specify
the name, address and taxpayer identification number of the person who tendered
the Shares to be withdrawn, the number of Shares to be withdrawn and the name of
the registered holder of such Shares, if different from that of the person who
tendered such Shares. If Share Certificates evidencing Shares to be withdrawn
have been delivered or otherwise identified to the Depositary, then, prior to
the physical release of such Share Certificates, the serial numbers shown on
such Share Certificates must be submitted to the Depositary and the signature(s)
on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution (as
defined in the Offer to Purchase), unless such Shares have been tendered for the
account of an Eligible Institution. If Shares have been tendered pursuant to the
procedure for book-entry transfer as set forth in Section 3 of the Offer to
Purchase, any notice of withdrawal must specify the name and number of the
account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to be credited with the withdrawn
Shares. All questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of
any notice of withdrawal will be determined by the Purchaser, in its sole
discretion, whose determination will be final and binding.

         The information required to be disclosed by Paragraph (d)(1) of Rule
14d-6 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act is contained
in the Offer to Purchase and is incorporated herein by reference.

         The Company has provided the Purchaser with a list of the stockholders
of the Company and security position listings for the purpose of disseminating
the Offer to holders of Shares. The Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of
Transmittal will be mailed to record holders of Shares whose names appear on the
Company's stockholder list and will be furnished, for subsequent transmittal to
beneficial owners of Shares, to brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust
companies and similar persons whose

names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on the stockholder list or, if
applicable, who are listed as participants in a clearing agency's security
position listing.

         THE OFFER TO PURCHASE AND THE RELATED LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL CONTAIN
IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE ANY DECISION IS MADE
WITH RESPECT TO THE OFFER.

         Questions or requests for assistance may be directed to the Information
Agent or the Dealer Manager, at the addresses and telephone numbers set forth
below. Stockholders may request copies of the Offer to Purchase, the Letter of
Transmittal, the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery and related materials from the

fees or commissions to any broker or dealer or to any other person (other than
to the Dealer Manager, the Depositary and the Information Agent) in connection
with the solicitation of tenders of Shares pursuant to the Offer.

waiver or amendment thereof not approved by the Lenders, and, in any event, the
Company having received acceptances for payment of a sufficient amount of the
Target Debt pursuant to the Debt Tender to permit Merger Sub to amend the Target
Debt covenants without the vote of any other holders of the Target Debt; and (x)
Citi/SSBI having received evidence reasonably satisfactory to it that all
conditions to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Equity Tender shall have
been satisfied without giving effect to any waiver or amendment thereof not
approved by the Lenders, and, in any event, the Company having received
acceptances for purchase of no less than 2/3 of the Shares.

SECTION 2. COMMITMENT TERMINATION. Citibank's commitment hereunder will
terminate on the earlier of (a) the date the Operative Documents become
effective and (b) December 28, 2001. Before such date, Citibank may terminate
its commitment hereunder if any event occurs or information becomes available
that, in its reasonable judgment, results or is likely to result in the failure
to satisfy any condition set forth in Section 1.

SECTION 3. SYNDICATION. After initial funding under the Operative Documents,
Citibank reserves the right to syndicate all or a portion of its commitment to
one or more other financial institutions identified by SSBI and reasonably
acceptable to the Company that will become parties to the Operative Documents
pursuant to a syndication to be managed exclusively by SSBI (the financial
institutions becoming parties to the Operative Documents being collectively
referred to herein as the "Lenders"). SSBI will manage all aspects of the
syndication in consultation with the Company, including the timing of all offers
to potential Lenders, the determination of the amounts offered to potential
Lenders, the acceptance of commitments of the Lenders and the compensation to be
provided to the Lenders.

The Company shall take all action as SSBI may reasonably request to assist SSBI
in forming a syndicate acceptable to SSBI and the Company. The Company's
assistance in forming such a syndicate shall include but not be limited to (i)
making senior management and representatives of the Company and the Target
available to

participate in information meetings with potential Lenders at such times and
places as SSBI may reasonably request; (ii) using the Company's best efforts to
ensure that the syndication efforts benefit from the Company's and the Target's
lending relationships; and (iii) providing SSBI with all information reasonably
deemed necessary by it to successfully complete the syndication, which shall
include projections and pro forma information.

To ensure an effective syndication of the Facility, the Company agrees that
until the earlier of (i) termination of the syndication (as determined by SSBI)
or (ii) 150 days after initial funding under Operative Documents, the Company
will not, and will not permit any of its affiliates to, syndicate or issue,
attempt to syndicate or issue, announce or authorize the announcement of the
syndication or issuance of, or engage in discussions concerning the syndication
or issuance of, any debt facility or debt security (including any renewals
thereof) in the commercial bank market, without the prior written consent of
SSBI not to be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not limit the Company's ability to issue commercial paper, other
short-term debt under programs currently in place, equity or public debt
securities.

Citibank will act as the sole Administrative Agent for the Facility and SSBI
will act as Sole Arranger, Book Manager and Syndication Agent. No additional
agents, co-agents or arrangers will be appointed, or other titles conferred,
without the consent of SSBI and Citibank.

SECTION 4. FEES. In addition to the fees described in Annex I, the Company shall
pay the non-refundable fees set forth in that certain letter agreement dated the
date hereof (the "Fee Letter") between the Company and Citi/SSBI. The terms of
the Fee Letter are an integral part of Citibank's commitment hereunder and
constitute part of this Commitment Letter for all purposes hereof.

SECTION 5. INDEMNIFICATION. The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless
Citi/SSBI, each Lender and each of their respective affiliates and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives
(each, an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all claims, damages,
losses, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel), that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded
against any Indemnified Party (including, without limitation, in connection with
any investigation, litigation or proceeding or the preparation of a defense in
connection therewith), in each case arising out of or in connection with or by
reason of this Commitment Letter or the Operative Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any actual or proposed use of the proceeds of
the Facility, except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability or
expense resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. In the case of an investigation, litigation or other proceeding to
which the indemnity in this paragraph applies, such indemnity shall be effective
whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the
Company, any of its directors, security holders or creditors,

an Indemnified Party or any other person or an Indemnified Party is otherwise a
party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated.

No Indemnified Party shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort or
otherwise) to the Company or any of its security holders or creditors for or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except for direct damages
(as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (including,
without limitation, any loss of profits, business or anticipated savings))
resulting from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

SECTION 6. COSTS AND EXPENSES. The Company shall pay, or reimburse Citi/SSBI on
demand for, all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
Citi/SSBI (whether incurred before or after the date hereof) in connection with
the Facility and the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of this
Commitment Letter, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel, regardless of whether any of the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated. The Company shall also pay all costs and expenses of
Citi/SSBI (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel) incurred in connection with the enforcement of any of its rights and
remedies hereunder.

SECTION 7. CONFIDENTIALITY. By accepting delivery of this Commitment Letter, the
Company agrees that this Commitment Letter is for the Company's confidential use

the Company to any person other than the Company's officers, directors,
employees, accountants, attorneys and other advisors, and then only on a

hereof, the Company may disclose this letter (but not the Fee Letter or the
contents thereof) to the Target on a confidential basis in connection with the
Acquisition and (ii) the Company may make such other public disclosures of the
terms and conditions hereof as the Company is required by law, in the opinion of
the Company's counsel, to make (it being understood that this Section 7 shall

clause (ii) of this Section 7).

SECTION 8. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY. The Company represents

available to Citi/SSBI, any Lender or any potential Lender by the Company or any
of its affiliates or representatives in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby does not and will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements contained therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under
which such statements were or are made and (ii) all financial projections that
have been or will be prepared by the Company and made available to Citi/SSBI,
any Lender or any potential Lender have been or will be prepared in good faith
based upon reasonable assumptions (it being understood that such projections are
subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond
the

Company's control and that no assurance can be given that the projections will
be realized). The Company agrees to supplement the information and projections
from time to time until the Operative Documents become effective so that the
representations and warranties contained in this paragraph remain correct.

In accepting this Commitment Letter, you acknowledge that Citi/SSBI is entitled
to rely on the accuracy of the information furnished to it by or on behalf of
the Company and its affiliates and representatives without responsibility for
independent verification thereof.

SECTION 9. NO THIRD PARTY RELIANCE, ETC. The agreements of Citi/SSBI hereunder
and of any Lender that issues a commitment to provide financing under the
Facility are made solely for the benefit of the Company and may not be relied
upon or enforced by any other person. Please note that those matters that are
not covered or made clear herein are subject to mutual agreement of the parties.
The Company may not assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without Citi/SSBI's prior written consent. This Commitment Letter may

to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Commitment
Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or the actions of the parties
hereto in the negotiation, performance or enforcement hereof.

                                       Container Corporation I for all
                                       outstanding Senior Notes and Subordinated

                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

                  THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as
of September 27, 2001, is by and among Temple-Inland Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), Temple-Inland Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger
Subsidiary"), and Gaylord Container Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").

                                   WITNESSETH:

                  WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary and the Company have unanimously approved the acquisition of the
Company by Parent and Merger Subsidiary;

                  WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, it is proposed
that Merger Subsidiary shall make a cash tender offer (the "Offer") to acquire
all of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, par value
$.0001 per share (the "Company Common Stock"), of the Company (the "Shares"),
including the associated Rights (defined below in Section 4.3), in accordance
with the terms provided in this Agreement;

                  WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, it is proposed
that simultaneously with the commencement of the Offer, Parent or its designee
shall make (i) a tender offer (the "9-3/8% Senior Notes Tender Offer") for all
of the $200 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Company's
outstanding 9-3/8% Senior Notes due 2007 (the "9-3/8% Senior Notes"); (ii) a
tender offer (the "9-3/4% Senior Notes Tender Offer") for all of the $225
million aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Company's outstanding
9-3/4% Senior Notes due 2007 (the "9-3/4% Senior Notes," and, together with the
9-3/8% Senior Notes, the "Senior Notes"), and (iii) a tender offer (the "Senior
Subordinated Notes Tender Offer," and, together with the 9-3/8% Senior Notes
Tender Offer and the 9-3/4% Senior Notes Tender Offer, the "Notes Tender
Offers") for all of the $250 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of
the Company's outstanding 9-7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 (the "Senior
Subordinated Notes," and, together with the Senior Notes, the "Notes");

                  WHEREAS, consummation of the Offer is expressly conditioned
upon consummation of each of the Notes Tender Offers;

                  WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, the Board of each
of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company have approved this Agreement and
the Merger (as defined in Section 2.1) following the Offer in accordance with
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") and upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

                  WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company
Board") has determined that the consideration to be paid for each Share in
connection with the Offer and the Merger is fair to the holders of such Shares
and has resolved to recommend that the holders of such Shares accept the Offer
and approve this Agreement and each of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

                  WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent
and Merger Subsidiary to enter into this Agreement, Parent and certain
stockholders of the Company (collectively, the "Stockholders") are entering into
an agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the "Stockholders Agreement")
pursuant to which the Stockholders will agree to tender all of their Shares in
the Offer and to take certain other actions in furtherance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Stockholders Agreement; and

                  WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent
and Merger Subsidiary to enter into this Agreement, the Company, is entering
into a Stock Option Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the "Stock Option
Agreement"), with Parent and Merger Subsidiary pursuant to which the Company is
granting to Merger Subsidiary an option to purchase Shares upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Stock Option Agreement.

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein,
and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the
Company hereby agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                    THE OFFER

                  Section 1.1 The Offer. (a) Provided that (i) this Agreement
shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 10.1 and (ii) none of
the events set forth in Annex I hereto shall have occurred or be existing and
not have been waived, Merger Subsidiary shall, not later than five business days
from the first public announcement of the execution of this Agreement, commence
the Offer. Each Share (including the associated Right) accepted by Merger
Subsidiary in accordance with the Offer shall be purchased for $1.80, net to the
seller in cash, without interest. The Offer shall be subject to the conditions
(i) that there shall be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the
Offer prior to the expiration date of the Offer and not withdrawn a number of
Shares which, together with the Shares then owned by Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, represents at least two-thirds of the total number of outstanding
Shares, assuming the exercise of all outstanding warrants, options, rights and
convertible securities (if any) (other than the Rights, Parent's option to
acquire Company Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Option Agreement, to the
extent not then exercised and options cancelled pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
hereof) and the issuance of all Shares that the Company is obligated to issue
pursuant thereto (such total number of outstanding Shares being hereinafter
referred to as the "Fully Diluted Shares") (the "Minimum Stock Condition"), (ii)
that Parent shall have simultaneously accepted for payment Notes in each of the
Notes Tender Offers, and (iii) that the other conditions set forth in Annex I
hereto shall have been satisfied or waived. Parent and Merger Subsidiary
expressly reserve the right to waive the conditions to the Offer and to make any
change in the terms or conditions of the Offer; provided that, without the
written consent of the Company, no change may be made which changes the form or
amount of consideration to be paid (other than by adding consideration), imposes
conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex I or changes or
waives the Minimum Stock Condition or amends any other term of the Offer in a
manner materially adverse to the holders of Shares. If on the initial scheduled
expiration date of the Offer, which shall be no earlier than 20 business days
after the date the Offer is commenced, all conditions to the Offer shall not
have been satisfied or waived, Merger Subsidiary may, from time to time, in its
sole discretion, extend the expiration date; provided that without the prior
written consent of the Company, Merger Subsidiary may not extend the Offer
beyond December 28, 2001 (except that Parent may extend the expiration date of
the Offer after December 28, 2001 as required to comply with any rule,
regulation or interpretation of the SEC). Subject to the terms and conditions
of the Offer, Parent shall

cause Merger Subsidiary to accept for payment and pay for, as promptly as
practicable after the expiration of the Offer, all Shares validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. In addition, Merger Subsidiary may extend
the Offer after the acceptance of Shares thereunder for a further period of time
by means of a subsequent offering period under Rule 14d-11 promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), of not
more than 20 business days to meet the objective (which is not a condition to
the Offer) that there be validly tendered, in accordance with the terms of the
Offer, prior to the expiration date of the Offer (as so extended) and not
withdrawn a number of Shares, which together with Shares then owned by Parent
and Merger Subsidiary, represents at least 90% of the Fully Diluted Shares.

                  (b) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
and not later than five business days from the first public announcement of the
execution of this Agreement, Parent shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Subsidiary to, file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with any amendments or
supplements thereto and any other filings pursuant to which the Offer will be
made, the "Offer Documents"). Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company each
agree promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect. Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree to take all steps
necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC
and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents prior to their being filed with the SEC. In addition, Parent and
Merger Subsidiary agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any
comments, whether written or oral, that Parent or Merger Subsidiary or their
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments or other
communications.

                  Section 1.2 The Notes Tender Offers. (a) Provided that this
Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 10.1 and
none of the events or circumstances set forth in Annex I hereto shall have
occurred and be existing and not have been waived, Parent agrees that it or its
designee will commence the Notes Tender Offers as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, but in no event later than five business days
after the first public announcement of the execution hereof. The aggregate
consideration payable to each holder of

Notes pursuant to the Notes Tender Offers shall be an amount in cash set forth
in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement made by Parent in
connection with the Notes Tender Offers attached as Exhibit A hereto as amended
from time to time (the "Notes Offer to Purchase"). In connection with the Notes
Tender Offers, Parent intends to solicit consents to amend, eliminate or waive
certain sections of the Indenture relating to the 9-3/8% Senior Notes, dated as
of February 23, 1998 among the Company, the guarantors party thereto and State
Street Bank and Trust Company, as trustee, the Indenture relating to the 9-3/4%
Senior Notes, dated as of June 12, 1997 among the Company, the guarantors party
thereto and Fleet National Bank, as trustee, and the Indenture relating to the
Senior Subordinated Notes, dated as of February 23, 1998 among the Company, the
guarantors party thereto and Chase Bank of Texas, National Association, as
trustee (collectively, the "Indentures"), as set forth in the Notes Offer to
Purchase. Parent's obligation to accept for payment and pay for the Notes and
related consents tendered pursuant to the Notes Tender Offers shall be subject
to the conditions that (i) the aggregate principal amount of each series of
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Notes
Tender Offers, combined with the Notes already owned by Parent, Merger
Subsidiary and their affiliates, constitutes at least 90% of the aggregate
principal amount of each of the 9-3/8% Senior Notes, the 9-3/4% Senior Notes and
the Senior Subordinated Notes outstanding at the expiration of the Notes Tender
Offer with respect to each of such series of Notes (the "Minimum Note
Condition"), (ii) Parent receives consents from at least a majority of the
outstanding principal amount of each series of the Notes, and (iii) the other
conditions set forth in Annex I hereto shall have been satisfied or waived
(including, without limitation, the Minimum Stock Condition). Parent expressly
reserves the right to waive any such condition (including without limitation the
Minimum Note Condition), to increase the price payable for each Note and related
consent tendered in the Notes Tender Offers, and to make any other changes in
the terms and conditions of the Notes Tender Offers; provided, however, that
Parent agrees that no change may be made without the consent of the Company
which decreases the price payable for each Note and related consent tendered in
the Notes Tender Offers, which increases the Minimum Note Condition, which
eliminates the Minimum Stock Condition, which amends or eliminates any section
of the Indentures, that, by the terms thereof, requires the approval of the
holders of 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, which
otherwise modifies or amends the conditions to the Notes Tender Offers or any
other term of the Notes Tender Offers in a manner that is materially adverse to
the tendering holders of the Notes, which imposes conditions to the Notes Tender
Offers in addition to those set forth in Annex I hereto, or which extends the
expiration date of the Notes Tender Offers beyond December 28, 2001 (except that
Parent may extend the expiration date of the

Notes Tender Offers after December 28, 2001 as required to comply with any rule,
regulation or interpretation of the SEC or to coincide with the termination date
of the Offer); provided, however, that Parent expressly reserves the right, in
its sole discretion, to reduce the minimum percentage of any series of Notes to
be purchased in the Notes Tender Offers. The Notes Tender Offers shall provide
that any tender of Notes under the Notes Tender Offers shall also constitute a
consent to the amendments to the Indentures. Subject to the terms and
conditions of the Notes Tender Offers (including, without limitation, the
Minimum Note Condition), Parent agrees to accept for payment and to pay for, as
promptly as practicable after expiration of the Notes Tender Offers, all Notes
and related consents validly tendered and not withdrawn.

                  (b) Parent agrees to disseminate to the record holders of the
Notes, and to the extent disclosed to Parent by the Company, the beneficial
owners of the Notes (collectively, the "Noteholders"), the Notes Tender Offers
pursuant to the terms of the Notes Offer to Purchase, together with related
letters of transmittal and similar ancillary agreements (such documents,
together with all supplements and amendments thereto, being referred to herein
collectively as the "Notes Tender Offers Documents"), which shall have been
provided to the Company and its counsel a reasonable time prior to dissemination
to holders of the Notes and to which the Company shall not have reasonably
objected. Parent and the Company agree to correct promptly any information
provided by any of them for use in the Notes Tender Offers Documents which shall
have become false or misleading, and Parent further agrees to take all steps
necessary to cause the Notes Tender Offers Documents as so corrected to be
disseminated to holders of Notes, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Federal securities laws.

                  (c) At such time as Parent receives Consents from at least a
majority of each series of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, the
Company agrees to execute, and to cause the guarantors party to the Indentures
to execute, and will use all reasonable efforts to cause the trustees under the
Indentures to execute, supplemental indentures (the "Supplemental Indentures")
in order to give effect to the amendments of the Indentures contemplated in the
Notes Tender Offers Documents; provided, however, that notwithstanding the fact
that the Supplemental Indentures will become effective upon such execution, the
proposed amendments set forth therein (the "Proposed Amendments") will not
become operative unless and until the Minimum Note Condition is satisfied or
waived and all other conditions to the Notes Tender Offers set forth on Annex I
have been satisfied or waived by Parent and Parent accepts all Notes (and
related Consents) validly tendered for purchase and

payment pursuant to the Notes Tender Offers. In such event, the parties hereto
agree that the Proposed Amendments will be deemed operative as of immediately
prior to such acceptance for payment, and Parent will thereafter be obligated to
make all payments for the Notes (and related Consents) so tendered.

                  (d) The Company agrees to promptly furnish Parent with mailing
labels containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Notes and
security position listings of the Notes held in depositories, each as of a
recent date, together with all other available listings and computer files
containing names, addresses and security position listings of Noteholders. The
Company agrees to furnish Parent with such additional information, including,
without limitation, updated listings and computer files of Noteholders, mailing
labels and security position listings, and such other assistance as Parent or
its agents may reasonably request. Subject to the requirements of applicable
law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Notes Tender
Offers Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby, Parent shall hold in confidence the
information contained in such labels, listings and files, shall use such
information only in connection with the Notes Tender Offers and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with Section 10.1, shall deliver to
or cause to be delivered to the Company all copies of such information, labels,
listings and files then in its possession or in the possession of its agents or
representatives.

                  Section 1.3 Company Action. (a) The Company hereby approves of
and consents to the Offer and the Notes Tender Offers and represents that the
Company Board has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are
advisable and are fair to and in the best interest of the Company's
stockholders, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement, including the Offer, the
Merger, the Stock Option Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, which approval constitutes
approval under Section 203 of the DGCL such that the Offer, the Merger, this
Agreement, the Stock Option Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are not and shall not be
subject to any restriction of Section 203 of the DGCL, and (iii) resolved to
recommend that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their
Shares to Merger Subsidiary thereunder and approve and adopt this Agreement and
the Merger (the recommendations referred to in this clause (iii) are
collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "Recommendations"). The
Company further represents that Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and Rothschild Inc.
have rendered to the Company Board their opinions that the consideration to be

received by the Company's stockholders pursuant to this Agreement is fair to
such stockholders from a financial point of view. The Company has been advised
that all of its directors and executive officers presently intend to tender
their Shares pursuant to the Offer.

                  (b) As soon as practicable on the day that the Offer is
commenced, the Company will file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of
Shares a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") which shall
contain, except as provided in Section 6.4, the Recommendations. At the time the
Offer Documents are first mailed to the stockholders of the Company, the Company
shall mail or cause to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company such
Schedule 14D-9 together with such Offer Documents. The Company further agrees to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to
holders of the Shares, as and to the extent required by applicable Federal
securities laws. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, on the other hand, agrees promptly to correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect and the Company further
agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected
to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of the Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities laws.
Parent and its counsel shall be given the opportunity to review the Schedule
14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC. In addition, the Company agrees to
provide Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their counsel with any comments, whether
written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the
receipt of such comments or other communications.

                  (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly
furnish Merger Subsidiary with mailing labels containing the names and addresses
of all record holders of Shares and with security position listings of Shares
held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, together with all other
available listings and computer files containing names, addresses and security
position listings of record holders and non-objecting beneficial owners of
Shares. The Company shall furnish Merger Subsidiary with such additional
information, including, without limitation, updated listings and computer files
of stockholders, mailing labels and security position listings, and such other
assistance as Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their agents may reasonably require
in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares.
Subject to the requirements of applicable law, and except for

such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall hold in confidence the information contained in such labels,
listings and files, shall use such information solely in connection with the
Offer and the Merger, and, if this Agreement is terminated, will upon the
request of the Company deliver or cause to be delivered to the Company all
copies of such information, labels, listings and files then in their possession
or in the possession of their agents or representatives.

                  Section 1.4 Directors. (a) Promptly upon the purchase of and
payment for Shares by Merger Subsidiary or any of its affiliates pursuant to the
Offer as a result of which Parent or Merger Subsidiary beneficially own at least
a majority of the outstanding Shares, Parent shall be entitled to designate the
number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board
that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company
Board (giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to
this Section 1.4) and (ii) the percentage that the number of Shares owned by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary (including Shares accepted for payment) bears to
the total number of Shares outstanding. In furtherance thereof, the Company
shall, upon request of the Parent, use its best efforts promptly either to
increase the size of its Board or to secure the resignations of such number of
its incumbent directors, or both, as is necessary to enable such designees of
Parent to be so elected or appointed to the Company's Board, and the Company
shall take all actions available to the Company to cause such designees of
Parent to be so elected and, subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, shall cause Parent's designees to be so
elected. At such time, the Company shall, if requested by Parent, also take all
action necessary to cause persons designated by Parent to constitute the same
percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on (i) each committee of
the Company Board, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each
Subsidiary of the Company and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each
such board.

                  (b) The Company shall promptly take all actions required
pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under Section 1.4(a), including
mailing to stockholders the information required by such Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder as is necessary to enable
Parent's designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board immediately
after the purchase of and payment for any Shares by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 4.1) as a result of which Parent and its
Subsidiaries beneficially own at least a majority of then

outstanding Shares. Parent or Merger Subsidiary will supply the Company all
information with respect to either of them and their nominees, officers,
directors and affiliates required to be disclosed by such Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The provisions of this
Section 1.4 are in addition to and shall not limit any rights which Merger
Subsidiary, Parent or any of their affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial
owner of Shares as a matter of law with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise.

                  (c) In the event that Parent's designees are elected or
appointed to the Company Board, until the Effective Time, the Company Board
shall have at least two directors who are directors on the date hereof and are
not employees of the Company ("Independent Directors"), provided that, in such
event, if the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below two for any
reason whatsoever, any remaining Independent Directors (or Independent Director,
if there be only one remaining) shall be entitled to designate persons to fill
such vacancies who shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of
this Agreement or, if no Independent Director then remains, the other directors
shall designate two persons to fill such vacancies who shall not be
stockholders, affiliates, associates or employees of Parent, Merger Subsidiary
or the Company, and such persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for
purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in the event that Parent's designees constitute a majority of the
directors on the Company Board, the affirmative vote of a majority of the
Independent Directors shall be required after the acceptance for payment of
Shares pursuant to the Offer and prior to the Effective Time, to (a) amend or
terminate this Agreement by the Company, (b) cause the Company to extend or
waive the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
Parent or Merger Subsidiary under this Agreement, (c) waive any of the Company's
rights hereunder, or (d) take any other action under or in connection with this
Agreement if such action materially and adversely affects holders of Shares
other than Parent or Merger Subsidiary; provided, that if, notwithstanding
reasonable efforts set forth above to ensure that at least two directors are
Independent Directors, there shall be no such directors, such actions (except
for any amendment, modification or waiver of Sections 2.3 or 8.1 hereof) may be
effected by unanimous vote of the entire Company Board.
