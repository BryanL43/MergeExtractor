                  MERGER PROPOSED--YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

The respective boards of directors of Harris Interactive Inc. ("Harris") and
Total Research Corporation ("Total") have agreed on a merger. The merger is
structured so that Harris will be the surviving publicly-traded company and
Total will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Harris. Total stockholders will
receive 1.222 shares of Harris common stock for each share of Total common stock
they own. Harris stockholders will continue to own their existing shares. Harris
expects to issue approximately ______ shares of its common stock in the merger.
If the merger was completed today and assuming no additional issuances of common
stock or options to purchase common stock by Harris or Total, the shares of
Harris common stock to be issued to Total stockholders would represent
approximately 32.76% of the shares of Harris common stock outstanding after the
merger on a fully diluted basis. Likewise, the shares of Harris common stock
held by Harris stockholders prior to the merger would represent approximately
67.25% of the shares of Harris common stock outstanding after the merger on a
fully diluted basis. Upon completion of the merger, shares of Total common stock
will be delisted and will no longer be traded on the Nasdaq National Market. The
merger cannot be completed unless the Total stockholders adopt the merger
agreement and the Harris stockholders approve the issuance of shares of Harris
common stock in connection with the merger. Total has scheduled a special
meeting for the Total stockholders to vote on these matters, and the Harris
stockholders will vote on these matters at Harris's annual meeting. Your vote is
very important.

Whether or not you plan to attend a meeting, please take the time to vote by
completing and mailing the enclosed proxy card to Harris or Total, as
applicable. If you sign, date and mail your proxy card without indicating how
you want to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote in favor of the merger if
you are a Total stockholder, and in favor of the issuance of shares of Harris
common stock in connection with the merger if you are a Harris stockholder.

Only stockholders of record of Total as of _________, 2001 and stockholders of
record of Harris as of ____________, 2001 are entitled to attend and vote at the
meetings. The dates, times and places of the meetings are as follows:

For Harris stockholders:                        For Total stockholders:

(date)                                          (date)
(time)                                          (time)
(location)                                      (location)

         Shares of Harris common stock are listed on the Nasdaq National Market
under the symbol "HPOL". Shares of Total common stock are listed on the Nasdaq
National Market under the symbol "TOTL".

         This Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus provides detailed information
about the proposed merger. Stockholders are encouraged to read this entire Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus carefully. In addition, a copy of each of Total's and
Harris's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001

additional information about Harris and Total from documents that each company
has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").

Harris, for its annual meeting of stockholders, and of Total, for its special
meeting of stockholders. As allowed by SEC rules, this Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus does not contain all of the information you can find in the
registration statement or the exhibits to the registration statement. You may
obtain copies of the Form S-4, and any amendments to that document, in the
manner described above.

         The SEC allows each of Harris and Total to "incorporate by reference"
certain information into this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which means that
Harris and Total may disclose important information to their respective
stockholders about each company's business and finances by referring them to
another document filed separately with the SEC. This Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus incorporates by reference the documents set forth below
that Harris and Total have previously filed with the SEC. These documents

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

         Q. Why are Harris and Total proposing the merger?

         A. Harris and Total are engaged in complementary businesses in the
market research and polling industry, and the merger is expected to create
opportunities for revenue growth, cost savings and other synergies. By
synergies, it is meant that the companies will be able to sell to one another's
customers, offer customers more comprehensive and diverse products and services,
use a combined worldwide network, and pursue jointly future acquisitions. This
is intended to result in increased value for stockholders.

         Q. What will happen to Total as a result of the merger?

         A. Upon consummation of the merger, Total will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Harris.

         Q. What will stockholders receive in the merger?

         A. Total stockholders will receive 1.222 shares of Harris common stock
in exchange for each of their shares of Total common stock. This fraction is
referred to as the "exchange ratio."

         Harris stockholders will not change their holdings of shares of Harris
common stock as a result of the merger.

         Q. When will the merger be completed?

         A. Harris and Total and their respective professional advisors are
working diligently to complete the merger as quickly as possible. If the merger
agreement is adopted by the Total stockholders and the issuance of shares of
Harris common stock in connection with the merger is approved by the Harris
stockholders, and all other conditions to the closing of the merger are met or
waived, the merger is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of
calendar year 2001.

         Q. What should stockholders do now?

         A. After carefully reading and considering the information contained in
this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, stockholders should complete, sign, date
and mail their proxy card in the enclosed postage-prepaid envelope as soon as
possible so that their shares will be voted at the meetings. The Board of
Directors of Total unanimously recommends voting for adoption of the merger
agreement. The Board of Directors of Harris unanimously recommends voting for
approval of the issuance of shares of Harris common stock in connection with the
merger.

         Total stockholders should not send in their share certificates now.
After the merger is completed, Total stockholders will receive written
instructions for exchanging their share certificates.

         Q. What if a stockholder doesn't vote?

         A. If a Total stockholder fails to respond, it will have the same
effect as a vote against adoption of the merger agreement. If a Total
stockholder responds and does not indicate how such stockholder desires to vote,
such stockholder's proxy will be counted as a vote in favor of adoption of the
merger agreement. If a Total stockholder responds and abstains from voting, such
stockholder's proxy will have the same effect as a vote against adoption of the
merger agreement.

            So long as a quorum is present at the annual meeting, if a Harris
stockholder fails to respond, it will have no effect on the proposal relating to
the issuance of shares of Harris common stock in connection with the merger. If
a Harris stockholder responds and does not indicate how such stockholder desires
to vote, such stockholder's proxy will be counted as a vote in favor of the
issuance of shares of Harris common stock in connection with the merger and in
favor of all other proposals presented at the annual meeting. If a Harris
stockholder responds and abstains from voting, such stockholder's proxy will
have the same effect as a vote against the issuance of shares of Harris common
stock in connection with the merger.

         Q. Can stockholders change their vote?

         A. Yes. Stockholders of record can change their vote at any time prior
to the applicable meeting by mailing a later-dated signed proxy card or by
attending their meeting and voting in person.

         Q. How do stockholders vote if their shares of Harris common stock or
Total common stock are held by a bank or broker?

         A. Stockholders whose shares are held by a bank, broker or other
fiduciary must contact the fiduciary to vote on their behalf.

         If a Total stockholder whose shares are held by a bank, broker or other
fiduciary does not instruct the fiduciary on how to vote such stockholder's
shares, the fiduciary will not vote such shares, which will have the same effect
as a vote against the adoption of the merger agreement.

         If a Harris stockholder whose shares are held by a bank, broker or
other fiduciary does not instruct the fiduciary on how to vote such
stockholder's shares, the fiduciary will not vote such shares. This will have
the same effect as a vote against the issuance of shares of Harris common stock
in connection with the merger.

         Q. What should stockholders do if they have questions?

         A. Total stockholders should call Patti Hoffman at (609) 919-2548
(collect). Harris stockholders should call Dan Hucko, Harris's Director of
Investor Relations, at (800) 866-7655 (toll free in the United States and
Canada) or (716) 272-8400 (collect).

                                  The Companies

HARRIS INTERACTIVE INC.
135 Corporate Woods
Rochester, New York  14623
(716) 272-8400

         Harris, a Delaware corporation, together with its subsidiaries, is a
leading market research, polling and consulting firm, which uses Internet-based
and traditional methodologies to provide its worldwide customers with critical
market knowledge in many industries. Known for its HARRIS POLLSM, Harris has
over 45 years of experience in providing its clients with information about the
views, experiences and attitudes of people worldwide. Harris's Internet-based
and traditional market research and polling services include:

         -        research studies conducted on specific issues for specific
                  customers (Custom Research);

         -        research studies on issues of general interest developed and
                  sold to numerous clients (Multi-Client Research);

         -        research conducted for other research firms (Service Bureau
                  Research); and

         -        outsourced customer relationship services (Customer
                  Relationship Services).

         In September 1997, Harris began developing its Internet Panel and its
proprietary technology infrastructure to provide its clients with online market
research and polling products and services. Harris's Internet Panel presently
consists of several million individuals who have voluntarily agreed to
participate in various online market research and polling studies. Harris
believes that its Internet Panel is larger than those of any of its competitors.
Consequently, Harris believes that it is the leading Internet-based market
research and polling firm in the world. Harris's extensive Internet Panel and
proprietary technology infrastructure enable it to offer Internet-based market
research and polling products and services which meet its clients' needs for
fast, comprehensive and accurate information.

         Historically, Harris provided its market research services exclusively
through traditional methodologies, including direct mail, telephone surveys,
mall intercepts, focus groups and in-person interviews. Harris believes,
however, that the Internet is changing the market research and polling industry.
Accordingly, Harris has made, and will continue to make, significant
expenditures in the development of its technology platform, its Internet Panel
and management and staff to lead the transformation of the market research and
polling industry to an Internet-based platform.

         For further information regarding the business of Harris, see Harris's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, accompanying
this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

         Under Delaware law, which governs the merger, neither the Total
stockholders nor the Harris stockholders have appraisal rights in connection
with the merger. See "Appraisal Rights" on page _____.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

         The merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Internal Revenue Code"). Assuming the merger qualifies as a
reorganization, holders of shares of Total common stock will not recognize gain
or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the
exchange of their shares of Total common stock for shares of Harris common stock
in the merger, except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Harris
common stock. To review the federal income tax consequences of the merger in
greater detail, see "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on
page _____.

         Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences of the merger
to Total's stockholders will depend on the facts of each stockholder's own
situation. Total stockholders should consult their own tax advisors for a full
understanding of the tax consequences of the merger to them.

                  stockholders in connection with the merger;

         -        the absence of any law, decree, injunction, order or
                  institution of any judicial or administrative proceeding that

         -        all authorizations, consents, orders or approvals of, and all
                  expirations or terminations of any waiting periods imposed by,

                  force and effect;

         -        the registration statement on Form S-4, of which this Joint

         -        receipt of opinions from Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP
                  and Harris Beach LLP to the effect that, for United States

                  reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
                  Internal Revenue Code;

         -        approval for listing on the Nasdaq National Market of the

                  the merger; and

         -        other customary contractual conditions set forth in the merger
                  agreement.

         For further information, see "Conditions To the Merger" beginning on
page _____.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER

         Harris and Total may terminate the merger agreement if both parties
consent in writing. In addition, either Harris or Total may terminate the merger
agreement if:

         -        the merger is not consummated by January 31, 2002 through no
                  fault of the party seeking to call off the merger;

         -        the Total stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement;

         -        the Harris stockholders do not approve the issuance of shares
                  of Harris common stock in connection with the merger;

         -        there are legal restraints preventing the merger; or

         -        there is a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
                  agreement contained in the merger agreement which would give
                  rise to a failure of a condition set forth in the merger
                  agreement and which breach is incurable or has not been cured
                  within ten business days of written notice thereof.

         Harris or Total may also terminate the merger agreement if the other
party's board of directors withdraws or adversely modifies its approval,
adoption or recommendation of the merger agreement or fails to hold its
respective stockholders meeting as contemplated by the merger agreement or to
solicit proxies in connection therewith.

         Subject to certain conditions, Total may terminate the merger agreement
to accept an acquisition proposal if Total's Board of Directors reasonably
believes, after consultation with its financial advisor, that such acquisition
proposal is more favorable from a financial point of view to Total's
stockholders than the proposed merger with Harris.

         For further information, see "Termination of the Merger" beginning on
page ___.

TERMINATION FEE AND EXPENSES

         If the merger is terminated under specified circumstances, generally
involving an alternative acquisition transaction, Total may be required to pay a
termination fee of $1,250,000 to Harris and to reimburse Harris for up to
$500,000 of Harris's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. If the merger is
terminated by Harris or Total on account of a breach by the other party, the
breaching party may be required to reimburse the other party for up to $625,000
of such other party's reasonable costs and expenses.

         The termination fee payable by Total, as well as the no-solicitation
provisions described below, may have the effect of discouraging persons who
might be interested in entering into a business combination with Total from
proposing a business combination transaction. This may be so even where the
consideration payable to Total stockholders in the other transaction would
exceed the consideration payable in the merger.

         For further information, see "Termination Fee and Expenses" beginning
on page ___.

NO SOLICITATION

         Total has agreed that it will not solicit or encourage the initiation
of any inquiries or proposals regarding any alternative acquisition transaction
with third parties. Total may respond to unsolicited transaction proposals if
Total's Board of Directors reasonably determines in good faith, after due
consultation with its legal advisor, that it is or is reasonably likely to be
required to do so in order to discharge properly its fiduciary duties. Total
must promptly notify Harris if it receives proposals for any such alternative
acquisition transactions. For further information, see "No Solicitation"
beginning on page ___.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

         The merger will be accounted for as a purchase by Harris in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. For further information, see
"Accounting Treatment" on page ______.

OPINION OF TOTAL'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

         Total's financial advisor, Howard, Lawson & Co., LLC ("HL&Co"), has
given a written opinion to Total's Board of Directors as to the fairness, as of
August 5, 2001, to Total, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio
set forth in the merger agreement. The full text of the written opinion of
HL&Co, dated August 5, 2001, is attached to this Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus as Annex B and should be read carefully in its entirety.
The opinion of HL&Co is directed to Total's Board of Directors and does not
constitute a recommendation to any stockholder how to vote on the adoption of
the merger agreement. For further information, see "Opinion of Total's Financial
Advisor" beginning on page ___.

OPINION OF HARRIS'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

         Harris's financial advisor, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, Inc. ("U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray"), has given a written opinion to Harris's Board of
Directors as to the fairness to Harris, from a financial point of view, of the
exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement. The full text of the written
opinion of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, dated August 5, 2001, is attached to this
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus as Annex C and should be read carefully in its
entirety. The opinion of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray is directed to Harris's
Board of Directors and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder
how to vote on the issuance of shares of Harris common stock to be delivered in
connection with the merger. For further information, see "Opinion of Harris's
Financial Advisor" beginning on page ___.

                             Other Harris Proposals

         The other proposals being presented to Harris stockholders at the
Harris annual meeting are:

         1.       The re-election of Thomas D. Berman and David H. Clemm as
                  directors, to serve for the ensuing three years; and

         2.       An amendment to Harris's Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase
                  the number of shares of Harris common stock reserved for
                  issuance under the Long-Term Incentive Plan from 2,750,000 to
                  3,250,000.

                                  RISK FACTORS

         In evaluating the merger and the merger agreement, stockholders should
take into account the following risks, as well as other information included in
or incorporated by reference into this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
including Harris's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2001 and Total's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2001, each of which accompanies this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus:

THE EXCHANGE RATIO FOR SHARES OF HARRIS COMMON STOCK TO BE RECEIVED IN THE
MERGER IS FIXED AND WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED IN THE EVENT OF ANY CHANGE IN STOCK
PRICE.

         Under the merger agreement, each share of Total common stock will be
converted into the right to receive 1.222 shares of Harris common stock. This
exchange ratio is a fixed number and will not be adjusted in the event of any
increase or decrease in the price of shares of Harris common stock or Total
common stock. The respective prices of shares of Harris common stock and Total
common stock at the completion of the merger may vary from their respective
prices on the date of this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and on the
respective dates of the Total special meeting and the Harris annual meeting.
These prices may vary as a result of changes in the business, operations or
prospects of Harris and/or Total, market assessments of the likelihood that the
merger will be completed, the timing of the completion of the merger, the
prospects of post-merger operations, regulatory considerations, general market
and economic conditions and other factors. Because the date that the merger is
completed may be later than the respective dates of the Total special meeting
and the Harris annual meeting, the respective prices of shares of Harris common
stock and Total common stock on the dates of the respective meetings may not be
indicative of their respective prices on the date the merger is completed. Total
stockholders and Harris stockholders are encouraged to obtain current market
quotations for shares of Harris common stock and Total common stock.

THE INTEGRATION OF HARRIS AND TOTAL FOLLOWING THE MERGER WILL PRESENT
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES.

         Harris and Total will face significant challenges in combining their
operations and product and service offerings in a timely and efficient manner
and retaining key personnel. The integration of Harris and Total will be complex
and time consuming. The failure to integrate successfully Harris and Total and
to manage successfully the challenges presented by the integration process may
result in Harris and Total not achieving the anticipated potential benefits of
the merger.

THE PRICE OF SHARES OF HARRIS COMMON STOCK MAY BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS DIFFERENT
FROM THOSE AFFECTING THE PRICE OF SHARES OF TOTAL COMMON STOCK.

         Upon completion of the merger, holders of shares of Total common stock
will become holders of shares of Harris common stock. Harris's business is
different in certain respects from that of Total, and Harris's results of
operations, as well as the price of shares of Harris common stock, may be
affected by factors different than those affecting Total's results of operations
and the price of shares of Total common stock. For a discussion of Harris's and
Total's businesses and certain factors to consider in connection with such
businesses, see Harris's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2001 and Total's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2001, each of which accompanies and is incorporated by reference in
this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus are "forward-looking statements" within the

any statements regarding the timing or benefits of the merger or the value of
the shares of Harris common stock to be received by Total stockholders as

service expansion, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
contingencies, many of which are beyond the control of Harris and Total and
which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially
from anticipated results, performance or achievements. Factors that might affect

         -        changes in government regulation;

         -        changes in tax requirements, including tax rate changes, new
                  tax laws and revised tax law interpretations;

         -        economic and political conditions in international markets;

         -        the ability to achieve anticipated synergies in connection
                  with the merger; and

         -        the timing, impact and other uncertainties of future mergers
                  or acquisitions by Harris.

UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

         The following table summarizes on a per share basis certain (i)
historical financial information, and (ii) unaudited pro forma and equivalent
pro forma financial information.

         The unaudited pro forma supplemental financial information illustrates
the effects of the merger as if the merger had occurred at July 1, 2000 for the
statement of income information and at June 30, 2001 for the balance sheet
information. The unaudited pro forma financial information, has been prepared
based on the purchase method of accounting and does not include the impact of
non-recurring charges directly attributable to the merger. The unaudited pro
forma per share information for Harris is based on the weighted average number
of outstanding shares of Harris common stock adjusted to include the number of
shares of Harris common stock that would be issued in the merger in exchange for
the outstanding shares of Total common stock, based on the number of shares of
Total common stock outstanding for the period reported.

         All potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the calculation
of diluted net loss per share, as the effect would be anti-dilutive.

         The unaudited equivalent pro forma per share information for Total is
based on the unaudited pro forma amounts per share on a combined basis
multiplied by the exchange ratio of 1.222. The information set forth below is
qualified in its entirety by reference to, and should be read in conjunction
with, the historical consolidated financial information of Harris and Total
incorporated by reference in this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the
"Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information" included elsewhere in this
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

         Dividends

         Since Harris became a public company on December 6, 1999, it has not
declared or paid dividends and does not intend to pay any dividends on its
capital stock in the foreseeable future. Harris's future dividend policy will
depend on its earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, the

requirements of any financing agreements to which it may be a party, and on
other factors considered relevant by its Board of Directors.

         Total's policy is to retain earnings to support the growth of its
business and Total has not paid dividends to date. Total does not intend to
change this policy at the present time.

         Under the terms of the merger agreement, each of Harris and Total is
restricted from declaring, making or paying any dividend or other distribution
or payment with respect to its capital stock from the date of the merger
agreement until the earlier of the termination of the merger agreement or the
consummation of the merger.

                              TOTAL SPECIAL MEETING

JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS

         This Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is being furnished to Total
stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by Total's Board of
Directors regarding the proposed merger. This Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
is first being furnished to Total stockholders on or about , 2001.

DATE, TIME AND PLACE

         The special meeting of Total stockholders will be held at _____________
on ___________________, 2001, at ___________ [a.m./p.m.], Eastern Time.

PURPOSE OF THE TOTAL SPECIAL MEETING

         At the special meeting, Total stockholders will consider and vote upon
a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, dated as of August 5, 2001, by and
among Total, Harris and Merger Sub. Adoption of the merger agreement will also
constitute approval of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement. The merger agreement provides, among other things, that Merger
Sub will be merged with and into Total and each outstanding share of Total
common stock will be exchanged for 1.222 shares of Harris common stock. Total is
not proposing any matters other than the adoption of the merger agreement at the
special meeting.

RECORD DATE; VOTING RIGHTS; QUORUM; REQUIRED VOTE

         The close of business on , 2001 is the record date for determining the
holders of shares of Total common stock who are entitled to receive notice of
and to vote at the special meeting or at any adjournment or adjournments of the
special meeting. Total has one class of capital stock outstanding: common stock,
par value $.001 per share. Each holder of shares of Total common stock is
entitled to one vote for each share held. The holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Total common stock entitled to vote must be present at the
special meeting, in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum to transact
business. The affirmative vote of the holders of shares representing at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of Total common stock entitled to vote is
required to adopt the merger agreement. On the record date, shares of Total
common stock were outstanding, excluding shares held in treasury, and were held
by approximately ___________ holders of record.

         Total's officers, directors and affiliates have voting power with
respect to an aggregate of approximately __________ shares of Total common
stock, or approximately __% of Total's total voting power outstanding as of the
record date. It is currently expected that each such executive officer, director
and affiliate of Total will vote the shares of Total common stock beneficially
held by him or her for the

adoption of the merger agreement. In addition, all of the directors of Total
have entered into voting agreements with Harris that obligate them to vote all
of their shares of Total common stock, which represents in the aggregate
approximately 24% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Total common
stock, in favor of adoption of the merger agreement.

         Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Total special meeting will be
tabulated and will determine whether or not a quorum is present. Abstentions and
broker non-votes will be treated as shares present in determining whether Total
has a quorum for the special meeting. However, because adoption of the merger
agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Total common stock, abstentions and broker non-votes will
have the same effect as a vote against adoption of the merger agreement. A
broker non-vote means a broker or other fiduciary or nominee indicates on a
proxy that it does not have direction or authority to vote certain shares. A
broker or other fiduciary or nominee will vote shares of Total common stock only
if the beneficial owner of such shares provides instructions on how to vote by
following the instructions provided by such broker, fiduciary or other nominee.

         Total's Board of Directors urges the Total stockholders to sign, date
and return the enclosed proxy card as promptly as possible in the enclosed
postage-prepaid envelope.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF TOTAL

         Total's Board of Directors has unanimously approved and adopted the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Total's Board of
Directors has determined that the merger agreement is fair to and in the best
interests of Total and its stockholders and unanimously recommends that Total's
stockholders vote for the adoption of the merger agreement. See "Recommendation
of the Board of Directors of Total; Reasons of Total for the Merger" beginning
on page __, and "Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger" beginning on page
__.

PROXIES; REVOCATION

         A proxy card is enclosed for use by Total stockholders. Total's Board
of Directors requests that stockholders sign and return the proxy card in the
accompanying envelope. No postage is required if

mailed within the United States. If stockholders have questions or requests for
assistance in completing and submitting proxy cards, they should contact       ,
a firm retained by Total, at the following address and telephone number:

                            -------------------------

                            -------------------------

                            -------------------------

         All properly executed proxies that are not revoked will be voted at the
special meeting as instructed on those proxies. A stockholder who executes and
returns a proxy may revoke it at any time before it is voted, but only by
executing and returning a proxy bearing a later date, by giving written notice
of revocation to any of the persons named as proxies or to the Secretary of
Total, or by attending the special meeting and voting in person. If you
instructed a nominee on how to vote your shares of Total common stock, you must
follow directions received from your nominee to change your vote. A proxy that
has been properly executed, but has otherwise been left blank, will be voted for
the adoption of the merger agreement, unless the proxy is revoked before the
vote is taken. Shares that are not voted will have the same effect as a vote
against adoption of the merger agreement.

         Total's Board of Directors is unaware of any other matters that may be
presented for action at the Total special meeting. If other matters do properly
come before the meeting, however, it is intended that shares represented by
proxies in the enclosed form will be voted or not voted by the persons named in
the proxies in their discretion, provided that no proxy that is voted against
adoption of the merger agreement will be voted in favor of any adjournment or
adjournments of the Total special meeting for the purpose of soliciting
additional proxies.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

         Management of Total may use the services of its directors, officers and
employees in soliciting proxies, who will not receive any additional
compensation therefor, but who will be reimbursed for their out-of-pocket
expenses. Total will reimburse banks, brokers, nominees, custodians and
fiduciaries for their expenses in forwarding copies of the proxy soliciting
material to the beneficial owners of the stock held by such persons and in
requesting authority for the execution of proxies. In addition, Total has
retained ........ to assist with the solicitation of proxies for a fee not to
exceed $_________, plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. Total and
Harris will pay their respective expenses incurred in connection with the
filing, printing and mailing of this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. If the
merger is not consummated, the parties will share equally in the aggregate
filing, printing and mailing expenses.

         This Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is also being furnished by Harris

         1.       to approve the issuance of 1.222 shares of Harris common stock
                  for each outstanding share of Total common stock in connection
                  with the merger;

         2.       to re-elect Thomas D. Berman and David H. Clemm as directors
                  of Harris, to serve for the ensuing three years; and

         3.       to approve an amendment to Harris's Long-Term Incentive Plan
                  to increase the number of shares of Harris common stock
                  reserved for issuance under the Long-Term Incentive Plan from
                  2,750,000 to 3,250,000.

         The consummation of the merger is not conditioned on the approval by
the Harris stockholders of proposals 2 or 3.

RECORD DATE; VOTING RIGHTS; QUORUM; REQUIRED VOTE

         The close of business on _______, 2001 is the record date for
determining the holders of shares of Harris common stock who are entitled to
receive notice of and to vote at the Harris annual meeting or at any adjournment
or postponement of the Harris annual meeting.

         Harris has one class of capital stock outstanding: common stock, par
value $.001 per share. Each holder of shares of Harris common stock is entitled
to one vote for each share held. The holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Harris common stock entitled to vote must be present at the annual
meeting, in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum to transact business.

         The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Harris common stock present and entitled to vote at the annual meeting
is required to approve the issuance of shares of Harris common stock in
connection with the merger and the amendment to Harris's Long-Term Incentive
Plan to increase the number of shares of Harris common stock reserved for
issuance under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. The affirmative vote of a plurality
of the votes cast at the annual meeting is required for the re-election of the
director nominees. On the record date, there were shares of Harris common stock
outstanding, excluding shares held in treasury, held by approximately holders of
record.

         Harris's officers and directors and their affiliates have voting power
with respect to an aggregate of approximately _________ shares of Harris common
stock, or approximately ______% of Harris's aggregate voting power, outstanding
as of the record date. It is currently expected that each such officer and
director of Harris and his or her affiliates will vote the shares of Harris
common stock beneficially held by him, her or it for the approval of the
issuance of shares of Harris common stock in connection with the merger, the
re-election of Thomas D. Berman and David H. Clemm as directors of Harris, and
the approval of the amendment to Harris's Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase
the number of shares of

Harris common stock reserved for issuance under the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Certain Harris officers and directors entered into voting agreements with Total
which obligate them to vote shares of Harris common stock, which represent in
the aggregate approximately ___% of the outstanding shares of Harris common
stock on _______, 2001, the record date for the annual meeting, in favor of the
issuance of shares of Harris common stock in connection with the merger.

         Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Harris annual meeting will be
tabulated and will determine whether or not a quorum is present. Abstentions
will be treated as shares present in determining whether Harris has a quorum for
the annual meeting, and will have the same effect as a vote against the issuance
of shares of Harris common stock in connection with the merger and against
amendment to Harris's Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares
of Harris common stock reserved for issuance under the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal relating to
re-election of the director nominees.

         A broker or other fiduciary or nominee will vote shares of Harris
common stock only if the beneficial owner of such shares provides instructions
on how to vote by following the instructions provided by such broker, fiduciary
or nominee. If a broker or other fiduciary or nominee indicates on a proxy that
it does not have direction or authority to vote certain shares, those shares
will be considered present at the annual meeting for purposes of determining a
quorum. Broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against the
issuance of shares of Harris common stock in connection with the merger and
against the amendment to Harris's Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the
number of shares of Harris common stock reserved for issuance under the
Long-Term Incentive Plan. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of
the proposal relating to the re-election of the director nominees.

         Because approval of the issuance of shares of Harris common stock in
connection with the merger and approval of the amendment to Harris's Long-Term
Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares of Harris common stock reserved
for issuance under the Long-Term Incentive Plan each requires the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Harris common
stock present and entitled to vote at the annual meeting, abstentions and broker
non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against the issuance of shares of
Harris common stock in connection with the merger and against the amendment to
Harris's Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares of Harris
common stock reserved for issuance under the Long-Term Incentive Plan.

         Because approval of the proposal relating to re-election of the
director nominees requires a plurality of the votes cast at the annual meeting,
abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the
proposal relating to re-election of the director nominees.

         Accordingly, Harris's Board of Directors urges the Harris stockholders
to complete, sign and date and return the enclosed proxy card as promptly as
possible in the enclosed, postage-prepaid envelope.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF HARRIS

         Harris's Board of Directors has unanimously approved the issuance of
shares of Harris common stock in connection with the merger and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. Harris's Board of Directors has determined
that the merger is fair to and in the best interest of Harris and its
stockholders and unanimously recommends that the Harris stockholders vote for
the approval of the issuance of shares of Harris common stock in connection with
the merger. See "Recommendation of the Board of Directors of Harris; Reasons of
Harris for the Merger" beginning on page _____, and "Interests of Certain
Persons in the Merger" beginning on page ____. Harris's Board of Directors also
unanimously

recommends that the Harris stockholders vote for the re-election of Thomas D.
Berman and David H. Clemm to serve as directors of Harris and for the amendment
to Harris's Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares of Harris
common stock reserved for issuance under the Long-Term Incentive Plan.

PROXIES; REVOCATION

         A proxy card is enclosed for use by Harris stockholders. Harris's Board
of Directors requests that stockholders sign and return the proxy card in the
accompanying envelope. No postage is required if mailed within the United
States. Any Harris stockholder who has questions or requests for assistance in
completing and submitting a proxy card should contact Harris at the following
address and telephone number:

                             Harris Interactive Inc.

         All properly executed proxies that are not revoked will be voted at the
Harris annual meeting as instructed on such proxies. A stockholder of record who
executes and returns a proxy may revoke it at any time before it is voted, but
only by executing and returning a proxy bearing a later date, by giving written
notice of revocation to any of the persons named as proxies or to Harris,
addressed to the Secretary, or by attending the Harris annual meeting and voting
in person. A stockholder whose shares are held by a broker, bank or other
fiduciary must bring to the special meeting a legal proxy from such fiduciary
authorizing such stockholder to vote the shares at the special meeting. A proxy
that has been properly executed, but has otherwise been left blank, will be
voted for the approval of the issuance of shares of Harris common stock in
connection with the merger, for the approval of the amendment to Harris's
Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares of Harris common stock
reserved for issuance under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, and for the
re-election of Thomas D. Berman and David H. Clemm to serve as directors of
Harris, unless the proxy is revoked before the vote is taken. Harris's Board of
Directors is unaware of any other matters that may be presented for action at
the Harris annual meeting. If other matters do properly come before the meeting,
however, it is intended that shares represented by the proxies in the enclosed
form will be voted or not voted by the persons named in the proxies in their
discretion, provided that no proxy that is voted against approval of the
issuance of shares of Harris common stock in connection with the merger will be
voted in favor of any adjournment or postponement of the Harris annual meeting
for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES AND EXPENSES

         Management of Harris may use the services of its directors, officers
and employees in soliciting proxies. These persons will not receive any
additional compensation therefor, but will be reimbursed for their out-of-pocket
expenses. Harris will reimburse banks, brokers, nominees, custodians and
fiduciaries for their expenses in forwarding copies of the proxy soliciting
material to the beneficial owners of the stock held by such persons and in
requesting authority for the execution of proxies. Harris and Total will pay
their respective expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and
mailing of this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. If the merger is not
consummated, the parties will share equally in the aggregate filing, printing
and mailing expenses.

                                   THE MERGER

         This section, as well as the following section entitled "Provisions of
the Merger Agreement," describes the material aspects of the proposed merger,
including the merger agreement. These discussions are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is attached as Annex A to
this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Stockholders should read the merger
agreement in its entirety as it is the legal document that governs the merger.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

         In the Prospectus filed in connection with its initial public offering
of stock in December 1999, Harris indicated its intention to use a portion of
the proceeds to expand its business through acquisitions of complementary
businesses. Following the offering, Harris's officers identified a number of
companies that might fit into Harris's strategic plan. From time to time, direct
approaches were made to companies in which Harris had an interest, or Harris
responded to inquiries from such companies. Pursuant to this plan, Harris
acquired the custom research business of Yankelovich Partners, Inc. in the
United States in February 2001 and Market Research Solutions, Ltd. in England in
August 2001.

         Total was among the companies identified by Harris as it reviewed
possible advantageous business combinations. On May 2, 2001, Dr. Gordon S.
Black, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Harris, contacted
Albert A. Angrisani, President and Chief Executive Officer of Total, outlining
possible strategic advantages of a merger and suggesting further discussions.
Mr. Angrisani responded the same day indicating a willingness to explore the
possibility of a business combination with Harris.

         As a result of these communications, a meeting was held in New York
City on May 11, 2001, attended by Dr. Black, David H. Clemm, President and Chief
Operating Officer of Harris, Thomas D. Berman, a director of Harris, James R.
Riedman, a director of Harris, Mr. Angrisani and Howard L. Shecter, Vice
Chairman of the Board of Total. It was the consensus of the meeting to engage in
discussions, and valuation and governance were identified as the key issues to
be addressed initially. On May 17, Dr. Black, Mr. Clemm and Mr. Angrisani had a
meeting in New York City to discuss generally certain management and governance
issues. Dr. Black, Mr. Shecter and Mr. David Brodsky, Chairman of the Board of
Total, had a follow up meeting on May 24, 2001 and generally discussed the
process for proceeding further with discussions regarding a potential
transaction. On May 30, 2001, a confidentiality agreement was signed by the
parties which was amended on June 5, 2001.

         In April 2001, prior to receiving Dr. Black's initial communication,
Total's Executive Committee had begun a process of reviewing Total's strategic
alternatives, including the possibility of making strategic acquisitions,
remaining independent without further acquisitions, or effecting a strategic
merger with a peer company. In the course of this process, Total's Executive
Committee interviewed three potential financial advisors and received
presentations and proposals from each.

         On May 29, 2001, Dr. Black sent a memorandum to Harris's Board of
Directors describing certain potential benefits of a transaction with Total. He
also engaged Harris Beach LLP to provide legal services, and began discussions
with several investment banking firms regarding financial advisory services in
connection with the possible merger. Proposals from three investment banking
firms were sent to members of Harris's Board of Directors for review.

         In late May, Total's Executive Committee had discussions with potential
financial advisors, including two of the firms which it had interviewed the
preceding month and ultimately retained HL&Co on June 1, 2001. At approximately
the same time, Total also engaged Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP to serve
as its legal advisor and Ernst & Young LLP to serve as its accounting advisor.

         Dr. Black sent a memo to Mr. Angrisani and Mr. Shecter on May 30, 2001
with a proposed governance structure to serve as a basis for further discussion.
On June 1, Dr. Black, Mr. Clemm, and Mr. Angrisani met in Princeton, New Jersey
and issues regarding a post-merger management structure were reviewed.

         Harris's Board of Directors met by conference telephone call on May 31,
2001. Harris's Board of Directors approved retention of U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray to act as financial advisor in connection with the possible transaction,
and designated Dr. Black, Mr. Clemm, and outside directors, Mr. Berman and Mr.
Riedman, to act as principal representatives of Harris in negotiations with
Total. Harris's Board of Directors met again in Rochester, New York on June 6,
2001. Representatives of Harris Beach LLP briefed Harris's Board of Directors on
legal considerations in connection with the proposed transaction and
representatives of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed selected publicly
available business and financial information concerning Total and a potential
business combination between Harris and Total. Management provided an overview
of possible benefits and risks of a transaction. Harris's Board of Directors
determined to proceed with due diligence and negotiations.

         On June 8, Mr. Angrisani met with Bruce A. Newman, Harris's Chief
Financial Officer, in New York City to discuss the financial performance and
financial projections of the two companies.

         On June 11, Harris directors Benjamin Addoms and Mr. Berman met with
Mr. Shecter and Mr. Brodsky in Chicago to discuss issues related to corporate
culture, management and governance. Messrs. Shecter and Brodsky met in Rochester
the following day with Mr. Riedman, and separately with Dr. Black and Mr. Clemm,
regarding the same issues.

         Between June 13 and the end of June, several drafts of a proposed term
sheet were circulated among the parties' respective financial and legal
advisors, after consultation with management. It was ultimately determined to
proceed to negotiation of a definitive agreement rather than finalizing the term
sheet. The parties' respective financial advisors also had preliminary
discussions regarding a possible range of valuations during the same period.

         The parties' accountants, financial advisors, legal counsel and
management representatives began due diligence in mid-June. On June 20, 2001, a
special meeting of the Board of Directors of Total was convened in Princeton to
discuss preliminary financial, legal and accounting due diligence issues with
representatives of Total's financial, legal and accounting advisors.
Representatives of Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP also discussed with
Total's Board of Directors its fiduciary duties in considering a potential
transaction with Harris. Total's Board of Directors discussed the possible
benefits and strategic advantages of a combination between Harris and Total and
emphasized the view that Mr. Angrisani should have a significant role in the
management of the combined company following any combination. Total's Board of
Directors discussed the nature of the proposed executive responsibilities that
Mr. Angrisani would assume and also discussed the notion that Messrs. Angrisani,
Brodsky and Shecter would join Harris's Board of Directors following a
combination. Total's Board of Directors ratified the engagement of Howard,
Lawson & Co., LLC ("HL&Co"), Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP and Ernst &
Young LLP, and authorized the Executive Committee and Total's advisors to
proceed with due diligence and the negotiation of a merger agreement.

         On June 29, 2001, the first draft of a merger agreement was circulated
to senior management and the advisors of each company. Draft voting agreements
were circulated shortly thereafter, and the management and advisors of each
company reviewed and negotiated the legal and economic terms of the agreements
and valuation issues over the next month. On June 22, Mr. Angrisani met with Mr.
Berman in Princeton and, on July 5, Mr. Angrisani met with Mr. Riedman in
Princeton. The subjects of discussion at both meetings were management and
governance.

         Among management issues, Mr. Angrisani's post-combination management
responsibilities and his post-combination employment agreement received
significant attention. On June 27, 2001, Mr. Angrisani's legal advisor suggested
proposed terms of an agreement and Dr. Black requested Messrs. Berman, Riedman
and Shecter to act as an informal negotiating committee related to Mr.
Angrisani's employment arrangement. Numerous discussions occurred over the
following month.

         On July 18, a special meeting of the Board of Directors of Total was
held by teleconference. At the meeting, Total's advisors reported on due
diligence issues and the status of negotiations of the merger agreement. HL&Co
made a preliminary presentation regarding its financial analysis of the proposed
transaction. Total's Board of Directors authorized continuing the negotiations
with Harris. On July 25, Total's Board of Directors held another special meeting
in New York City to discuss the proposed transaction. HL&Co provided an update
of its financial analysis and Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP provided a
status report on the negotiation of the merger agreement and the voting
agreements. Total's Board of Directors again authorized the continuation of the
negotiations with Harris.

         On July 27, 2001, Harris's Board of Directors met to review the
proposed transaction. The results of due diligence were reviewed, and Harris's
legal counsel discussed open issues relating to the merger and related
agreements. Senior management of Harris described the status of discussions
related to management and governance issues. Harris's Board of Directors
authorized continued work on the legal agreements but directed management not to
proceed with the transaction until open issues relating to the management and
operations of the combined company were resolved to the satisfaction of Harris's
Board of Directors.

         Beginning late in the afternoon of July 27 and continuing into the
evening, Mr. Brodsky, Mr. Shecter and Mr. Angrisani, on behalf of Total, and Dr.
Black, Mr. Clemm, Mr. Newman and David Vaden, Vice President - Corporate
Finance, on behalf of Harris, met in New York City to discuss various open
issues, including valuation and the indicative exchange ratio.

         Mr. Angrisani traveled to Rochester on July 30 and 31, 2001 for
meetings with Harris's senior management regarding the executive
responsibilities of the senior executives of the combined company following the
completion of the merger as well as future plans regarding operations of the
combined company. Following those meetings, Dr. Black and Mr. Clemm provided
additional information to, and had further discussions with, members of Harris's
Board of Directors, and the parties continued to negotiate the final exchange
ratio for the proposed transaction. Harris's financial advisors conducted an
informal telephonic briefing on financial issues to some of Harris's outside
directors the afternoon of August 3, 2001. A conference call was held among Dr.
Black, Mr. Clemm, Mr. Shecter and the respective parties' legal counsel the
evening of August 3, 2001, at which time tentative agreement was reached as to
remaining issues related to conduct of the businesses prior to stockholder
approval of the transaction and terms and conditions of Mr. Angrisani's
employment agreement. Negotiations continued on August 4, 2001 and August 5,
2001 regarding Mr. Angrisani's proposed contract.

         With respect to valuation, the initial proposal made by Harris to Total
was that Total stockholders would receive approximately 29% or 30% of the equity
of the combined company. Total's initial response was that its stockholders
should receive in excess of 35% of the equity of the combined company. As a
consequence of numerous discussions and counterproposals by the parties and
their financial advisors, the parties ultimately agreed that Total stockholders
would receive approximately 32.76% of the equity of the combined company, from
which the 1.222 exchange ratio was derived.

         Harris's Board of Directors met on the afternoon of August 5, 2001 and
reviewed various written materials previously presented to Harris's Board of
Directors. Harris's senior management made a

presentation regarding the status of discussions and negotiations, including the
results of discussions related to management issues and the proposed exchange
ratio. Harris's management, legal and financial advisors further reviewed the
due diligence process and results, as well as the proposed merger agreement,
voting agreements and employment agreement with Mr. Angrisani. Representatives
of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed in detail information relating to Harris
and Total as well as market and other related data, and delivered its opinion to
Harris's Board of Directors to the effect that the exchange ratio was fair, from
a financial point of view, to Harris. After further review and discussion,
Harris's Board of Directors, with Mr. Addoms absent, approved the merger
agreement and declared its advisability, recommended for approval of the Harris
stockholders the issuance of shares of Harris common stock as contemplated by
the merger agreement, and authorized management to execute and deliver such
agreement subject to final resolution of issues related to Mr. Angrisani's
agreement in form satisfactory to Dr. Black, Mr. Berman and Mr. Riedman. A
conference call among Dr. Black, Mr. Berman and Mr. Riedman followed the meeting
of Harris's Board of Directors and issues related to Mr. Angrisani's employment
agreement were resolved.

         On August 5, Total's Board of Directors held a special meeting by
teleconference. Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP reviewed with Total's Board
of Directors the proposed final merger agreement and voting agreements. Mr.
Shecter reviewed with Total's Board of Directors Mr. Angrisani's proposed
executive responsibilities with respect to the combined company and the proposed
terms of Mr. Angrisani's employment agreement with Harris, which would take
effect upon the consummation of the merger. Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP
and Mr. Shecter also discussed with Total's Board of Directors the proposed role
and responsibilities of the Integration Committee and the nature of the matters
that would be referred to the Integration Committee for consideration. HL&Co
presented its financial analysis and provided its opinion that, subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, as of August 5, 2001 the exchange ratio was fair
to the stockholders of Total, other than Harris, Merger Sub, or any subsidiaries
of Harris or Merger Sub, from a financial point of view. Total's Board of
Directors then approved the merger agreement, declared its advisability and
recommended that the agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Total for
their approval.

         The Board of Directors of Merger Sub, and Harris as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, approved the merger agreement and authorized
management to execute and deliver such agreement, acting by unanimous written
consent on August 5, 2001.

         The definitive merger agreement, voting agreements and agreement with
Mr. Angrisani were executed the evening of August 5, 2001, and on August 6,
2001, the parties issued a joint press release announcing the signing of the
merger agreement. At a telephonic meeting held on August 21, 2001, Harris's
Board of Directors, with Mr. Addoms present, ratified the actions of Harris's
Board of Directors on August 5, 2001.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF TOTAL; REASONS OF TOTAL FOR THE
MERGER

         At a meeting of the Total Board of Directors held on August 5, 2001,
after careful consideration, Total's Board of Directors unanimously:

         -        determined that the merger is fair to, and in the best
                  interests of, Total and its stockholders;

         -        approved the merger and adopted the merger agreement; and

         -        recommended that holders of shares of Total common stock vote
                  for the adoption of the merger agreement.

         In deciding to approve and adopt the merger agreement and to recommend
approval and adoption of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Total
common stock, Total's Board of Directors consulted with Total management, as
well as Total's financial and legal advisors.

         The strategic factors considered by Total's Board of Directors in
approving the merger and adopting the merger agreement were the following:

         -        the market research industry in which Total operates continues
                  to be affected by advances in technology, including the use of
                  the Internet as a less expensive and faster means of data
                  collection as compared to telephonic data collection. Through
                  the merger, Total will become part of a larger and more
                  diversified company, and will have access to Harris's leading
                  technological expertise in the area of Internet-based market
                  surveys. Total will be able to offer its existing and future
                  customers Harris's full spectrum of market research
                  capabilities, including Harris's Internet-based methodologies.
                  Accordingly, Total's Board of Directors believes that a
                  combination with Harris will provide Total with access to
                  significantly greater financial and operational resources and
                  a stronger market and competitive position than Total could
                  achieve on a stand-alone basis;

         -        the complementary nature of certain of Total's and Harris's
                  products, which Total's Board of Directors believes will allow
                  Total both to attract Harris's customers as new customers for
                  Total products and to offer Harris products to Total's current
                  customers; and

         -        the combination of Total and Harris should accelerate the
                  development of product ideas and create opportunities for
                  efficiencies that should enable each company to enhance its
                  skill base, competitiveness, marketability, product quality
                  and profitability. Furthermore, it is expected that the cost
                  of future research and development activities can be
                  distributed over a larger base and that the combined research
                  and development efforts of the two companies will promote
                  enhanced productivity.

         Total's Board of Directors also considered, in approving the merger and
adopting the merger agreement, the following additional factors and potential
benefits of the merger:

         -        the Total Board of Directors' familiarity with and review of
                  Total's own business, operations, financial condition and
                  earnings on a historical and prospective basis;

         -        the Total Board of Directors' review of Harris's business,
                  operations, financial condition and earnings on a historical
                  and prospective basis;

         -        the current and prospective economic and competitive
                  environment facing the market research industry generally;

         -        the financial and business prospects for the combined company,
                  including general information relating to possible synergies,
                  cost reductions, operating efficiencies and consolidations;
                  and the ability of the combined company to offer customers a
                  broader spectrum of market research services;

         -        the fact that the exchange ratio of 1.222 shares of Harris
                  common stock for each share of Total common stock had an
                  implied transaction value of $3.30 per share of Total common
                  stock based upon the closing price of shares of Total common
                  stock on the Nasdaq National Market as of August 3, 2001. The
                  implied transaction value was a 17.8% premium over the closing
                  price of shares of Total common stock on the Nasdaq National
                  Market as of August 3, 2001, a 60.9% premium over the closing
                  price of shares of Total common stock on the Nasdaq National
                  Market 30 calendar days prior to August 3, 2001, and a 46.4%
                  premium over the closing price of shares of Total common stock
                  on the Nasdaq National Market 30 trading days prior to August
                  3, 2001;

         -        the fact that, when the merger is completed, the former Total
                  stockholders will own approximately 32.76% of the shares of
                  Harris common stock outstanding after the merger on a fully
                  diluted basis;

         -        the financial presentations by HL&Co to Total's Board of
                  Directors and the information and analyses contained in its
                  presentations, and the opinion of HL&Co that as of August 5,
                  2001, and based upon and subject to the procedures followed,
                  assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the
                  analyses undertaken as described in its written opinion, the
                  exchange ratio of 1.222 was fair from a financial point of
                  view to Total stockholders other than Harris, Merger Sub or
                  any subsidiaries of Harris or Merger Sub. The full text of the
                  HL&Co written opinion, dated as of August 5, 2001, is attached
                  as Annex B to this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Total
                  stockholders are urged to read this opinion carefully and in
                  its entirety. Also, see "Opinion of Total's Financial Advisor"
                  beginning on page ___;

         -        the qualification of the merger as a reorganization for U.S.
                  federal income tax purposes, which will permit Total
                  stockholders to receive shares of Harris common stock in a
                  tax-free exchange under U.S. federal income tax laws;

         -        the combined company's strong and experienced management team
                  which, pursuant to the merger agreement, will include Albert
                  A. Angrisani as the new President and Chief Operating Officer;

         -        the agreement that upon the completion of the merger, the
                  Harris Board of Directors will be expanded to ten members and
                  will include the following former members of Total's Board of
                  Directors: Albert A. Angrisani, David Brodsky and Howard L.
                  Shecter;

         -        the fact that the merger agreement provides that, upon the
                  signing of the merger agreement, an Integration Committee was
                  established that is comprised of certain members of Total's
                  Board of Directors and certain members of Harris's Board of
                  Directors;

         -        the support of the merger by certain of Total's stockholders
                  (representing in the aggregate approximately __% of the
                  outstanding shares of Total common stock), as evidenced by the
                  execution by each of them of voting agreements with Harris
                  pursuant to which such stockholders committed to vote their
                  shares of Total common stock in favor of adoption of the
                  merger agreement. Such Total stockholders will not be
                  receiving any consideration for their shares in the merger
                  different from any other Total stockholders. See "Voting
                  Agreements" on page ___;

         -        the support of the merger by certain of Harris's stockholders
                  (representing in the aggregate approximately __% of the
                  outstanding shares of Harris common stock), as evidenced by
                  the execution by each of them of voting agreements with Total
                  pursuant to which such stockholders committed to vote their
                  shares of Harris common stock in favor of the issuance of
                  shares of Harris common stock in connection with the merger.
                  See "Voting Agreements" on page ___;

         -        the fact that adoption of the merger agreement requires the
                  affirmative vote of at least a majority of the holders of the
                  outstanding shares of Total common stock entitled to vote;

         -        the review of, and discussions with, Total's senior management
                  and legal, accounting and financial advisors regarding the
                  business, financial, legal and accounting aspects of the
                  merger;

         -        the recognition by Total's Board of Directors that certain
                  members of Total's management have interests in the merger
                  that are in addition to or different from their interests as
                  holders of shares of Total common stock. See "Interests of
                  Certain Persons in the Merger" beginning on page ___; and

         -        the effect of the merger on various employment agreements and
                  benefit plans of Total, including the fact that outstanding
                  options to acquire shares of Total common stock that are
                  unvested at the completion of the merger will vest and become
                  immediately exercisable and convert into options to purchase
                  shares of Harris common stock at that time, in accordance with
                  the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements and
                  plan, as amended. See "Treatment of Total Stock Options"
                  beginning on page ___.

         Total's Board of Directors also considered and balanced against the
potential benefits of the merger the following potentially negative factors:

         -        the risk that the merger would not be consummated;

         -        the substantial management time and effort that will be
                  required to consummate the merger and integrate the operations
                  of the two companies;

         -        the fact that Total stockholders will not receive the full
                  benefit of any future growth in the value of their equity that
                  Total may have achieved as an independent company, and the
                  potential disadvantage to Total stockholders in the event that
                  Harris does not perform as well in the future as Total may
                  have performed as an independent company;

         -        the risks associated with integrating Total's existing
                  operations with those of Harris, including the potential loss
                  of key personnel of Total and difficulty in integrating
                  corporate, accounting, financial reporting and management
                  information systems of Total with those of Harris;

         -        the possibility that certain provisions of the merger
                  agreement, including, among others, the non-solicitation and
                  termination fee payment provisions, as well as the voting
                  agreements, might have the effect of discouraging other
                  persons potentially interested in merging with or acquiring
                  Total from pursuing such an opportunity; and

         -        other matters described under "Risk Factors" beginning on
                  page ___.

         After detailed consideration of these factors, Total's Board of
Directors concluded that the potential benefits of the merger outweighed these
considerations.

         The above discussion of the information and factors considered by
Total's Board of Directors is not exhaustive and does not include all factors
considered by the Board of Directors of Total. Each member of Total's Board of
Directors also may have considered different factors. In view of the variety of
factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, Total's
Board of Directors did not find it practicable to, and did not quantify or
otherwise assign relative or specific weights to the different factors. Rather,
Total's Board of Directors views its recommendation as being based on the
totality of the information presented to and considered by it. Total's Board of
Directors considered all of these factors and determined that these factors, as
a whole, supported the conclusions and recommendations described above. Based on
the factors outlined above, Total's Board of Directors determined that the
merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, Total and its stockholders.

         Total's Board of Directors has unanimously determined that the merger
is fair to, and in the best interests of, Total and its stockholders and
unanimously recommends that Total stockholders vote for the adoption of the
merger agreement.

OPINION OF TOTAL'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

         Total retained Howard, Lawson & Co., LLC ("HL&Co"), an indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiary of FleetBoston Financial Corporation, as its exclusive
financial advisor in connection with the merger. Total asked HL&Co, in its role
as financial advisor to Total, to render an opinion as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the exchange ratio. On August 5, 2001, at a meeting
of Total's Board of Directors, HL&Co delivered its oral opinion to Total's Board
of Directors, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of August 5,
2001, based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and
other matters described in the written HL&Co opinion, the exchange ratio was
fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of Total common
stock other than Harris, Merger Sub, or any subsidiaries of Harris or Merger
Sub. No limitations were imposed by Total's Board of Directors on HL&Co with
respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by HL&Co in furnishing
its opinion. HL&Co was not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, third
parties regarding alternatives to the merger.

         The full text of the HL&Co opinion is attached to this Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus as Annex B. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on HL&Co's review, and is
incorporated by reference into this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. This
summary of the HL&Co opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
full text of the HL&Co opinion, and you are urged to read the HL&Co opinion in
its entirety. The HL&Co opinion was prepared for the benefit and use of Total's
Board of Directors in its evaluation of the financial terms of the exchange
ratio and the merger. The opinion is not a recommendation to the stockholders of
Total as to how they should vote on, or take any other action with respect to,
the merger or their shares of Total common stock.

         In arriving at its opinion, HL&Co:

         1.       reviewed certain publicly available historical financial
                  statements and other historical business, financial and
                  operating information of Total and Harris, respectively;

         2.       reviewed certain internal historical financial statements and
                  other historical business, financial and operating data of
                  Total and Harris prepared by the management of Total and
                  Harris, respectively;

         4.       held discussions with the management of Total and Harris,
                  respectively, concerning their businesses, past and current
                  operations, financial condition and future prospects on both
                  an independent and combined basis, including cost savings and
                  other synergies that may result from the merger, as well as
                  their views regarding the strategic rationale for the merger;

         5.       reviewed the financial terms set forth in the draft merger
                  agreement, dated August 5, 2001, including the exchange ratio;

         6.       reviewed the price and trading history of shares of Total
                  common stock and Harris common stock;

         7.       compared the historical financial performance of Total and
                  Harris and the trading prices and volume of shares of Total
                  common stock and Harris common stock with that of certain
                  other publicly traded companies which HL&Co believed to be
                  relevant;

         8.       compared the financial terms of the merger with the financial
                  terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions
                  that HL&Co believed to be relevant;

         9.       reviewed the anticipated pre-tax pro forma impact of the
                  merger on the earnings per share of Harris common stock;

         10.      reviewed and considered information prepared by members of
                  management of Total and Harris relating to the relative
                  historical and expected pre-tax pro forma contributions of
                  Total and Harris to the combined company on a post-merger
                  basis;

         11.      prepared a discounted cash flow analysis of the Total
                  projections and the Harris projections;

         12.      participated in discussions and negotiations among
                  representatives of Total and Harris and their financial and
                  legal advisors;

         13.      reviewed draft reports and analyses as prepared by Ernst &
                  Young LLP, Total's consultant with respect to certain due
                  diligence;

         14.      reviewed the draft merger agreement dated August 5, 2001; and

         15.      made such other studies and inquiries, and reviewed such other
                  data, as HL&Co deemed relevant.

         The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed
by HL&Co in connection with rendering its opinion and presented by HL&Co to
Total's Board of Directors on August 5, 2001. This summary is not a complete
description of all of the analyses performed by HL&Co. Portions of the
information in this section are presented in a tabular form. In order to better
understand the financial analyses performed by HL&Co, these tables must be read
together with the text of each summary.

         HL&Co employed several methodologies in performing its analyses and
rendering its opinion. No one method of analysis should be regarded as critical
to the overall conclusion reached by HL&Co. Each analytical technique has
inherent strengths and weaknesses, and the nature of the available information
may further affect the value of particular techniques. The conclusions reached
by HL&Co are based on all analyses and factors taken as a whole and also on
application of HL&Co's own experience and judgment. These conclusions may
involve significant elements of subjective judgment and qualitative analysis.
Because of this, HL&Co did not provide an opinion as to the value or merit,
standing alone, of any one or more parts of its analysis. In performing its
analyses, HL&Co considered general economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Total.

         No company, business or transaction compared in the comparable
companies analysis or comparable acquisition analysis is identical to Total or
the merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the comparable companies
analysis or comparable acquisition analysis is not entirely mathematical. It
involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in
financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the
acquisition, public trading and other values of the comparable companies,
comparable acquisitions or the business segment, company or transactions to
which they are being compared.

         Calculation Of Transaction Value Of The Exchange Ratio

         HL&Co reviewed the terms of the merger and noted that the exchange
ratio of 1.222 shares of Harris common stock for each share of Total common
stock had an implied transaction value of $3.30 per share of Total common stock
based upon the closing price of Harris common stock of $2.70 on August 3, 2001
(the last trading day preceding the August 5, 2001 board meeting). HL&Co also
noted that the transaction had an implied aggregate transaction value of
approximately $47.05 million as of August 3, 2001, based on the implied
transaction value of $3.30 per share of Total common stock and the number of
fully diluted shares of Total common stock outstanding. Upon completion of the
merger, former Total stockholders would own 32.76% of the total equity of
Harris, on a fully diluted basis.

         HL&Co noted that when the market capitalizations of Total and Harris as
of August 3, 2001 are combined, the fully diluted market capitalization of Total
was equal to 28.1% of the combined fully diluted market capitalization of the
two companies. For the 30 days ending August 3, 2001, the fully diluted market
capitalization of Total averaged 23.8% of the combined fully diluted market
capitalization of the two companies. HL&Co compared these percentages to the
32.76% of the shares of Harris common stock, calculated on a fully diluted
basis, which Total stockholders would receive upon completion of the merger.

         The analyses performed by HL&Co indicated that the implied transaction
value of $3.30 per share of Total common stock was a 17.8% premium to the
closing price of Total common stock as of August 3, 2001. The analyses performed
by HL&Co also indicated that the implied transaction value was a 60.9% premium
to the closing price of Total common stock 30 calendar days prior to August 3,
2001, and a 46.4% premium to the closing price of Total common stock 30 trading
days prior to August 3, 2001.

         HL&Co also analyzed the implied aggregate transaction value as a
multiple of Total's estimated fiscal 2001 revenues, earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), earnings before interest and
taxes ("EBIT"), net income, and stockholders' equity. HL&Co's analyses indicated
that as of August 3, 2001, the aggregate transaction value indicated a multiple
of 0.9x Total's estimated fiscal 2001 revenues, 9.1x Total's estimated fiscal
2001 EBITDA, 13.5x Total's estimated fiscal 2001 EBIT, 21.1x Total's estimated
fiscal 2001 net income, and 3.3x Total's estimated book value of

stockholders' equity as of June 30, 2001. The implied value of the total
capitalization of Total (adjusting for cash and debt) indicated a multiple of
0.8x Total's estimated fiscal 2001 revenues, 8.8x Total's estimated fiscal 2001
EBITDA and 13.0x Total's estimated fiscal 2001 EBIT.

         Relative Contribution Analysis

         HL&Co analyzed the relative contribution of Total and Harris to the
combined estimated results of operations of both companies for fiscal year 2001
and the combined projected results of operation for fiscal years 2002 through
2006. For fiscal year 2001, Total contributed 42.3% of the combined estimated
revenues, pro forma to reflect recent acquisitions as if owned for the full
year. As a result of operating losses of Harris in fiscal year 2001, Total
contributed greater than 100% of the combined estimated operating income in
fiscal year 2001. Using the Total projections and the Harris projections for
fiscal years 2002 through 2006, Total is projected to contribute 43.0%, 42.3%,
41.3%, 40.5% and 39.3%, respectively, of the combined projected revenues. For
fiscal years 2002 through 2006, Total's contribution to combined operating
income is projected to be greater than 100% (as a result of operating losses at
Harris), 89.0%, 51.4%, 39.7% and 32.4%, respectively.

         HL&Co noted that at the implied transaction value of $3.30 per share of
Total common stock, the total capitalization of Total was 45.6% of the combined
total capitalizations of Harris and Total after adjusting for the estimated cash
balances of Total and Harris as of June 30, 2001. This percentage was greater
than Total's contribution of combined estimated and projected revenue for fiscal
years 2001 through 2006 and greater than Total's contribution of combined
projected operating income for fiscal years 2005 and 2006, although less than
its contribution in fiscal years 2001 through 2004.

         Earnings Per Share Analysis

         HL&Co examined Harris's earnings per share, before income taxes and
amortization related to the merger ("EBTA"), based on operating and financial
projections both on a stand alone basis and in combination with Total. The
combined projections assumed completion of the merger and gave no consideration
to any synergies that may arise from the merger. Combining the projections for
Total prepared by its management and projections for Harris prepared by its
management for fiscal years 2003 through 2006 indicated that combined EBTA per
share is projected to be higher than the projected EBTA per share of Harris on a
stand alone basis, with the exception of fiscal year 2006.

         Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

         HL&Co performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Total
projections and the Harris projections using estimates of after-tax free cash
flows for the fiscal years 2002 to 2006. The purpose of the discounted cash flow
analysis was to compare the relative valuations of the equity of Total and
Harris utilizing a net present value of their projected cash flows. After-tax
free cash flows were calculated as the after-tax operating earnings of the two
companies adjusted to add back non-cash expenses and deduct certain uses of cash
not reflected in the income statements. HL&Co first discounted the projected
after-tax free cash flows of Total and Harris through June 30, 2006 using
discount rates derived from an estimation of each company's cost of capital.
HL&Co then added to the present value of the after-tax free cash flows the
terminal value of Total and Harris at June 30, 2006, discounted back to the
present at the same discount rates as were the net cash flows, and each
company's estimated cash balance as of June 30, 2001.

         HL&Co discounted the projected, after-tax free cash flows of Total
through December 31, 2006, using discount rates ranging from 13.5% to 17.5%. The
terminal value was determined by capitalizing terminal cash flow by a
capitalization rate equal to the discount rate less a long term growth rate
ranging

from 1% to 5%. HL&Co discounted the projected, after-tax free cash flows of
Harris through December 31, 2006, using discount rates ranging from 22.0% to
26.0%. The terminal value was determined by capitalizing terminal cash flow by a
capitalization rate equal to the discount rate less a long term growth rate
ranging from 6% to 10%. When the equity values of Total and Harris determined
under the discounted cash flow analyses are combined, Total's contribution to
the combined equity value ranged from 25.7% to 32.2% with a midpoint of 28.2%.
This compares to the 32.76% relative value of the equity capitalization
indicated by the implied transaction value. The following table summarizes the
resulting contribution to equity value for Total under the discounted cash flow
analyses:

         Comparable Companies Analysis

         Using publicly-available information, HL&Co analyzed certain financial,
trading and valuation statistics for certain publicly-traded companies that were
deemed by HL&Co to have business and operating characteristics similar to those
of Total. These statistics were the aggregate net debt and equity values ("Total
Capitalization") as a multiple of revenues, EBIT, and EBITDA for the most recent
twelve months, and equity values ("Price") as a multiple of net income for the
latest twelve months ended March 31, 2001. These comparable companies were
comprised of DoubleClick, Inc., Forrester Research, Inc., Harte Hanks, Inc.,
Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Gartner Group, Inc., Jupiter Media Metrix,
Inc., National Research Corporation, Omnicom Group, and Opinion Research
Corporation. The table below summarizes the range of the multiples described
above as derived by HL&Co, as well as the implied aggregate transaction value
and total capitalization implied by the merger as a multiple of Total's
estimated results for fiscal 2001.

         HL&Co noted that multiples implied by the merger were superior to the
median multiples of net income, EBIT and EBITDA of the group, most of which are
larger and better capitalized than Total. While the multiple of revenues was
generally lesser than the group, HL&Co noted that Total has had lower profit
margins in general than the group.

         Comparable Acquisition Analysis

         Using publicly-available information, HL&Co analyzed certain financial
and valuation statistics for certain acquisition transactions involving
companies that were deemed by HL&Co to have business and operating
characteristics similar to those of Total. Due to the limited amount of
operating data publicly available, HL&Co focused principally on the total
capitalization implied by such acquisition transactions as a multiple of the
acquired company's revenues for the most recent twelve months. HL&Co considered
18 transactions involving market research companies completed between June 1,
1999 and August 3, 2001, none of which was considered to be identical to the
merger. The analyses performed by HL&Co indicated that the multiple of total
capitalization to revenues of the acquired companies ranged from 0.3x to 7.0x
with a mean and median of 1.7x and 1.6x, respectively. This compares to an
implied multiple for the total capitalization in the merger of 0.8x. Information
with respect to the earnings and cash flow of the 18 acquired companies was
inadequate to provide a meaningful indication on this basis.

         Premium Analysis

         HL&Co also reviewed selected merger transactions involving public
market research companies that occurred between June 1, 1999 and August 3, 2001.
HL&Co considered seven transactions involving public market research companies,
none of which was considered to be identical to the merger. The analyses
performed by HL&Co indicated that the mean and median per share transaction
premium as measured by stock prices 30 days prior to the announcement date of
those transactions were 51% and 56%, respectively. The mean and median per share
transaction premium as measured by stock prices one day prior to the
announcement date of those transactions were 56% and 43%, respectively. HL&Co
also considered acquisitions of public companies across all industries in which
the acquired company was purchased with the stock of another public company and
in which the consideration was valued at less than $100 million. HL&Co
considered 30 transactions completed between November 1, 2000 and August 3,
2001. The analyses performed by HL&Co indicated that the mean and median per
share transaction premium as measured by stock prices 30 days prior to the
announcement date of those transactions were 65% and 44%, respectively. The mean
and median per share transaction premium as measured by stock prices one day
prior to the announcement date of those transactions were 56% and 43%,
respectively. The implied transaction value of $3.30 per share of Total common
stock was a premium of 60.9% to the Total stock price 30 days prior to August 3,
2001, and a 17.8% premium to the Total stock price as of August 3, 2001.

         Other Factors and Comparative Analyses

         In rendering its opinion, HL&Co considered certain other factors and
conducted certain other comparative analyses, including a review of the history
of trading prices and volumes for the shares of Total common stock and Harris
common stock from July 31, 1998 to August 3, 2001.

         While the summary above describes certain analyses and factors that
HL&Co deemed material in its presentation to Total's Board of Directors, it is
not a comprehensive description of all analyses and factors considered by HL&Co.
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process that involves various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analyses and the application of these methods to the particular circumstances.
HL&Co believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole. Selecting only
portions of its analyses and of the factors considered by it would create an
incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying the HL&Co opinion.

         The analyses performed by HL&Co do not predict actual values or future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested
by HL&Co's analyses. Accordingly, analyses relating to the value of a business
do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which the business
actually may be purchased. Furthermore, HL&Co is not expressing an opinion with
respect to the prices at which shares of Total common stock or Harris common
stock may be traded at any future time.

         The engagement letters between HL&Co and Total provide that HL&Co is
entitled to receive certain fees for its services. To date, HL&Co has received
$175,000 in fees related to its retention and opinion and it is estimated that
it will receive an additional fee of $525,000 upon completion of the merger.
Total has also agreed to reimburse HL&Co for certain of its out-of-pocket
expenses, including legal fees. In addition, Total has agreed to indemnify HL&Co
and its affiliates and any director, employee or agent of HL&Co or any of its
affiliates, or any person controlling HL&Co or its affiliates, for certain
losses, claims, damages, expenses and liabilities relating to or arising out of
HL&Co rendering a fairness opinion to Total.

         On August 31, 2001, the business of HL&Co was assigned to Fleet M&A
Advisors, a division of Fleet Securities, Inc. ("FSI"). In the ordinary course
of its business, FSI or one of its affiliates may trade in securities of Harris
or Total for its own account and the accounts of its customers and, accordingly,
may at any time hold a long or short position in securities of Harris or Total.
Summit Bank, an affiliate of FSI, has provided senior debt financing and other
commercial banking services to Total, for which it has received customary
banking fees. Total retained HL&Co based on HL&Co's experience in investment
banking and in preparing and rendering fairness opinions in connection with
mergers and acquisitions and in securities valuations generally. FSI, a
nationally recognized investment banking firm, is frequently engaged in the
valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions and securities,
private placements and other purposes.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF HARRIS; REASONS OF HARRIS FOR THE
MERGER

         Harris's Board of Directors, at a meeting held on August 5, 2001, after
careful consideration, unanimously:

         -        determined that the acquisition of Total was fair and in the
                  best interests of Harris and its stockholders;

         -        approved the merger and the merger agreement and approved,
                  subject to the approval of Harris stockholders, the issuance
                  of shares of Harris common stock; and

         -        determined to recommend that Harris stockholders take the
                  action necessary to effect such acquisition including approval
                  of the issuance of shares of Harris common stock to be
                  delivered in connection with the merger.

         In deciding to approve the merger and recommend that its stockholders
approve the issuance of the requisite number of shares of Harris common stock
necessary to complete the merger, Harris's Board of Directors consulted with
Harris's financial, legal and accounting advisors.

         The decisions of the Harris Board of Directors were based on several
potential benefits of the merger that it believes will contribute to Harris's
success. These potential benefits include:

         -        growing Harris's position worldwide in the market research
                  industry;

         -        enabling Harris to offer Total clients the full array of
                  Internet based market research capabilities possessed by
                  Harris and supported by Harris's Internet database, Internet
                  based research technologies, the Harris and Harris Poll brand
                  and Harris's core research capabilities in pharmaceuticals,
                  automotive, health care insurance, eCommerce, financial
                  services, public opinion polling, research for public
                  relations firms, loyalty and retention modeling and others;
                  and

         -        expanding Harris's line of market research products and
                  services by combining the products and services offered by
                  Total with complementary products and services offered by
                  Harris.

         The Harris Board of Directors reviewed a number of factors in
evaluating the merger, including but not limited to the following:

         -        the terms and the structure of the merger, including the
                  exchange ratio in light of comparable merger transactions;

         -        the results of the due diligence investigation of Total
                  conducted by Harris's management, accountants, counsel and
                  financial advisor;

         -        current and historical market prices and trading information
                  with respect to shares of Harris common stock and Total common
                  stock;

         -        Harris's corporate strategy of complementing its internal
                  growth with acquisitions that are likely to benefit from cost
                  reductions and synergies when combined with Harris's existing
                  operations and that are expected to be accretive to earnings
                  per share;

         -        Harris's history of growth through acquisitions, including its
                  experience integrating acquired businesses with existing
                  operations and thereby achieving synergies and cost savings;

         -        the anticipated treatment of the merger as an acquisition by
                  Harris for financial accounting purposes;

         -        the fact that the merger will generally be tax free to both
                  Harris and Total stockholders under the federal income tax
                  laws of the United States;

         -        the oral opinion of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, which opinion
                  was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion,
                  on August 5, 2001, to Harris's Board of Directors to the
                  effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon the
                  assumptions made, matters considered and limits of review set
                  forth in its written opinion, the exchange ratio in the merger
                  pursuant to the merger agreement was fair to Harris from a
                  financial point of view. See "Opinion of Harris's Financial
                  Advisor" below.

         During the course of deliberations concerning the merger, the Harris
Board of Directors also identified and considered a variety of potentially
negative factors that could materialize as a result of the merger, including the
following:

         -        the difficulties in integrating an acquisition of the size of
                  Total, including the substantial management time and effort
                  that will be required;

         -        the risk that the anticipated cost savings and synergies, and
                  the expected accretive effect of the merger, might not be
                  fully realized;

         -        the possibility that the merger might not be completed; and

         -        other risks described in this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
                  under the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page
                  ____.

         Harris's Board of Directors concluded that these factors were
outweighed by the potential benefits of the merger. The above discussion is not
exhaustive of all factors considered by Harris's Board of Directors. Each member
of Harris's Board of Directors may have considered different factors, and
Harris's Board of Directors evaluated these factors as a whole and did not
quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the factors considered.

         After careful consideration, the Harris Board of Directors has
determined the issuance of Harris common stock in the merger to be fair and in
the best interests of Harris and its stockholders. Harris's Board of Directors
voted unanimously to approve the merger and merger agreement and the issuance of
Harris common stock in connection with the merger and unanimously recommends
that the Harris stockholders approve the issuance of the shares of Harris common
stock to be issued in the merger.

OPINION OF HARRIS'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

         Harris retained U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray to act as its financial
advisor and, if requested, to render to Harris's Board of Directors an opinion
as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio
pursuant to the merger agreement.

         U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray delivered to Harris's Board of Directors on
August 5, 2001 its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, as of that
date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, factors and limitations set
forth in the written opinion and described below, that the exchange ratio in the
merger pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of
view, to Harris. A copy of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's written opinion is
attached to this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus as Annex C and is incorporated
by reference into this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

         While U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray rendered its opinion and provided
certain analyses to Harris's Board of Directors, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray was
not requested to and did not make any

recommendation to Harris's Board of Directors as to the specific form or amount
of the consideration to be paid by Harris in the proposed merger, which was
determined through negotiations between Total and Harris. U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray's written opinion, which was directed to Harris's Board of Directors,
addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange
ratio pursuant to the merger agreement, and does not address Harris's underlying
business decision to participate in the merger or constitute a recommendation to
any Harris stockholder.

         In arriving at its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's review
included:

         -        a draft, dated as of August 5, 2001, of the merger agreement;

         -        selected financial and other information related to Harris and
                  Total;

         -        certain publicly available market and securities data of
                  Harris and Total;

         -        to the extent publicly available, certain financial and
                  securities data of selected other companies whose securities
                  are traded in public markets;

         -        to the extent publicly available, information relating to
                  selected transactions deemed comparable to the proposed
                  merger; and

         -        estimates and financial forecasts of Total and Harris prepared
                  and furnished by Total and Harris management.

         In addition, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray visited the headquarters of
both Harris and Total and conducted discussions with members of senior
management of each company concerning the financial condition, current operating
results and business outlook of Harris, Total and the combined company following
the merger.

         In delivering its opinion to Harris's Board of Directors, U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray prepared and delivered to Harris's Board of Directors written
materials containing various analyses and other information material to the
opinion. The following is a summary of the analyses contained in the materials:

         Implied Consideration

         Giving effect to the exchange ratio, the resulting implied value of
Harris stock consideration of $3.30 per share of Total common stock (based on
the closing trading price for shares of Harris common stock on August 3, 2001 of
$2.70) and the outstanding shares of Total common stock and common share
equivalents, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray calculated the aggregate implied value
of the stock consideration payable in the transaction for shares of Total common
stock to be approximately $47.05 million. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray also
calculated that stockholders of Total would be issued an aggregate of 32.76% of
the total shares of Harris common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding
after the merger. Giving effect to outstanding debt and cash, U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray calculated an implied company value (equity value plus debt less cash)
for Total of $48.20 million.

         Total Market Update

         U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed the stock trading history of shares
of Total common stock. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray presented the recent common
stock trading information contained in the following table:

                 Closing price on August 3, 2001...................    $  2.80
                 30 calendar day closing average...................       2.21
                 60 calendar day closing average...................       2.21
                 90 calendar day closing average...................       2.18
                 180 calendar day closing average..................       2.45
                 52 week high trade................................       4.25
                 52 week low trade.................................       1.81

         U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray also presented selected price and volume
distribution data and illustrated the relative stock price performance of Total
against Harris, the comparable group described below and the Nasdaq Stock
Market.

         Contribution Analysis

         U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyzed the expected contributions of each
of Total and Harris to revenue, gross profit, EBITDA (earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization), operating income, pretax income and net
income of the combined company for the fiscal years ending 2000, 2001, 2002,
2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, based on estimates and financial forecasts for Total
and Harris provided by Total and Harris management, respectively, without
including any synergies that the combined company may realize following
consummation of the transaction. The analysis indicated that, during these
periods, Total would contribute to the combined entity revenue ranging from
39.3% to 49.7% and gross profit ranging from 40.8% to 53.1%. The analysis also
indicated that, during fiscal years ending 2002 to 2006, Total would contribute
to the combined entity EBITDA ranging from 29.4% to 83.1%. Due to Harris's
negative EBITDA for fiscal years ending 2000 and 2001, an analysis of EBITDA for
such periods was not meaningful. In addition, the analysis indicated that Total
would contribute to the combined entity in fiscal years ending 2003 to 2006
operating income ranging from 32.4% to 89.0%, pretax income ranging from 31.0%
to 72.6%, and net income ranging from 31.1% to 72.6%. Due to Harris's negative
operating income, pretax income and net income for fiscal years ending 2000,
2001 and 2002, an analysis of operating income, pretax income and net income
during these periods was not meaningful. Total stockholders will receive an
aggregate of 32.76% of the shares of the combined company.

         Pro Forma Accretion/Dilution Analysis

         U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyzed pro forma effects resulting from
the impact of the transaction on the projected earnings per share of the
combined company for the fiscal years ending 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006
using estimates and financial forecasts for Total and Harris provided by Total
and Harris management, respectively. Without consideration of any synergies that
the combined company may realize following consummation of the transaction, U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray determined that the transaction could be accretive in the
fiscal years ending 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 and dilutive in the fiscal year
ending 2006 to the projected stand-alone earnings per share of Harris.

         Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

         U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray performed a discounted cash flow analysis of
Total in which it calculated the present value of the projected hypothetical
future cash flows of Total using estimates and financial forecasts prepared by
Total management. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray estimated a range of theoretical
values for Total based on the net present value of its implied annual cash flows
and a terminal value for Total in 2006 calculated based upon a multiple of
operating income. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray

applied a range of discount rates of 14% to 18% and a range of terminal value
multiples of 8.0x to 10.0x of forecasted 2006 operating income. This analysis
yielded the following results:

                 Aggregate Equity Value of Total
                 -------------------------------
                 (in thousands)
                 Low..........................................       $43,482
                 Mid..........................................        50,671
                 High.........................................        58,915

                 Per Share Equity Value of Total
                 -------------------------------
                 Low..........................................        $3.07
                 Mid..........................................         3.53
                 High.........................................         4.05

         Comparable M&A Transaction Analysis

         U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed 14 merger and acquisition
transactions that it deemed comparable to the merger. It selected these
transactions by searching SEC filings, public company disclosures, press
releases, industry and popular press reports, databases and other sources, and
by applying the following criteria:

         -        transactions involving target companies with primary SIC codes
                  similar to that of the comparable companies described below;

         -        transactions involving target companies which U.S. Bancorp
                  Piper Jaffray deemed similar to Total's business;

         -        transactions in which the target company was a public or
                  private company;

         -        transactions with an equity value greater than $40 million;

         -        transactions in which 100% of the target company was acquired;

         -        transactions announced between July 25, 1998 and August 5,
                  2001; and

         -        transactions which were not share repurchases or hostile
                  transactions.

         U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray compared the resulting multiples of selected
valuation data to multiples for Total derived from the implied value payable in
the merger.

         Comparable Public Company Analysis

         U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray compared financial information and valuation
ratios of Total to corresponding data and ratios from nine publicly traded
companies deemed comparable to Total. This group included Arbitron Inc.,
Forrester Research, Inc., Gartner Group, Inc., Harris Interactive Inc.,
Information Resources, Inc., META Group, Inc., National Research Corporation and
Opinion Research Corporation. This group was selected from companies with a
market capitalization below $1 billion that operate in the market research
industry, that had similar primary SIC codes as Total and were companies
otherwise deemed comparable by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.

         This analysis produced multiples of selected valuation data as follows:

         Premiums Paid Analysis

         U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed publicly available information for
94 merger and acquisition transactions involving public companies to determine
the implied premiums payable in the mergers over recent trading prices. It
selected these transactions by searching SEC filings, public company
disclosures, press releases, industry and popular press reports, databases and
other sources, and by applying the following criteria:

         -        transactions with an equity value between $30 million and $100
                  million;

         -        transactions in which 100% of a public target company was
                  acquired;

         -        transactions announced between July 25, 2000 and July 25,
                  2001; and

         -        transactions which were not share repurchases.

         The table below shows a comparison of those premiums to the premium
that would be paid to Total stockholders based on the implied value payable in
the merger. The premium calculations for shares of Total common stock are based
upon an assumed announcement date of August 3, 2001:

         Analysis of Shares of Harris Common Stock

         U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed general background information
concerning Harris, including recent financial and operating results and outlook,
the price performance of shares of Harris common stock over the previous twelve
months relative to Total, the Nasdaq Stock Market and to the comparable company
group, and the stock price and volume over selected periods. U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray also reviewed the stock trading history of shares of Harris common stock
at the dates or for the periods indicated below.

         In reaching its conclusion as to the fairness of the exchange ratio in
the merger and in its presentation to Harris's Board of Directors, U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray did not rely on any single analysis or factor described above,
assign relative weights to the analyses or factors considered by it, or make any
conclusion as to how the results of any given analysis, taken alone, supported
its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selection of portions of its analyses and of the factors considered by it,
without considering all of the factors and analyses, would create a misleading
view of the processes underlying the opinion.

         The analyses of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or future results, which may be significantly more
or less favorable than suggested by the analyses. Analyses relating to the value
of companies do not purport to be appraisals or valuations or necessarily
reflect the price at which companies may actually be sold. No company or
transaction used in any analysis for purposes of comparison is identical to
Total or Harris, or to the merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of
the comparisons is not mathematical; rather, it involves complex considerations
and judgments about differences in the companies to which Total and Harris were
compared and other factors that could affect the public trading value of the
companies.

         For purposes of its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray relied upon and
assumed the accuracy and completeness of the financial statements and other
information provided to it by Total and Harris or otherwise made available to it
and did not assume responsibility for the independent verification of that
information. Estimates and financial forecasts of management were not prepared
with the expectation of public disclosure. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray further
relied upon the assurances of Harris's and Total's management that the
information provided was prepared on a reasonable basis in accordance with
industry practice and, with respect to estimates and financial forecast data,
reflects the best currently available estimates and judgment of Harris's and
Total's management, was based on reasonable judgments

and neither Harris's nor Total's management were aware of any information or
facts that would make the information provided to U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
incomplete or misleading.

         For purposes of its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray assumed that
the merger will constitute a reorganization for federal income tax purposes and
will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, for purposes of its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray assumed that neither Harris nor Total are a party to any material
pending transaction, including external financings, recapitalizations,
acquisitions or merger discussions, other than the merger. U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray also assumed that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory
approvals and consents for the merger, no restrictions will be imposed that have
a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the merger to Harris
or the purchase price.

         In arriving at its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray did not perform
any appraisals or valuations of any specific assets or liabilities of Total or
Harris, and was not furnished with any such appraisals or valuations. U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray expressed no opinion regarding the liquidation value of
any entity. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray undertook no independent analysis of any pending or threatened
litigation, possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities, to which
Harris, Total or any of their respective affiliates is a party or may be subject
and, at Harris's direction and with its consent, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's
opinion makes no assumption concerning, and therefore does not consider, the
possible assertions of claims, outcomes or damages arising out of any such
matters.

         U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray was not authorized to solicit, and did not
solicit, any other party relative to a possible business combination with
Harris. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's opinion addresses solely the fairness, from
a financial point of view, to Harris of the exchange ratio and does not address
any other terms or agreement relating to the transaction. U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray's opinion does not address, nor should it be construed to address, the
relative merits of the transaction with Total, on the one hand, or any
alternative business strategies or alternative transactions that may be
available to Harris, on the other hand. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyzed
Total as a going concern and accordingly expressed no opinion as to the
liquidation value of any entity. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray expressed no opinion
as to the price at which shares of Total or Harris common stock have traded or
at which the shares of Total, Harris or the combined company may trade at any
future time. The opinion is based on information available to U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray and the facts and circumstances as they existed and were subject to
evaluation on the date of the opinion. Events occurring after that date could
materially affect the assumptions used in preparing the opinion. U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray has not undertaken to, and is not obligated to, affirm or revise
its opinion or otherwise comment on any events occurring after the date it was
given.

         U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, as a customary part of its investment
banking business, evaluates businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, underwritings and secondary distributions of
securities, private placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other
purposes. Harris's Board of Directors selected U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
because of its expertise, reputation and familiarity with the market research
industry. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray maintains a market in the common stock of
Harris, has written research reports on Harris during the last twelve months,
and acted as co-manager for the public offering of shares of Harris common stock
in December 1999. In the ordinary course of its business, U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray and its affiliates may actively trade securities of Harris or Total for
their own accounts or the accounts of their customers and, accordingly, may at
any time hold a long or short position in those securities.

         Under the terms of its engagement letter with Harris, U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray provided financial advisory services and a fairness opinion in
connection with the merger and Harris agreed to pay

U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray an aggregate fee of $650,000 upon completion of the
merger. Whether or not the transaction is consummated, Harris has agreed to pay
the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and to
indemnify U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray against liabilities incurred. These
liabilities include liabilities under the federal securities laws in connection
with the engagement of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray by Harris's Board of
Directors.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

         General

         Certain executive officers and directors of Total, in their capacities
as such, may be deemed to have interests in the merger that are in addition to
or different from their interests as Total stockholders generally. These
include, among other things, provisions in the merger agreement relating to
indemnification and insurance, the accelerated vesting of outstanding stock
options and the receipt of severance and welfare benefits under certain
pre-existing employment agreements. Total's Board of Directors was aware of
these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

         Table 1 below lists, with respect to each of Total's executive
officers, (i) the number of shares of Total common stock issuable to such
executive officer upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, all of which
will become immediately exercisable upon completion of the merger and will be
converted into stock options to purchase shares of Harris common stock, as
described under "Merger Consideration - Treatment of Total Stock Options" on
page __, and (ii) the approximate number of shares of Harris common stock that
will be issuable upon the exercise of these stock options after the completion
of the merger. Table 2 below lists, with respect to each of Total's executive
officers, the approximate amount of potential severance payments receivable by
such executive officer pursuant to such executive officer's existing employment
agreement with Total, in the event that his or her employment with Total is
terminated under qualifying circumstances after adoption of the merger agreement
by Total's stockholders. The employment agreements governing these payments are
referred to below. Figures with respect to options in the following tables are
as of November 1, 2001, except as otherwise indicated.

         In addition, pursuant to their existing agreements with Total, each of

payments under their prior employment agreements with Total and paid a "gross

excise, income or other taxes, incurred by reason of Harris's payment of the
excise taxes otherwise payable by Messrs. Shecter and Brodsky.

         Agreements with Executives

         Total has entered into the following employment agreements with certain
of its executive officers:

         1.       Employment Agreement by and between Total and Albert
                  Angrisani, dated as of July 3, 2000;

         2.       Employment Agreement by and between Total and David Brodsky,
                  dated as of July 1, 2000;

         4.       Employment Agreement by and between Total and Patti Hoffman,
                  dated as of January 1, 1999, and subsequently extended through
                  December 31, 2001, with an additional option to extend upon
                  mutual agreement through June 30, 2002 pursuant to the Senior
                  Management Compensation Term Sheet Fiscal Year 2002;

                  dated as of July 1, 2000;

                  dated as of January 1, 2001;

         7.       Employment Agreement by and between Total and Mark Nissenfeld,

                  Shecter, dated as of July 1, 2000;

         Each of the employment agreements listed above contains change in
control provisions. The change in control provisions for David Brodsky and
Howard L. Shecter are described above under "General." The agreements with the
other executive officers provide for severance benefits and continuation of
welfare benefits to such executive officers if their employment is terminated
under qualifying circumstances after the completion of the merger. Mr.
Angrisani's employment agreement with Total, including the change in control
provisions, will be replaced by provisions in his employment agreement with
Harris, as described below under "Employment of Albert A. Angrisani." The merger
will constitute a change in control under the employment agreements.

         Director Appointment

         If the merger is completed, Harris's Board of Directors will be
increased by three members and Albert A. Angrisani, President, Chief Executive
Officer and a Director of Total, David Brodsky, Chairman of the Board of
Directors of Total, and Howard L. Shecter, Vice Chairman of the Board of
Directors of Total, will be appointed to fill the newly created vacancies.

         Subject to the applicable fiduciary obligations of Harris's Board of
Directors and, in the case of Albert A. Angrisani, subject to his continued
employment by Harris at the time of re-nomination, Harris has agreed to use its
best efforts to have Messrs. Angrisani, Brodsky and Shecter nominated for
re-election at the next upcoming Harris annual meeting of stockholders at which
such individuals' respective classes are up for re-election.

         Employment of Albert A. Angrisani

         Pursuant to an employment agreement and accompanying letter agreement
between Harris and Albert A. Angrisani, if the merger is consummated, Mr.
Angrisani will serve in the capacity as President and Chief Operating Officer of
Harris, reporting to Gordon S. Black, Harris's Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer. The initial term of Mr. Angrisani's employment agreement expires on
December 31, 2003, which term shall be automatically renewed for one additional

initial term. As President and Chief Operating Officer of Harris, Mr. Angrisani
will be eligible to receive, among other things, the following compensation and
benefits:

         -        annual base salary of $300,000;

         -        an annual performance bonus of up to $250,000, with a target
                  bonus of $100,000, based on performance standards relating to
                  Harris's revenue and operating income;

         -        a grant, effective upon consummation of the merger, of options
                  to purchase 500,000 shares of Harris's common stock under the
                  Harris Long-Term Incentive Plan, which options shall vest 1/36
                  at the end of each month during the term of the employment
                  agreement;

         -        reimbursement of any excise taxes payable by Mr. Angrisani by
                  reason of receiving excess parachute payments under his prior
                  employment agreement with Total or his agreement with Harris
                  and payment of a "gross-up" amount necessary to offset any and
                  all applicable federal, state and local excise, income or
                  other taxes incurred by Mr. Angrisani by reason of Harris's or
                  Total's payment of the excise taxes otherwise payable by Mr.
                  Angrisani;

         -        vacation, automobile allowance, expense reimbursements and
                  other employee benefits provided by Harris to its senior
                  executives generally;

         -        a one time payment of $1,250,000 on the date his employment
                  commences in consideration of his agreement to be subject to
                  the non-competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality
                  covenants described below; and

         -        continuation of a $500,000 loan originally made by Total, due
                  June 30, 2002, collateralized by shares of Harris common
                  stock.

         In addition, as part of the termination of Mr. Angrisani's existing
employment agreement with Total, he will, among other things:

         -        receive a one-time "change of control" payment of $250,000,
                  payable on December 31, 2002;

         -        have a $300,000 loan from Total forgiven; and

         -        receive a bonus of $175,000.

         During the term of the employment agreement, if Mr. Angrisani's
employment is terminated under qualifying circumstances, he will be entitled to
receive certain payments and benefits, including a severance payment of (i)
$400,000, if termination occurs during the initial two year term, and (ii) if
termination occurs during the third year of the employment agreement, his unpaid
salary plus performance bonus for the remainder of the term. Moreover, if Harris
elects not to renew the employment agreement following expiration of the initial
two year term, Mr. Angrisani will be entitled to a severance payment of
$300,000. Mr. Angrisani also will be subject to certain non-competition,
non-solicitation and confidentiality covenants. Throughout the period that Mr.
Angrisani is employed by Harris, and for a period of one year after his
employment is terminated for any reason, Mr. Angrisani may not own, be employed
by or otherwise be affiliated with any business that is substantially similar to
the business (or any significant part of the business) of Harris. For the term
of the employment agreement (including any unexpired portion) and for one year
thereafter, Mr. Angrisani may not encourage any employee of Harris to terminate
his or her employment, employ any individual who is or within the preceding year
was employed by Harris, or contact, service or solicit any of Harris's clients,
customers or accounts on behalf of any competing business. Mr. Angrisani may not
at any time, whether while employed by Harris or thereafter, disclose or use any
confidential information of Harris.

         Indemnification and Insurance of Directors and Officers

         Total's organizational documents provide for the indemnification, to
the full extent permitted by applicable law, of the members of Total's Board of
Directors and its executive officers for any action or proceeding against a
director or such officer by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of Total. In addition, Total's organizational documents
provide that Total will pay all expenses incurred by such director or officer in
defending an action against such director or officer, in the manner and to the
full extent permitted by applicable law.

         Harris has agreed that the indemnification provisions of the surviving
corporation's organizational documents following the merger shall be no less
favorable than those set forth in the organizational documents of Total
immediately prior to the completion of the merger, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years following
completion of the merger in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of individuals who at any time prior to the merger were directors or
officers of Total in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to
the merger unless such modification is required by applicable law. Harris and
the surviving corporation also have agreed to indemnify, from and after the
completion of the merger, the present and former officers and directors of Total
against all claims based in whole or in part by reason of the fact that such
person is or was a director or officer of Total and arising out of actions,
events or omissions occurring prior to the completion of the merger, in each
case to the full extent permitted by applicable law or in any applicable
contract or agreement. Harris has also agreed to maintain directors and officers
insurance covering present and former officers of Total. See "Certain Other
Covenants" beginning on page __.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

         The following discussion is a summary of the material United States
federal income tax consequences of the exchange of shares of Total common stock
for shares of Harris common stock in the merger. The discussion which follows is
based on the Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder,
administrative rulings and pronouncements and judicial decisions as of the date
hereof, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.
Any such change could alter the tax consequences discussed in this Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. The following discussion is also based on, among other
things, representations made by Harris and Total. If any of these
representations is inaccurate, the tax consequences of the merger could differ
from those described in this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

         The following discussion is for general information only and, except
where specifically noted, does not address the effects of any state, local or
non-U.S. tax laws. In addition, the discussion below relates to persons who hold
shares of Total common stock and will hold shares of Harris common stock as
capital assets. The tax treatment of a Total stockholder may vary depending upon
such stockholder's particular situation, and certain stockholders may be subject
to special rules not discussed below. Such stockholders would include, for
example, non-U.S. persons, partners of partnerships that hold shares of Total
common stock or will hold shares of Harris common stock, insurance companies,
tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions, broker-dealers and individuals
who received shares of Total common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee
stock options or otherwise as compensation.

         In the opinion of Harris Beach LLP and Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel
LLP:

         -        the merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning
                  of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code; and

         -        each of Harris, Merger Sub and Total will be a party to the
                  reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the
                  Internal Revenue Code.

         Based on those conclusions, the following additional material U.S.
federal income tax consequences will result from the merger:

         -        Total stockholders will not recognize any income, gain or loss
                  on the exchange of shares of Total common stock for shares of
                  Harris common stock in the merger (except for cash received in
                  lieu of fractional shares);

         -        the tax basis to a Total stockholder of the shares of Harris
                  common stock received in exchange for shares of Total common
                  stock pursuant to the merger, including any fractional share
                  interest in shares of Harris common stock for which cash is
                  received, will equal such Total stockholder's tax basis in the
                  shares of Total common stock surrendered in exchange therefor;

         -        the holding period of a Total stockholder for the shares of
                  Harris common stock received pursuant to the merger will
                  include the holding period of the shares of Total common stock
                  surrendered in exchange therefor;

         -        a Total stockholder who receives cash in lieu of a fractional
                  share interest in a share of Harris common stock pursuant to
                  the merger will be treated as having received such cash in
                  redemption of such fractional share interest and generally
                  will recognize capital gain or

                  loss on such deemed exchange in an amount equal to the
                  difference between the amount of cash received and the basis
                  of the Total common stock allocable to such fractional share;
                  and

         -        no income, gain or loss will be recognized by Harris, Total or
                  Merger Sub as a result of the transfer to Total stockholders
                  of the shares of Harris common stock pursuant to the merger.

         The obligations of Harris and Total to complete the merger are
conditioned upon the receipt of opinions to the same effect as those described
above as of the date that the merger is completed. If the condition relating to
delivery of such opinions is waived and there is a material change in the tax
consequences of the merger, Harris and Total will recirculate proxy materials
regarding the merger and resolicit proxies. Such opinions are and will be based
on, among other things, facts existing as of the dates of such opinions, certain
representations as to factual matters made by Harris, Merger Sub and Total and
the assumption that the merger is consummated in accordance with the terms of
the merger agreement. Such representations or assumption, if incorrect in
certain material respects, could jeopardize the conclusions reached in the
opinions. Such opinions are not binding on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or
the courts.

         The foregoing discussion is intended only as a summary and does not
purport to be a complete analysis or listing of all potential tax effects
relevant to a decision whether to vote in favor of approval and adoption of the
merger agreement. Total stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors
concerning the United States federal, state and local, and non-United States,
tax consequences of the merger to them.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

         In accordance with the recently issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Harris will
use the purchase method of accounting for a business combination to account for
the merger, as well as the new accounting and reporting regulations for goodwill
and other intangibles. Under these methods of accounting, the assets and
liabilities of Total, including all intangible assets, will be recorded at their
respective fair market values. All intangible assets will be amortized over
their estimated useful lives with the exception of goodwill and any other
intangibles with indefinite lives. Goodwill and other intangibles with
indefinite lives will be assessed for impairment on a periodic basis in the
future. The financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Total
will be included in Harris's financial statements prospectively as of the
completion of the merger.

CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS

         Each of Harris and Total have committed to use its reasonable best
efforts to take whatever actions are required to obtain necessary regulatory
approvals.

         Neither Harris nor Total believes that consummation of the merger will
result in a violation of any applicable antitrust laws. However, there is no
assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made
or, if such a challenge is made, of the result.

         Harris and Total do not believe that any material governmental filings,
other than the Certificate of Merger in Delaware, are required with respect to
the merger. In addition to the United States, Harris and Total conduct
operations in a number of countries where regulatory filings or approvals may be
required in connection with the consummation of the merger. Harris and Total
believe that all such

material filings and approvals have been made or obtained, will be made or
obtained, or will not need to be made or obtained, as the case may be.

U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAW CONSEQUENCES

         Total stockholders who receive shares of Harris common stock issued in
connection with the merger can freely transfer such shares under the Securities
Act, except that persons who are deemed to be "affiliates", as such term is
defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act, of Total prior to the merger may only
sell shares they receive in the merger in transactions permitted by the resale
provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, or as otherwise permitted under
the Securities Act. It is expected that these restrictions will apply to the
directors and executive officers of Total and the holders of 10% or more of the
shares of Total common stock.

         In general, under Rule 145, for one year following the consummation of
the merger, Total affiliates will be subject to the following restrictions on
the public sale of shares of Harris common stock acquired in the merger:

         -        a Total affiliate, together with certain related persons, may
                  sell only through unsolicited "broker transactions" or in
                  transactions directly with a "market maker," as such terms are
                  defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act;

         -        the number of shares of Harris common stock a Total affiliate
                  may sell, together with certain related persons and certain
                  persons acting in concert, within any three-month period may
                  not exceed the greater of 1% of the outstanding shares of
                  Harris common stock or the average weekly trading volume of
                  such shares during the four calendar weeks preceding such
                  sale; and

         -        a Total affiliate may sell only if Harris remains current with
                  its informational filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act.

         After the end of one year from the consummation of the merger, a Total
affiliate who is not an affiliate of Harris may sell shares of Harris common
stock received in the merger without restriction, provided that Harris is
current with its Exchange Act informational filings. Two years after the
consummation of the merger, an affiliate of Total may sell such shares of Harris
common stock without any restrictions so long as such affiliate was not an
affiliate of Harris for at least three months prior to such sale.

DIVIDENDS

         Although the payment of dividends by Harris in the future will depend
on business conditions, Harris's financial condition and earnings, and other
factors, since Harris became a public company on December 6, 1999, it has not
declared or paid dividends and does not intend to pay any dividends on its
capital stock in the foreseeable future. The merger agreement restricts each of
Total and Harris, without prior consultation with the Integration Committee and
consent of the other party (in the case of consents by Total, not to be
unreasonably withheld) from declaring, making or paying any dividend or other
distribution or payment with respect to its capital stock, or purchasing,
redeeming or otherwise acquiring any shares of its capital stock, except to the
extent necessary to meet minimum tax withholding obligations in connection with
the exercise of any stock options, during the period from the date of the merger
agreement until the earlier of the termination of the merger agreement or the
consummation of the merger.

NASDAQ LISTING

         Shares of Harris common stock and Total common stock are each quoted on
the Nasdaq National Market. It is a condition to the merger that the Nasdaq
National Market authorize for listing the shares of Harris common stock to be
delivered in connection with the merger.

         If the merger is completed, Total's common stock will be delisted from
the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

         Neither Total stockholders nor Harris stockholders will have appraisal
rights under the Delaware General Corporation Law by reason of the merger or the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

                       PROVISIONS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

GENERAL

         This section of this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus describes the
material provisions of the merger agreement. This description is not complete,
and stockholders are encouraged to read the full text of the merger agreement
which is attached to this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus as Annex A, and is
incorporated by reference into this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. In
addition, important information about the merger agreement and the merger is
provided in the previous section entitled "The Merger" beginning on page ______.

THE MERGER

         At the effective time of the merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the merger agreement and the applicable provisions of the Delaware
General Corporation Law, Merger Sub will be merged into Total, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and Total will continue as the
surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Harris.

EFFECTIVE TIME

         Unless the merger agreement is terminated as described below, within
two business days after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the
merger set forth in the merger agreement, the closing of the merger will take
place at a time and place mutually agreeable to Harris and Total, and Total and
Merger Sub will file a Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, as prescribed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. The
effect of this filing is that Merger Sub will merge into Total, and Total will
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Harris.

MERGER CONSIDERATION

         General

         As a result of the merger, all outstanding shares of Total common stock
will be converted into shares of Harris common stock based on the exchange ratio
in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, all outstanding shares of
Total common stock owned by Total, Harris or Merger Sub or their respective
wholly owned subsidiaries will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist,
and all

outstanding options to purchase shares of Total common stock will be fully
vested and converted, at the exchange ratio, into options to purchase shares of
Harris common stock.

         The Exchange Ratio

         In the merger, holders of shares of Total common stock will receive
1.222 shares of Harris common stock for each share of Total common stock which
they own.

         Fractional Shares

         In the merger, Total stockholders will be entitled to receive only
whole numbers of shares of Harris common stock for their shares of Total common
stock. If applying the exchange ratio would entitle a stockholder to receive a
fraction of a share of Harris common stock, such stockholder will receive cash
for any fractional share of Harris common stock he or she would otherwise be
entitled to receive in the merger. The amount of cash to be received in lieu of
any fractional share will be calculated by multiplying (i) the fractional share
interest to which such stockholder is entitled, by (ii) the closing price (as
reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets or, if not reported thereby, another
nationally recognized source acceptable to Harris and Total) of a share of
Harris common stock on the date on which the merger is completed. As promptly as
practicable after the determination of the aggregate amount of cash to be paid
to holders of fractional interests, Harris shall deposit such amount with its
exchange agent and shall cause such exchange agent to forward payments to the
holders of fractional interests.

         Treatment of Total Stock Options

         The merger agreement provides that, upon completion of the merger,
outstanding options to purchase shares of Total common stock shall be fully
vested and converted into an option, or a new substitute option will be granted,
to purchase that number of shares of Harris common stock (rounded up to the
nearest whole share) equal to (i) the number of shares of Total common stock
subject to such option, multiplied by (ii) 1.222, the exchange ratio, at an
exercise price per share of Harris common stock (rounded down to the nearest
penny) equal to (x) the former exercise price per share of Total common stock
under such option immediately prior to consummation of the merger, divided by
(y) 1.222, the exchange ratio. In the case of incentive stock options (within
the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code), the number of shares
of Harris common stock and the exercise price per share will be determined in
accordance with Section 424 of the Internal Revenue Code, to ensure that the
options do not lose their status as incentive stock options. Except as provided
in the merger agreement or in the agreement evidencing the grant of such option,
each option shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable
immediately prior to consummation of the merger.

         Harris will prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8, or other appropriate form, to become effective as of or within three
business days following the completion of the merger, with respect to those
shares of Harris common stock subject to the outstanding options.

EXCHANGE OF TOTAL COMMON STOCK

         Prior to consummation of the merger, Harris will appoint an exchange
agent to act as its agent in connection with the exchange of shares of Total
common stock. As soon as reasonably practicable after the consummation of the
merger, the surviving corporation will cause the exchange agent to mail to each
holder of record of shares of Total common stock a letter of transmittal and
instructions as to how to surrender certificates of Total common stock in
exchange for shares of Harris common stock and payment for any fractional shares
of Harris common stock. Total stockholders should not return stock certificates
with the enclosed proxy.

         After the consummation of the merger, each certificate or other
authorized evidence of ownership that previously represented shares of Total
common stock will represent only the right to receive the shares of Harris
common stock into which such shares of Total common stock were converted in the
merger and the right to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares as described
above.

         Holders of certificates previously representing shares of Total common
stock will not be paid dividends or distributions on the shares of Harris common
stock and will not be paid cash in lieu of a fractional share of Harris common
stock until such certificates are surrendered to Harris for exchange. When such
certificates are surrendered, any unpaid dividends declared by Harris after the
consummation of the merger and any cash in lieu of a fractional share of Harris
common stock will be paid without interest. For all other corporate purposes,
certificates that represented shares of Total common stock prior to the
consummation of the merger will represent, from and after the consummation of
the merger, the number of shares of Harris common stock and cash in respect of
fractional shares into which such shares of Total common stock are actually
converted in the merger. The shares of Total common stock will be otherwise
exchanged in accordance with the customary procedures of the exchange agent used
by Harris for such purpose.

         The exchange agent will deliver shares of Harris common stock in
exchange for lost, stolen or destroyed certificates if the owner of such
certificates signs an affidavit of loss, theft or destruction, as appropriate,
and, if required by the surviving corporation, delivers a bond in a reasonable
sum as indemnity against any claim that might be made against Harris with
respect to alleged lost, stolen or destroyed certificates.

         Each of Harris and Total has made various customary representations and

assets, properties, condition (financial or otherwise), goodwill or results of
operations of the party making the representation and warranty and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) would materially impair the ability of
either party to perform its obligations under the merger agreement or otherwise
materially impede the consummation of the merger, other than any material
adverse effect arising out of any change or development relating to changes in
the economic, regulatory or political conditions generally or that affect the
conduct of the business in which either party engages, United States securities
markets, and the effect of public announcement of the transaction.

         For a complete statement of the representations and warranties of
Harris and Total in connection with the merger, stockholders should refer to the
merger agreement which is attached to this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus as
Annex A.

CONDUCT OF BUSINESS BY TOTAL

         Total has agreed that, prior to the consummation of the merger, Total
and each of its subsidiaries will conduct business in the ordinary and usual
course, consistent with past practice. Subject to certain

exceptions described in the merger agreement, Total has also agreed to specific
restrictions, including the following:

         -        changing or amending its organizational documents;

         -        issuing, selling or redeeming shares of its capital stock or
                  any other securities;

INTEGRATION COMMITTEE

         The parties have also established an Integration Committee whose
purpose and power is to oversee the integration of Harris and Total, as well as
certain matters prior to consummation of the merger as referenced in the merger
agreement. The members of the Integration Committee are Thomas D. Berman, Gordon
S. Black and James R. Riedman, each of whom is a director of Harris, and David
Brodsky and Howard L. Shecter, each of whom is a director of Total.

NO SOLICITATION

         Total has agreed that it will not solicit or encourage the initiation
of any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, sale of assets, sale of
shares of capital stock (including without limitation by way of a tender offer)
or similar transactions involving Total or any of its subsidiaries, which, if
consummated, would constitute a "Total Alternative Transaction," defined to
mean:

         -        a transaction pursuant to which any party or group other than
                  Harris acquires or would acquire more than 25% of the
                  outstanding shares of any class of equity securities of Total,
                  whether from Total or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange
                  offer or otherwise;

         -        a merger or other business combination involving Total
                  pursuant to which any party other than Harris acquires more
                  than 25% of the outstanding equity securities of Total or the
                  entity surviving such merger or business combination;

         -        any transaction pursuant to which any party other than Harris
                  acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for
                  this purpose the outstanding equity securities of Total's
                  subsidiaries and securities of the entity surviving any merger
                  or business combination, including any of Total's
                  subsidiaries) of Total or any of its subsidiaries having a
                  fair market value (as determined by Total's Board of Directors
                  in good faith) equal to more than 25% of the fair market value
                  of all of the assets of Total and its subsidiaries, taken as a
                  whole, immediately prior to such transaction; or

         -        any other consolidation, business combination,
                  recapitalization or similar transaction involving Total or any
                  "Significant Subsidiary" (as defined in Rule 1-02 under
                  Regulation S-X) other than the transactions contemplated by
                  the merger agreement; provided, however, that the term Total
                  Alternative Transaction shall not include any acquisition of
                  securities in connection with arbitrage activities.

         Any inquiry or proposal related to the foregoing is referred to as a
"Total Takeover Proposal."

         Prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by the Total stockholders
at the Total special meeting, if Total's Board of Directors reasonably
determines in good faith (after due consultation with its legal advisor) that it
is or is reasonably likely to be required to do so in order to discharge
properly its fiduciary duties, Total's Board of Directors may:

         -        furnish information to a third party which has made a bona
                  fide Total Takeover Proposal that is a "Superior Total
                  Proposal" (as defined below) not solicited in violation of the
                  merger agreement; provided that such third party has executed
                  an agreement with confidentiality provisions substantially
                  similar to those then in effect between Total and

                  Harris. A "Superior Total Proposal" means any proposal made by
                  a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, for
                  consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, all of the
                  equity securities of Total entitled to vote generally in the
                  election of directors or all or substantially all of the
                  assets of Total, on terms which the Total Board of Directors
                  reasonably believes (after consultation with its financial
                  advisor) to be more favorable from a financial point of view
                  to its stockholders than the merger, taking into account at
                  the time of determination all factors relating to such
                  proposed transaction deemed relevant by the Total Board of
                  Directors, including, without limitation, the financing
                  thereof, the proposed timing thereof and all other conditions
                  thereto and any changes to the financial terms of the merger
                  agreement proposed by Harris; provided, however, that a
                  Superior Total Proposal may be subject to a due diligence
                  review of confidential information and to other customary
                  conditions; or

         -        subject to compliance with the terms of the merger agreement,
                  consider and negotiate a bona fide Total Takeover Proposal
                  that is a Superior Total Proposal not solicited in violation
                  of the merger agreement.

         Total will notify Harris as promptly as practicable (but in no case
later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Total Takeover Proposal, or any
modification of or amendment to any Total Takeover Proposal, or any request for
non-public information relating to Total or any of its subsidiaries in
connection with a Total Takeover Proposal, or for access to the properties,
books or records of Total or any of its subsidiaries by any party that informs
Total's Board of Directors that it is considering making, or has made, a Total
Takeover Proposal. Such notice to Harris will be made orally and in writing, and
will indicate the identity of the party making the Total Takeover Proposal,
intending to make the Total Takeover Proposal, or requesting non-public
information or access to the books and records of Total, the terms of any such
Total Takeover Proposal or modification or amendment to a Total Takeover
Proposal, and whether Total is providing or intends to provide the party making
the Total Takeover Proposal with access to information concerning Total. Total
will also promptly notify Harris, orally and in writing, if it enters into
negotiations concerning any Total Takeover Proposal.

         Unless Total's Board of Directors determines in good faith, with the
advice of outside counsel, that the failure to do so could reasonably be
determined to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to Total's stockholders under
applicable law, and only after three business days following written notice to
Harris that Total's Board of Directors has received a Superior Total Proposal or
any modification thereof, neither Total nor Total's Board of Directors, nor any
committee thereof, may:

         -        withdraw, modify or indicate publicly its intention to
                  withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Harris, the
                  approval or recommendation by Total's Board of Directors or
                  such committee of the merger;

         -        approve or recommend, or indicate publicly its intention to
                  approve or recommend, any Total Takeover Proposal; or

         -        cause Total to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
                  principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement
                  related to any Total Takeover Proposal.

         The merger agreement expressly provides that the foregoing covenants
will not prohibit Total from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or
from making any disclosure to Total's stockholders if, in the good faith
judgment of Total's Board of Directors, with the advice of outside counsel,
failure to so disclose could

reasonably be determined to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to Total's
stockholders under applicable law.

         Total agreed, upon execution of the merger agreement, to immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with
any third party with respect to any of the foregoing. Total further agrees not
to release any third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of
any agreement to which Total is a party, except as otherwise permitted by the
merger agreement. Total will ensure that the officers and directors of Total and
its subsidiaries and any investment banker or other advisor or representative
retained by Total in connection with the merger are aware of the no-solicitation
restrictions described above.

CERTAIN OTHER COVENANTS

         Consents; Approvals

         Harris and Total will each use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
all consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders, and Harris and Total
will make all filings, required in connection with the authorization, execution
and delivery of the merger agreement and the consummation by each of Harris and
Total of the transactions contemplated thereby.

         Indemnification And Insurance

         For a period of six years following consummation of the merger, the
organizational documents of the surviving corporation will contain provisions
with respect to indemnification no less favorable than those currently set forth
in the organizational documents of Total, and such provisions will not be
amended, modified or otherwise repealed in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of individuals who were directors or officers of
Total at the time of the consummation of the merger unless otherwise required by
law.

         After the consummation of the merger, Harris and the surviving
corporation will, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law or in any
applicable contract or agreement or under its organizational documents,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former officers and
directors of Total against all losses, expenses, claims, damages, liabilities or
amounts that are paid in settlement of, with the approval of the surviving
corporation (which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), or otherwise
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, based in whole or in part by reason of the fact that such person
is or was a director or officer of Total, and arising out of actions, events or
omissions occurring at or prior to the consummation of the merger.

         If any claim is brought against a director or officer of Total after
consummation of the merger:

         -        such director or officer may retain independent legal counsel
                  satisfactory to them, provided that such other counsel shall
                  be reasonably acceptable to the surviving corporation;

         -        the surviving corporation will pay all reasonable fees and
                  expenses of such counsel promptly; and

         -        the surviving corporation will use its reasonable best efforts
                  to assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter, provided
                  that the surviving corporation will not be liable for any
                  settlement effected without its written consent, which consent
                  shall not be unreasonably withheld.

         For a period of six years after the consummation of the merger, Harris
or the surviving corporation will provide those directors and officers of Total,
who are currently covered by a Total liability policy, with an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior
to the consummation of the merger that is no less favorable than Total's
existing policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that Harris and the
surviving corporation will not be required to pay an annual insurance premium in
excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by Total for such insurance, but
in such case will purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount.

         Notification Of Certain Matters

         Harris and Total will give each other prompt notice of:

         -        the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event which would be
                  likely to cause any condition to the obligations of either
                  Harris or Total to effect the transaction contemplated by the
                  merger agreement not to be satisfied;

         -        any notice received by Harris or Total prior to the
                  consummation of the merger of, or other communication relating
                  to, a default or event which, with notice or lapse of time or
                  both, would become a default, under any material agreement of
                  Harris or Total;

         -        any notice or other communication from any governmental entity
                  in connection with the merger;

         -        any actions, suits, claims, investigations or other
                  proceedings commenced or threatened against Harris or Total or
                  their respective subsidiaries which would have been required
                  to be disclosed under, or which otherwise relate to, the
                  merger agreement;

         -        any notice or other communication from any third party
                  alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be
                  required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
                  the merger agreement; or

         -        any event or occurrence which has, or would reasonably be
                  likely to have, a material adverse effect with respect to
                  Harris or Total.

         Further Action/Tax Treatment

         Harris and Total agree to use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do all other things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement, to obtain in a timely manner all necessary waivers,
consents and approvals and to effect all necessary registrations and filings,
and otherwise to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all conditions precedent to
each of their obligations under the merger agreement. In addition, Harris and
Total have each agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the merger
to qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368 of the
Internal Revenue Code, as specified in the merger agreement, and will not, both
before and after consummation of the merger, take any actions which to their
knowledge could reasonably be expected to prevent the merger from so qualifying.

         Public Announcements

         Neither Harris nor Total will issue any press release or otherwise make
any public statements with respect to the merger agreement or the transactions
contemplated therein without the prior consent of the other party, except as
required by applicable law or the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and, to the extent
practical, after consultation with the other party.

         Listing of Shares of Harris Common Stock

         Harris will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of
Harris common stock to be issued in connection with the merger to be approved
for listing on the Nasdaq National Market prior to consummation of the merger,
subject to official notice of issuance.

         Option Plan And Employee Benefits

         During the six-month period following the consummation of the merger,
Harris's Board of Directors shall develop and implement a unified program of
employee benefits that will provide equivalent employee benefits to all
similarly situated employees of Harris and its subsidiaries, including the
surviving corporation.

         During the period of time from the consummation of the merger through
the time that the unified program of employee benefits is implemented as
contemplated by the merger agreement, the surviving corporation shall provide
each person who, as of the consummation of the merger, is an employee of Total
or a subsidiary of Total, with salary, bonus opportunity and other employee
benefits that are no less favorable than those provided to such employee of
Total immediately prior to the consummation of the merger; provided, however,
that subject to the foregoing, the surviving corporation shall have the right to
amend any benefit plan of Total in effect as of the consummation of the merger.

         Upon completion of the merger, all outstanding options to purchase
shares of Total common stock will become fully vested and exercisable,
regardless of whether such options would have been exercisable at that time
under their original vesting schedules.

         Director Appointment

         Upon consummation of the merger, the size of Harris's Board of
Directors will be increased by three members, which positions will be filled by
Albert A. Angrisani, as a class III director, David Brodsky, as a class I
director, and Howard L. Shecter, as a class II director.

         Subject to the applicable fiduciary obligations of Harris's Board of
Directors and, in the case of Albert A. Angrisani, subject to his continued
employment by Harris at the time of re-nomination, Harris has agreed to use its
best efforts to have Messrs. Angrisani, Brodsky and Shecter nominated for
re-election at the next upcoming Harris annual meeting of stockholders at which
such individuals' respective classes are up for re-election.

                           failure of consummation;

         -        by Total, if

                  -        Total is not in material breach of the merger
                           agreement and Harris breaches any representation,

                           agreement which breach is incurable or remains

                           merger agreement which breach is incurable or remains

                           proxies in connection therewith.

TERMINATION FEE AND EXPENSES

         If the merger is terminated:

         -        by Total in connection with a Superior Total Proposal;

         -        by Harris due to a withdrawal or modification by the Total
                  Board of Directors of its recommendation of the merger or a
                  failure of the Total Board of Directors to call the special
                  meeting or solicit proxies; or

         -        because the merger is not consummated by January 31, 2002 or
                  the Total stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement at
                  the Total special meeting, and (i) a Total Takeover Proposal
                  shall have been made to Total or publicly announced prior to
                  such termination, and (ii) within nine months of such
                  termination Total enters into a definitive agreement to
                  consummate, or consummates, any Total Takeover Proposal;

Total is required to pay to Harris a termination fee of $1,250,000 and to
reimburse Harris for up to $500,000 of Harris's reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, not including financial advisor fees.

         If the merger is terminated by Harris on account of a breach by Total,
Total is required to reimburse Harris for up to $625,000 of Harris's reasonable
costs and expenses (including financial advisor fees). If the merger is
terminated by Total on account of a breach by Harris, Harris is required to
reimburse Total for up to $625,000 of Total's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(including financial advisor fees).

         The termination fees payable by Total may have the effect of
discouraging persons who might be interested in entering into a business
combination with Total from proposing a business combination transaction. This
may be so even where the consideration payable to Total stockholders in the
other transaction would exceed the consideration payable in the merger.

PARTIES IN INTEREST; AMENDMENT; WAIVER

         Neither the merger agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations of Harris, Total or Merger Sub under the merger agreement may be
assigned, by operation of law or otherwise, and any attempted assignment thereof
shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, the merger agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, Harris, Total and
Merger Sub and their respective successors and assigns. Adoption of the merger
agreement and consummation of the merger is not intended to and will not confer
upon any other person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever.

         The merger agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of the parties hereto.

         The merger agreement may be amended by action taken by Total and Harris
at any time before or after approval of the merger and approval of the issuance
of shares of Harris common stock in connection with the merger, provided that
after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which requires the approval
of such stockholders under applicable law without such approval.

         At any time prior to the consummation of the merger, either Harris or
Total may:

         -        extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
                  or other acts of the other party;

         -        waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
                  of the other party contained in the merger agreement or in any
                  document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant to the
                  merger agreement, or

         -        waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements
                  or conditions contained in the merger agreement.

         Any agreement on the part of Harris or Total to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of either Harris or Total to assert any of its
rights under the merger agreement will not constitute a waiver of such rights,
and no single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege will
preclude any other or further exercise thereof by either Harris or Total.

(a)  On August 5, 2001, Harris and Total agreed on a merger that will be
     accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The merger will be
     effected by Harris issuing shares of its common stock at an exchange ratio
     of 1.222 shares for each share of Total common stock, and by the conversion
     of outstanding Total stock options, as of the effective time of the merger,
     into options to purchase shares of Harris common stock at the exchange
     ratio of 1.222 shares. The actual number of shares of Harris stock to be
     issued will depend on the actual number of shares of Total common stock
     outstanding on the date the merger closes. The merger is valued at
     approximately $47.05 million based upon the average closing price of shares
     of Harris common stock for a range of trading days (August 1 through August
     8, 2001) around the announcement date of (August 6, 2001) the merger.

     The purchase price will be allocated based upon the fair value of the
     assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For purposes of the pro forma
     presentation, the book value of the office equipment, leasehold
     improvements, and software approximates fair market value. The final
     calculations will be determined based on studies and valuations which will
     be conducted. The excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired
     has been allocated to goodwill and other intangibles in this presentation.
     Based upon the preliminary assessment of intangible assets acquired, the
     excess purchase price is primarily attributable to goodwill, workforce in
     place, and other intangible assets with indefinite lives.

(b)  Adjustment relates to non-recurring transaction costs, including investment
     banking, legal and accounting fees, and change of control and non-compete
     payments directly attributable to the merger. See "Opinion of Total's
     Financial Advisor" beginning on page ___, "Opinion of Harris's Financial
     Advisor" beginning on page ___, and "Interests of Certain Persons in the
     Merger" beginning on page ___.

(c)  Adjustment reflects the issuance of 16.5 million shares of Harris stock to
     effect the exchange of shares of Total common stock at an exchange ratio of
     1.222 shares of Harris common stock for each share of Total common stock
     and the conversion of options to acquire shares of Total common stock
     outstanding as of the effective time of the merger, into options to
     purchase Harris common stock at the exchange ratio of 1.222 shares.

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK

         The following description of Harris's common stock and preferred stock
summarizes the material terms and provisions of these securities. For the
complete terms of Harris's common stock and preferred stock, please refer to
Harris's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, which
have been filed with the SEC.

AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK

         Harris's authorized capital stock consists of 100,000,000 shares of
common stock, par value $.001 per share, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $.01 per share.

         As of _____________, 2001, the record date for the Harris annual
meeting, there were ____________ shares of Harris common stock issued and
outstanding and no shares of Harris preferred stock issued and outstanding.

HARRIS COMMON STOCK

         Dividends

         Harris's Board of Directors may declare and pay dividends upon the
shares of its common stock out of funds legally available to pay dividends.
However, this dividend right is subject to any preferential dividend rights
Harris may grant to holders of preferred stock, if any, then outstanding.

         Voting Rights

         For all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, each holder of
shares of Harris common stock is entitled to one vote for each share registered
in his, her or its name on the books of Harris. Shares of Harris common stock do
not have cumulative voting rights.

         Liquidation

         On a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Harris, the holders of
shares of Harris common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets that
remain after payment of Harris's liabilities, subject to prior distribution
rights of the holders of preferred stock, if any, then outstanding.

         Variation of Rights

         Generally, in all matters other than the election of directors,
amendments to Harris's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
mergers and similar transactions, the affirmative vote of a majority of the
shares of Harris common stock present at a meeting, whether in person or by
proxy, is required to constitute an act of the stockholders.

         Provisions of Harris's Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws may have the effect of making it more difficult for a
third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to
acquire, control of Harris. These provisions, which are more fully described in
the section "Comparison of Stockholder Rights" on page ___:

         -        divide Harris's Board of Directors into three classes serving
                  staggered three-year terms;

         -        eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent
                  without a meeting; and

         -        allow Harris to issue preferred stock without any vote or
                  further action by stockholders.

         The classification system of electing directors may tend to discourage
a third-party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain
control of Harris and may maintain the incumbency of Harris's Board of
Directors, as the classification of Harris's Board of Directors increases the
difficulty of replacing a majority of the directors. These provisions may have
the effect of deferring hostile takeovers, delaying changes in Harris's control
or management, or may make it more difficult for stockholders to take certain
corporate actions. An amendment of the provisions relating to the staggered
board or the elimination of the prohibition to act by written consent requires
the approval of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the shares of Harris common
stock. For a more detailed explanation of Harris's Restated and Amended
Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, see "Comparison of Stockholder Rights"
on page _____.

         Preemptive Rights, Redemptions and Other Rights

         Holders of shares of Harris common stock have no preemptive rights or
rights to convert their shares of Harris common stock into any other securities.
There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the shares of
Harris common stock. All outstanding shares of Harris common stock are duly
authorized, fully paid and non-assessable, and the shares of Harris common stock
to be issued in connection with the merger will be duly authorized, fully paid
and non-assessable.

         Transfer Agent and Registrar

         The transfer agent and registrar for the shares of Harris common stock
is American Stock Transfer and Trust Company.

HARRIS PREFERRED STOCK

         Pursuant to Harris's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation,
Harris's Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by its
stockholders, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more
series and to fix the designations, powers, preferences and privileges of such
preferred stock, which may be greater than the rights of the common stock.
Harris's Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, may issue preferred
stock with voting, conversion or other rights that could adversely affect the
voting power and other rights of the holders of shares of Harris common stock.

LISTING

         The shares of Harris common stock are listed on the Nasdaq National
Market. It is a condition to the merger that the shares of Harris common stock
issuable in connection with the merger are authorized for listing on the Nasdaq
National Market at or prior to the consummation of the merger, subject to
official notice of issuance.

                  OTHER HARRIS PROPOSALS FOR STOCKHOLDER ACTION

             Harris Proposal Number 2 - Election of Harris Directors

         Harris's Board of Directors is currently divided into three classes,
having three-year terms that expire in successive years. The current term of
office of directors in Class II expires at the Harris annual meeting. Harris's
Board of Directors proposes that the nominees described below, each of whom is
currently serving as a Class II director, be re-elected as Class II directors
for a term of three years or until their successors are duly elected and
qualified. Each of the nominees has consented to serve a three-year term. If
either of them become unavailable to serve as a director, Harris's Board of
Directors may designate a substitute nominee. In that case, the persons named as
proxies will vote for the substitute nominee designated by the Board of
Directors.

         If the merger is completed, Harris's Board of Directors will be
increased by three members and Albert A. Angrisani, President, Chief Executive
Officer and a Director of Total, David Brodsky, Chairman of the Board of
Directors of Total, and Howard L. Shecter, Vice Chairman of the Board of
Directors of Total, will be appointed to fill the newly created vacancies. See
"Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger" beginning on page ____.

VOTE REQUIRED

         The two nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of
the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote, a
quorum being present, shall be elected as Harris's directors. Only votes cast
for a nominee will be counted, except that the accompanying proxy will be voted
for all nominees in the absence of instructions to the contrary. Abstentions,
broker non-votes and instructions on the accompanying proxy card to withhold
authority to vote for one or more nominees will result in the respective
nominees receiving fewer votes. However, the number of votes otherwise received
by the nominee will not be reduced by such action.

granted during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 to the Named Executive
Officers. In accordance with the rules of the SEC, the following table also sets
forth the potential realizable value over the term of the options (the period
from the grant date to the expiration date) based on assumed rates of stock
appreciation of 0%, 5% and 10%, compounded annually. These amounts do not
represent Harris's estimate of future stock prices. Actual realizable values, if
any, of stock options will depend on the future performance of shares of Harris
common stock. No stock appreciation rights were granted to the Named Executive
Officers during the fiscal year. In fact, Harris has never granted any stock
appreciation rights.

(1) Based on an aggregate of 653,250 options granted in the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2001 to employees of Harris, including the Named Executive Officers.

(2) The potential realizable value is calculated based on the term of the option
at its time of grant and illustrates value that might be realized upon exercise
of the options immediately prior to the expiration of their terms, assuming the
specified annual compounded rates of appreciation of the market price per share
from the date of grant to the end of the option term. Actual gains, if any, on
stock option exercise are dependent upon a number of factors, including the
future performance of shares of Harris's common stock and the timing of option
exercises, as well as the optionee's continued employment through the vesting
period. There can be no assurance that the amounts reflected in this table will
be achieved.

REPORT OF HARRIS'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON COMPENSATION ISSUES

         The following report is provided to the stockholders of Harris by the
members of the Compensation Committee of Harris's Board of Directors.

         Harris's Compensation Committee made no changes to the compensation of
the executive officers over whom they exercise oversight responsibility and
awarded no bonuses to those executive officers.

         Compensation Philosophy

         The goals of Harris's compensation policy are to attract, retain and
reward executive officers who contribute to the overall success of the company
by offering compensation that is competitive in the industry and geographic
region in which Harris operates, to motivate executives to achieve the company's
business objectives and to align the interests of Harris's executive officers
with the long-term interests of Harris's stockholders. Harris currently uses
salary, bonuses and stock options to meet these goals.

         Forms of Compensation

         Harris provides its executive officers with a compensation package
consisting of base salary, incentive bonuses and participation in benefit plans
generally available to other employees. In setting total compensation, the
Compensation Committee considers individual performance and the performance of
Harris, as well as market information regarding compensation paid by other
companies in Harris's industry.

         Base Salary

         Harris provides a base salary and benefits package that is competitive
within the industry and geographic region in which it offers employment.
Salaries for executive officers are initially set based on negotiation with
individual executive officers at the time of recruitment and with reference to
salaries for comparable positions for individuals of similar education and
background to the executive officers being recruited. Harris also gives
consideration to the individual's experience, reputation in his or her industry
and expected contributions to the company. Salaries of Harris's Named Executive
Officers, except its Group President-Business and Consumer Services and Group
President-Emerging Markets, are determined annually by the Compensation
Committee and are subject to adjustments based on (i) the Compensation
Committee's determination that the individual's level of contribution to Harris
has increased since his or her salary had last been reviewed, and (ii) increases
in competitive pay levels. The Chief Executive Officer reviews and takes action
with respect to the compensation of other executive officers and key personnel.
Executive officers are generally eligible to participate in benefit programs
that are available to all employees.

         Bonuses

         Bonus payments to executive officers, other than the Chief Executive
Officer and President, are determined by the Compensation Committee, in
consultation with the Chief Executive Officer and President, based on Harris's
financial performance and the achievement of the officer's individual
performance objectives. The bonus amounts for the Chief Executive Officer and
President are determined by the Compensation Committee, without participation by
the Chief Executive Officer or President, based on the same factors.

         Long-Term Incentives

         Longer term incentives are provided through Harris's Long-Term
Incentive Plan, which rewards executives and other employees through the growth
in value of Harris's stock. Harris's Board of Directors acts as the "Committee"
under the Plan for purposes of administering the Plan and selecting those
individuals to whom options or other awards should be granted and the terms of
those awards. The Compensation Committee believes that employee equity ownership
is highly motivating, provides a major incentive for employees to build
stockholder value and serves to align the interests of employees with those of
stockholders. Although a variety of equity incentives are available under the
Plan, stock options historically have been granted to executive officers based
upon each officer's relative position, responsibilities, historical and expected
contributions to Harris, and the officer's existing stock ownership and previous
option grants, with primary weight given to the executive officer's relative
rank and responsibilities. Initial stock option grants designed to recruit an
executive officer to join Harris may be based on negotiations with the officer
and with reference to historical option grants to existing officers. Stock
options are typically granted at the market price of Harris's common stock on
the date of grant and will provide value to the executive officers only when the
price of shares of Harris common stock increases over the exercise price.

         Limits on the Deductibility of Compensation

         Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, generally denies
publicly-held corporations a federal income tax deduction for compensation
exceeding $1,000,000 paid to the Chief Executive Officer or any of the four
other highest paid executive officers, excluding performance-based compensation.
Through June 30, 2001, this provision has not limited Harris's ability to deduct
executive compensation; the Compensation Committee will continue to monitor the
potential impact of Section 162(m) on the company's ability to deduct executive
compensation. Harris's Long-Term Incentive Plan has been

designed, and is intended to be administered, in a manner that will enable the
company to deduct compensation attributable to options and certain other awards
thereunder, without regard to such deduction limitation.

         Compensation of Gordon S. Black, Chief Executive Officer

         During fiscal 2001, the compensation of Dr. Black was determined by
applying the same criteria discussed at the beginning of this report used to
determine compensation and bonuses for all executive officers. Dr. Black's
compensation for 2001 is set forth in the Summary Compensation Table appearing
on page ____.

         Summary

         The Compensation Committee believes that Harris's compensation policy
as practiced to date has been successful in attracting and retaining qualified
employees and in tying compensation directly to corporate performance relative
to corporate goals. Harris's compensation policy will evolve over time as the
company attempts to achieve the many short-term goals it faces while maintaining
its focus on building long-term stockholder value through technological
leadership and development and expansion of the market for Harris's products.

Respectfully submitted,

The Compensation Committee
James R. Riedman, Chairman
Thomas D. Berman
Benjamin Addoms

         The foregoing report of the Compensation Committee shall not be deemed
to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the SEC, nor shall such
information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except to the extent Harris specifically
incorporates it by reference into such filing.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION IN COMPENSATION
DECISIONS

         No interlocking relationship exists between Harris's Board of Directors
or Harris's Compensation Committee and the board of directors or compensation
committee of any other company, nor has any interlocking relationship existed in
the past.

         None of Mr. Berman, Mr. Addoms or Mr. Riedman has at any time been an
officer or employee of Harris. However, during Harris's fiscal year 2001, Harris
and Mr. Riedman entered into a letter agreement, pursuant to which Harris has
agreed to pay Mr. Riedman for certain investment counseling and negotiation
services rendered by Mr. Riedman on behalf of Harris in connection with proposed
mergers and acquisitions and to provide counsel on administrative issues. During
fiscal year 2001, Mr. Riedman was paid $21,000 for rendering such services on
behalf of Harris.

         Mr. Berman is a Partner of Adams Street Partners, LLC ("ASP"), a

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

         Confidentiality and Non-Competition Agreements with Executive Officers

         In September 1999, Harris entered into agreements with Gordon S. Black,
David H. Clemm and Leonard R. Bayer. These agreements include confidentiality
and non-competition provisions, and obligate each of these executive officers to
transfer to Harris any inventions developed by them during their employment with
Harris and prohibits each of them from competing with Harris for a period of one
year after their termination of employment. The agreements also provide that, in
the event Harris terminates Dr. Black's, Mr. Clemm's or Mr. Bayer's employment
without cause, he is entitled to receive severance benefits equal to:

         -        his base salary in effect before the date of his termination;

         -        the average of his annual incentive bonus for the past three
                  years;

         -        his accrued and unused vacation time;

         -        his expenses incurred on Harris's behalf; and

         -        insurance benefits for two years following the date of
                  termination.

         Payment of Fees to Director for Negotiations on Behalf of Harris

         Pursuant to a letter agreement between Harris and James R. Riedman,
Harris has agreed to pay Mr. Riedman for certain investment counseling and
negotiation services rendered by Mr. Riedman on behalf of Harris in connection
with proposed mergers and acquisitions and to provide counsel on administrative
issues. During fiscal year 2001, Mr. Riedman was paid $21,000 for rendering such
services on behalf of Harris.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

         Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires Harris's directors and
executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of
Harris's equity securities, to file reports of ownership and reports of changes
in the ownership with the SEC. Such persons are required by regulations of the
SEC to furnish Harris with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based
upon a review of the filings with the SEC and written representations from
Harris's executive officers and directors and persons who beneficially own more
than 10% of the shares of Harris common stock, Harris believes that, with
respect to fiscal year 2001, its executive officers, directors and 10%
stockholders were in compliance with all applicable filing requirements.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

         The Audit Committee of Harris's Board of Directors reviews the
financial reporting process, the system of internal control, the audit process
and Harris's process for monitoring compliance with laws and regulations. During
fiscal 2001, Harris's Audit Committee members, G. Thomas Clark, Thomas D. Berman
and James R. Riedman, were "independent directors" as defined in Rule
4200(a)(15) of the National Association of Securities Dealers Listing Standards.
In light of Mr. Clark's recent resignation, effective September 1, 2001, and Mr.
Riedman's provision of services to Harris during fiscal 2002, Harris's Board of
Directors has appointed Benjamin Addoms to serve as a member of the committee
and will appoint a member to the committee to replace Mr. Riedman at the
earliest possible opportunity.

         The Audit Committee of Harris's Board of Directors reviews the
financial reporting process, the system of internal control, the audit process
and Harris's process for monitoring compliance with laws and regulations.
Harris's Board of Directors adopted a written charter for Harris's Audit
Committee on May 2, 2000, which is attached as Appendix "A" to Harris's proxy
statement for its 2000 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

         The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed Harris's audited financial
statements for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 with Harris's Board of
Directors and management. In addition, Harris's Audit Committee discussed with
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Harris's independent auditors, the matters required
to be discussed by Statement of Auditing Standard No. 61. The Audit Committee
received from PricewaterhouseCoopers the written disclosures required by
Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 and discussed with them their
independence. Based on the Audit Committee's review of the audited financial
statements and the foregoing discussions, Harris's Audit Committee recommended
to Harris's Board of Directors that the audited financial statements of Harris
be included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2001.

         This report of the Audit Committee shall not be deemed incorporated by
reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus into any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, except to the extent that Harris specifically incorporates this information
by reference, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such acts.

year 2002. Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are expected to be
present at the annual meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement
if they so desire and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

AUDIT FEES

         The aggregate fees billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for
professional services rendered for the audit of Harris's annual financial
statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, and the reviews of the
financial statements included in Harris's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for
that fiscal year were $48,000.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION FEES

         PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP did not render any professional services
related to financial information systems design and implementation to Harris
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001.

ALL OTHER FEES

         The aggregate fees billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for
professional services rendered during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, other
than as stated above under "Audit Fees" and "Financial Information Systems
Design and Implementation Fees," were $230,500.

       Harris Proposal Number 3 - Long-Term Incentive Plan Share Increase

         Harris's stockholders are being asked to approve an amendment to
Harris's Long-Term Incentive Plan. The consummation of the merger is not
conditioned upon approval of the amendment to the Harris Long-Term Incentive
Plan. The proposed amendment would increase the maximum number of shares of
Harris common stock reserved for issuance under the Plan from 2,750,000 shares
to a total of 3,250,000 shares.

         The proposed amendment will accommodate the options to be issued to
Albert A. Angrisani under the Harris Long-Term Incentive Plan, pursuant to his
employment agreement with Harris, which will become effective upon completion of
the merger. The amendment will also ensure that Harris is able to remain
competitive and provide sufficient equity incentives to attract and retain
highly-qualified and experienced employees. Harris's Board of Directors believes
that approval of this amendment is in the best interests of Harris and its
stockholders because the increase will accommodate the employment obligations of
Harris to Albert A. Angrisani in connection with the merger and maintain the
availability of an adequate reserve of shares under the Harris Long-Term
Incentive Plan, which is an important factor in attracting, motivating and
retaining qualified officers and employees essential to Harris's success and in
aligning their long-term interests with those of the Harris stockholders.

SUMMARY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE PLAN

         The following is a summary of the principal features of the Plan. A
copy of the Plan, as amended, is attached as Annex D to this Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

         General

         Pursuant to the Plan, Harris may grant certain combinations of the
following to its employees, officers and non-employee directors, or to the
employees, officers and non-employee directors of its subsidiaries:

         -        stock options, both incentive stock options within the meaning
                  of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code and non-qualified
                  stock options;

         -        stock appreciation rights;

         -        restricted or unrestricted share awards; and

         -        performance-based awards.

         As of June 30, 2001, Harris had outstanding options under the Plan to
purchase an aggregate of 1,316,750 shares, and there were 1,433,250 shares of
Harris common stock available for future grants under the Plan, without taking
the proposed share reserve increase into account.

         The Plan is administered by Harris's Board of Directors. Harris's Board
of Directors selects the individuals to whom options or other awards are granted
and specifies the terms of the awards.

         Incentive Stock Options

         These options may only be granted to Harris employees, and may not be
exercised more than 10 years after the date of grant. The exercise price must be
at least equal to the fair market value of shares of Harris common stock on the
date of grant. The purchase price of the shares issued upon exercise of these
options may be paid in cash or shares of Harris common stock having a total fair
market value equal to the aggregate purchase price.

         Non-Qualified Stock Options

         These options may not be exercised more than 10 years after the date of
grant. The purchase price of shares issued upon exercise of these options may be
paid in cash or shares of Harris common stock having a total fair market value
equal to the aggregate purchase price.

         Stock Appreciation Rights

         These rights may be granted on a free-standing or tandem basis. The
term of exercise will be determined by Harris's Board of Directors, but in no
event will be more than 10 years from the date of grant. These rights generally
entitle the holder to receive a payment having an aggregate value equal to the
product of the excess of the fair market value over the exercise price per share
specified in the grant multiplied by the number of shares specified in the
award. Payment by Harris of the amount receivable in respect of the stock
appreciation right may be paid in any combination of cash and common stock.

         Shares Subject to the Plan

         Currently, a maximum of 2,750,000 shares of Harris common stock may be
issued pursuant to the Plan. The Board of Directors has amended the Plan,
subject to stockholder approval, to increase the maximum number of shares
issuable under the Plan to 3,250,000 shares of Harris common stock.

         Change in Control/Adjustment

         The Plan generally provides that, except as may be provided in
individual award agreements, all outstanding awards will become immediately
vested and exercisable upon the consummation of any merger or consolidation in
which the owners of 75% or more of the shares of Harris common stock immediately
prior to the merger or consolidation do not receive the same percentage
ownership in the surviving corporation or which results in the acquisition of
more than 15% of Harris's outstanding common stock by a single person or entity
or by a group of persons and/or entities acting in concert, or in the event of
the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of Harris's assets. The number
of shares available under the Plan and the number of shares of Harris common
stock subject to each outstanding award and, if applicable, the exercise price
thereof, shall be adjusted upon the occurrence of, among other things, a stock
dividend, stock split and a recapitalization of Harris's common stock.

         Termination or Amendment

         Harris's Board of Directors may stop granting awards under the Plan at
any time, and may alter or amend the Plan or any outstanding awards for any
purpose which may at the time be permitted by law, or may at any time terminate
the Plan as to any further grants of awards, except that no amendment can (i)
increase the maximum number of shares available under the Plan, (ii) change the
group of persons eligible to receive awards under the Plan, or (iii) extend the
time within which awards may be granted, without stockholder approval, if
required by law, and the approval of each affected Plan participant if the
amendment, alteration or termination would adversely affect the participant's
rights or obligations under any award made prior to the date of the amendment,
alteration or termination. The termination of the Plan would not affect the
validity of any award outstanding on the date of termination.

SUMMARY OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF HARRIS'S LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

         The following summary is intended only as a general guide as to the
United States federal income tax consequences under current law of options
granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan and does not attempt to describe all
possible federal or other tax consequences of such participation or tax
consequences based on particular circumstances.

         Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)

         An optionee recognizes no taxable income for regular income tax
purposes as the result of the grant or exercise of an ISO qualifying under
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. Optionees who do not dispose of their
shares for two years following the date of grant or within one year following
the exercise date will normally recognize a long-term capital gain or loss equal
to the difference, if any, between the sale price and the purchase price of the
shares. If an optionee satisfies such holding periods upon a sale of the shares,
Harris will not be entitled to any deduction for federal income tax purposes. If
an optionee disposes of shares within two years after the date of grant or
within one year from the exercise date, referred to as a disqualifying
disposition, the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the
exercise date and the option exercise price, not to exceed the gain realized on
the sale if the disposition is a transaction with respect to which a loss, if
sustained, would be recognized, will be taxed as ordinary income at the time of
disposition. Any gain in excess of that amount will be a capital gain. If a loss
is recognized, there will be no ordinary income, and such loss will be a capital
loss. A capital gain or loss will be long-term if the optionee's holding period
is more than one year. Generally, for federal income tax purposes, Harris should
be able to deduct any ordinary income recognized by the optionee upon the
disqualifying disposition of the shares, except to the extent the deduction is
limited by applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations
thereunder.

         The difference between the option exercise price and the fair market
value of the shares on the exercise date of an ISO is an adjustment in computing
the optionee's alternative minimum taxable income and may be subject to an
alternative minimum tax which is paid if the tax exceeds the regular tax for the
year. Special rules may apply with respect to certain subsequent sales of the
shares in a disqualifying disposition, certain basis adjustments for purposes of
computing the alternative minimum taxable income on a subsequent sale of the
shares and certain tax credits, which may arise with respect to optionees
subject to the alternative minimum tax.

         Non-Qualified Stock Options

         Options not designated or qualifying as ISOs will be non-qualified
stock options. Non-qualified stock options have no special tax status. An
optionee generally recognizes no taxable income as the result of the grant of
such an option.

         Upon exercise of a non-qualified stock option, the optionee normally
recognizes ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the
option exercise price and the fair market value of the shares on the exercise
date. If the optionee is an employee, the ordinary income generally is subject
to withholding of income and employment taxes. Upon the sale of stock acquired
by the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, any gain or loss, based on the
difference between the sale price and the fair market value on the exercise
date, will be taxed as capital gain or loss. A capital gain or loss will be
long-term if the optionee's holding period is more than 12 months. No tax
deduction is available to Harris with respect to the grant of a non-qualified
option or the sale of the stock acquired pursuant to that grant. Harris
generally should be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary
income recognized by the optionee as a result of the exercise of a non-qualified
option, except to the extent the deduction is limited by applicable provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations thereunder.

         Vote Required

         The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Harris common stock present and entitled to vote at the meeting is
required for the adoption of the amendment to the Plan. Broker non-votes with
respect to this matter will be treated as neither a vote "for" nor a vote
"against" the matter, although they will be counted in determining if a quorum
is present. However, abstentions will be considered in determining the number of
votes required to attain a majority of the shares present or represented at the
meeting and entitled to vote. Accordingly, an abstention from voting by a
stockholder present in person or by proxy at the meeting has the same legal
effect as a vote "against" the matter because it represents a share present or
represented at the meeting and entitled to vote, thereby increasing the number
of affirmative votes required to approve this proposal.

         Harris's Board of Directors recommends a vote for approval of the
foregoing amendment to the plan.

                        COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS

         Each of Harris and Total are Delaware corporations subject to the
provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which will be referred to in
this section as Delaware Law. Total stockholders, whose rights are currently
governed by the Total Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, the Total
Amended and Restated By-laws and Delaware Law, will, upon completion of the
merger, become stockholders of Harris and their rights will be governed by the
Harris Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Harris By-laws and
Delaware Law.

         The following discussion summarizes the material differences that may
affect the rights of stockholders of Total but does not purport to be a complete
statement of all those differences, or a complete description of the specific
provisions referred to in this summary. The identification of specific
differences is not intended to indicate that other equally or more significant
differences do not exist. Stockholders should read carefully the relevant
provisions of Delaware Law, the Harris Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, the Harris By-laws, the Total Certificate of Incorporation, as
amended, and the Total Amended and Restated By-laws.

Certificate of Incorporation, any action which may be taken at an annual meeting
or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, if a consent
in writing is signed by the holders of the outstanding stock having the minimum

NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDER MEETING

         Harris. Under Harris's By-laws, no business may be transacted at any
meeting of stockholders, other than business that is either:

         -        specified in the notice of meeting given by or at the
                  direction of the Board of Directors;

         -        otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the
                  direction of the Board of Directors; or

         -        otherwise properly brought before the meeting by any
                  stockholder of Harris who is entitled to vote on the business
                  proposed to be considered at the meeting, is a stockholder of
                  record on the record date, and complies with the notice
                  procedures summarized in the next paragraph.

         For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a
stockholder, timely written notice must be given to the Secretary of Harris
before the annual meeting. To be timely, a notice of stockholder proposal must
be received by the Secretary of Harris not less than 90 calendar days nor more
than 120 calendar days before the date of Harris's proxy statement and notice
released to stockholders in connection with the immediately preceding annual
meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that no annual
meeting was held in the previous year, or the date of the annual meeting has
been changed by more than 30 days from the date of the previous year's annual
meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be received not later than
the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which notice of the
date of the annual meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the
annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs.

         A stockholder's notice to Harris must set forth, as to each matter the
stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, the following:

         -        a brief description of the business proposed to be brought
                  before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such
                  business at the meeting;

         -        the name and record address of such stockholder;

         -        the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of
                  Harris which are owned beneficially or of record by such
                  stockholder;

         -        a description of all arrangements or understandings between
                  such stockholder and any other person or persons (including
                  their names) in connection with the proposal of such business
                  by such stockholder and any material interest of such
                  stockholder in such business; and

         -        a representation that such stockholder intends to appear in
                  person or by proxy at the meeting to bring such business
                  before the meeting.

         Similarly, in order for a stockholder to nominate candidates for
election to Harris's Board of Directors at any annual or any special meeting of
stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, timely written notice
must be given to the Secretary of Harris. Under Harris's By-laws, notice of
stockholder nominations, to be timely, must be received by the Secretary of
Harris:

         -        in the case of an annual meeting, not less than 90 calendar
                  days nor more than 120 calendar days before the date of
                  Harris's proxy statement and notice released to stockholders
                  for the prior year; provided, however, that in the event no
                  annual meeting was held in the previous year, or the date of
                  the annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 days from
                  the date of the previous year's meeting, notice by the
                  stockholder to be timely must be received not later than the
                  close of business on the tenth day following the day on which
                  notice of the date of annual meeting was mailed or public
                  disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made,
                  whichever occurs first; and

         -        in the case of a special meeting of stockholders called for
                  the purpose of electing directors, not later than the close of
                  business on the tenth day following the day on which public
                  disclosure of the date of the special meeting was made.

         In the case of a notice of nomination of candidates for election to

         The Chairman of any meeting of Harris's stockholders may refuse to

made in accordance with the procedures set forth in the By-laws, the Chairman
may declare that the defective nomination will be disregarded.

         Total. Delaware law does not require the purpose of the annual meeting
to be included in the notice of the annual meeting and neither Total's By-laws
nor its Certificate of Incorporation contain any such requirement. Total's
Amended and Restated By-laws do, however, require the purpose of a special
meeting to be included in the notice of special meeting. Total's Amended and
Restated By-laws do not contain any advance notice provisions for Board
nominations or other stockholder business at a meeting of stockholders.

VOTING RIGHTS

         Harris. Each stockholder of Harris is entitled to one vote in person or
by proxy for each share of voting capital stock held of record on all matters
submitted to a vote of stockholders of Harris and may not cumulate votes.
Actions by the stockholders of Harris generally require a majority of the votes
cast. However, any election of directors by stockholders requires a plurality of
votes cast and certain actions set forth in the sections below entitled
"Amendments to Charter Documents" and "Amendments to By-laws" require a
two-thirds vote.

         Total. Each stockholder of Total is entitled to one vote in person or
by proxy for each share of capital stock having voting power held by such
stockholder. Under Delaware law, a corporation may provide in its charter for
cumulative voting. Neither the Total Certificate of Incorporation nor the Total
Amended and Restated By-laws provide for cumulative voting. Actions by the
stockholders of Total require a majority vote of the stock having voting power
present in person or represented by proxy. Elections of Total directors,
however, are decided by plurality vote.

NUMBER AND ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

         Harris. The Harris Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
provides that the total number of Harris directors will be not less than three
nor more than 13, as determined by Harris's Board of Directors from time to
time. Harris currently has six directors. The Harris Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation provides for Harris's Board of Directors to be
divided into three classes, as nearly equal in size as possible, with one class
being elected annually. Each director serves for a term ending on the date of
the third annual meeting of stockholders following the annual meeting at which
the director was elected. The Harris By-laws provide that directors are elected
by a plurality of the votes cast. No person can be eligible for election as a
director of Harris unless nominated in accordance with the advance notice
procedures set forth in the Harris By-laws.

         Total. An amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation of Total
provides that the number of Total directors shall initially be fixed at seven
but may be changed from time to time by a majority of the members of Total's
Board of Directors then in office. Total currently has seven directors. The
amendment also provides for Total's Board of Directors to be divided into three
classes, as nearly equal in size as possible, with one class being elected
annually. Each director serves for a term ending on the date of the third annual
meeting of stockholders following the annual meeting at which the director was
elected. The Total By-laws provide that directors are elected by a plurality of
the votes cast by Total stockholders entitled to vote in the election of
directors at a meeting at which a quorum is present. Total has no advance notice
requirements with respect to nomination of directors.

VACANCIES ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

         General. Delaware law provides that if, at the time of the filling of
any vacancy or newly created directorship, the directors then in office
constitute less than a majority of the authorized number of directors, the
Delaware Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or
stockholders holding at least 10% of the outstanding stock of the corporation
having the right to vote for such directors, order an election to be held to
fill the vacancy or replace the directors selected by the directors then in
office.

         Harris. Vacancies on Harris's Board of Directors, including vacancies
and unfilled newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the
authorized number of directors, may be filled only by a majority vote of the
directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or the sole remaining
director.

         The Harris By-laws provide that directors may be removed for cause by
the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of
directors.

         Total. Vacancies on Total's Board of Directors, including vacancies and
unfilled newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the
authorized number of directors, may be filled only by a majority vote of the
directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or the sole remaining
director.

         The Total Certificate of Incorporation provides that directors may be
removed for cause by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to
vote at an election of directors.

AMENDMENTS TO CHARTER DOCUMENTS

         General. Under Delaware law, an amendment to the Certificate of
Incorporation of a corporation requires the approval of the corporation's board
of directors and the approval of a majority of the outstanding stock entitle to
vote upon the proposed amendment, unless a higher vote is required by the
corporation's certificate of incorporation.

         Harris. Pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, Harris reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provisions contained in its Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner
prescribed by statute, and further provides that all rights conferred upon
Harris's stockholders pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation are granted
subject to that reservation. The Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation further provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of not
less than sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the shares of each class
of the capital stock of Harris entitled to vote is required to alter, amend,
rescind or repeal the provisions of Harris's Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation relating to:

         -        the number of members of Harris's Board of Directors, board
                  classification, and vacancies of Harris's Board of Directors;

         -        the manner in which the By-laws are to be altered, amended,
                  rescinded or repealed;

         -        the restriction on cumulative voting by the holders of stock
                  of any class or series;

         -        the manner in which stockholder action may be effected; and

         -        the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of
                  Incorporation that may be amended only upon the vote of the
                  holders of not less than sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66
                  2/3%) of the shares of each class of the capital stock of
                  Harris entitled to vote.

         Total. Total's Certificate of Incorporation provides that Total shall
have the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in its
Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner prescribed by statute.

AMENDMENTS TO BY-LAWS

         General. Under Delaware law, unless a corporation's certificate of
incorporation provides otherwise, the stockholders entitled to vote have the
power to adopt, amend or repeal the corporation's by-laws.

         Harris. Harris's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
provides that in furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by
Delaware Law, Harris's Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make,
alter, amend, rescind or repeal any of the By-laws of Harris.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, a majority of the entire Board of
Directors of Harris or the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than
sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the shares of each class of
capital stock of Harris entitled to vote, is required to alter, amend, rescind
or repeal provisions relating to any of the following:

         -        the manner in which a special meeting may be called;

         -        the manner in which business may be properly brought before an
                  annual meeting of stockholders;

         -        the number of members and the classification of Harris's Board
                  of Directors;

         -        the procedure by which persons are nominated for election to
                  Harris's Board of Directors; and

         -        the manner by which the By-laws are to be amended.

         Total. The Total Certificate of Incorporation provides that in
furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by Delaware law,
Total's Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal the
By-laws of Total.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

         General. Under Delaware law, a corporation generally may indemnify
directors and officers:

         -        for actions taken in good faith and in a manner they
                  reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best
                  interests of the corporation; and

         -        with respect to any criminal proceeding, if they had no
                  reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was unlawful.

         In addition, Delaware law provides that a corporation may advance to a
director or officer expenses incurred in defending any action upon receipt of an
undertaking by the director or officer to repay the amount advanced if it is
ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to indemnification.

         Harris. The Harris Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
and By-laws provide for indemnification, to the fullest extent permitted by
Delaware law, of any person against expenses

(including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding in which such person was or is a party or
is threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or
was a director, officer, agent or employee of Harris.

         In addition, the By-laws provide that Harris shall pay expenses
(including attorney's fees) incurred by a director or officer of Harris entitled
to indemnification in defending any action, suit or proceeding because they are
directors or officers in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit or
proceeding. The payment of expenses will only be made if Harris receives an
undertaking by the director or officer to repay all amounts advanced if it is
ultimately determined that the director or officer is not entitled to be
indemnified by Harris, as authorized by the Harris's By-laws, Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or otherwise.

         Harris is authorized to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of
its directors, officers, employees and agents.

         The indemnification rights conferred by Harris are not exclusive of any
other right which persons seeking indemnification may be entitled under any
statute, provision of Harris's Amended and Restated Certification of
Incorporation, By-laws, agreement vote of the stockholders or disinterested
directors, or otherwise.

         Total. The Amended and Restated By-laws of Total provide for
indemnification, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, of any person
who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such person is or
was a director or officer of Total, or is or was serving while a director or
officer of Total at the request of Total as a director, officer, employee,
agent, fiduciary or other representative of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against
expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, excise taxes and amounts
paid in settlement and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with
such action, suit or proceeding.

         In addition, the Amended and Restated By-laws provide that Total shall
pay expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by any person entitled to
indemnification in defending actions against such person in the manner and to
the full extent permissible under Delaware law.

         Total is authorized to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of Total or is or
was serving at the request of Total as a director, officer, employee, agent,
fiduciary or other representative of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise.

         The indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by Total are
not exclusive of any other rights which persons seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled under any insurance or other agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, and continue as to
a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and inures to the benefit of
the heirs, executors and administrators of such person.

                                  LEGAL MATTERS

         The validity of the shares of Harris common stock to be issued to Total
stockholders in connection with the merger will be passed on for Harris by
Harris Beach LLP, Rochester, New York, counsel to Harris. Certain other legal
matters in connection with the merger will be passed upon for

Harris by Harris Beach LLP and for Total by Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP,
New York, New York. Beth Ela Wilkens, a partner of Harris Beach LLP, holds
options to purchase 28,000 shares of Harris common stock.

                                     EXPERTS

         The consolidated financial statements of Harris incorporated in this
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus by reference to Harris's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended June 30, 2001 have been so incorporated in reliance upon
the report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, given on the

         The consolidated financial statements and schedule of Total Research

         It is not expected that any matters other than those described in this
document will be brought before the special meeting of Total or the annual
meeting of Harris. If any other matters are presented, however, it is intended
that shares represented by proxies will be voted or not voted by the persons
named in the proxies in their discretion.

                          FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

TOTAL

         Total does not currently expect to hold a 2001 annual meeting of
stockholders because, upon consummation of the merger, Total will be a wholly
owned subsidiary of Harris. In the event the merger is not consummated, the 2001
annual meeting of stockholders will be held. Proposals of Total stockholders
submitted to Total pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act for inclusion
in the proxy statement to be mailed to all Total stockholders entitled to vote
at the 2001 annual meeting of stockholders must have been received at Total's
principal executive offices not later than July 12, 2001. However, if the annual
meeting is held and is delayed by more than thirty days from the originally
scheduled date, Total will announce a new deadline in accordance with SEC
regulations.

HARRIS

         Advance Notice Procedures

         Under Harris's bylaws, no business may be brought before an annual
meeting unless it is specified in the notice of the meeting (which includes
stockholder proposals that Harris is required to include in its proxy statement
pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act) or is otherwise brought before
the meeting by or at the direction of Harris's Board of Directors or by a
stockholder entitled to vote who has delivered notice to Harris (containing
certain information specified in the bylaws) not less than 90 nor more than 120
days prior to the first anniversary of the date on which Harris first mailed
this proxy statement and form of proxy. These requirements are separate from and
in addition to the SEC's requirements that a stockholder must meet in order to
have a stockholder proposal included in Harris's proxy statement.

         Stockholder Proposals for the 2002 Annual Meeting

         Stockholders interested in submitting a proposal for inclusion in the
proxy materials for Harris's annual meeting of stockholders in 2002 may do so by
following the procedures prescribed in SEC Rule 14a-8. To be eligible for
inclusion, stockholder proposals must be received by Harris's Corporate
Secretary no later than ________, 2002.

         Harris will mail without charge to any stockholder of Harris, upon
written request, a copy of Harris's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2001, including the financial statements, schedules and a
list of exhibits. Requests should be sent to the Director of Investor Relations,
Harris Interactive Inc., 135 Corporate Woods, Rochester, New York 14623.

                                     PART II

                     INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS

Item 20.          Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

         Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that a
         corporation may indemnify directors and officers as well as other
         employees and individuals against expenses (including attorneys' fees),
         judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
         incurred by such person in connection with any threatened, pending or
         completed actions, suits or proceedings in which such person is made a
         party by reason of such person being or having been a director,
         officer, employee or agent to the Registrant. The Delaware General
         Corporation Law provides that Section 145 is not exclusive of other
         rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any
         bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
         otherwise. Article VIII of the Registrant's Bylaws provides for
         indemnification by the Registrant of its directors, officers and
         employees to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware Corporation
         Law.

         Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law permits a
         corporation to provide in its certificate of incorporation that a
         director of the corporation shall not be personally liable to the
         corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
         fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach
         of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its
         stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which
         involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) for
         unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases,
         redemptions or other distributions, or (iv) for any transaction from
         which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Article X of
         the Registrant's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
         provides for such limitation of liability.

         The Registrant maintains insurance on behalf of its directors, officers
and employees for certain liabilities.

All schedules for which provision is made in the applicable accounting
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission are not required under the
related instructions or are not applicable, and, therefore, have been omitted.

Item 22.          Undertakings.

         A. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes as follows: that prior
to any public reoffering of the securities registered hereunder through use of a
prospectus which is a part of this registration statement, by any person or
party who is deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of Rule 145(c), the
issuer undertakes that such reoffering prospectus will contain the information
called for by the applicable registration form with respect to reofferings by
persons who may be deemed underwriters, in addition to the information called
for by the other items of the applicable form.

         B. The undersigned registrant undertakes that every prospectus: (i)
that is filed pursuant to paragraph (1) immediate preceding, or (ii) that
purports to meet the requirement of Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of
1933 and is used in connection with an offering of securities subject to Rule
415, will be filed as a part of an amendment to the registration statement and
will not be used until such amendment is effective, and that, for purposes of
determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such
post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement
relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities
at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

         C. Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the
Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling
persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise,
the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and
Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed
in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event
that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the
payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or
controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action,
suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person
in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless
in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether
such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the
Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such
issue.

         D. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to respond to requests
for information that is incorporated by reference into the prospectus pursuant
to Item 4, 10(b), 11, or 13 of this form, within one business day of receipt of
such request, and to send the incorporated documents by first class mail or
other equally prompt means. This includes information contained in documents
filed subsequent to the effective date of this registration statement through
the date of responding to the request.

         E. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to supply by means of a
post-effective amendment all information concerning a transaction, and the
company being acquired, involved therein, that was not the subject of and
included in the registration statement when it became effective.

                                      II-4

                                   SIGNATURES
