                    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q: What is the merger?

    A: In the merger, Illuminet will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
       VeriSign and Illuminet stockholders will become VeriSign stockholders.

Q: What will Illuminet's stockholders receive in the merger?

    A: Illuminet's stockholders will receive 0.93 shares of VeriSign common
       stock for each share of Illuminet common stock they own. VeriSign will
       not issue fractional shares of stock. Illuminet's stockholders will
       receive cash based on the market price of VeriSign common stock instead
       of any fractional share.

       For example, a holder of 100 shares of Illuminet common stock will
       receive 93 shares of VeriSign common stock.

       Based on the capitalization of VeriSign and Illuminet as of September
       30, 2001, the former stockholders of Illuminet will receive in the
       merger a number of shares of VeriSign common stock representing
       approximately 13.0% of VeriSign's outstanding common stock.

       The number of shares of VeriSign common stock to be issued for each
       share of Illuminet common stock is fixed and will not be adjusted based
       upon changes in the value of these shares. As a result, the value of the
       shares that Illuminet's stockholders will receive in the merger will not
       be known prior to the time of the merger and may go up or down as the
       market price of VeriSign common stock goes up or down. Illuminet is not
       permitted to terminate its obligations to complete the merger or
       resolicit the vote of its stockholders based solely on changes in the
       value of Illuminet common stock.

Q: Does the board of directors of Illuminet recommend voting in favor of the
   merger?

    A: Yes. After careful consideration, Illuminet's board of directors
       recommends that its stockholders vote in favor of the merger agreement
       and the proposed merger.

       For a more complete description of the recommendations of the board of
       directors of Illuminet, see the sections entitled "Proposal One--The
       Merger--Illuminet's reasons for the merger" beginning on page 35 and
       "Proposal One--The Merger--Recommendation of Illuminet's board of
       directors" on page 36.

Q: Are there risks I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the
   merger?

    A: Yes. For example, the number of shares of VeriSign common stock that
       Illuminet stockholders will receive will not change even if the market
       price of VeriSign common stock increases or decreases before the
       completion of the merger. We urge you to obtain current market
       quotations of VeriSign common stock and Illuminet common stock.

       In evaluating the merger, you should also carefully consider these and
       other factors discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning
       on page 11.

Q: What do I need to do now?

    A: Sign your proxy card and mail it in the enclosed return envelope as soon
       as possible so that your shares may be represented at the special
       meeting. If you do not include instructions on how to vote your properly
       signed proxy, your shares will be voted "FOR" your approval and adoption
       of the merger agreement and approval of the merger and "FOR" your
       approval of adjournment of the special meeting if the number of shares
       of Illuminet common stock present or represented and voting in favor of
       approval of the merger is insufficient to approve the merger.

       For a more complete description of voting at the meeting, see the
       section entitled "The Illuminet Special Meeting" beginning on page 31.

                                      iv

Q: What do I do if I want to change my vote?

    A: If you want to change your vote, send the secretary of Illuminet a
       later-dated, signed proxy card before the special meeting or attend the
       special meeting in person. You may also revoke your proxy by sending
       written notice to the secretary of Illuminet before the special meeting.

       For a more complete description of how to change your vote, see the
       section entitled "The Illuminet Special Meeting" beginning on page 31.

Q: If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote my
   shares for me?

    A: Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on
       how to vote by following the information provided to you by your broker.

       For a more complete description of voting shares held in "street name,"
       see the section entitled "The Illuminet Special Meeting" beginning on
       page 31.

Q: Should I send in my Illuminet stock certificates now?

    A: No. After the merger is completed, we will send you written instructions
       for exchanging your Illuminet stock certificates for VeriSign stock
       certificates.

Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed?

    A: We are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. We
       hope to complete the merger during the fourth quarter of 2001.

       For a more complete description of the conditions to the merger, see the
       section entitled "The Merger Agreement--Conditions to completion of the
       merger" beginning on page 54.

Q: Will I recognize a gain or loss on the transaction?

    A: We expect that if the merger is completed, you will not recognize gain
       or loss for United States federal income tax purposes, except that you
       will recognize gain or loss with respect to cash received instead of
       fractional shares. However, you are urged to consult your own tax
       advisors to determine your particular tax consequences.

       For a more complete description of the tax consequences, see the section
       entitled "Material United States federal income tax consequences of the
       merger" beginning on page 44.

Q: Am I entitled to dissenters' or appraisal rights?

    A: Under Delaware law, holders of Illuminet common stock are not entitled
       to dissenters' or appraisal rights in the merger.

Q: Whom should I call with questions?

    A: Illuminet's stockholders should call Illuminet Investor Relations at
       (360) 493-6000 with any questions about the merger.

       You may also obtain additional information about VeriSign and Illuminet
       from documents each of us files with the Securities and Exchange
       Commission by following the instructions in the section entitled "Where
       you can find more information" on page iii.

                          Summary of the Transaction

The merger (see page 34)

   VeriSign and Illuminet have entered into a merger agreement that provides
for the merger of Illinois Acquisition Corporation, a newly formed and wholly
owned subsidiary of VeriSign, with and into Illuminet. As a result of the
merger, the separate corporate existence of Illinois Acquisition Corporation
will cease and Illuminet will survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary
of VeriSign.

   Upon completion of the merger, Illuminet stockholders will become VeriSign
stockholders, and each outstanding share of Illuminet common stock, other than
shares held by Illuminet and its subsidiaries, will be converted into the right
to receive 0.93 shares of fully paid and nonassessable VeriSign common stock.
Also, VeriSign will convert each outstanding option to purchase Illuminet
common stock into an option to purchase shares of VeriSign common stock.

   The merger agreement is attached to this prospectus/proxy statement as Annex
A. We urge you to read it carefully.

Special meeting of Illuminet stockholders (see page 31)

   Illuminet will hold a special meeting of its stockholders on     ,     ,
2001 at       .m., local time, at               . At the meeting, Illuminet
stockholders will consider and vote on a proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement and the merger. In addition, Illuminet stockholders will
consider and vote on a proposal to grant Illuminet management the discretionary
authority to adjourn the special meeting to a date not later than       , 2002
in order to enable the Illuminet board of directors to continue to solicit
additional proxies in favor of the merger.

   Only holders of record of Illuminet common stock at the close of business on
     , 2001, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to notice of
and to vote at the special meeting.

Votes required for approval (see page 32)

   The holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Illuminet common
stock must approve the merger agreement and the merger. The holders of a
majority of the votes cast on the adjournment proposal must approve the
adjournment proposal. Illuminet stockholders are entitled to cast one vote per
share of Illuminet common stock owned as of the record date for the special
meeting.

   Stockholders of Illuminet that beneficially own approximately     % of the
outstanding Illuminet common stock as of the record date have agreed to vote in
favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger.
Directors and executive officers of Illuminet collectively beneficially owned
approximately     % of the outstanding Illuminet common stock as of the record
date.

Recommendation of Illuminet's board of directors (see page 36)

   Illuminet's board of directors believes that the merger is fair to Illuminet
stockholders and in their best interests. The Illuminet board has voted to
approve the merger agreement and the merger and recommends that its
stockholders vote FOR the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the
merger. The Illuminet board also recommends that Illuminet stockholders vote
FOR the adjournment proposal.

Opinion of Illuminet's financial advisor (see page 37)

   In deciding to approve the merger, Illuminet's boards of directors
considered, among other things, an opinion from Robertson Stephens, Inc., its
financial advisor, as to the fairness of the exchange ratio, from a

financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, to the holders of
Illuminet common stock. The opinion of Robertson Stephens, Inc. is attached as
Annex D. We urge you to read it carefully in its entirety to understand the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on
the review undertaken by Robertson Stephens in providing its opinion. The
opinion of Robertson Stephens is directed to the Illuminet board of directors
and is not a recommendation to any stockholder with respect to any matter
relating to the merger.

No other negotiations (see page 51)

   Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated,
Illuminet has agreed, with limited exceptions, not to take any action, directly
or indirectly, with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, as described on page 52
of this document.

   If Illuminet receives an unsolicited, written, bona fide Acquisition
Proposal that its board reasonably concludes after consultation with its
financial advisor may constitute a Superior Offer, as described on page 52 of
this document, Illuminet may furnish non-public information regarding itself
and may enter into discussions with the person or group who has made the
Acquisition Proposal if it provides written notice to VeriSign and follows
other specified procedures.

   Illuminet has agreed to inform VeriSign promptly as to any Acquisition
Proposal, or request for non-public information or inquiry that it reasonably
believes would lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Illuminet has agreed to inform
VeriSign of the status and details of any Acquisition Proposal and to provide
VeriSign with a copy of all written materials provided to Illuminet in
connection with any request or inquiry.

   The board of Illuminet may change its recommendation in favor of the merger
if it receives a Superior Offer and VeriSign does not respond with a
corresponding offer at least as favorable as the Superior Offer.

Conditions to completion of the merger (see page 54)

   The completion of the merger depends upon meeting a number of conditions,
including:

  .  the merger agreement and the merger must be approved and adopted by
     Illuminet's stockholders;

  .  no governmental entity shall have enacted a law, regulation or order that
     has the effect of making the merger illegal, and the applicable waiting
     periods under antitrust laws must have expired or been terminated;

  .  Illuminet must have received from its tax counsel an opinion to the effect
     that the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization;

  .  the representations and warranties of each party in the merger agreement
     must be true and correct in all material respects;

  .  the parties must have performed or complied in all material respects with
     their respective agreements and covenants in the merger agreement;

  .  no material adverse effect with respect to VeriSign or Illuminet shall
     have occurred;

  .  VeriSign shall have received from Illuminet's regulatory counsel an
     opinion as to specified regulatory matters; and

  .  all material required approvals or consents of any governmental entity or
     other person shall have been obtained and become final, and are not on
     terms reasonably likely to materially affect the ownership or operations
     of business by VeriSign.

   If either VeriSign or Illuminet waives any conditions, VeriSign and
Illuminet will consider the facts and circumstances at that time and make a
determination as to whether a resolicitation of proxies from stockholders is
appropriate.

Termination of the merger agreement (see page 55)

   The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to closing the
merger, whether before or after the requisite approval of Illuminet's
stockholders:

  .  by mutual written consent duly authorized by the boards of VeriSign and
     Illuminet;

  .  by either VeriSign or Illuminet, if the merger is not completed by
     September 30, 2002, except that the right to terminate the merger
     agreement under this provision is not available to any party whose action
     or failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure
     of the merger to occur on or by September 30, 2002, and this action or
     failure to act constitutes a breach of the merger agreement;

  .  by VeriSign or Illuminet, if a governmental authority has issued an order,
     decree or ruling or taken any other action that is final and
     nonappealable, having the effect of permanently enjoining, restraining or
     prohibiting the merger;

  .  by VeriSign or Illuminet, if the merger is not approved by the
     stockholders of Illuminet, except that the right to terminate the merger
     agreement under this provision is not available to Illuminet where the
     failure to obtain stockholder approval was caused by an action or failure
     to act by Illuminet that constitutes a breach of the merger agreement, or
     a breach of the voting agreements described under "Related
     Agreements--Voting Agreements";

  .  by VeriSign at any time prior to the adoption and approval of the merger
     agreement and the merger by the required vote of stockholders of
     Illuminet, if a Triggering Event, as described on page 56 of this
     document, occurs; or

  .  by Illuminet, on the one hand, or VeriSign, on the other, upon a breach of
     any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the
     other in the merger agreement, or if any of the other's representations or
     warranties are or become untrue, so that the corresponding condition to
     closing the merger would not be met. However, if the breach or inaccuracy
     is curable by the breaching party through the exercise of its commercially
     reasonable efforts, and such party continues to exercise commercially
     reasonable efforts, then the other party may not terminate the merger
     agreement if the breach or inaccuracy is cured within 30 days after
     delivery of the notice of breach or inaccuracy.

Termination fee (see page 56)

   If the merger agreement is terminated by VeriSign because of any Triggering
Event, Illuminet will be obligated to pay VeriSign a termination fee of $45.5
million.

   Illuminet is also obligated to pay a termination fee equal to $45.5 million
if:

  .  prior to termination of the merger agreement, an Acquisition Proposal is
     publicly announced;

  .  the merger agreement was terminated because (1) the merger did not close
     by September 30, 2002; (2) approval of the merger by Illuminet's
     stockholders was not obtained; or (3) of a breach of a representation,
     warranty, covenant or agreement of Illuminet; and

  .  within 18 months of the termination of the merger agreement, Illuminet
     completes an Acquisition, as described on page 56 of this document, or
     enters into an agreement providing for an Acquisition and that Acquisition
     is later consummated with the person with whom the agreement was entered
     into, regardless of when the consummation occurs, if Illuminet had entered
     into the agreement during the eighteen-month period.

The stock option agreement (see page 58)

   VeriSign and Illuminet have entered into a stock option agreement that
grants VeriSign the right to buy shares of Illuminet common stock equal to
19.9% of the shares of Illuminet common stock outstanding on the date of
exercise at an exercise price of $35.62 per share. The option becomes
exercisable only upon the occurrence of specified events. The amount of profit
that VeriSign may realize under the option together with the termination fee is
subject to a profit cap of $65.0 million. VeriSign required Illuminet to grant
the option as a condition for entering into the merger agreement. The option
may discourage third parties who are interested in acquiring a significant
stake in Illuminet and is intended by VeriSign to increase the likelihood that
the merger will be consummated. The stock option agreement is attached to this
document as Annex B. We urge you to read it carefully.

The voting agreements (see page 59)

   Illuminet stockholders, who are also directors and executive officers of
Illuminet, Roger Moore, Theodore Berns, Jack Blumenstein, Terry Kremian,
Richard Lumpkin, David Nicol, James Strand and Greg Wilkinson, entered into
voting agreements with VeriSign. The voting agreements require these
stockholders to vote all of the shares of Illuminet common stock they own in
favor of the merger and against competing proposals or proposals in opposition
to the merger. These stockholders own approximately    % of the outstanding
Illuminet common stock as of the record date. The form of voting agreement is
attached to this document as Annex C. We urge you to read it carefully.

Interests of certain persons in the merger (see page 43)

   When considering the recommendations of Illuminet's boards of directors, you
should be aware that some of the Illuminet directors and officers have
interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, yours.
For example, Roger Moore, who is the chief executive officer and a director of
Illuminet, will become a member of the VeriSign board of directors; also, some
executive officers of Illuminet will become employees of VeriSign.

   As a result, these executive officers and directors could be more likely to
vote to approve, and recommend the approval of, the merger agreement and the
merger, than if they did not hold these interests.

Government approvals required to complete the merger (see page 46)

   The merger is subject to antitrust laws. We have made the required filings
with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and we will
make any necessary filings with foreign regulatory agencies. However, the
Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, as well as a foreign
regulatory agency or government, state or private person, may challenge the
merger at any time before or after its completion. We will also make filings
with the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, to transfer two
authorizations, one of which relates to services offered through one of
Illuminet's subsidiaries, National Telemanagement Corporation, or NTC, and the
other relates to a two way radio license used internally by Illuminet.

Restrictions on the ability to sell VeriSign stock (see page 46)

   All shares of VeriSign common stock received by Illuminet stockholders in
connection with the merger will be freely transferable unless the holder is
considered an affiliate of either VeriSign or Illuminet under the Securities
Act.

Listing on the Nasdaq National Market (see page 47)

   VeriSign common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq National Market
under the symbol VRSN. VeriSign will list the shares of VeriSign common stock
to be issued in the merger for trading on the Nasdaq National Market.

Accounting treatment of the merger (see page 46)

   VeriSign intends to account for the merger as a "purchase" for financial
accounting purposes under generally accepted accounting principles.

Comparison of rights of VeriSign stockholders and Illuminet stockholders (see
page 63)

   The rights of Illuminet stockholders are determined by Delaware law and
Illuminet's certificate of incorporation and bylaws. If the merger is
completed, Illuminet stockholders will receive shares of VeriSign common stock.
As stockholders of VeriSign, their rights will be governed by Delaware law and
VeriSign's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

Comparative market price information (see page 61)

National Market. On September 21, 2001, the last full trading day prior to the
public announcement of the proposed merger, VeriSign's common stock closed at

    computed by dividing pro forma stockholders' equity by the pro forma number
    of shares of common stock outstanding at December 31, 2000.

(2) The Illuminet equivalent pro forma combined per share amounts are
    calculated by multiplying the VeriSign share amounts by the exchange ratio
    of 0.93.

               STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

   This prospectus/proxy statement and the documents incorporated in this
document by reference contain forward-looking statements within the "safe
harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with
respect to our financial condition, results of operations and business, and on
the expected impact of the merger on the combined company's financial
performance. Words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans,"
"believes," "seeks," "estimates" and similar expressions identify
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees
of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the
forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include:

  .  the possibility that the value of the VeriSign common stock to be issued
     to Illuminet stockholders in the merger will decrease prior to completion
     of the merger and no corresponding adjustment to the number of shares of
     VeriSign stock to be received by Illuminet stockholders will be made;

  .  the possibility that the merger will not be consummated;

  .  the possibility that the anticipated benefits from the merger cannot be
     fully realized;

  .  the possibility that costs or difficulties related to the integration of
     our businesses are greater than expected;

  .  the combined companies' dependence on the timely development, introduction
     and customer acceptance of new telecommunications and Internet services;

  .  the impact of competition on revenues and margins;

  .  rapidly changing technology and shifting demand requirements and
     telecommunications and Internet usage patterns;

  .  other risks and uncertainties, including the impact of competitive
     services, products and prices, the unsettled conditions in
     telecommunications, the Internet and other high-technology industries and
     the ability to attract and retain key personnel; and

  .  other risk factors as may be detailed from time to time in VeriSign's and
     Illuminet's public announcements and filings with the Securities and
     Exchange Commission.

   In evaluating the merger, you should carefully consider the discussion of
these and other factors in the following section, entitled "Risk Factors."

                                 RISK FACTORS

   The merger involves a high degree of risk. Also, by voting in favor of the
merger, Illuminet's stockholders will be choosing to invest in VeriSign common
stock. An investment in VeriSign common stock involves a high degree of risk.
In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in
this prospectus/proxy statement, Illuminet's stockholders should carefully
consider the following risk factors in deciding whether to vote for the merger.

Risks related to the proposed merger

   Illuminet's stockholders will receive a fixed ratio of 0.93 shares of
   VeriSign common stock per share of Illuminet common stock even if there are
   changes in the market value of Illuminet common stock or VeriSign common
   stock before the closing of the merger.

   There will be no adjustment to the exchange ratio if the market price of
either Illuminet common stock or VeriSign common stock fluctuates. The specific
dollar value of VeriSign common stock that Illuminet stockholders will receive
upon completion of the merger will depend on the market value of VeriSign
common stock at the time of the merger. The share prices of both Illuminet
common stock and VeriSign common stock are subject to price fluctuations in the
market for publicly traded equity securities and have each experienced
significant volatility. Neither company can predict the market prices for
either Illuminet common stock or VeriSign common stock at any time before the
completion of the merger or the market price for VeriSign common stock after
the completion of the merger. VeriSign and Illuminet encourage you to obtain
current market quotations of VeriSign common stock and Illuminet common stock.

   VeriSign will face technical, operational and strategic challenges that may
   prevent it from successfully integrating Illuminet with VeriSign.

   The merger involves risks related to the integration and management of
acquired technology, operations and personnel. The integration of VeriSign and
Illuminet will be a complex, time consuming and expensive process and may
disrupt VeriSign's business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner.
Following the merger, VeriSign and Illuminet must operate as a combined
organization utilizing common information and communication systems, operating
procedures, financial controls and human resources practices. VeriSign and
Illuminet may encounter substantial difficulties, costs and delays involved in
integrating their operations, including:

  .  potential incompatibility of business cultures;

  .  managing the combined company's growth and managing larger, more
     geographically dispersed operations;

  .  perceived adverse changes in business focus;

  .  failure of the combined company to successfully manage relationships with
     customers, suppliers and other important relationships;

  .  failure of the combined company's customers to accept new services or to
     continue using the products and services of the combined company; and

  .  the loss of key employees and diversion of the attention of management
     from other ongoing business concerns.

   The acquisitions that VeriSign and Illuminet have recently completed may
   increase the integration difficulties associated with the proposed merger.

   The challenges of integrating the operations of VeriSign and Illuminet will
be increased by each companies' ongoing efforts associated with the continuing
integration of other recent acquisitions by VeriSign and Illuminet.

In addition, VeriSign anticipates that it will continue to consider other
acquisitions of businesses and assets to expand its business and to acquire
complementary technologies and personnel. The integration of multiple
organizations requires a substantial amount of management resources and
attention. These acquisitions, as well as other potential future acquisitions,
will require VeriSign to manage and integrate the acquired businesses and their
personnel, which are and may be located in diverse geographic locations, and
will also require VeriSign to develop and market services to new markets with
which it may not be familiar.

   Illuminet officers and directors have different interests from yours.

   The directors and officers of Illuminet have interests in the merger and
participate in arrangements that are different from, or are in addition to,
those of Illuminet stockholders generally. These include:

  .  Roger Moore, who is the chief executive officer and a director of
     Illuminet, will become a member of the VeriSign board of directors;

  .  Directors and officers of Illuminet are entitled to specified
     indemnification rights; and

  .  Some executive officers of Illuminet will become employees of VeriSign.

   As a result, these executive officers and directors could be more likely to
vote to approve, and recommend the approval of, the merger agreement and the
merger than if they did not hold these interests.

   If the merger's benefits do not meet the expectations of financial or
   industry analysts, the market price of VeriSign common stock may decline.

   The market price of VeriSign common stock may decline as a result of the
merger if:

  .  the integration of VeriSign and Illuminet is unsuccessful;

  .  VeriSign does not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as rapidly
     as, or to the extent, anticipated by financial or industry analysts; or

  .  the effect of the merger on VeriSign's financial results is not consistent
     with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.

   Illuminet faces risks relating to the proposed merger.

   The announcement of the proposed merger may have a negative impact on
Illuminet's ability to sell its services and products, attract and retain
employees and clients, and maintain strategic relationships with third parties.
For example, its employees may experience uncertainty about their future role
with VeriSign until VeriSign's strategies with regards to Illuminet's employees
are announced or executed. The announcement may also have an adverse effect on
Illuminet's relationships with significant customers and business partners.

   Failure to complete the proposed merger could adversely affect Illuminet's
   and VeriSign's stock prices and future business and operations.

   The merger is subject to approval by Illuminet's stockholders and regulatory
agencies, and we cannot assure you that the merger will be successfully
completed. In the event that the merger is not successfully completed,
Illuminet and VeriSign may be subject to a number of material risks, including
the following:

  .  Illuminet may be required to pay VeriSign a termination fee;

  .  The price of Illuminet's common stock may decline to the extent that the
     current market price for its common stock reflects a market assumption
     that the proposed merger will be completed; and

  .  Costs related to the proposed merger, such as legal, accounting, and
     advisory fees, must be paid, even if the merger is not completed.

Risks related to VeriSign's business

   If the merger is successfully completed, holders of Illuminet's common stock
will become holders of VeriSign's common stock. VeriSign's business differs
from Illuminet's business, and VeriSign's results of operations, as well as the
price of VeriSign's common stock, may be affected by factors different than
those affecting Illuminet's results of operations and the price of its common
stock before the merger.

   VeriSign has a limited operating history under its current business
   structure.

   VeriSign was incorporated in April 1995, and began introducing its trusted
infrastructure services in June 1995. In addition, VeriSign completed several
acquisitions in 2000 and 2001. Therefore, VeriSign has only a limited operating
history on which to base an evaluation of its consolidated business and
prospects. VeriSign's success will depend on many factors, including, but not
limited to, the following:

  .  the successful integration of the acquired companies;

  .  the rate and timing of the growth and use of Internet protocol, or IP,
     networks for electronic commerce and communications;

  .  the extent to which digital certificates and domain names are used for
     these communications or e-commerce;

  .  the continued growth in the number of web sites;

  .  the growth in demand for VeriSign's payment services;

  .  the continued evolution of electronic commerce as a viable means of
     conducting business;

  .  the demand for VeriSign's Internet infrastructure services, digital
     certificates and Web Presence Services;

  .  the competition for any of VeriSign's services;

  .  the perceived security of electronic commerce and communications over IP
     networks;

  .  the perceived security of VeriSign's services, technology, infrastructure
     and practices; and

  .  VeriSign's continued ability to maintain its current, and enter into
     additional, strategic relationships.

   To address these risks VeriSign must, among other things:

  .  successfully market its Internet infrastructure services, its digital
     certificates and its Web Presence Services to new and existing customers;

  .  attract, integrate, train, retain and motivate qualified personnel;

  .  respond to competitive developments;

  .  successfully introduce new Internet infrastructure services and Web
     Presence Services; and

  .  successfully introduce enhancements to its existing Internet
     infrastructure services, digital certificates and Web Presence Services to
     address new technologies and standards and changing market conditions.

   VeriSign cannot be certain that it will successfully address these risks.

   VeriSign's business depends on the future growth of the Internet and
   adoption and continued use of IP networks.

   VeriSign's future success substantially depends on the continued growth in
the use of the Internet and IP networks. If the use of and interest in the
Internet and IP networks does not continue to grow, its business would be
harmed. To date, many businesses and consumers have been deterred from
utilizing the Internet and IP networks for a number of reasons, including, but
not limited to:

  .  potentially inadequate development of network infrastructure;

  .  security concerns, particularly for online payments, including the
     potential for merchant or user impersonation and fraud or theft of stored
     data and information communicated over IP networks;

  .  privacy concerns, including the potential for third parties obtaining
     personally identifiable information about users to disclose or sell data
     without notice to or the consent of such users;

  .  other security concerns such as attacks on popular websites by "hackers;"

  .  inconsistent quality of service;

  .  lack of availability of cost-effective, high-speed systems and service;

  .  limited number of local access points for corporate users;

  .  inability to integrate business applications on IP networks;

  .  the need to operate with multiple and frequently incompatible products;

  .  government regulation; and

  .  a lack of tools to simplify access to and use of IP networks.

   The widespread acceptance of the Internet and IP networks will require a
broad acceptance of new methods of conducting business and exchanging
information. Organizations that already have invested substantial resources in
other methods of conducting business may be reluctant to adopt new methods.
Also, individuals with established patterns of purchasing goods and services
and effecting payments may be reluctant to change.

   Verisign may not be able to sustain its revenue growth and VeriSign's
   near-term success depends, in part, on the growth of the Web Presence
   Services business.

   VeriSign may not be able to sustain the revenue growth it has experienced in
recent periods. In addition, past revenue growth may not be indicative of
future operating results. If VeriSign does not successfully maintain its
current position as a leading provider of domain name registration services or
develop or market additional value-added Web Presence Services and products,
its business could be harmed.

   VeriSign's Web Presence Services will account for a significant portion of
its revenue in at least the near term. VeriSign's future success will depend
largely on:

  .  continued new domain name registrations;

  .  re-registration rates of its customers;

  .  VeriSign's ability to maintain its current position as a leading registrar
     of domain names;

  .  the successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new Web
     Presence Services that address the demands of Internet users;

  .  VeriSign's ability to provide robust domain name registration systems; and

  .  VeriSign's ability to provide a superior customer service infrastructure
     for its Web Presence Services.

   Issues arising from implementing agreements with ICANN and the Department of
   Commerce could harm VeriSign's registration business.

   The Department of Commerce, or DOC, has adopted a plan for a phased
transition of the DOC's responsibilities for the domain name system to the
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN. VeriSign faces
risks from this transition, including the following:

  .  ICANN could adopt or promote policies, procedures or programs that are
     unfavorable to VeriSign's role in the registration of domain names or that
     are inconsistent with VeriSign's current or future plans;

  .  the DOC or ICANN could terminate VeriSign's agreements to be the registry
     or a registrar in the .com, .net and .org top-level domains if they find
     that VeriSign is in violation of its agreements with them;

  .  if VeriSign's agreements to be the registry for the .com, .org or .net, or
     a registrar for existing and new top-level domains are terminated, it may
     not be able to sustain the revenue growth it experienced in recent
     periods;

  .  the terms of the registrar accreditation contract could change, as a
     result of an ICANN-adopted policy, in a manner that is unfavorable
     toVeriSign;

  .  the DOC's or ICANN's interpretation of provisions of VeriSign's agreements
     with either of them described above could differ from VeriSign's;

  .  the DOC could revoke its recognition of ICANN, as a result of which the
     DOC would take the place of ICANN for purposes of the various agreements
     described above, and could take actions that are harmful to VeriSign;

  .  ICANN has approved new top-level domains and VeriSign may not be permitted
     to act as a registrar with respect to some of those top-level domains;

  .  the U.S. Government could refuse to transfer certain responsibilities for
     domain name system administration to ICANN due to security, stability or
     other reasons, resulting in fragmentation or other instability in domain
     name system administration; and

  .  VeriSign's registry business could face legal or other challenges
     resulting from the activities of registrars.

   Challenges to ongoing privatization of Internet administration could harm
   VeriSign's Web Presence Services business.

   Risks VeriSign faces from challenges by third parties, including other
domestic and foreign governmental authorities, to VeriSign's role in the
ongoing privatization of the Internet include:

  .  legal, regulatory or other challenges, including challenges to the
     agreements governing VeriSign's relationship with, or to the legal
     authority underlying the roles and actions of, the DOC, ICANN or VeriSign,
     could be brought;

  .  Congress has held several hearings in which various issues about the
     domain name system and ICANN's practices have been raised and Congress
     could take action that is unfavorable to VeriSign;

  .  Congress has issued a Conference Report directing the General Accounting
     Office to review the relationship between the DOC and ICANN and the
     adequacy of security arrangements under existing DOC cooperative
     agreements. An adverse report could cause Congress to take action that is
     unfavorable to VeriSign or the stability of the domain name system;

  .  ICANN could fail to maintain its role, potentially resulting in
     instability in domain name system administration; and

  .  some foreign governments and governmental authorities have in the past
     disagreed with, and may in the future disagree with, the actions, policies
     or programs of ICANN, the U.S. Government and VeriSign relating to the
     domain name system. These foreign governments or governmental authorities
     may take actions or adopt policies or programs that are harmful to
     VeriSign's business.

   VeriSign's quarterly operating results may fluctuate and its future revenues
   and profitability are uncertain.

   VeriSign's quarterly operating results have varied and may fluctuate
significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which
are outside its control. These factors include the following:

  .  continued market acceptance of its trusted infrastructure services;

  .  the long sales and implementation cycles for, and potentially large order
     sizes of, some of VeriSign's Internet trust services and the timing and
     execution of individual contracts;

  .  volume of domain name registrations through VeriSign's Web Presence
     Services business and its Global Registry Service business;

  .  customer renewal rates for VeriSign's Internet infrastructure services and
     Web Presence Services;

  .  competition in the Web Presence Services business from competing
     registrars and registries;

  .  the introduction of additional alternative Internet naming systems;

  .  the timing of releases of new versions of Internet browsers or other
     third-party software products and networking equipment that include
     VeriSign's digital certificate service interface technology;

  .  the mix of all VeriSign's offered services sold during a quarter;

  .  VeriSign's success in marketing other Internet infrastructure services and
     web presence value-added services to its existing customers and to new
     customers;

  .  continued development of its direct and indirect distribution channels,
     both in the U.S. and abroad;

  .  market acceptance of VeriSign's Internet infrastructure services and new
     service offerings or its competitors' products and services;

  .  a decrease in the level of spending for IT related products and services
     by enterprise customers;

  .  VeriSign's ability to expand operations;

  .  VeriSign's success in assimilating the operations and personnel of any
     acquired businesses;

  .  the amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of its
     operations;

  .  the impact of price changes in VeriSign's Internet infrastructure services
     and Web Presence Services or its competitors' products and services; and

  .  general economic and market conditions as well as economic and market
     conditions specific to IP network and Internet industries.

   In addition, VeriSign expects a significant increase in its operating
expenses as it:

  .  increases its sales and marketing operations and activities; and

  .  continues to update its systems and infrastructure.

   If the increase in VeriSign's expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding
increase in its revenues, VeriSign's operating results will suffer,
particularly as revenues from many of its services are recognized ratably over
the term of the service, rather than immediately when the customer pays for
them, unlike its sales and marketing expenditures, which are expensed in full
when incurred.

   Due to all of the above factors, VeriSign's quarterly revenues and operating
results are difficult to forecast. Therefore, VeriSign believes that
period-to-period comparisons of VeriSign's operating results will not
necessarily be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication
of future performance. Also, operating results may fall below VeriSign's
expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or
more future quarters. If this were to occur, the market price of VeriSign
common stock would likely decline.

   VeriSign faces significant competition.

   VeriSign anticipates that the market for services that enable trusted and
secure electronic commerce and communications over IP networks will remain
intensely competitive. VeriSign competes with larger and smaller

companies that provide products and services that are similar to some aspects
of its Internet infrastructure services. VeriSign's competitors may develop new
technologies in the future that are perceived as being more secure, effective
or cost efficient than the technology underlying its trust services. VeriSign
expects that competition will increase in the near term, and that its primary
long-term competitors may not yet have entered the market.

   Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, reduced margins or
the failure of VeriSign's Internet trust services to achieve or maintain market
acceptance, any of which could harm its business. Several of VeriSign's current
and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly
greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources. As a result,
VeriSign may not be able to compete effectively.

   In connection with VeriSign's first round of financing, RSA contributed
certain technology to VeriSign and entered into a non-competition agreement
with VeriSign under which RSA agreed that it would not compete with VeriSign's
certificate authority business for a period of five years. This non-competition
agreement expired in April 2000. VeriSign believes that, because RSA, which is
now a wholly owned subsidiary of RSA Security, has already developed expertise
in the area of cryptography, its barriers to entry would be lower than those
that would be encountered by VeriSign's other potential competitors should RSA
choose to enter any of VeriSign's markets. If RSA were to enter into the
digital certificate market, VeriSign's business could be materially harmed.

   Seven new top-level domain registries, .aero, .biz, .coop, .info, .museum,
 .name and .pro, are expected to begin accepting domain name registrations in
the near future. The commencement of registrations in these new top-level
domains could have the effect of reduced demand for .com and .net domain name
registrations. If the new top-level domains do reduce the demand for domain
name registrations in .com and .net, VeriSign's business could be materially
harmed.

   The agreements among ICANN, the DOC, VeriSign and other registrars permit
flexibility in pricing for and term of registrations. VeriSign's revenues,
therefore, could be reduced due to pricing pressures, bundled service offerings
and variable terms resulting from increased competition. Some registrars and
resellers in the .com, .net and .org top-level domains are already charging
lower prices for Web Presence Services in those domains. In addition, other
entities are bundling, and may in the future bundle, domain name registrations
with other products or services at reduced rates or for free.

   VeriSign's Internet infrastructure services market is new and evolving.

   VeriSign targets its Internet infrastructure services at the market for
trusted and secure electronic commerce and communications over IP networks.
This is a new and rapidly evolving market that may not continue to grow.
Accordingly, the demand for VeriSign's Internet infrastructure services is very
uncertain. Even if the market for electronic commerce and communications over
IP networks grows, VeriSign's Internet infrastructure services may not be
widely accepted. The factors that may affect the level of market acceptance of
digital certificates and, consequently, VeriSign's Internet infrastructure
services include the following:

  .  market acceptance of products and services based upon authentication
     technologies other than those VeriSign uses;

  .  public perception of the security of digital certificates and IP networks;

  .  the ability of the Internet infrastructure to accommodate increased levels
     of usage; and

  .  government regulations affecting electronic commerce and communications
     over IP networks.

   Even if digital certificates achieve market acceptance, VeriSign's Internet
infrastructure services may fail to address the market's requirements
adequately. If digital certificates do not sustain or increase their
acceptance, or if VeriSign's Internet infrastructure services in particular do
not achieve or sustain market acceptance, VeriSign's business would be
materially harmed.

   System interruptions and security breaches could harm VeriSign's business.

   VeriSign depends on the uninterrupted operation of its various domain name
registration systems, secure data centers and other computer and communications
systems. VeriSign must protect these systems from loss, damage or interruption
caused by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure or other
events beyond its control. Most of VeriSign's systems are located at, and most
of its customer information is stored in, its facilities in Mountain View,
California and Kawasaki, Japan, both of which are susceptible to earthquakes,
and Dulles and Herndon, Virginia. Though it has back-up power resources,
VeriSign's California locations are susceptible to recent electric power
shortages. All of VeriSign's Web Presence Services systems, including those
used in its domain name registry and registrar business are located at its
Dulles and Herndon, Virginia facilities. Any damage or failure that causes
interruptions in any of these facilities or VeriSign's other computer and
communications systems could materially harm its business. In addition,
VeriSign's ability to issue digital certificates and register domain names
depends on the efficient operation of the Internet connections from customers
to its secure data centers and its various registration systems as well as from
customers to VeriSign's registrar and from VeriSign's registrar and other
registrars to the shared registration system.

   These connections depend upon efficient operation of web browsers, Internet
service providers and Internet backbone service providers, all of which have
had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past. Any of
these problems or outages could decrease customer satisfaction.

   A failure in the operation of VeriSign's various registration systems,
VeriSign's domain name zone servers, the domain name root servers or other
events could result in deletion of one or more domain names from the Internet
for a period of time. A failure in the operation of VeriSign's shared
registration system could result in the inability of one or more other
registrars to register and maintain domain names for a period of time. A
failure in the operation or update of the master database that VeriSign
maintains could result in deletion of one or more top-level domains from the
Internet and the discontinuation of second-level domain names in those
top-level domains for a period of time. The inability of VeriSign's registrar
systems, including its back office billing and collections infrastructure, and
telecommunications systems to meet the demands of the increasing number of
domain name registration requests and corresponding customer e-mails and
telephone calls, including speculative, otherwise abusive and repetitive e-mail
domain name registration and modification requests, could result in substantial
degradation in VeriSign's customer support service and its ability to process,
bill and collect registration requests in a timely manner.

   VeriSign retains certain confidential customer information in its secure
data centers and various registration systems. It is critical to VeriSign's
business strategy that its facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are
perceived by the marketplace to be secure. VeriSign's domain name registration
operations also depend on its ability to maintain its computer and
telecommunications equipment in effective working order and to reasonably
protect its systems against interruption and potentially on such maintenance
and protection by other registrars in the shared registration system. The root
zone servers and top-level domain name zone servers that VeriSign operates are
critical hardware to its web presence operations. Therefore, VeriSign may have
to expend significant time and money to maintain or increase the security of
its facilities and infrastructure.

   Despite VeriSign's security measures, its infrastructure may be vulnerable
to physical break-ins, computer viruses, and attacks by hackers or similar
disruptive problems. It is possible that VeriSign may have to expend additional
financial and other resources to address such problems. Any physical or
electronic break-ins or other security breaches or compromises of the
information stored at VeriSign's secure data centers and domain name
registration systems may jeopardize the security of information stored on its
premises or in the computer systems and networks of its customers. In such an
event, VeriSign could face significant liability and customers could be
reluctant to use its Internet infrastructure services and Web Presence
Services. Such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and
therefore adversely affect the market's perception of the security of
electronic commerce and communications over IP networks as well as of the
security or reliability of VeriSign's services.

   VeriSign relies on a continuous power supply to conduct its operations, and
   California's current energy crisis could disrupt VeriSign's operations and
   increase its expenses.

   California is in the midst of an energy crisis that could disrupt VeriSign's
operations and increase its expenses. In the event of an acute power shortage,
that is, when power reserves for the State of California fall below 1.5%,
California has on some occasions implemented, and may in the future continue to
implement, rolling blackouts throughout the state. If blackouts interrupt
VeriSign's power supply, it may be temporarily unable to operate. Any such
interruption in VeriSign's ability to continue operations could delay the
development of its products. Future interruptions could damage VeriSign's
reputation, harm its ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new
customers, and could result in lost revenue, any of which could substantially
harm VeriSign's business and results of operations.

   Furthermore, the deregulation of the energy industry instituted in 1996 by
the California government and shortages in wholesale electricity supplies have
caused power prices to increase. If wholesale prices continue to increase,
VeriSign's operating expenses will likely increase, as its headquarters and
many of its employees are based in California.

   Acquisitions could harm VeriSign's business.

   VeriSign made several acquisitions in 2000 and 2001. VeriSign could
experience difficulty in integrating the personnel, products, technologies or
operations of these companies. In addition, assimilating acquired businesses
involves a number of other risks, including, but not limited to:

  .  the potential disruption of VeriSign's business;

  .  the potential impairment of relationships with VeriSign's employees,
     customers and strategic partners;

  .  potential additional expenses associated with a write-off of a portion of
     goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market condition,
     as was the case when VeriSign recorded a non-cash charge of $9.9 billion
     related to write downs of goodwill for stock-based acquisitions;

  .  unanticipated costs or the incurrence of unknown liabilities;

  .  the need to manage more geographically-dispersed operations, such as
     VeriSign's offices in Virginia, North Carolina, South Africa and Europe;

  .  diversion of management's resources from other business concerns;

  .  the inability to retain the employees of the acquired businesses;

  .  adverse effects on existing customer relationships of acquired companies;

  .  the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the
     acquired businesses;

  .  VeriSign's inability to incorporate acquired technologies successfully
     into its Internet infrastructure services; and

  .  the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and
     policies.

   Additionally, VeriSign is required under generally accepted accounting
principles to review its intangible assets for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.

   If VeriSign is unable to successfully address any of these risks for future
acquisitions, its business could be harmed.

   Some of VeriSign's investments in other companies resulted in losses and may
   result in losses in the future.

   VeriSign has equity and debt investments in a number of companies. In most
instances, these investments are in the form of equity and debt securities of
private companies for which there is no public market. These companies are
typically in the early stage of development and may be expected to incur
substantial losses. Therefore, these companies may never become publicly traded
companies. Even if they do, an active trading market for their securities may
never develop and VeriSign may never realize any return on these investments.
Further, if these companies are not successful, VeriSign could incur charges
related to write-downs or write-offs of these types of assets. Due to the
recent volatility in the stock market in general, and the market prices of
securities of technology companies in particular, in the first quarter of 2001,
VeriSign determined that the decline in value of some of its public and private
equity security investments was other than temporary and recognized a loss of
$74.7 million related to the decline in value of these investments. Due to the
inherent risk associated with some of its investments, and in light of current
stock market conditions, VeriSign may incur future losses on the sales,
write-downs or write-offs of its investments.

   Technological changes will affect VeriSign's business.

   The emerging nature of the Internet, digital certificate business, the
domain name registration business and payment services business, and their
rapid evolution, require VeriSign continually to improve the performance,
features and reliability of its Internet infrastructure services and Web
Presence Services, particularly in response to competitive offerings. VeriSign
must also introduce any new Internet infrastructure services and Web Presence
Services, as quickly as possible. The success of new Internet infrastructure
services and Web Presence Services depends on several factors, including proper
new service definition and timely completion, introduction and market
acceptance. VeriSign may not succeed in developing and marketing new Internet
infrastructure services and Web Presence Services that respond to competitive
and technological developments and changing customer needs. This could harm
VeriSign's business.

   VeriSign must manage its growth and expansion.

   VeriSign's historical growth has placed, and any further growth is likely to
continue to place, a significant strain on its resources. VeriSign has grown
from 26 employees at December 31, 1995 to over 2,355 employees at June 30,
2001. In addition to internal growth, VeriSign's employee base grew through
acquisitions. VeriSign has also opened additional sales offices and has
significantly expanded its operations, both in the U.S. and abroad, during this
time period. To be successful, VeriSign will need to implement additional
management information systems, continue the development of its operating,
administrative, financial and accounting systems and controls and maintain
close coordination among its executive, engineering, accounting, finance,
marketing, sales and operations organizations. Any failure to manage growth
effectively could harm VeriSign's business.

   VeriSign depends on key personnel.

   VeriSign depends on the performance of its senior management team and other
key employees. VeriSign's success will also depend on its ability to attract,
integrate, train, retain and motivate these individuals and additional highly
skilled technical and sales and marketing personnel, both in the U.S. and
abroad. There is intense competition for these personnel. In addition,
VeriSign's stringent hiring practices for some of its key personnel, which
consist of background checks into prospective employees' criminal and financial
histories, further limit the number of qualified persons for these positions.
VeriSign has no employment agreements with any of its key executives that
prevent them from leaving VeriSign at any time. In addition, VeriSign does not
maintain key person life insurance for any of its officers or key employees
other than its President and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services
of any of its senior management team or other key employees or failure to
attract, integrate, train, retain and motivate additional key employees could
harm VeriSign's business.

   VeriSign relies on third parties who maintain and control root zone servers
   and route Internet communications.

   VeriSign currently administers and operates only two of the 13 root zone
servers. The others are administered and operated by independent operators on a
volunteer basis. Because of the importance to the functioning of the Internet
of these root zone servers, VeriSign's global registry services business could
be harmed if these volunteer operators fail to maintain such servers properly
or abandon such servers which would place additional capacity on the two root
zone servers VeriSign operates.

   Further, VeriSign's global registry services business could be harmed if any
of these volunteer operators fails to include or provide accessibility to the
data that it maintains in the root zone servers that it controls. In the event
and to the extent that ICANN is authorized to set policy with regard to an
authoritative root server system, as provided in the registry agreement between
ICANN and VeriSign, it is required to ensure that the authoritative root will
point to the top-level domain zone servers designated by it. If ICANN does not
do this, VeriSign's business could be harmed.

   VeriSign's Web Presence Services and registry services businesses also could
be harmed if a significant number of Internet service providers decided not to
route Internet communications to or from domain names registered by it or if a
significant number of Internet service providers decided to provide routing to
a set of domain name servers that did not point to VeriSign's domain name zone
servers.

   VeriSign must establish and maintain strategic and other relationships.

   One of VeriSign's significant business strategies has been to enter into
strategic or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a
larger customer base than it could reach through its direct sales and marketing
efforts. Examples of these types of relationships include VeriSign's
arrangements with Cisco, Microsoft and RSA Security. VeriSign may need to enter
into additional relationships to execute its business plan. VeriSign may not be
able to enter into additional, or maintain its existing, strategic
relationships on commercially reasonable terms. If VeriSign fails to enter into
additional relationships, VeriSign would have to devote substantially more
resources to the distribution, sale and marketing of its Internet
infrastructure services and Web Presence Services than it would otherwise.
VeriSign's success in obtaining results from these relationships will depend
both on the ultimate success of the other parties to these relationships,
particularly in the use and promotion of IP networks for trusted and secure
electronic commerce and communications, and on the ability of these parties to
market VeriSign's Internet infrastructure services successfully.

   Furthermore, VeriSign's ability to achieve future growth will also depend on
its ability to continue to establish direct seller channels and to develop
multiple distribution channels, particularly with respect to its Web Presence
Services business. To do this VeriSign must maintain relationships with
Internet access providers and other third parties. Failure of one or more of
VeriSign's strategic relationships to result in the development and maintenance
of a market for its Internet infrastructure services or Web Presence Services
could harm VeriSign's business. Many of VeriSign's existing relationships do
not, and any future relationships may not, afford it any exclusive marketing or
distribution rights. In addition, the other parties may not view their
relationships with VeriSign as significant for their own businesses. Therefore,
they could reduce their commitment to VeriSign at any time in the future. These
parties could also pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative
products and services either on their own or in collaboration with others,
including VeriSign's competitors. If VeriSign is unable to maintain its
relationships or to enter into additional relationships, this could harm its
business.

   Some of VeriSign's Internet trust services have lengthy sales and
   implementation cycles.

   VeriSign markets many of its Internet infrastructure services directly to
large companies and government agencies. The sale and implementation of its
services to these entities typically involves a lengthy education process and a
significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources.
This process is also subject to the risk of delays associated with customers'
internal budgeting and other procedures for approving

large capital expenditures, deploying new technologies within their networks
and testing and accepting new technologies that affect key operations. As a
result, the sales and implementation cycles associated with certain of
VeriSign's Internet trust services can be lengthy, potentially lasting from
three to six months. VeriSign's quarterly and annual operating results could be
materially harmed if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular
quarter are not realized.

   VeriSign's services could have unknown defects.

   Services as complex as those VeriSign offers or develops frequently contain
undetected defects or errors. Despite testing, defects or errors may occur in
VeriSign's existing or new services, which could result in loss of or delay in
revenues, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance, diversion
of development resources, injury to VeriSign's reputation, tort or warranty
claims, increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs, any
of which could harm VeriSign's business. Furthermore, VeriSign often provides
implementation, customization, consulting and other technical services in
connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of its services,
which typically involves working with sophisticated software, computing and
communications systems. VeriSign's failure or inability to meet customer
expectations in a timely manner could also result in loss of or delay in
revenues, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance, injury to
its reputation and increased costs.

   Public key cryptography technology is subject to risks.

   VeriSign's Internet infrastructure services depend on public key
cryptography technology. With public key cryptography technology, a user is
given a public key and a private key, both of which are required to perform
encryption and decryption operations. The security afforded by this technology
depends on the integrity of a user's private key and that it is not lost,
stolen or otherwise compromised. The integrity of private keys also depends in
part on the application of specific mathematical principles known as
"factoring." This integrity is predicated on the assumption that the factoring
of large numbers into their prime number components is difficult. Should an
easy factoring method be developed, the security of encryption products
utilizing public key cryptography technology would be reduced or eliminated.
Furthermore, any significant advance in techniques for attacking cryptographic
systems could also render some or all of VeriSign's existing Internet trust
services obsolete or unmarketable. If improved techniques for attacking
cryptographic systems were ever developed, VeriSign would likely have to
reissue digital certificates to some or all of its customers, which could
damage VeriSign's reputation and brand or otherwise harm its business. In the
past there have been public announcements of the successful attack upon
cryptographic keys of certain kinds and lengths and of the potential
misappropriation of private keys and other activation data. This type of
publicity could also hurt the public perception as to the safety of the public
key cryptography technology included in VeriSign's digital certificates. This
negative public perception could harm VeriSign's business.

   VeriSign's international operations are subject to certain risks.

   Revenues from international subsidiaries and affiliates accounted for
approximately 13% of its revenues in the second quarter of 2001 and
approximately 12% of its revenues in the first six months of 2001. VeriSign
intends to expand its international operations and international sales and
marketing activities. For example, with its acquisition of THAWTE VeriSign has
additional operations in South Africa and with its acquisition of Network
Solutions, VeriSign has additional operations in Asia and Europe. Expansion
into these markets has required and will continue to require significant
management attention and resources. VeriSign may also need to tailor its
Internet infrastructure trust services and Web Presence Services for a
particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating
relationships. VeriSign has limited experience in localizing its services and
in developing international distribution or operating relationships. VeriSign
may not succeed in expanding its services into international markets. Failure
to do so could harm VeriSign's business. In addition, there are risks inherent
in doing business on an international basis, including, among others:

  .  competition with foreign companies or other domestic companies entering
     the foreign markets in which VeriSign operates;

  .  regulatory requirements;

  .  legal uncertainty regarding liability and compliance with foreign laws;

  .  export and import restrictions on cryptographic technology and products
     incorporating that technology;

  .  tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions;

  .  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;

  .  longer sales and payment cycles;

  .  problems in collecting accounts receivable;

  .  currency fluctuations, as all of VeriSign's international revenues from
     VeriSign Japan, K.K., THAWTE (South Africa), Registrars.com (Canada),
     Domainnames.com, Limited (U.K.) and the entities acquired through
     VeriSign's recent Euro909 acquisition are not denominated in U.S. dollars
     ;

  .  difficulty of authenticating customer information;

  .  political instability;

  .  failure of foreign laws to protect VeriSign's U.S. proprietary rights
     adequately;

  .  more stringent privacy policies in foreign countries;

  .  seasonal reductions in business activity; and

  .  potentially adverse tax consequences.

   VeriSign has licensed to its affiliates the VeriSign Processing Center
platform, which is designed to replicate its own secure data centers and allows
the affiliate to offer back-end processing of Internet infrastructure services.
The VeriSign Processing Center platform provides an affiliate with the
knowledge and technology to offer Internet infrastructure services similar to
those offered by VeriSign. It is critical to VeriSign's business strategy that
the facilities and infrastructure used in issuing and marketing digital
certificates remain secure and VeriSign is perceived by the marketplace to be
secure. Although VeriSign provides the affiliate with training in security and
trust practices, network management and customer service and support, these
practices are performed by the affiliate and are outside of VeriSign's control.
Any failure of an affiliate to maintain the privacy of confidential customer
information could result in negative publicity and therefore adversely affect
the market's perception of the security of VeriSign's services as well as the
security of electronic commerce and communication over IP networks generally.
For further information, please see "--System interruptions and security
breaches could harm VeriSign's business."

   VeriSign's Internet infrastructure services could be affected by government
   regulation.

   Exports of software products utilizing encryption technology are generally
restricted by the United States and various non-United States governments.
Although VeriSign has obtained approval to export its Global Server digital
certificate service, and none of VeriSign's other Internet infrastructure
services are currently subject to export controls under United States law, the
list of products and countries for which export approval is required could be
revised in the future to include more digital certificate products and related
services. If VeriSign does not obtain required approvals it may not be able to
sell specific Internet infrastructure services in international markets. There
are currently no federal laws or regulations that specifically control
certificate authorities, but a limited number of states have enacted
legislation or regulations with respect to certificate authorities. If the
market for digital certificates grows, the United States federal or state or
non-United States governments may choose to enact further regulations governing
certificate authorities or other providers of digital certificate products and
related services. These regulations or the costs of complying with these
regulations could harm VeriSign's business.

   In July 2000, the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act,
or "E-Sign," was signed into law. E-Sign is intended to render digital
signatures legally equivalent to those signed on paper. The execution of E-Sign
could materially and adversely affect VeriSign's digital certificates services
business. For example, there may be an increasing demand for digital signatures
and certificates as a result of the new E-Sign law. However, due to competition
or other reasons, VeriSign's services may not be adopted. If VeriSign cannot
meet market expectations or demand for its products and services do not
increase, its business may be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, a
successful implementation of E-Sign may further encourage competitors to enter
the marketplace because of the possible increase in demand for digital
signatures and certificates. This could effectively lower barriers to entry and
increasingly flood the marketplace with competitors, which could, among other
things, result in price erosion. While VeriSign cannot assure you that E-Sign
will be effectively implemented or how this implementation will affect its
business, VeriSign must continue to meet the demand and expectations of its
customers, its failure to do so could materially and adversely harm its
business.

   VeriSign faces risks related to intellectual property rights.

   VeriSign's success depends on its internally developed technologies and
other intellectual property. Despite its precautions, it may be possible for a
third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use VeriSign's trade secrets or
other forms of its intellectual property without authorization. In addition, it
is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent
intellectual property. If VeriSign does not effectively protect its
intellectual property, its business could suffer.

   In the future VeriSign may have to resort to litigation to enforce its
intellectual property rights, to protect its trade secrets or to determine the
validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. This type of
litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial costs and
diversion of management and technical resources.

   VeriSign also licenses third-party technology, such as public key
cryptography technology licensed from RSA and other technology that is used in
VeriSign's products, to perform key functions. These third-party technology
licenses may not continue to be available to VeriSign on commercially
reasonable terms or at all. VeriSign's business could suffer if it lost the
rights to use these technologies. A third party could claim that the licensed
software infringes a patent or other proprietary right. Litigation between the
licensor and a third party or between VeriSign and a third party could lead to
royalty obligations for which it is not indemnified or for which
indemnification is insufficient, or VeriSign may not be able to obtain any
additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The loss of, or
its inability to obtain or maintain, any of these technology licenses could
delay the introduction of VeriSign's Internet infrastructure services until
equivalent technology, if available, is identified, licensed and integrated.
This could harm VeriSign's business.

   From time to time, VeriSign has received, and may receive in the future,
notice of claims of infringement of other parties' proprietary rights.
Infringement or other claims could be made against VeriSign in the future. Any
claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly
litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, cause product
shipment delays or require VeriSign to develop non-infringing technology or
enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Royalty or licensing agreements, if
required, may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If a successful
claim of product infringement were made against VeriSign and it could not
develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar
technology on a timely and cost- effective basis, VeriSign's business could be
harmed.

   In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and
scope of protection of intellectual property rights in Internet-related
businesses are uncertain and still evolving. Because of the growth of the
Internet and Internet-related businesses, patent applications are continuously
and simultaneously being filed in connection with Internet-related technology.
There are a significant number of U.S. and foreign patents and patent
applications in VeriSign's areas of interest, and VeriSign believes that there
has been, and is likely to continue to be, significant litigation in the
industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights.

VeriSign has implemented anti-takeover provisions.

   VeriSign's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws,
contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to
acquire VeriSign without the consent of its board of directors. These
provisions include:

  .  VeriSign's stockholders may only take action at a meeting and not by
     written consent;

  .  VeriSign's board must be given advance notice regarding
     stockholder-sponsored proposals for consideration at annual meetings and
     for stockholder nominations for the election of directors;

  .  VeriSign has a classified board of directors, with the board being divided
     into three classes that serve staggered three-year terms;

  .  vacancies on its board may be filled until the next annual meeting of
     stockholders only by majority vote of the directors then in office; and

  .  special meetings of VeriSign's stockholders may only be called by the
     Chairman of the Board, the President or by the board, not by VeriSign's
     stockholders.

   While VeriSign believes these provisions provide for an opportunity to
receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with its
board of directors, these provisions may apply even if the offer may be
considered beneficial by some stockholders.

Additional Risks Related to Illuminet

   System failures, delays and other problems could harm Illuminet's reputation
   and business, cause it to lose customers and expose it to customer
   liability.

   Illuminet's success depends on its ability to provide reliable services.
Illuminet's operations could be interrupted by any damage to or failure of:

  .  its network;

  .  its connections to third parties; and

  .  its computer hardware or software or its customers' or suppliers' computer
     hardware or software.

   Illuminet's systems and operations are also vulnerable to damage or
interruption from:

  .  power loss, transmission cable cuts and other telecommunications failures;

  .  fires, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters;

  .  computer viruses or software defects;

  .  physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism
     and similar events; and

  .  errors by its employees or third-party service providers.

Any such damage or failure or the occurrence of any of these events could
disrupt the operation of Illuminet's network and the provision of its services
and result in the loss of current and potential customers.

   From time to time, Illuminet experiences outages of service. For example, on
two occasions, once in 1997 and once in 1998, flaws in third-party software
caused network outages that disrupted the ability of its customers to connect
through Illuminet's network to other parts of the U.S. telecommunications
system. As a result of these outages, some of its customers reduced their usage
of its network. More recently, in June 2000, several of Illuminet's customers
in the Northeast region of the United States experienced a similar disruption
when a road maintenance crew cut a carrier's fiber cable bundle that contained
multiple links servicing Illuminet's two pairs of signal transfer points to its
SS7 network in that region. Because several of these links were routed by the
carrier

through the severed cable bundle, the redundant design of Illuminet's network
did not prevent a service interruption. Illuminet's emergency response
procedures were immediately activated. At other times Illuminet has experienced
minor, customer specific outages which have not had a material adverse impact
on its customer relations.

   Illuminet's contracts with customers generally contain provisions designed
to limit its exposure to potential product liability claims. These provisions
include disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability for special,
consequential and incidental damages. In addition, Illuminet's agreements
generally limit the amounts recoverable for damages to the amounts paid by the
customer to it for the product or service giving rise to the damages. However,
a court or arbitrator may not enforce these contractual limitations on
liability, and Illuminet may be subject to claims based on errors in its
software or mistakes in performing its services. Any of those claims, including
any relating to damages to its customers' internal systems, whether or not
successful, could harm Illuminet's business by increasing its costs and
distracting its management.

   Illuminet's reliance on third party communications infrastructure, hardware
   and software exposes it to a variety of risks it cannot control.

   Illuminet's success will depend on its network infrastructure, including the
capacity leased from telecommunications suppliers. In particular, Illuminet
relies on AT&T, WorldCom, Sprint and other telecommunications providers for
leased long-haul and local loop transmission capacity. These companies provide
the dedicated links that connect Illuminet's network components to each other
and to its customers.

   Illuminet's business also depends upon the capacity, reliability and
security of the infrastructure owned by third parties that is used to connect
telephone calls. Specifically, Illuminet currently leases capacity from
regional partners on seven of the thirteen mated pairs of SS7 signal transfer
points that comprise its network. Illuminet has no control over the operation,
quality or maintenance of a significant portion of that infrastructure and
whether or not those third parties will upgrade or improve their equipment.

   Illuminet depends on these companies to maintain the operational integrity
of its connections. If one or more of these companies is unable or unwilling to
supply or expand its levels of service to Illuminet in the future, Illuminet's
operations could be severely interrupted. In addition, rapid changes in the
telecommunications industry have led to the merging of many companies. These
mergers may cause the availability, pricing and quality of the services
Illuminet uses to vary and could cause the length of time it takes to deliver
the services that it uses to increase significantly.

   Illuminet relies on links, equipment and software provided to it from its
vendors, the most important of which are gateway equipment and software from
Tekelec and Agilent Technologies, Inc. Illuminet cannot assure you that it will
be able to continue to purchase equipment from these vendors on acceptable
terms, if at all. If Illuminet is unable to maintain current purchasing terms
or ensure product availability with these vendors, it may lose customers and
experience an increase in costs in seeking alternative suppliers of products
and services.

   The costs and difficulties of acquiring and integrating complementary
   businesses and technologies could impede Illuminet's future growth and
   adversely affect its competitiveness.

   Illuminet may make investments in complementary companies, technologies or
other assets, exposing it to several risks, including:

  .  greater than expected costs and management time and effort involved in
     identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions;

  .  potential disruption of its ongoing business and difficulty in maintaining
     its standards, controls, information systems and procedures;

  .  entering into markets and acquiring technologies in areas in which it has
     little experience;

  .  acquiring intellectual property which may be subject to various challenges
     from others in the telecommunications industry;

  .  the inability to successfully integrate the services, products and
     personnel of any acquisition into its operations;

  .  a need to incur debt, which may reduce its cash available for operations
     and other uses, or issue equity securities, which may dilute the ownership
     interests of existing stockholders; and

  .  realizing little, if any, return on its investment.

   Illuminet's business depends on the acceptance of its SS7 network and the
   telecommunications market's continuing use of SS7 technology.

   Illuminet's future growth depends on the commercial success and reliability
of its SS7 network. Illuminet's SS7 network is a vital component of its
intelligent network services, which have been an increasing source of revenue
for it. Illuminet's business will suffer if its target customers do not use its
SS7 network. Illuminet's future financial performance will also depend on the
successful development, introduction and customer acceptance of new and
enhanced SS7-based products and services. Illuminet is not certain that its
target customers will choose its particular SS7 network solution or continue to
use its SS7 network. In the future, Illuminet may not be successful in
marketing its SS7 network or any new or enhanced products or services.

   If Illuminet does not adapt to rapid technological change in the
   telecommunications industry, it could lose customers or market share.

   Illuminet's industry is characterized by rapid technological change and
frequent new product and service announcements. Significant technological
changes could make its technology obsolete. Illuminet must adapt to its rapidly
changing market by continually improving the responsiveness, reliability and
features of its network and by developing new network features, services and
applications to meet changing customer needs. Illuminet cannot assure you that
it will be able to adapt to these challenges or respond successfully or in a
cost-effective way to adequately meet them. Its failure to do so would
adversely affect its ability to compete and retain customers or market share.

   Illuminet sells its products and services primarily to traditional
telecommunications companies. Many emerging companies are providing convergent
Internet protocol-based telecommunications services. Illuminet's future
revenues and profits, if any, could depend upon its ability to provide products
and services to these Internet protocol-based telephony providers.

   The market for SS7 network services and related products is competitive and
   many of Illuminet's competitors have significant advantages that could
   adversely affect its business.

   Illuminet competes in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly
changing. Increased competition could result in fewer customer orders, reduced
gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could harm Illuminet's
business. Illuminet faces competition from large, well-funded regional
providers of SS7 network services and related products, such as regional Bell
operating companies, TSI and Southern New England Telephone, a unit of SBC
Communication. The prepaid wireless account management and unregistered user
services of National Telemanagement Corporation, a subsidiary of Illuminet,
face competition from Boston Communications Group, Priority Call,
InterVoice-Brite, and TSI. Illuminet is aware of major Internet service
providers, software developers and smaller entrepreneurial companies that are
focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and
services that will compete with it. Illuminet anticipates continued growth of
competition in the telecommunications industry and the entrance of new
competitors into its business. It expects that competition will increase in the
near term and that its primary long-term competitors may not yet have entered
the market. Many of its current and potential competitors have significantly
more employees and

greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than it does.
Illuminet's competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging
technologies and changes in customer requirements than it can. Also, many of
Illuminet's current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and
more extensive customer bases that they can use to their advantage.

   Illuminet's failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance at desired
   pricing levels could impact its ability to maintain profitability or
   positive cash flow.

   Competition and industry consolidation could result in significant pricing
pressure and erode market share. Pricing pressure from competition could cause
large reductions in the selling price of Illuminet's services. For example,
Illuminet's competitors may provide customers with reduced communications costs
for Internet access or private network services, reducing the overall cost of
solutions and significantly increasing pricing pressures on Illuminet.
Illuminet may not be able to offset the effects of any price reductions by
increasing the number of its customers, generating higher revenues from
enhanced services or reducing its costs. Illuminet believes that the business
of providing network connectivity and related network services will likely see
increased consolidation in the future. Consolidation could decrease selling
prices and increase competition in these industries, which could erode its
market share, revenues and operating margins.

   The inability of Illuminet's customers to successfully implement its
   services with their existing systems could adversely affect Illuminet's
   business.

   Significant technical challenges exist in Illuminet's business because many
of its customers:

  .  purchase and implement SS7 network services in phases;

  .  deploy SS7 connectivity across a variety of telecommunication switches and
     routes; and

  .  integrate its SS7 network with a number of legacy systems, third-party
     software applications and engineering tools.

   Customer implementation currently requires participation by Illuminet's
order management and its engineering and operations groups, each of which has
limited resources. Some customers may also require Illuminet to develop costly
customized features or capabilities, which increase Illuminet's costs and
consume a disproportionate share of its limited customer service and support
resources. Also, Illuminet typically charges one-time flat rate fees for
initially connecting a customer to its SS7 network and a monthly recurring flat
rate fee after the connection is established. If new or existing customers have
difficulty deploying Illuminet's products or require significant amounts of its
engineering service support, it may experience reduced operating margins.
Illuminet's customers' ability to deploy its network services to their own
customers and integrate them successfully within their systems depends on
Illuminet's customers' capabilities and the complexity involved. Difficulty in
deploying those services could reduce Illuminet's operating margins due to
increased customer support and could cause potential delays in recognizing
revenue until the services are implemented.

   Illuminet may have difficulty attracting and retaining employees with the
   requisite skills to execute its growth plans.

   Illuminet's success depends, in part, on the continued service of its
existing management and technical personnel. If a significant number of those
individuals are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions,
Illuminet will have difficulty in maintaining and enhancing its networks and
services. This may adversely affect its operating results and growth prospects.

   In addition, Illuminet has experienced, and it expects to continue to
experience, some difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees.
Specifically, it centralizes a large portion of its technical operations in
geographic areas in which competition for technical talent is intense, due to
the existence of competing

employers seeking employees with similar sets of skills. Illuminet's continued
success depends on its ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled
employees, particularly engineering and technical personnel. Failure to do so
may adversely affect its ability to expand its network and enhance its products
and services.

   Capacity limits on Illuminet's technology and network hardware and software
   may be difficult to project and Illuminet may not be able to expand and
   upgrade out systems to meet increased use.

   As traffic from Illuminet's customers through its network increases, it will
need to expand and upgrade its technology and network hardware and software. It
may not be able to accurately project the rate of increase in usage on its
network. In addition, it may not be able to expand and upgrade, in a timely
manner, its systems and network hardware and software capabilities to
accommodate increased traffic on its network. If it does not appropriately
expand and upgrade its systems and network hardware and software, it may lose
customers and revenues.

   Regulations affecting Illuminet's customers and future regulations to which
   it may be subject may adversely affect its business.

   Although Illuminet is not otherwise subject to telecommunications industry
regulations, one service provided by Illuminet's NTC subsidiary is currently
subject to Federal Communications Commission regulation, and the business of
its customers is subject to regulation that indirectly affects its business.
The U.S. telecommunications industry has been subject to continuing
deregulation since 1984, when AT&T was required to divest ownership of the Bell
telephone system. Illuminet cannot predict when, or upon what terms and
conditions, further regulation or deregulation might occur or the effect of
regulation or deregulation on its business. Several services that it offers may
be indirectly affected by regulations imposed upon potential users of those
services, which may increase Illuminet's costs of operations. In addition,
future services Illuminet may provide could be subject to direct regulation.

   Fluctuations in Illuminet's quarterly operating results may negatively
   impact and cause volatility in the combined company's stock price.

   Illuminet's revenues and operating results may vary significantly from
quarter to quarter due to a number of factors.

   Factors that could cause quarterly fluctuations include:

  .  seasonal fluctuations in consumer use of telecommunications services;

  .  varying rates at which telecommunications companies, telephony resellers
     and Internet service providers use Illuminet's services;

  .  loss of customers through industry consolidation, or customer decisions to
     deploy in-house technology;

  .  the timing and execution of individual contracts, particularly large
     contracts;

  .  significant lead times before a product or service begins generating
     revenues;

  .  volatile economic conditions specific to the telecommunications industry;
     and

  .  an inability to collect Illuminet's accounts receivable.

   Illuminet uses a strategic relationship to implement and sell its network
   usage software applications. It could lose revenues or incur significant
   costs to retain revenues if this relationship is terminated.

   Illuminet has a non-exclusive agreement with Agilent Technologies, Inc. to
sell its network usage software applications. The agreement may be terminated
with limited notice by either party without cause or penalty. In the past,
Illuminet has received significant revenues under this agreement. There is no
guarantee that Agilent will

continue to market Illuminet's network usage software applications. If this
relationship is terminated or materially changes, Illuminet would be required
to devote substantial new resources to the distribution, sales and marketing,
implementation and support of its network usage software applications and its
efforts may not be as effective as those of Agilent.

   There is a limited market for Illuminet's existing network usage software
   applications.

   Illuminet derives only a small portion of its revenues from sales and
maintenance of its network usage software applications. Current users of these
software products include most of the regional Bell operating companies, as
well as other large telecommunications carriers. With initial market sales
essentially completed, Illuminet's ability to derive continued revenue from its
network usage software applications is limited, unless it can develop new
derivative products.

                         THE ILLUMINET SPECIAL MEETING

Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting

, 2001

________________________
________________________
________________________
________________________

Purpose of the Special Meeting

   At the special meeting, Illuminet stockholders will be asked to consider and
vote upon the following items:

  .  a proposal to approve the merger and approve and adopt the merger
     agreement and the merger;

  .  a proposal to grant Illuminet management the discretionary authority to
     adjourn the special meeting to a date not later than      , 2002 in order
     to enable the Illuminet board of directors to continue to solicit
     additional proxies in favor of the merger; and

  .  any other matters that may properly come before the special meeting or any
     adjournment or postponement of the special meeting.

Recommendation of the Illuminet Board of Directors

   The Illuminet board of directors:

  .  has approved the merger and the merger agreement;

  .  believes that the terms of the merger are fair to, and in the best
     interests of, Illuminet's stockholders;

  .  recommends that the Illuminet stockholders vote FOR approval and adoption
     of the merger and merger agreement; and

  .  recommends that the Illuminet stockholders vote FOR the adjournment
     proposal.

Stockholders Entitled to Vote

   You are entitled to vote at the special meeting if you owned shares of
Illuminet common stock at the close of business on      , 2001. This date is
called the record date.

Outstanding Shares on Record Date

   As of the record date, there were       outstanding shares of Illuminet
common stock.

Number of Votes

   You will have one vote for each share you owned on the record date for the
Illuminet special meeting. The proxy card indicates the number of shares you
owned on the record date and are eligible to vote at the special meeting.

Quorum Requirement

   A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. The presence,
in person or by proxy, of the holders of shares representing a majority of the
outstanding shares of Illuminet common stock is a quorum.

If you submit a properly executed proxy card, even if you abstain from voting,
you will be considered part of the quorum. Broker non-votes will also count as
present at the special meeting for establishing a quorum. A broker non-vote
occurs with respect to any proposal when a broker is not permitted to vote on
that proposal without instruction from the beneficial owner of the shares and
no instruction is given.

Shares Beneficially Owned by Illuminet Directors and Executive Officers as of
the Record Date

   As of the record date, directors and executive officers of Illuminet and
their affiliates beneficially owned shares of Illuminet common stock, or
approximately      % of the outstanding shares.

Vote Necessary to Approve the Proposals

   Two-thirds of the total votes represented by the outstanding shares of
Illuminet common stock on the record date are necessary to approve the merger
and approve and adopt the merger agreement. Broker non-votes and abstentions
have the same effect as a vote against the merger and the merger agreement.

   A majority of the votes cast on the adjournment proposal are necessary to
approve the adjournment proposal.

Voting of Proxies

   The proxy card accompanying this prospectus/proxy statement is solicited on
behalf of the Illuminet board of directors for use at the meeting. You may vote
in person at the Illuminet meeting or by proxy. Illuminet recommends that you
vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the meeting. You can always change
your vote at the meeting.

How to Vote by Proxy

   Voting instructions are included on the proxy card accompanying this
prospectus/proxy statement. If you properly give your proxy and submit it to
Illuminet in time to vote, one of the individuals named as your proxy (the
individuals named on the proxy card) will vote your shares as you have
directed. You may vote for or against the proposals or abstain from voting.
Please complete, sign, date and return the accompanying proxy card in the
enclosed envelope. If you submit your proxy card but do not make specific
choices, your proxy will follow the board's recommendations and vote your
shares FOR approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger and FOR
the adjournment proposal.

Revoking Your Proxy

   You may revoke your proxy before it is voted by:

  .  notifying Illuminet's Secretary in writing before the meeting that you
     have revoked your proxy (contact Illuminet Holdings, Inc., 4501 Intelco
     Loop SE, P.O. Box 2909, Olympia, Washington 98503, Fax: (360) 923-3440,
     Attention: Secretary);

  .  submitting a new proxy card with a later date; or

  .  voting in person at the meeting.

Voting in Person

   If you plan to attend the meeting and wish to vote in person, Illuminet will
give you a ballot at the meeting. You should realize that attendance at a
stockholders meeting, however, will not in and of itself constitute a
revocation of a proxy.

Effect of Abstaining

   You may abstain from voting on the proposal required for approval of the
merger and the proposal required for adjournment of the meeting. Illuminet will
count a properly executed proxy marked "ABSTAIN" as present for purposes of
determining whether a quorum is present, but the shares represented by that
proxy will not be voted at the special meeting. Because the affirmative vote of
two thirds of the outstanding shares of Illuminet common stock is required to
approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, if you mark your proxy
"ABSTAIN," it will have the effect of a vote against approval and adoption of
the merger agreement and the merger. Because only votes cast on the adjournment
proposal will determine the outcome of any vote on the adjournment proposal, if
you mark your proxy "ABSTAIN," your proxy will have no effect on the
adjournment proposal.

Broker Non-Vote

   If you are an Illuminet stockholder and your broker holds shares in its
name, the broker cannot vote your shares on the proposal without your
instructions. This is a "broker non-vote." You should follow the directions
provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your
shares. Your broker cannot vote your shares of Illuminet common stock without
specific instructions from you. Because the affirmative vote of two thirds of
the outstanding shares of Illuminet common stock is required to approve and
adopt the merger agreement and the merger, if you do not instruct your broker
how to vote, it will have the effect of a vote against approval and adoption of
the merger agreement. Because only votes cast on the adjournment proposal will
determine the outcome of any vote on the adjournment proposal, if you do not
instruct your broker how to vote, your proxy will have no effect on the
adjournment proposal.

Voting shares in person that are held through brokers

   If your shares are held by your broker or another nominee and you wish to
vote those shares in person at the special meeting, you must obtain from the
nominee holding your Illuminet common stock a properly executed legal proxy
identifying you as an Illuminet stockholder, authorizing you to act on behalf
of the nominee at the special meeting and identifying the number of shares with
respect to which the authorization is granted.

Proxy Solicitation

   Illuminet will pay its own costs of soliciting proxies. Illuminet has
retained      , to aid in the solicitation of proxies and to verify records
relating to the solicitations.         will receive customary fees and expense
reimbursement for these services. The extent to which these proxy soliciting
efforts will be necessary depends entirely upon how promptly proxies are
received. Directors, officers and employees of Illuminet may solicit proxies,
without additional remuneration, by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail and
in person. You should send in your proxy by mail without delay. Illuminet also
reimburses brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their
expenses in sending these materials to you and getting your voting
instructions.

   Do not send in any stock certificates with your proxy. The exchange agent
will mail transmittal forms with instructions for the surrender of stock
certificates for Illuminet common shares to former Illuminet stockholders as
soon as practicable after the completion of the merger.

No Appraisal Rights

   Illuminet stockholders are not entitled to dissenters' rights or appraisal
rights with respect to the merger.

Other Business

   Illuminet is not currently aware of any other business to be acted upon at
the Illuminet special meeting. If, however, any other matters are properly
brought before the meeting, or any adjourned meeting, the persons named on the
proxy card, and acting under that proxy, will have discretion to vote or act on
those matters in accordance with their best judgment.

                           PROPOSAL ONE--THE MERGER

   This section of the prospectus/proxy statement describes certain aspects of
the proposed merger and the merger agreement. While we believe that the
description covers the material terms of the merger and the related
transactions, this summary may not contain all of the information that is
important to you. You should read this entire document and the other documents
we refer to carefully for a more complete understanding of the merger. In
addition, we incorporate important business and financial information about
each of us into this prospectus/proxy statement by reference. See "Documents
Incorporated by Reference in this Prospectus/Proxy Statement" on page ii. You
may obtain the information incorporated by reference into this prospectus/proxy
statement without charge by following the instructions in the section entitled
"Where You Can Find More Information" on page iii.

Background of the merger

   From time to time during 2000 and early 2001, the management teams of
VeriSign and Illuminet had exploratory discussions regarding the possibility of
a business relationship or strategic transaction. None of the discussions
resulted in a strategic relationship between the two companies.

   From late July 2001, Mr. Stratton Sclavos, President and Chief Executive
Officer of VeriSign, had independent discussions with Mr. Roger Moore,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Illuminet, about the possibility of a
potential business combination between VeriSign and Illuminet.

   On May 4, 2001, at a meeting of the Illuminet board of directors, Mr. Moore
informed the Illuminet board of the nature and scope of the conversations
between him and Mr. Sclavos. Also, representatives of Robertson Stephens, Inc.
were present for a portion of the meeting and discussed generally VeriSign's
business and financial condition.

   On May 30, June 28 and July 26, 2001, telephonic meetings of the Illuminet
board of directors or its Executive Committee were held during which the
Illuminet directors were updated regarding the discussions with VeriSign.

   On August 3, 2001, during an Illuminet board meeting, Mr. Moore and
representatives of Robertson Stephens made a detailed presentation to the
Illuminet board about VeriSign's operations, business, competitive position,
financial condition and management team. The Illuminet board authorized Mr.
Moore to pursue discussions with VeriSign about a potential merger.

   On August 24, 2001, Illuminet's board held a telephonic meeting during which
Mr. Moore provided a status report on discussions with VeriSign. Mr. Moore
reported that he would continue to discuss a possible merger and keep the
Illuminet board informed of his progress.

   On September 4, 2001, Illuminet's board held a special meeting in Chicago at
which the status of discussions with VeriSign and the general terms of a
possible business combination were reviewed with the board by Illuminet's
management and legal advisors, as well as its financial advisor, Robertson
Stephens. In addition, Mr. Sclavos, Ms. Dana Evan, Chief Financial Officer of
VeriSign, and Mr. Robert Korzeniewski, Executive Vice President of VeriSign,
were invited to participate in part of the meeting. Mr. Sclavos made a
presentation on VeriSign's business. Following significant discussion, the
board authorized management to proceed with further discussions and due
diligence in connection with the potential merger.

   From September 4, 2001 through September 22, 2001, VeriSign and its legal
and financial advisors conducted a business, legal and financial due diligence
review of Illuminet, and Illuminet and its legal and financial advisors
conducted a business, legal and financial due diligence review of VeriSign.
Also during this period, senior management of both companies and their
respective legal advisors held numerous discussions regarding various business,
financial, operational and technical issues involved in combining the
companies. On September 11, 2001, VeriSign's legal counsel provided Illuminet's
legal counsel with a draft merger agreement and ancillary transaction
agreements. During the following eleven days,senior management of both
companies and their respective legal advisors negotiated the terms of the
merger agreement and ancillary agreements.

   On September 18, 2001, Illuminet's board held a special meeting by telephone
conference call. At this meeting Mr. Moore reported on the preliminary results
of the due diligence review of VeriSign. He informed the Illuminet board that a
draft merger agreement would be presented to the Illuminet board later in the
week.

   On September 20, 2001, the VeriSign board of directors held a meeting to
discuss the results of the business, legal and financial due diligence review
of Illuminet and to discuss with VeriSign's management the strategic rationale
and specific terms of the proposed business combination.

   On September 22, 2001, Illuminet's board held a special meeting in San Jose,
California at which its legal advisors reviewed the principal terms of the
merger and Robertson Stephens summarized the financial analyses it had
performed relating to the proposed transaction and rendered its oral opinion to
the Illuminet board, subsequently confirmed in writing as of September 23,
2001, that as of the date of such opinion and based on the matters considered
and the limitations on the review undertaken described in the opinion, the
exchange ratio in the merger was fair to the holders of Illuminet common stock,
from a financial point of view. Following discussion, the Illuminet board
approved the merger agreement and the merger and determined to recommend that
Illuminet's stockholders vote to approve and adopt the merger and the merger
agreement.

   On September 22, 2001, VeriSign's board held a special meeting by telephone
conference call and approved the merger and merger agreement, the creation of
the Merger Sub for the purpose of effecting the merger and the issuance of
shares of VeriSign common stock in the merger.

   On September 23, 2001, the parties executed the merger agreement and the
stock option agreement, and certain officers and directors of Illuminet
executed voting agreements. Prior to the opening of the financial markets on
September 24, 2001, the parties publicly announced their agreement to merge.

Illuminet's reasons for the merger

   The Illuminet board has determined that the terms of the merger agreement
and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of Illuminet and its
stockholders. In the course of reaching its decision to approve the merger
agreement and the merger, the Illuminet board consulted with Illuminet's
management, as well as its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and
considered the following material factors:

  .  that this combination brings to the forefront Illuminet's stated growth
     strategies of expanding into new markets and positioning the company for a
     leading role in softswitch/IP-based network services;

  .  that by combining complementary operations, jointly developing services
     and leveraging the expertise of each company, the combined company would
     have better opportunities for future growth;

  .  the ability of the combined company to take advantage of the product
     development and expertise of both companies in order to bring new products
     to the market;

  .  information concerning the business, earnings, operations, competitive
     position and prospects of Illuminet and VeriSign both individually and on
     a combined basis;

  .  the ability of the combined company to capitalize on each company's strong
     customer and other relationships;

  .  analyses and other information with respect to Illuminet and VeriSign
     including, without limitation, a discussion of the complementary nature of
     the businesses of Illuminet and VeriSign;

  .  the risks and potential rewards associated with continuing to execute
     Illuminet's strategic plan as an independent entity as an alternative to
     the merger, including, among others, risks associated with remaining
     independent and rewards associated with the opportunity for existing
     Illuminet stockholders to participate in the future growth of Illuminet;

  .  the presentations of Robertson Stephens and the opinion of Robertson
     Stephens that, as of the date of the opinion, and based on the matters
     considered and the limitations on the review undertaken described in the
     opinion, the exchange ratio in the merger was fair to the Illuminet
     stockholders, from a financial point of view. The opinion of Robertson
     Stephens is described in detail under the heading "--Opinion of
     Illuminet's financial advisor";

  .  the amount and form of the consideration to be received by Illuminet
     stockholders in the merger and information on the historical trading
     ranges of Illuminet common stock and VeriSign common stock;

  .  the expectation that the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization;

  .  the financial and other terms and conditions of the merger and the merger
     agreement, including, without limitation:

    .  the limited conditions to VeriSign's obligation to close the merger; and

    .  the ability of Illuminet's board of directors, in the exercise of its
       fiduciary duties in accordance with the merger agreement, to authorize
       Illuminet to provide information to, engage in negotiations with, and,
       subject to payment of the termination fee, enter into a transaction
       with, another party as described under "The Merger Agreement - No other
       negotiations";

  .  the possible effects of the public announcement of the merger on
     Illuminet's relationships with customers, suppliers and employers; and

  .  the interests that certain executive officers and directors of Illuminet
     may have with respect to the merger in addition to their interests as
     stockholders of Illuminet generally as described in "--Interests of
     certain persons in the merger."

   In view of the number and wide variety of factors considered in connection
with its evaluation of the merger, and the complexity of these matters, the
Illuminet board of directors did not find it practicable to, nor did it attempt
to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors
it considered. In addition, the Illuminet board did not undertake to make any
specific determination as to whether any particular factor was favorable or
unfavorable to its ultimate determination or assign any particular weight to
any factor, but conducted an overall analysis of the factors described above,
including thorough discussions with and questioning of Illuminet's management
and management's analysis of the proposed merger based on information received
from Illuminet's legal, financial and accounting advisors. In considering the
factors described above, individual members of the board of directors may have
given different weight to different factors. Illuminet's board of directors
considered all these factors together and, on the whole, considered them to be
favorable to, and to support, its determination.

Recommendation of Illuminet's board of directors

   The board of directors of Illuminet believes that the terms of the merger
are fair to and in the best interests of Illuminet and its stockholders and
recommends to its stockholders that they vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the
merger and approve and adopt the merger agreement.

   In considering the recommendation of the Illuminet board of directors with
respect to the merger, you should be aware that certain directors and officers
of Illuminet have certain interests in the merger that are different from, or
are in addition to, the interests of Illuminet's stockholders generally. Please
see the section entitled "--Interests of certain persons in the merger."

Opinion of Illuminet's financial advisor

   Under a letter agreement dated as of August 7, 1998, as amended on May 4,
2001, Illuminet engaged Robertson Stephens to provide financial advisory and
investment banking services in connection with the proposed merger and to
render an opinion as to the fairness of the exchange ratio, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Illuminet common stock.

   On September 22, 2001, at a meeting of the Illuminet board of directors held
to evaluate the proposed merger, Robertson Stephens delivered to Illuminet's
board of directors its oral opinion (subsequently confirmed in writing on
September 23, 2001) that, as of September 23, 2001 and based on the matters
considered and the limitations on the review undertaken described in the
opinion, the 0.93x exchange ratio, or the Exchange Ratio, was fair from a
financial point of view to the holders of Illuminet common stock. The Exchange
Ratio was determined through negotiations between the respective managements of
Illuminet and VeriSign. Although Robertson Stephens assisted the management of
Illuminet in those negotiations, Robertson Stephens was not asked by, and did
not recommend to, Illuminet that any specific exchange ratio constituted the
appropriate exchange ratio for the merger.

   You should consider the following when reading the discussion of the opinion
of Robertson Stephens in this document:

     considered and the limitations on the review undertaken.

  .  The Robertson Stephens opinion was prepared for the benefit and use of the
     Illuminet board of directors in its consideration of the merger and does
     not constitute a recommendation to stockholders of Illuminet as to how
     they should vote at the special meeting, or take any other action, in
     connection with the merger.

  .  The Robertson Stephens opinion does not address the relative merits of the
     merger and any other transactions or business strategies discussed by the
     Illuminet board of directors as alternatives to the merger agreement or
     the underlying business decision of the Illuminet board of directors to
     proceed with or effect the merger.

   Although developments following the date of the Robertson Stephens opinion
may affect the opinion, Robertson Stephens assumed no obligation to update,
revise or reaffirm its opinion. The Robertson Stephens opinion is necessarily

VeriSign) or publicly available and neither attempted independently to verify,
nor assumed responsibility for verifying, any of such information. Robertson

     estimates and judgments of the managements of Illuminet and VeriSign,
     respectively, as to the future financial condition and performance of
     Illuminet and VeriSign, respectively; and

  .  such estimates and forecasts will be realized in the amounts and in the
     periods currently estimated.

   In addition, Robertson Stephens assumed that:

  .  the merger will be consummated upon the terms set forth in the merger
     agreement dated September 23, 2001 without material alteration thereof,

     "purchase method" business combination in accordance with United States
     generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and that the merger
     will be treated as a tax free reorganization pursuant to the Internal
     Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and

performed by Robertson Stephens. Certain information in this section is
presented in tabular form.

STEPHENS, THESE TABLES MUST BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE TEXT OF EACH SUMMARY. THE
ROBERTSON STEPHENS OPINION IS BASED ON THE TOTALITY OF THE VARIOUS ANALYSES
THAT IT PERFORMED, AND NO PARTICULAR PORTION OF THE ANALYSIS HAS ANY MERIT
STANDING ALONE.

  Exchange Ratio Analysis

   Robertson Stephens reviewed the ratios of the closing prices of Illuminet
common stock to the corresponding closing prices of VeriSign common stock over
various periods from September 21, 2000 through September 21, 2001. Robertson
Stephens examined the premiums represented by the Exchange Ratio over the
averages of these implied exchange ratios over various periods:

  Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis

   Robertson Stephens analyzed the aggregate value and implied transaction
value multiples paid or proposed to be paid in selected precedent transactions
including:

  .  Geneva Technology Ltd./Convergys Corp.

  .  InvoiceLink Corp./BCE Emergis Inc.

  .  National Telemanagement Corp./Illuminet Holdings Inc.

  .  Network Solutions Inc./VeriSign, Inc.

  .  Solect Technology Group, Inc./Amdocs Ltd.

  .  TransPoint LLC/CheckFree Corp.

  .  Signio Inc./VeriSign, Inc.

  .  Transaction Network Services, Inc./PSINet Inc.

  .  Brite Voice Systems, Inc./InterVoice Inc.

  .  IEX Corp./Tekelec

   Robertson Stephens compared, among other things, the aggregate values in
these transactions as a multiple of the preceding twelve months', or LTM,
actual revenues and the following twelve months', or NTM, publicly-available
research estimates for revenues. Applying these multiples to similar revenue
figures for Illuminet resulted in the following range of implied equity values
and implied exchange ratios. Robertson Stephens also applied the premium paid
to the share price of the target the day prior to and one month prior to the
announcement of these transactions to the share price of Illuminet the day
prior to and one month prior to the announcement of the merger, which resulted
in the following implied equity values and implied exchange ratios. LTM and/or
NTM earnings data was either not publicly available or was negative/not
applicable for a number of the target companies represented in the selected
precedent transactions and therefore was not considered an appropriate metric.

                                                                      Implied

   No company, transaction or business used in the Comparable Company Analysis
or the Selected Precedent Transaction Analysis as a comparison is identical to
Illuminet or the merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the
foregoing is not entirely mathematical; rather it involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public
trading and other values of the comparable companies or the business segment,
company or transactions to which they are compared.

  Contribution Analysis

   Robertson Stephens analyzed the respective contributions of Illuminet and
VeriSign to the publicly-available research estimates for revenues, earnings
before interest and taxes, or EBIT, and earnings of the combined company
(without consideration of any synergies) for calendar years 2002, 2003 and
2004, as supplemented by discussions with the respective managements of
Illuminet and VeriSign as to growth and margin assumptions. The actual results
achieved by the combined company may vary from projected results and the
variations may be material.

   The contribution analysis for calendar years 2002, 2003 and 2004 resulted in
the following implied exchange ratios and implied equity values:

                               Suggested Pro-Forma Ownership

  Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

   Robertson Stephens performed a discounted cash flow analysis using
publicly-available research analyst estimates as supplemented by assumptions as
to long-term revenue growth rates and operating margins, based on discussions
with the management of Illuminet, of Illuminet's unlevered free cash flows and
publicly-available research analyst estimates of VeriSign's unlevered free cash
flows, assuming that both Illuminet and VeriSign were to continue to operate on
a stand-alone basis and without giving effect to the merger. Robertson Stephens
calculated the discounted cash flow using discount rates ranging from 15.0% to
17.0% for Illuminet, and discount rates ranging from 22.0% to 24.0% for
VeriSign. The discounted cash flow was comprised of the sum of the present
values of the projected unlevered free cash flows for calendar years 2002
through 2006, and the assumed future 2006 exit value based upon assumed
multiples of 2007 net income ranging from 16.0x to 21.0x for Illuminet and
27.5x to 33.5x for VeriSign.

   This analysis implies a range of Illuminet equity values of $1,019 million
to $1,083 million, with the corresponding implied exchange ratios ranging from
0.75x to 0.80x.

  Other Factors

   While this summary describes the analyses and factors that Robertson
Stephens deemed material in its presentation to the Illuminet board of
directors, it is not a comprehensive description of all analyses and factors
considered by Robertson Stephens. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a
complex process that involves various determinations as to the most appropriate
and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of these methods
to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, Robertson Stephens did not attribute any particular weight to any
analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments as
to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly,
Robertson Stephens believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and
that selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors considered by it,
without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying its opinion. Several
analytical methodologies were employed and no one method of analysis should be
regarded as critical to the overall conclusion reached by Robertson Stephens.
Each analytical technique has inherent strengths and weaknesses, and the nature
of the available information may further affect the value of particular
techniques. The conclusion reached by Robertson Stephens is based on all
analyses and factors taken

as a whole and also on application of Robertson Stephens' own experience and
judgment. This conclusion may involve significant elements of subjective
judgment and qualitative analysis. Robertson Stephens gives no opinion as to
the value or merit standing alone of any one or more parts of the analyses it
performed. In performing its analyses, Robertson Stephens made numerous
assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and other
conditions and matters, many of which are beyond the control of Illuminet or
Robertson Stephens. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not
necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or
values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested
by these analyses. Accordingly, analyses relating to the value of businesses do
not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which these businesses
actually may be sold in the future, and these estimates are inherently subject
to uncertainty. Furthermore, no opinion is being expressed as to the prices at
which shares of VeriSign common stock may be traded at any future time.

   Illuminet's engagement letter with Robertson Stephens provides that, for its
services, Robertson Stephens is entitled to receive a fee for delivering its
opinion, whether or not the opinion is favorable, as well as an additional fee
for its financial advisory and investment banking services contingent upon
consummation of the merger. Illuminet has also agreed to reimburse Robertson
Stephens for its out-of-pocket expenses and to indemnify and hold harmless
Robertson Stephens and its affiliates and any other person, director, employee
or agent of Robertson Stephens or any of its affiliates, or any person
controlling Robertson Stephens or its affiliates, for certain losses, claims,
damages, expenses and liabilities relating to or arising out of services
provided by Robertson Stephens as financial advisor to Illuminet. The terms of
the fee arrangements with Robertson Stephens, which Illuminet and Robertson
Stephens believe are customary in transactions of this nature, were negotiated
at arm's length between Illuminet and Robertson Stephens, and the Illuminet
board of directors was aware of these fee arrangements.

   Robertson Stephens was retained based on Robertson Stephens' experience as a
financial advisor in connection with mergers and acquisitions and in securities
valuations generally, as well as Robertson Stephens' investment banking
relationship and familiarity with Illuminet. Robertson Stephens has provided
financial advisory services to Illuminet from time to time. In the ordinary
course of business, Robertson Stephens may actively trade the securities of
Illuminet and VeriSign for its own account and for the account of its customers
and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in these
securities.

   Robertson Stephens is an internationally recognized investment banking firm.
As part of its investment banking business, Robertson Stephens is frequently
engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of
securities, private placements and other purposes.

Interests of certain persons in the merger

   When considering the recommendations of Illuminet's boards of directors, you
should be aware that some of the Illuminet directors and officers have
interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, yours
as stockholders. These interests include:

  .  Roger Moore, who is the chief executive officer and a director of
     Illuminet, will become a member of the VeriSign board of directors;

  .  Directors and officers of Illuminet are entitled to specified
     indemnification rights, as described in "The Merger
     Agreement--Indemnification of Illuminet Directors and Officers" on page
     53; and

  .  Some executive officers of Illuminet will become employees of VeriSign.

   As a result, these executive officers and directors could be more likely to
vote to approve, and recommend the approval of, the merger agreement and the
merger, than if they did not hold these interests.

Completion and effectiveness of the merger

   The merger will be completed when all of the conditions to completion of the
merger are satisfied or waived, including approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and approval of the merger by the stockholders of Illuminet. The
merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with
the State of Delaware.

Structure of the merger and conversion of Illuminet common stock and stock
options

   Illinois Acquisition Corporation, a newly formed and wholly owned subsidiary
of VeriSign, will be merged with and into Illuminet. As a result of the merger,
the separate corporate existence of Illinois Acquisition Corporation will cease
and Illuminet will survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of VeriSign.

   Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding share of Illuminet common
stock, other than shares held by VeriSign and its subsidiaries and Illuminet
and its subsidiaries, will be converted into the right to receive 0.93 shares
of fully paid and nonassessable VeriSign common stock. Upon completion of the
merger, each outstanding option to purchase Illuminet common stock will be
converted into an option to purchase the number of shares of VeriSign common
stock equal to 0.93 times the number of shares of Illuminet common stock that
could have been obtained before the merger upon the exercise of the option and
the exercise price will be adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio. The number
of shares of VeriSign common stock issuable in the merger will be
proportionately adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend or similar event
with respect to VeriSign common stock or Illuminet common stock effected
between the date of the merger agreement and the completion of the merger.

   No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of VeriSign common
stock will be issued in connection with the merger. Instead, Illuminet's
stockholders will receive cash, without interest, in lieu of a fraction of a
share of VeriSign common stock.

Exchange of Illuminet stock certificates for VeriSign stock certificates

   When the merger is completed, VeriSign's exchange agent will mail to
Illuminet stockholders a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in
surrendering Illuminet stock certificates in exchange for VeriSign stock
certificates. When you deliver your Illuminet stock certificates to the
exchange agent along with an executed letter of transmittal and any other
required documents, your Illuminet stock certificates will be canceled and you
will receive VeriSign stock certificates representing the number of full shares
of VeriSign common stock to which you are entitled under the merger agreement.
You will also receive payment in cash, without interest, in lieu of any
fractional shares of VeriSign common stock that would have been otherwise
issuable to you in the merger.

   You should not submit your Illuminet stock certificates for exchange unless
and until you receive the transmittal instructions and a form of letter of
transmittal from the exchange agent.

   Illuminet stockholders are not entitled to receive any dividends or other
distributions on VeriSign common stock until the merger is completed and they
have surrendered their Illuminet stock certificates in exchange for VeriSign
stock certificates. In addition, VeriSign does not anticipate paying any
dividends with respect to its stock.

   VeriSign will only issue Illuminet stockholders a VeriSign stock certificate
or a check in lieu of a fractional share in a name in which the surrendered
Illuminet stock certificate is registered. If you wish to have your certificate
issued in another name you must present the exchange agent with all documents
required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership and show that
you paid any applicable stock transfer taxes.

Material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger

   The following discussion summarizes the material United States federal
income tax consequences of the merger. This discussion is based on the Internal
Revenue Code, the related regulations promulgated thereunder, existing
administrative interpretations and court decisions, all of which are subject to
change, possibly with

retroactive effect. This discussion assumes that Illuminet stockholders hold
their shares of Illuminet common stock as capital assets within the meaning of
section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code. This discussion does not address all
aspects of United States federal income taxation that may be important to you
in light of your particular circumstances or if you are subject to special
rules. These special rules include rules relating to:

  .  stockholders who are not citizens or residents of the United States;

  .  financial institutions;

  .  tax-exempt organizations;

  .  insurance companies;

  .  dealers in securities;

  .  stockholders who acquired their shares of Illuminet common stock through
     the exercise of options or similar derivative securities or otherwise as
     compensation; or

  .  stockholders who hold their shares of Illuminet common stock as part of a
     straddle, conversion or other integrated transaction.

   Illuminet's obligations to complete the merger are conditioned on the
delivery of an opinion to Illuminet from Blackwell Sanders Peper Martin, LLP
regarding the qualification of the merger as a reorganization within the
meaning of section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and that each of
VeriSign and Illuminet will be a party to the reorganization within the meaning
of section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

   VeriSign and Illuminet believe, based on the advice of counsel, that the
merger will have the United States federal income tax consequences discussed
below. The opinion of counsel referred to above (1) will assume the absence of
changes in existing facts and (2) will rely on assumptions, representations and
covenants including those contained in certificates executed by officers of
VeriSign and Illuminet. The opinion referred to above neither binds the IRS nor
precludes the IRS from adopting a position contrary to that expressed in the
opinions, and no assurance can be given that contrary positions will not be
successfully asserted by the IRS or adopted by a court if the positions were
litigated. Neither VeriSign nor Illuminet intends to obtain a ruling from the
IRS with respect to the tax consequences of the merger.

   Tax consequences to Illuminet stockholders. Except as discussed below,
current stockholders of Illuminet will not recognize gain or loss for United
States federal income tax purposes on the exchange of Illuminet common stock
for VeriSign common stock in the merger. The aggregate tax basis of the
VeriSign common stock received as a result of the merger will be the same as
the aggregate tax basis in the Illuminet common stock surrendered in the
exchange, reduced by the tax basis of any fractional shares of VeriSign common
stock for which cash is received. The holding period of the VeriSign common
stock received as a result of the exchange will include the period during which
the Illuminet common stock exchanged in the merger was held. Illuminet
stockholders will recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax
purposes with respect to the cash they receive instead of a fractional share
interest in VeriSign common stock. The gain or loss will be measured by the
difference between the amount of cash they receive and the portion of the tax
basis of their shares of Illuminet common stock allocable to the shares of
Illuminet common stock exchanged for the fractional share interest. This gain
or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be a long-term capital gain or
loss if the shares of Illuminet common stock have been held for more than one
year at the time the merger is completed.

   Tax consequences to VeriSign and Illuminet. VeriSign, including its merger
subsidiary, and Illuminet will not recognize gain or loss for United States
federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger.

   This discussion is only intended to provide you with a general summary, and
it is not intended to be a complete analysis or description of all potential
United States federal income tax consequences of the merger. In addition, this
discussion does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or are
contingent on, your individual circumstances. Moreover, this discussion does
not address any non-income

tax or any foreign, state or local tax consequences of the merger. Accordingly,
you are strongly urged to consult with your tax advisor to determine the
particular United States federal, state, local or foreign income or other tax
consequences to you of the merger.

Accounting treatment of the merger

   In July 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued
Statements No. 141, "Business Combinations," or Statement 141, and No. 142,
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," or Statement 142. Under the
transitional provisions of Statement No. 141, business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001 are required to be accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting. Additionally, although the methodology for determining the
purchase price, or the aggregate merger consideration, is largely unchanged,
the methodology for allocating the purchase price to certain intangible assets
has changed. The allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and
goodwill will still be based on the fair value of the assets and liabilities
assumed. These allocations will be made based upon valuations and other studies
that have not yet been finalized.

   Statement 142 will require that goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for
impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of Statement
142. Statement 142 will also require that intangible assets with estimable
useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their
estimated residual values, and reviewed for Impairment in accordance with FASB
Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed of."

Regulatory filings and approvals required to complete the merger

   The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act, which prevents certain transactions from being completed
until required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and the
appropriate waiting periods end or expire. We are filing the required
information and materials with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission. The requirements of Hart-Scott-Rodino will be satisfied if the
merger is completed within one year from the termination of the waiting period.

   The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade
Commission may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds either before or after
expiration of the waiting period. Accordingly, at any time before or after the
completion of the merger, either the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice or the Federal Trade Commission could take action under the antitrust
laws. Certain other persons could take action under the antitrust laws,
including seeking to enjoin the merger. Additionally, at any time before or
after the completion of the merger, notwithstanding that the applicable waiting
period expired or ended, any state could take action under the antitrust laws.
A challenge to the merger could be made and if a challenge is made we may not
prevail.

   The merger contemplates the transfer of control of the FCC authorization
held by Illuminet's subsidiary, NTC, and the radio license used internally by
Illuminet. These transfers are subject to the prior approval of the FCC.
Neither of us is aware of any other material governmental or regulatory
approval required for completion of the merger, other than the effectiveness of
the registration statement of which this prospectus/proxy statement is a part,
and compliance with applicable corporate law of Delaware.

Restrictions on sales of shares by affiliates of Illuminet and VeriSign

   The shares of VeriSign common stock to be issued in the merger will be
registered under the Securities Act. These shares will be freely transferable
under the Securities Act, except for shares of VeriSign common stock issued to
any person who is an affiliate of either of us. Persons who may be deemed to be
affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or
are under common control of either of us and may

include some of our officers and directors, as well as our principal
stockholders. Affiliates may not sell their shares of VeriSign common stock
acquired in the merger except pursuant to (1) an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of those shares, (2) an
exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act or (3) any
other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

Listing on the Nasdaq National Market of VeriSign common stock to be issued in
the merger

   It is a condition to the closing of the merger that the shares of VeriSign
common stock to be issued in the merger be approved for listing on the Nasdaq
National Market, subject to official notice of issuance.

Delisting and deregistration of Illuminet common stock after the merger

   If the merger is completed, Illuminet common stock will be delisted from the
Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange
Act.

                             THE MERGER AGREEMENT

   This section of the document describes the merger agreement. While we
believe that the description covers the material terms of the merger agreement,
this summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you.
The merger agreement is attached to this document as Annex A and we urge you to
carefully read this document in its entirety.

The merger

   The merger agreement provides for the merger to be effected through the
merger of Illinois Acquisition Corporation, a newly formed and wholly owned
subsidiary of VeriSign, with and into Illuminet. As a result of the merger, the
separate corporate existence of Illinois will cease and Illuminet will survive
the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of VeriSign.

   Upon completion of the merger, Illuminet stockholders will become VeriSign
stockholders, and each outstanding share of Illuminet common stock, other than
shares held by Illuminet and its subsidiaries, will be converted into the right
to receive 0.93 shares of fully paid and nonassessable VeriSign common stock.
VeriSign also will assume each outstanding option to purchase Illuminet common
stock and convert it into an option to purchase shares of VeriSign common
stock. The merger is expected to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the
IRC, and Illuminet stockholders will recognize no gain or loss, and pay no tax,
on their receipt of VeriSign shares.

Conduct of Illuminet's business before the closing of the merger

   Illuminet has agreed that until the closing of the merger, or unless
VeriSign consents in writing, it and its subsidiaries will carry on their

   The agreements related to the conduct of Illuminet's business in the merger
agreement are complicated and not easily summarized. We urge you to read the
sections of the merger agreement entitled "Conduct Prior to the Effective Time"
carefully.

No Dividends by VeriSign

   VeriSign has also agreed that until the closing of the merger, or unless
Illuminet consents in writing, VeriSign will not declare or pay dividends or
make other distributions with respect to its capital stock or split, combine or
reclassify any of its capital stock.

No other negotiations

   Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated,
Illuminet has agreed not to take any of the following actions directly or
indirectly:

  .  solicit, initiate, seek, entertain, encourage, facilitate, support or
     induce any Acquisition Proposal, as defined below;

  .  participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
     Proposal;

  .  furnish any non-public information with respect to any Acquisition
     Proposal;

  .  take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
     Acquisition Proposal;

  .  engage in discussions with any person with respect to any Acquisition
     Proposal;

  .  approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or

  .  enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract,
     agreement or commitment relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

   However, if Illuminet receives an unsolicited, written, bona fide
Acquisition Proposal prior to its stockholders' meeting that its board
reasonably concludes after consultation with its financial advisor may
constitute a Superior Offer, as defined below, Illuminet may furnish non-public
information regarding it and may enter into discussions with the person or
group who has made that Acquisition Proposal, if:

  .  neither Illuminet nor its representatives shall have violated the
     provisions relating to any other negotiations;

  .  Illuminet's board of directors concludes in good faith after consultation
     with outside legal counsel that this action is required for the board of
     directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations to its stockholders
     under applicable law;

  .  prior to furnishing non-public information to, or entering into any
     discussions with, a party making the Acquisition Proposal, Illuminet gives
     VeriSign written notice of the Acquisition Proposal, including the

     identity of the party making the Acquisition Proposal and the material
     terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal;

  .  Illuminet furnishes the non-public information to VeriSign at the same
     time that Illuminet furnishes this information to the party making the
     Acquisition Proposal and the information furnished to the other party is
     subject to an agreement requiring the confidential treatment of that
     information; and

  .  Illuminet gives VeriSign at least three business days' advance notice of
     its intent to furnish non-public information to or enter into discussions.

   Illuminet has agreed to inform VeriSign promptly as to any Acquisition
Proposal, request for non-public information that Illuminet reasonably believes
would lead to an Acquisition Proposal or inquiry that Illuminet reasonably
should believe would lead to an Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the party
making the Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the material terms of
the Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. Illuminet also has agreed to keep
VeriSign informed as to the status of any Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry and to provide VeriSign a copy of all written materials provided to
Illuminet in connection with any request or inquiry.

   An Acquisition Proposal is any offer or proposal by a third party relating
to:

  .  the acquisition or purchase of more than a 20% interest in the total
     outstanding voting securities of Illuminet or any of its subsidiaries;

  .  any tender offer or exchange offer, that, if consummated, would result in
     any person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of the total
     outstanding voting securities of Illuminet or any of its subsidiaries;

  .  any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
     involving Illuminet under which stockholders of Illuminet immediately
     prior to the acquisition hold less than 80% of the equity interest in the
     resulting entity;

  .  any sale, lease outside the ordinary course of business, exchange,
     transfer, license outside the ordinary course of business, or acquisition
     or disposition of any material portion of the assets of Illuminet; or

  .  any liquidation or dissolution of Illuminet.

   A Superior Offer with respect to Illuminet is an unsolicited, bona fide
written proposal made by a third party to complete any of the following
transactions:

  .  a merger or consolidation involving Illuminet under which the stockholders
     of Illuminet immediately preceding the transaction hold less than 50% of
     the equity interest in the surviving entity of the transaction; or

  .  the acquisition by any person or group, including by way of a tender offer
     or an exchange offer or a two step transaction involving a tender offer
     followed with reasonable promptness by a merger involving the company,
     directly or indirectly, of ownership of 100% of the then outstanding
     shares of capital stock of Illuminet

on terms that the board of Illuminet determines, in its reasonable judgment,
after consultation with its financial advisor, to be more favorable to
Illuminet's stockholders from a financial point of view than the terms of the
merger. An offer will not be a Superior Offer if any financing required to
complete the transaction is not committed or is not likely in the reasonable
judgment of Illuminet's board of directors, after consultation with its
financial advisor, to be obtained on a timely basis.

   Illuminet's board may, without breaching the merger agreement, withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor of the merger proposal
if:

  .  a Superior Offer is made to Illuminet and is not withdrawn;

  .  Illuminet provides written notice to VeriSign, including the identity of
     the party making the Superior Offer and specifying the material terms and
     conditions of the Superior Offer;

  .  VeriSign does not, within five business days after receiving this written
     notice, make an offer that the board of Illuminet determines by majority
     vote in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its financial
     advisor, to be at least as favorable to Illuminet's stockholders as the
     Superior Offer;

  .  Illuminet's board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
     outside legal counsel, that the withholding, withdrawal, amendment or
     modification of its recommendation is required for the board to comply
     with its fiduciary obligations to Illuminet's stockholders under
     applicable law; and

  .  Illuminet has not violated specified provisions in the merger agreement.

   Illuminet also agreed to provide VeriSign with prior notice of any meeting
of its board at which Illuminet's board is reasonably expected to consider any
Acquisition Proposal to determine whether it is a Superior Offer. Even if the
board's recommendation is withheld, withdrawn, amended or modified, Illuminet
must nevertheless hold and convene the stockholders meeting.

Public disclosure

   Each of us will consult with the other and, to the extent practicable, agree
before issuing any press release or making any public statement with respect to
the merger, the merger agreement, or any Acquisition Proposal.

Employee benefit plans

   VeriSign and Illuminet will work together to agree upon mutually acceptable
employee benefit and compensation arrangements. Illuminet will terminate its
severance, separation, retention and salary continuation plans, programs or
arrangements prior to the effective time of the merger, subject to specified
exceptions. The merger agreement also provides that Illuminet employees will
also be granted credit for service with Illuminet for purposes of VeriSign
employment plans for which they are eligible.

Treatment of Illuminet stock options

   Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase Illuminet
common stock will be converted, in accordance with its terms, into an option to
purchase the number of shares of VeriSign common stock equal to 0.93 times the
number of shares of Illuminet common stock that could have been obtained before
the merger upon the exercise of each option, rounded down to the nearest whole
share. The exercise price will be equal to the exercise price per share of
Illuminet common stock subject to the option before conversion divided by 0.93,
rounded to the nearest whole cent.

   The other terms of each option referred to above will continue to have
substantially the same terms and conditions that the options had prior to the
merger. The vesting of outstanding options under Illuminet's option plans will
accelerate in full upon approval of the merger by the stockholders of
Illuminet. Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding award, including
restricted stock, stock equivalents and stock units, under any employee
incentive or benefit plans, programs or arrangements maintained by Illuminet
which provide for grants of equity-based awards will be amended or converted
into a similar instrument of VeriSign, with certain adjustments to preserve
their value. The other terms of each Illuminet award, and the plans or
agreements under which they were issued, will continue to apply in accordance
with their terms, including any provisions providing for acceleration.

   VeriSign will file a registration statement on Form S-8 for the shares of
VeriSign common stock issuable with respect to converted Illuminet options and
will maintain the effectiveness of that registration statement on a basis
comparable to registration statements applicable to other outstanding stock
options of VeriSign.

Indemnification of Illuminet Directors and Officers

   After the merger, VeriSign will honor indemnification agreements between
Illuminet and its directors and officers in effect at the time of the merger
and will substantially maintain the indemnification provisions of Illuminet's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect at the time of the merger
agreement for a period of six years following the merger. For six years
following the merger, VeriSign will maintain liability insurance for
Illuminet's directors and officers on terms comparable to that provided by
Illuminet to its directors and officers, subject to a maximum expense of two
times the amount paid by Illuminet for such coverage.

  .  all material required approvals or consents of any governmental entity or
     other person shall have been obtained and become final, including the FCC

     the ownership or operations of business by VeriSign; and

  .  there shall not be instituted or pending any action or proceeding by a
     governmental entity seeking to:

    .  restrain or prohibit the ownership or operation by VeriSign of all or
       any portion of Illuminet's business or for VeriSign to dispose of any

       full ownership rights of the Illuminet stock it acquires; or

    .  seeking to require VeriSign to divest the assets or shares of Illuminet

inaccuracy, circumstance or effect that is, or is reasonably likely to be,
materially adverse to (1) the business, assets, capitalization, regulatory
environment, financial condition, operations or results of operations of the
company taken as a whole with its subsidiaries or (2) the ability of the
parties to consummate the merger within the time frame the merger would
otherwise be consummated. A material adverse effect does not include a change,
event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect that directly and
primarily results from:

  .  changes in general economic conditions so long as the change does not
     affect the company in a disproportionate manner;

  .  changes affecting the company's industry generally, so long as the change
     does not affect the company in a disproportionate manner; or

  .  changes in the market price of VeriSign or Illuminet common stock.

Termination of the merger agreement

   The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to closing the
merger, whether before or after the requisite stockholder approval:

  .  by mutual consent duly authorized by the boards of VeriSign and Illuminet;

  .  by either VeriSign or Illuminet, if the merger is not completed by
     September 30, 2002, except that the right to terminate the merger
     agreement under this provision is not available to any party whose action
     or failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure
     of the merger to occur on or by September 30, 2002, and this action or
     failure to act constitutes a breach of the merger agreement;

  .  by VeriSign or Illuminet, if a governmental authority has issued an order,
     decree or ruling or taken any other action that is final and
     nonappealable, having the effect of permanently enjoining, restraining or
     prohibiting the merger;

  .  by VeriSign or Illuminet, if the merger is not approved by the
     stockholders of Illuminet, except that the right to terminate the merger
     agreement under this provision is not available to Illuminet where the
     failure to obtain stockholder approval was caused by an action or failure
     to act by Illuminet that constitutes a breach of the merger agreement, or
     a breach of the voting agreements described under "Related
     Agreements--Voting Agreement";

  .  by VeriSign at any time prior to the adoption and approval of the merger
     agreement and the merger by the required vote of stockholders of
     Illuminet, if a Triggering Event, as described below, occurs; or

  .  by Illuminet, on the one hand, or VeriSign, on the other, upon a breach of
     any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the
     other in the merger agreement, or if any of the other's representations or
     warranties are or become untrue, so that the corresponding condition to
     closing the applicable merger would not be met. However, if the breach or
     inaccuracy is curable by the breaching party through the exercise of its
     commercially reasonable efforts, and the breaching party continues to
     exercise commercially reasonable efforts, then the other may not terminate
     the merger agreement if the breach or inaccuracy is cured within 30 days
     after delivery of the notice of breach or inaccuracy.

   A Triggering Event will occur if:

  .  Illuminet's board of directors or any committee withdraws or amends or
     modifies in a manner adverse to VeriSign its recommendation in favor of
     the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the approval of the
     merger;

  .  Illuminet fails to include in this prospectus/proxy statement the
     recommendation of its board of directors in favor of the adoption and
     approval of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger;

  .  Illuminet's board of directors fails to reaffirm its recommendation in
     favor of adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the approval of
     the merger within 10 business days after VeriSign requests in writing that
     this recommendation be reaffirmed at any time after the public
     announcement of an Acquisition Proposal;

  .  Illuminet's board of directors approves or publicly recommends any
     Acquisition Proposal;

  .  Illuminet enters into a letter of intent or agreement accepting an
     Acquisition Proposal;

  .  Illuminet shall have materially breached the non-solicitation provisions
     of the merger agreement or the provisions of the merger agreement relating
     to holding the Illuminet's stockholders meeting; or

  .  if a tender offer or exchange offer relating to the securities of
     Illuminet is commenced by a person or entity unaffiliated with VeriSign,
     and Illuminet does not send to its stockholders within 10 business days
     after the tender offer or exchange offer is first commenced a statement
     disclosing that Illuminet recommends rejection of the tender offer or
     exchange offer.

Termination fee

   Illuminet is obligated to pay VeriSign a termination fee equal to $45.5
million in immediately available funds if VeriSign terminates the merger
agreement at any time prior to approval of the merger by Illuminet's
stockholders because a Triggering Event has occurred.

   Illuminet is obligated to pay a termination fee equal to $45.5 million if:

  .  prior to termination of the merger agreement an Acquisition Proposal is
     publicly announced;

  .  if the merger agreement was terminated because:

    .  the merger fails to close by September 30, 2002;

    .  Illuminet or VeriSign terminates the merger agreement because the
       required approval of the merger by Illuminet's stockholders was not
       obtained; or

    .  VeriSign terminates the merger agreement due to a breach of a
       representation, warranty covenant or agreement of Illuminet; and

  .  within 18 months of the termination of the merger agreement, Illuminet
     completes an Acquisition or enters into an agreement providing for an
     Acquisition and that Acquisition is later completed with the person with
     whom the agreement was entered into, regardless of when the completion
     occurs, if Illuminet had entered into the agreement during the
     eighteen-month period.

   An Acquisition is any of the following:

  .  a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
     liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the company in
     which Illuminet's stockholders immediately preceding the transaction hold
     less than 50% of the aggregate equity interests in the surviving entity of
     the transaction;

  .  a sale or other disposition by Illuminet of assets representing in excess
     of 50% of the aggregate fair market value of its business immediately
     prior to the sale; or

  .  the acquisition by any person or group, including by way of a tender offer
     or an exchange offer or issuance by Illuminet, directly or indirectly, of
     beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares
     representing in excess of 50% of the voting power of the then outstanding
     shares of capital stock of Illuminet.

Amendment, extension and waiver of the merger agreement

   We may amend the merger agreement before closing the merger by execution of
a written instrument signed by each of us, provided that we comply with
applicable state law in amending the agreement. Either of us may extend the
other's time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts under
the merger agreement, waive any inaccuracies in the other's representations and
warranties and waive compliance by the other with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in the merger agreement.

                              RELATED AGREEMENTS

   This section of the prospectus/proxy statement describes agreements related
to the merger agreement including the stock option agreement and the voting
agreements. While we believe that these descriptions cover the material terms
of these agreements, these summaries may not contain all of the information
that is important to you. The stock option agreement is attached as Annex B,
and the form of voting agreement is attached as Annex C, and we urge you to
read them carefully.

The stock option agreement

   The stock option agreement grants VeriSign the right to buy up to a number
of shares of Illuminet common stock equal to 19.9% of the issued and
outstanding shares of Illuminet common stock as of the date, if any, after
which the option is exercisable and on which VeriSign delivers an exercise
notice to Illuminet, at an exercise price of $35.62 per share. Based on the
number of shares of Illuminet common stock outstanding on September 20, 2001,
the option would be exercisable for approximately 6,499,649 shares of Illuminet
common stock. VeriSign required Illuminet to grant this stock option as a
prerequisite to entering into the merger agreement.

   The option is intended to increase the likelihood that the merger will be
completed. Certain aspects of the stock option agreement may have the effect of
discouraging persons who might be interested in acquiring all or a significant
interest in Illuminet or its assets before completion of the merger. The option
is not currently exercisable.

   Until the option's termination, as described below, VeriSign may exercise
the option, in whole or part, and from time to time after any of the following:

  .  a triggering event, as described above on page 56, occurs;

  .  the board amends the Rights Agreement or takes any other action with
     regard to corporate laws impeding business combinations in connection with
     any acquisition proposal, as described above on page 52;

  .  the failure of Illuminet to convene its stockholders' meeting within 45
     days of the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this
     prospectus/proxy statement is a part;

  .  the public announcement of the acquisition by any person or group of more
     than 20% of the total outstanding voting securities of Illuminet or any of
     its subsidiaries;

  .  the public announcement of any tender offer or exchange offer that, if
     consummated, would result in any person or group owning 20% or more of the
     total outstanding voting securities of Illuminet or any of its
     subsidiaries;

  .  the public announcement of a bona fide proposal or offer by a person
     reasonably able to consummate a merger, consolidation, business
     combination, or other similar transaction after which, the Illuminet
     stockholders immediately before the merger or business combination will
     own less than 80% of the surviving entity's equity interests;

  .  a sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary
     course of business), acquisition or disposition of any material assets of
     Illuminet; or

  .  a solicitation of Illuminet's stockholders is commenced seeking to alter
     the composition of Illuminet's board.

   VeriSign is not required to terminate the merger agreement before exercising
the option.

   The option will terminate and will not be exercisable upon the earliest of
any of the following to occur:

  .  completion of the merger; or

  .  12 months following the termination of the merger agreement.

   The amount of profit that VeriSign may realize under the option, together
with any termination fee, is subject to a profit cap. This "profit cap" is
$65.0 million. If the sum of any termination fee received by VeriSign, plus all
proceeds received by VeriSign in connection with any sales or other
dispositions of the option or shares acquired upon exercise of the option, plus
any dividends received by VeriSign on its option shares, is greater than the
profit cap, then VeriSign must promptly remit the excess in cash to Illuminet.

   In addition, VeriSign may require Illuminet to repurchase the option if the
option becomes exercisable, for a purchase price for the remainder of the
unexercised option calculated by subtracting the exercise price of the option
from the higher of:

  .  the highest price paid by an acquiring person for an Illuminet share in
     the transaction triggering the exercisability of the option; or, if the
     transaction is a sale of Illuminet's assets, the sum of the total price
     paid for such assets plus the value of the remaining assets of Illuminet,
     divided by the number of Illuminet shares then outstanding; or

  .  the highest closing price of Illuminet common stock for the thirty trading
     days ending the trading day before the date of the VeriSign request;

and multiplying the difference by the number of shares of Illuminet common
stock that VeriSign could still acquire at that time under the option.

   The stock option agreement grants registration rights to VeriSign with
respect to the shares of Illuminet common stock represented by the option.

Voting Agreements

   VeriSign required the following Illuminet stockholders, officers and
directors Roger Moore, Theodore Berns, Jack Blumenstein, Terry Kremian, Richard
Lumpkin, David Nicol, James Strand and Greg Wilkinson to enter into voting
agreements. These voting agreements require these Illuminet stockholders to
vote all of the shares of Illuminet common stock beneficially owned by them in
favor of the merger and against any competing acquisition proposal or superior
offer, each as described above, and against any action or agreement that would
result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other
obligation of Illuminet under the merger agreement or of the stockholder under
his voting agreement. The voting agreements apply only to the exercise of
voting rights attaching to Illuminet shares and shall not limit the discretion
of any stockholder who is a director of Illuminet with respect to his duties as
a director of Illuminet.

   In addition, each Illuminet stockholder who is a party to a voting agreement
agreed not to sell the Illuminet stock and options owned, controlled or
acquired, either directly or indirectly, by that person until the termination
of the voting agreement or the record date for the Illuminet stockholders'
meeting.

   The Illuminet stockholders' voting agreements will terminate upon the
earliest to occur of the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with
its terms or the completion of the merger.

   As of the record date, the Illuminet stockholders who entered into voting
agreements collectively beneficially owned       shares of outstanding
Illuminet common stock, which represented approximately % of the outstanding
Illuminet common stock. None of the Illuminet stockholders who are parties to
the voting agreements were paid additional consideration in connection with
them.

               PROPOSAL TWO--ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

   If at the Illuminet special meeting on       , 2001, the number of shares of
Illuminet common stock present or represented and voting in favor of approval
of the merger is insufficient to approve the merger under Delaware law and
under Illuminet's certificate of incorporation, Illuminet management intends to
move to adjourn the special meeting in order to enable the Illuminet board of
directors to continue to solicit additional proxies in favor of the merger. In
that event, Illuminet will ask its stockholders to vote only upon the
adjournment proposal, and not the proposal regarding the approval and adoption
of the merger agreement and the merger.

   In this proposal, Illuminet is asking you to authorize the holder of any
proxy solicited by the Illuminet board of directors to vote in favor of
adjourning the special meeting, and any later adjournments, to a date or dates
not later than        , 2002, in order to enable the Illuminet board of
directors to solicit additional proxies in favor of the merger. If the
stockholders approve the adjournment proposal, Illuminet could adjourn the
special meeting, and any adjourned session of the special meeting, to a date
not later than       , 2002 and use the additional time to solicit additional
proxies in favor of the merger, including the solicitation of proxies from
stockholders that have previously voted against the merger. Among other things,
approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if Illuminet had
received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against the merger
to defeat the merger proposal, Illuminet could adjourn the special meeting
without a vote on the merger proposal for up to     days and seek during that
period to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes
in favor of the merger.

   Under Illuminet's certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the adjournment
proposal requires the approval of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal.
Broker non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the vote
on the adjournment proposal. No proxy that is specifically marked "AGAINST"
approval of the merger agreement will be voted in favor of the adjournment
proposal, unless it is specifically marked "FOR" the discretionary authority to
adjourn the special meeting to a later date.

   The board of directors believes that if the number of shares of Illuminet
common stock present or represented at the special meeting and voting in favor
of the merger is insufficient to approve the merger agreement, it is in the
best interests of the stockholders of Illuminet to enable the board, for a
limited period of time, to continue to seek to obtain a sufficient number of
additional votes in favor of the merger to bring about its approval.

   The board of directors of Illuminet believes that the terms of the
adjournment proposal are fair to and in the best interests of Illuminet and its
stockholders and recommends to its stockholders that they vote "FOR" the
proposal to authorize the adjournment of the special meeting to a date or dates
not later than       , 2002.

for each share of Illuminet common stock.

   VeriSign and Illuminet believe that Illuminet common stock presently trades
on the basis of the value of the VeriSign common stock expected to be issued in
exchange for the Illuminet common stock in the merger, discounted primarily for
the uncertainties associated with the merger. Apart from the publicly disclosed
information concerning VeriSign that is included and incorporated by reference
in this prospectus/proxy statement, VeriSign cannot state with certainty what
factors account for changes in the market price of the VeriSign common stock.

   Illuminet stockholders are advised to obtain current market quotations for
VeriSign common stock and Illuminet common stock. No assurance can be given as
to the market prices of VeriSign common stock or Illuminet common stock at any
time before the consummation of the merger or as to the market price of
VeriSign common stock at any time after the merger. Because the exchange ratio
is fixed, the exchange ratio will not be adjusted to compensate Illuminet
stockholders for decreases in the market price of VeriSign common stock that
could occur before the merger becomes effective. In the event the market price
of VeriSign common stock decreases or increases prior to the consummation of
the merger, the value of the VeriSign common stock to be received in the merger
in exchange for Illuminet common stock would correspondingly decrease or
increase.

   VeriSign and Illuminet have never paid cash dividends on their respective
shares of capital stock. Under the merger agreement, each of VeriSign and
Illuminet has agreed not to pay dividends pending the consummation of the
merger, without written consent of the other. If the merger is not consummated,
the Illuminet board presently intends that it would continue its policy of
retaining all earnings to finance the expansion of its business. The VeriSign
board presently intends to retain all earnings for use in its business and has
no present intention to pay cash dividends before or after the merger.

                      COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF
               VERISIGN COMMON STOCK AND ILLUMINET COMMON STOCK

   This section of the prospectus/proxy statement describes differences between
VeriSign common stock and Illuminet common stock. While we believe that the
description covers the material differences between the two, this summary may
not contain all of the information that is important to you, including the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws of each company. You should read this
entire document and the other documents we refer to carefully for a more
complete understanding of the differences between VeriSign common stock and
Illuminet common stock. You may obtain the information incorporated by
reference into this prospectus/proxy statement without charge by following the
instructions in the section entitled "Where you can find more information" on
page iii.

   After the merger, the holders of Illuminet common stock will become
stockholders of VeriSign. Because VeriSign and Illuminet are both Delaware
corporations, the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, will continue
to govern the rights of the stockholders. The Illuminet certificate of
incorporation and the Illuminet bylaws currently govern the rights of the
stockholders of Illuminet. As stockholders of VeriSign after the merger, the
VeriSign certificate of incorporation, and the VeriSign bylaws, will instead
govern their rights following the merger. The following paragraphs summarize
differences between the rights of VeriSign stockholders and Illuminet
stockholders under the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of VeriSign and
Illuminet, as applicable. The following discussion is qualified by the actual
provisions of each company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

Voting

   Each stockholder of Illuminet and VeriSign has the right to one vote for
each share of stock held by the stockholder.

Special meeting of stockholders

   The VeriSign bylaws provide that only a majority of the members of the board
of directors, chairman of the board or president may call special meetings of
the stockholders.

   The Illuminet bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may
be called by the chairman of the board, the president or the board of
directors, or by written demand of at least one-third of the stock entitled to
vote at the meeting.

Action by written consent in lieu of a stockholder's meeting

   VeriSign stockholders do not have the ability to take action by written
consent.

   Illuminet stockholders have the ability to take action by written consent of
the holders of outstanding shares of Illuminet so long as the action is signed
by the holders having the minimum number of shares to approve the action if the
action were taken at a meeting at which all outstanding shares of common stock
were present and voting.

Voting by written ballot

   Both the VeriSign and Illuminet certificates of incorporation contain
provisions not requiring written ballots for the election of directors. The
Illuminet bylaws provide that upon the demand of any stockholder, the vote for
directors shall be by ballot.

Record date for determining stockholders

   The VeriSign bylaws provide that the board of directors may fix a record
date that shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of
the stockholder meeting nor more than 60 days prior to any other action.

   The VeriSign bylaws provide that if the board of directors does not fix a
record date in the manner described above, then:

   (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to
       vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on
       the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice
       is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on
       which the meeting is held; and

   (2) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall
       be at the close of business on the same day on which the board of
       directors adopts the related resolution.

   The Illuminet bylaws provide that the board of directors may fix a record
date that shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of
the stockholder meeting nor more than 60 days prior to any other action.

Notice of board nomination and other stockholder business-annual meetings

   The VeriSign bylaws require that nominations of persons for election to the
board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered at an annual
meeting of stockholders must be generally made by the board of directors. If
made by a stockholder, the proposal or nomination must be made by advance
written notice given to VeriSign between 60 and 90 days prior to the first
anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders. However, if
the date of the annual meeting at which the nomination or business is proposed
by a stockholder is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after that
anniversary, then the notice may be given by the stockholder no earlier than
the 90th day prior to the meeting and not later than the later of 60 days prior
to the meeting or the 10th day following the first public announcement of the
meeting. These notice provisions are subject to certain exceptions with respect
to electing directors to fill board seats resulting from increases in the size
of the board of directors not publicly announced at least 70 days prior to the
annual meting. In addition, certain other information regarding the business
proposed for discussion must be included in the stockholder notice to VeriSign.

   The Illuminet bylaws require that annual meetings of stockholders for the
election of directors and for other business must be specified in the notice of
meeting given by or at the direction of the board, otherwise properly brought
before the meeting by or at the direction of the board. No business other than
that stated in the notice shall be transacted at any meeting without the
consent of the majority of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting.

Notice of board nomination and other stockholder business-special meetings

   The VeriSign bylaws provide that, at special meetings of stockholders, the
only business that can be conducted will be the items of business set forth in
the notice of the special meeting. The bylaws also provide that nominations of
candidates for directors at a special meeting at which directors are to be
elected shall be made (1) by the board of directors or (2) if the board of
directors has determined that directors will be elected at the meeting, by a
stockholder meeting certain qualifications who gives VeriSign advance written
notice of the nominations no earlier than 90 days prior to that special meeting
and no later than the later of (A) 60 days before the special meeting, or (B)
the 10th day after the first public announcement of the meeting and the
nominees proposed by the board of directors to be elected at the meeting.

   The Illuminet bylaws provide that the business that may be conducted at any
special meeting shall be confined to the purposes stated in the notice of the
special meeting.

Number of directors

   The VeriSign bylaws provide that the board of directors shall consist of not
fewer than six and not more than nine directors.

   The Illuminet bylaws provide that the board of directors shall consist of
not fewer than five and not more than sixteen directors.

Election of directors

   The holders of VeriSign common stock and Illuminet common stock elect all
members of the respective company's board of directors.

   The VeriSign certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for a staggered
board of directors divided into three classes with the term of office of the
first class, Class I, to expire at the annual meeting of the stockholders held
in 2004; the term of office of the second class, Class II, to expire at the
annual meeting of stockholders held in 2003; the term of office of the third
class, Class III, to expire at the annual meeting of stockholders held in 2002;
and after for each term to expire at each third succeeding annual meeting of
stockholders after the corresponding election.

   The Illuminet certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for a
staggered board of directors divided into three classes with the term of office
of the first class, Class I, to expire at the annual meeting of the
stockholders held in 2003; the term of office of the second class, Class II, to
expire at the annual meeting of stockholders held in 2004; the term of office
of the third class, Class III, to expire at the annual meeting of stockholders
held in 2002; and after for each term to expire at each third succeeding annual
meeting of stockholders after the corresponding election.

Removal of directors

   The VeriSign bylaws provide that any director or the entire board of
directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority
of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors of VeriSign.

   The Illuminet bylaws provide that any director or directors may be removed
from office only for cause and only by the vote of 80% of the voting power of
all the shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.

Board of directors vacancies

   The VeriSign bylaws provide that vacancies may be filled by the
stockholders, by a majority of the directors then in office or by a sole
remaining director. The Illuminet bylaws provide that vacancies may be filled
by a majority vote of the directors remaining in office.

Notice of special meetings of the board of directors

   The VeriSign bylaws provide that the chairman of the board, the president or
one-third of the directors then in office may call a special meeting of the
board of directors. The bylaws require that written notice of the time and
place of these meetings be given at least four days before the meeting if the
notice is mailed, or at least 48 hours before the meeting if notice is given by
hand, telegram, telecopy or telex, unless this notice requirement is waived in
writing by each member of the board of directors.

   The Illuminet bylaws provide that the chairman of the board, the president
or the secretary on the written request of any four directors may call a
special meeting of the board of directors. The bylaws require at least four
days' prior notice to each director. The meeting shall be held at such place or
places as may be determined by the board or as stated in the notice of the
meeting.

Board action-generally

   The VeriSign bylaws provide that, except as required by the DGCL, the vote
of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is
present or a written consent to action executed by all members of the board of
directors shall be the act of the board of directors of VeriSign.

   The Illuminet bylaws provide that, except as required by the DGCL, the vote
of majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present
or a written consent to action executed by all members of the board of
directors shall be the act of the board of directors of Illuminet.

Action by committees

   Both the VeriSign bylaws and the Illuminet bylaws authorize their respective
boards of directors to establish committees by resolution setting forth the
powers and duties of these committees.

Preferred stock

   Both the VeriSign and Illuminet certificates of incorporation authorize the
respective board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more
series and to fix the designations, preferences, powers and rights of the
shares to be included in each series. The VeriSign certificate of incorporation
reserves for issuance 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and the Illuminet
certificate of incorporation reserves for issuance 100,000 shares of preferred
stock.

Indemnification

   The VeriSign certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Illuminet
certificate of incorporation provide that its respective directors and officers
shall be indemnified to the full extent authorized by Delaware law against all
expenses, liabilities and losses reasonably incurred by that person in
connection with any action, proceeding or suit brought against that person by
reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of VeriSign
or Illuminet, as the case may be, or is or was serving at the request of
VeriSign or Illuminet, as the case may be, as a director or officer of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or similar entity. The VeriSign
bylaws and Illuminet bylaws require the respective corporations to pay all
expenses incurred by a director or officer in defending any proceeding within
the scope of the indemnification provisions as these expenses are incurred in
advance of its final disposition.

Limitation on liability

   Both the VeriSign certificate of incorporation and Illuminet certificate of
incorporation provide that a director of the respective corporation shall not
be personally liable to the respective corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for
liability (a) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the
Corporation and its stockholders; (b) for acts or omissions not in good faith
or which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violations of law; (c) under
section 174 of the DGCL; or (d) for any transaction from which the director
derived an improper personal benefit.

Interested directors

   The VeriSign bylaws require that in order for a transaction between VeriSign
and an interested director or officer not to be void or voidable solely for
this reason, there must be full disclosure of material facts as to the
interested director's relationship or interest to the transaction as well as
one of the following:

  .  approval by a majority of disinterested directors, even though the
     disinterested directors may be less than a quorum;

  .  approval by a good faith vote of the stockholders entitled to vote
     thereon; or

  .  the transaction must be fair to VeriSign as of the time it is authorized,
     approved or ratified by the board of directors, a committee thereof, or
     the stockholders.

   Because the Illuminet certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not contain
a provision expressly addressing interested director transactions, Illuminet is
subject to section 144 of the DGCL.

Dividends

   VeriSign and Illuminet stockholders are entitled to receive dividends,
subject to preferences of any outstanding preferred stock, out of assets
legally available for dividend distribution at times and in amounts as the
respective boards of directors may from time to time determine.

Liquidation

   In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of either VeriSign
or Illuminet, after payment of any amounts owed to creditors, subject to
preferences of any outstanding preferred stock, the remaining assets of
VeriSign or Illuminet will be divided equally, on a share for share basis, to
the holders of the common stock of VeriSign or Illuminet, respectively.

Amendment of bylaws

   The VeriSign bylaws provide that stockholders holding a majority of
VeriSign's outstanding voting stock may adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws. The
VeriSign certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that the board of
directors has the power to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws.

   The Illuminet bylaws provide that the bylaws may be amended at any meeting
of the stockholders or at a special meeting of the stockholders, by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding or by the
Board of Directors at any meeting of directors.

Delaware takeover statute

   Because the VeriSign and Illuminet certificates of incorporation and bylaws
do not contain a provision expressly electing for either company to not be
governed by section 203 of the DGCL, VeriSign and Illuminet are subject to the
Delaware takeover statute.

Stockholder rights plan

   VeriSign has not adopted a stockholders rights plan.

   Illuminet has a stockholder rights plan that would significantly discourage,
delay or prevent a merger or acquisition. The rights become exercisable if a
person or group acquires or makes a tender offer for more than 20% of Illuminet
outstanding common stock. Upon the occurrence of such an event, each right
entitles the holder, other than the acquiror, to purchase for $150 Illuminet
common stock or, in some instances, stock of the acquiring entity, that would
be worth $300. The rights expire on November 20, 2008, unless redeemed earlier
by Illuminet. This plan has been amended so as not to be triggered by the
merger.

                  SHARE OWNERSHIP BY PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS,
                     MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF ILLUMINET

   The following table lists information with respect to the beneficial
ownership of Illuminet's common stock as of September 30, 2001 by: (1) each
person known by Illuminet to beneficially own more than 5% of Illuminet's
outstanding common stock, (2) each of Illuminet's directors, (3) Illuminet's
four "most highly compensated" executive officers under SEC rules, and (4) all
of Illuminet's executive officers and directors as a group. Unless otherwise
indicated, the person or persons named have sole voting and investment power
and that person's address is c/o Illuminet, 4501 Intelco Loop, S.E., Lacey,
Washington 98503. In determining the number and percentage of shares
beneficially owned by each person, shares that may be acquired by that person
under options exercisable within 60 days of September 30, 2001 are deemed
beneficially owned by that person and are deemed outstanding for purposes of
determining the total number of outstanding shares for that person and are not
deemed outstanding for that purpose for all other stockholders.

                                                                      Shares Beneficially

Illuminet at its executive offices no later than November 26, 2001, and must

                         AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

   This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered
into as of September 23, 2001, among VeriSign, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Illinois Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned first-tier subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Illuminet
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company").

                                   RECITALS

   A. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and Company have
approved this Agreement, and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub with
and into Company (the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware ("Delaware Law").

   B. For United States federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to
qualify as a "reorganization" pursuant to the provisions of Section 368 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

   C. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and
inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain
stockholders of Company are entering into a Voting Agreement with Parent in the
form of Exhibit A (the "Voting Agreement").

   D. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and
inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, Parent and
Company are entering into a Stock Option Agreement in the form of Exhibit B
(the "Stock Option Agreement").

   In consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree as
follows:

                                   ARTICLE I
                                  THE MERGER

   1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Company, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

   1.2 Effective Time; Closing. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
certificate of merger, in such appropriate form as determined by the parties,
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the
relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the "Certificate of Merger") (the time of
such filing (or such later time as may be agreed in writing by Company and
Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the "Effective Time")
as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date. The closing of the Merger
(the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Fenwick & West LLP, located
at Two Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto, California, at a time and date to be
specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second business day
after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, or
at such other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing
(the "Closing Date").

   1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of

                                      A-1

vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

1.4 Certificateof Incorporation; Bylaws.

      (a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Company
   shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the
   Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
   to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware
   Law and as provided in such Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however,
   that at the Effective Time, Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of
   the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to
   read as follows: "The name of the corporation is "Illuminet Holdings, Inc."

      (b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Company shall be amended and
   restated in their entirety to be identical to the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as
   in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended
   in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such Bylaws.

   1.5 Directors and Officers. The initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed

Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of the
following securities:

   (a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Company, including each attached right ("Company
Right") issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated November 20, 1998
("Company Rights Agreement"), between Company and UMB Bank, N.A., as rights
agent ("Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled
pursuant to Section1.6(a), will be canceled and extinguished and automatically
converted (subject to Section1.6(d)) into the right to receive 0.93 (the
"Exchange Ratio") of a share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Parent ("Parent Common Stock") upon surrender of the certificate representing
such share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section1.7. No
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the
Merger, but in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made pursuant to
Section1.7(d). Company Common Stock that is Company Restricted Stock (as
defined in Section 1.9) shall be subject to the provisions of Section 1.9.

   (b) Cancellation of Company-Owned and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of
Company Common Stock held by Company or owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Company or of Parent immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof.

   (c) Stock Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plan. At the Effective Time, all
options to purchase Company Common Stock then outstanding under (i) Company's
1997 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Company Stock Option Plan") and (ii) the
option granted to Roger Moore shall be converted in accordance with Section5.7
of this Agreement. Rights outstanding under Company's 1999 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "Company ESPP") shall be treated as set forth in Section 5.7
of this Agreement.

   (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.00001 per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock"), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.00001
par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Following the Effective
Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub common
stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

                                      A-2

      (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted
   to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
   stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
   convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock),
   reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
   respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring on or after
   the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

   1.7 Exchange of Certificates.

      (a) Exchange Agent. Parent shall select an institution reasonably
   acceptable to Company to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in
   the Merger.

      (b) Exchange Fund. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall make
   available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article
   I, the shares of Parent Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common Stock,
   together with cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or
   distributions with respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the
   "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to Section 1.5 in exchange for
   outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

      (c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
   instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
   certificate or certificates ("Certificates") which immediately prior to the
   Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose
   shares were converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common
   Stock pursuant to Section 1.5, (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
   (that shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
   title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
   Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall contain such other provisions
   as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
   the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing
   shares of Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of Certificates for
   cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal,
   duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
   thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
   Exchange Agent, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to
   receive in exchange therefor certificates representing the number of whole
   shares of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all Certificates
   surrendered by such holder) into which such holder is entitled pursuant to
   Section 1.6(a)(which shall be in uncertificated book entry form unless a
   physical certificate is requested or required by applicable law or
   regulation), payment in lieu of fractional shares that such holders have the
   right to receive pursuant to Section1.7(d) and any dividends or
   distributions payable pursuant to Section1.7(c), and the Certificates so
   surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding
   Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all
   corporate purposes, to evidence only the ownership of the number of full
   shares of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Common Stock
   shall have been so converted and the right to receive an amount in cash in
   lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with
   Section1.7(d) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
   Section1.7(c). No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of
   fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or on any unpaid dividends or
   distributions payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer
   of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
   transfer records of Company, a certificate representing the proper number of
   shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the
   Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to
   the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
   effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer
   taxes have been paid.

      (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or
   other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with
   respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
   will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect
   to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holders
   of record of such Certificates shall surrender such Certificates. Subject to
   applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificates, the Exchange
   Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest, (i)
   promptly after such surrender, the amount of any cash payable with respect
   to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
   entitled pursuant to Section1.7(d) and the amount of dividends or other
   distributions with a record date

                                      A-3

   after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares
   of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount
   of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
   Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender,
   payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

      (e) Fractional Shares. (i) As promptly as practicable following the
   Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (A) the
   number of full shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent
   pursuant to Section1.7(a), over (B) the aggregate number of full shares of
   Parent Common Stock to be distributed to holders of Company Common Stock
   pursuant to Section1.7(b) (such excess, the "Excess Shares"). Following the
   Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of Company
   Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the
   Nasdaq Stock Market in the manner set forth in paragraph (ii) of this
   Section1.7(d).

          (ii) The sale of the excess shares by the Exchange Agent shall be
       executed on the Nasdaq Stock Market and shall be executed in round lots
       to the extent practicable. The Exchange Agent shall use all commercially
       reasonable efforts to complete the sale of the Excess Shares as promptly
       following the Effective Time as, in the Exchange Agent's reasonable
       judgment, is practicable consistent with obtaining the best execution of
       such sales in light of prevailing market conditions. Until the net
       proceeds of such sales have been distributed to the holders of Company
       Common Stock, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for
       the holders of Company Common Stock. The Exchange Agent will determine
       the portion of such net proceeds to which each holder of Company Common
       Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the
       aggregate net proceeds by a fraction the numerator of which is the
       amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of Company
       Common Stock is entitled (after aggregating all shares of Parent Common
       Stock to be issued to such holder) and the denominator of which is the
       aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of
       Company Common Stock are entitled. As soon as practicable after the
       determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
       Company Common Stock with respect to fractional share interests, the
       Exchange Agent shall promptly pay such amounts to such holders of
       Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of Section1.7(b).

          (iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (i) and (ii) of
       this Section1.7(d), Parent may decide, at its option, exercised prior to
       the Effective Time, in lieu of the issuance and sale of Excess Shares
       and the making of the payments contemplated in such paragraphs, that
       Parent shall pay to the Exchange Agent an amount sufficient for the
       Exchange Agent to pay each holder of Company Common Stock the amount
       such holder would have received pursuant to Section1.7(e)(ii) assuming
       that the sales of Parent Common Stock were made at a price equal to the
       average of the closing prices of the Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq
       Stock Market, regular session, for the ten consecutive trading days
       immediately following the Effective Time and, in such case, all
       references herein to the cash proceeds of the sale of the Excess Shares
       and similar references shall be deemed to mean and refer to the payments
       calculated as set forth in this paragraph(ii). In such event, Excess
       Shares shall not be issued or otherwise transferred to the Exchange
       Agent pursuant to Sections1.7(a) or (d).

      (f) Required Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the
   Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
   consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
   any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be
   required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any
   provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable
   Legal Requirement (as defined in Section 2.2(a)). To the extent such amounts
   are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
   under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts
   would otherwise have been paid.

      (g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any
   Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
   shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates,
   upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof,
   certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock into which the
   shares of Company Common Stock represented by such

                                      A-4

   Certificates were converted pursuant to Section 1.5, cash for fractional
   shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.7(d) and any
   dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(c); provided,
   however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
   the issuance of such certificates representing shares of Parent Common
   Stock, cash and other distributions, require the owner of such lost, stolen
   or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably
   direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the
   Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates
   alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

      (h) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
   Section 1.7, neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
   nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common
   Stock or Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public
   official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
   law.

      (i) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
   remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months
   after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
   holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with the
   provisions of this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only to Parent for the
   shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
   Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d)
   and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
   to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(c), in each case, without
   any interest thereon.

   1.8 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof (including any
cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section1.7(c) and (d)) shall be deemed
to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If
after the Effective Time Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in
this Article I.

   1.9 Restricted Stock. If any shares of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject
to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition providing that
such shares ("Company Restricted Stock") may be forfeited or repurchased by
Company upon any termination of the stockholders' employment, directorship or
other relationship with Company (and/or any affiliate of Company) under the
terms of any restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with
Company that does not by its terms provide that such repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition lapses upon consummation of the Merger, then the
shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the conversion of such shares of
Company Common Stock in the Merger will continue to be unvested and subject to
the same repurchase options, risks of forfeiture or other conditions following
the Effective Time, and the certificates representing such shares of Parent
Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends noting such
repurchase options, risks of forfeiture or other conditions. Company shall take
all actions that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective
Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right
set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement. A
listing of the holders of Company Restricted Stock, together with the number of
shares and the vesting schedule of Company Restricted Stock held by each, is
set forth in Part 1.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

   1.10 Tax Consequences. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger
shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States
Income Tax Regulations.

   1.11 Alternative Transaction Structure. The parties agree that Parent may
change the method of effecting the business combination with Company, including
by merging Company with an affiliate of Parent, and Company shall cooperate in
such efforts, including by entering into an appropriate amendment to this
Agreement

                                      A-5

(to the extent such amendment does not substantively affect this Agreement or
adversely affect the rights and obligations of Company or its stockholders);
provided however that such affiliate shall become a party to, and agree to be
bound by, the terms of this Agreement and that any action taken pursuant to
this Section 1.11 shall not (i) alter or change the kind or amount of
consideration to be issued to the holders of Company Common Stock as provided
for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the tax consequences of the
transaction to the holders of Company Common Stock, (iii) significantly delay
the receipt of any required regulatory approval or (iv) otherwise cause the
closing conditions in Article VI to not be capable of being fulfilled (unless
duly waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof).

   1.12 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of Company
and Merger Sub will take all such lawful and necessary action. Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to perform all of its obligations relating to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

   "HSR Act"), and the securities or antitrust laws of any foreign country,
   (iv) the filing of applications with the Federal Communications Commission
   for the authorization to transfer control of (x) the Section 214

   Employee Plan. Furthermore, no International Employee Plan has unfunded
   liabilities that, as of the Effective Time, will not be offset by insurance

   has been any material problem with the service Company or its subsidiaries
   provide to such Key Customers or that a Key Customer desires to amend,

   Customer Contract. No Contract with a Key Customer materially differs from
   Company's or subsidiaries' standard form contract for the applicable service

   network deficiency or condition of which Company or its subsidiaries have
   knowledge that could cause or result in any of the foregoing (collectively,
   a "Network Failure"), which have resulted, or could result, in (1) a
   material breach of any material Contract with a customer or other third
   party, (2) the payment of any penalties or (3) the issuance of any credits

   designed to prevent the reoccurrence of any Network Failure.

      (c) Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries has provided to its
   customers or any third parties, other than in the ordinary course of
   business and consistent with the terms of the standard form customer
   contract for such product or service in the form previously provided to
   Parent, (i) any warranties, representations, covenants or guarantees
   regarding products or services provided by Company or its subsidiaries,
   including any warranties, representations, covenants or guarantees regarding
   network or service availability, service levels, operability or
   non-interruption; (ii) any rights to obtain refunds or credits with respect
   to any product or service provided by Company or its subsidiaries; and (iii)
   any indemnities with respect to intellectual property infringement or the
   performance or availability of any product or service of Company or any of
   its subsidiaries.

   2.16 Brokers' and Finders' Fees. Except for fees payable to Robertson

has incurred, nor will they incur, directly or indirectly, any liability for
brokerage or finders' fees or agents' commissions or any similar charges in
connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby.

   2.17 Insurance. Part 2.17 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list
of all insurance policies and fidelity bonds carried by Company or any of its
subsidiaries. Such policies and bonds are written by insurers of recognized
financial responsibility against such risks and losses and in such amounts as

in Company's and its subsidiaries' businesses. There is no material claim
pending under any of such policies or bonds as to which coverage has been
questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies or bonds.
All premiums due and payable under all such policies have been paid and Company
and its subsidiaries are otherwise in compliance in all material respects with
the terms of such policies and bonds. To the knowledge of Company, there has
been no threatened termination of, or material premium increase with respect
to, any of such policies.

   2.18 Disclosure. The information supplied by Company for inclusion in the
Form S-4 (or any similar successor form thereto) Registration Statement to be
filed by Parent with the SEC in connection with the issuance of Parent Common
Stock in the Merger (the "Registration Statement") shall not at the time the
Registration Statement is filed with the SEC and at the time it becomes
effective under the Securities Act contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The information
supplied by Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the proxy
statement/prospectus to be filed with the SEC as part of the Registration
Statement (the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus") shall not, on the date the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is mailed to Company's stockholders, at the time of the
meeting of Company's stockholders (the "Company Stockholders' Meeting") to
consider the Company Stockholder Approvals, or as of the Effective Time,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or
misleading; or omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any
statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of
proxies for the Company Stockholders' Meeting which has become false or
misleading. The proxy statement included in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will
comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any event relating to Company or any of its affiliates, officers
or directors should be discovered by Company which is required to be set forth
in an amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, Company shall promptly inform Parent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to any
information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub that is contained in any of the
foregoing documents.

effect that, as of the date hereof, the consideration to be received by
Company's stockholders in the Merger is fair to Company's stockholders from a
financial point of view, and has delivered to Parent a copy of such opinion.

   2.21 DGCL Section 203 and Rights Agreement. The restrictions contained in
Section 203 of the Delaware Law applicable to a "business combination" (as
defined in such Section 203) are not applicable to the execution,

                                     A-21

delivery or performance of this Agreement or the Stock Option Agreement or to
the consummation of the Merger. To Company's knowledge, no other anti-takeover,
control share acquisition, fair price, moratorium or other similar statute or
regulation (each, a "Takeover Statute") applies or purports to apply to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. Company
has (i) duly authorized and executed an appropriate amendment to the Company
Rights Agreement which amendment has been provided to Parent and (ii) taken all
other action necessary or appropriate so that the entering into of this
Agreement, the Stock Option Agreement or the Voting Agreement, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including the
Merger) do not and will not result in Parent or Merger Sub being or becoming an
"Acquiring Person" thereunder or the ability of any person to exercise a
"Right" (as defined in the Company Rights Agreement) or enabling or requiring
Rights to separate from the shares of Company Common Stock to which they are
attached or to be triggered or become exercisable and the Company Rights
Agreement will expire immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the Company
Rights Agreement, as so amended, has not been further amended or modified
except in accordance herewith. No "Distribution Date" or "Shares Acquisition
Date" (as such terms are defined in the Company Rights Plan) has occurred prior

or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

by Company pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.

   untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
   required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements

   hereof until the Closing, (i) complied as to form in all material respects
   with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto,
   (ii) was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis

   Exchange Act) and (iii) fairly presented the consolidated financial position

   expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
   Effect on Parent, except for liabilities incurred since the date of the
   Parent Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
   practices and liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement.

      (d) Parent has heretofore furnished to Company a complete and correct
   copy of any amendments or modifications, which have not yet been filed with

of Parent's or any of its subsidiaries' capital stock, (iii) any split,
combination or reclassification of any of Parent's or any of its subsidiaries'
capital stock, (iv) any material change by Parent in its accounting methods,
principles or practices, except as required by concurrent changes in GAAP, or
(v) any material revaluation by Parent of any of its material assets, including
writing off notes or accounts receivable other than in the ordinary course of
business.

   3.7 Taxes. Parent is not aware of any fact, circumstance, plan or intention
on the part of Parent that would be reasonably likely to prevent the Merger
from qualifying as a "reorganization" pursuant to the provisions of Section 368
of the Code.

   3.8 Intellectual Property. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Parent
Intellectual Property" shall mean any Intellectual Property that is owned by,
or exclusively licensed to, Parent or one of its subsidiaries.

      (a) No material Parent Intellectual Property is subject to any proceeding
   or outstanding decree, order, judgment, agreement, or stipulation
   restricting in any manner the use, transfer, or licensing thereof by Parent,
   or which may materially and adversely affect the validity, use or
   enforceability of such Parent Intellectual Property, which proceeding,
   decree, order, judgment, agreement or stipulation would reasonably be
   expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

      (b) To Parent's knowledge, the operation of the business of Parent as
   such business currently is conducted, including Parent's design,
   development, marketing and sale of the products or services of Parent
   (including with respect to products currently under development) has not,
   does not and will not infringe or misappropriate the Intellectual Property
   of any third party or, to its knowledge, constitute unfair competition or
   trade practices under the laws of any jurisdiction, except for such matters
   as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
   Parent.

      (c) Parent has not received notice from any third party that the
   operation of the business of Parent or any act, product or service of
   Parent, infringes or misappropriates the Intellectual Property of any third
   party or constitutes unfair competition or trade practices under the laws of
   any jurisdiction, which allegations if true, would reasonably be expected to
   have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

                                     A-25

   3.9 Litigation. There are no claims, suits, actions or proceedings pending
or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against, relating to or affecting
Parent or any of its subsidiaries, before any Governmental Entity or any
arbitrator that seeks to restrain or enjoin the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or which could reasonably be
expected, either singularly or in the aggregate with all such claims, actions
or proceedings, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or have a material
adverse effect on the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the Merger.

   3.10 Disclosure. The information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the
Registration Statement shall not at the time the Registration Statement is
filed with the SEC and at the time it becomes effective under the Securities

material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,

Stockholders' Meeting which has become false or misleading. The Registration
Statement and prospectus included in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will comply
as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time, any event relating to Parent or any of its affiliates, officers or
directors should be discovered by Parent which is required to be set forth in
an amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, Parent shall promptly inform Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent makes no representation or warranty with respect to any
information supplied by Company which is contained in any of the foregoing
documents.

breach or default under, and neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has
received written notice that it has materially breached or defaulted, any of
the terms or conditions of any Contract set forth on Part 3.11 of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, in such a manner as would reasonably be expect to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

   Company will prepare and file with the SEC, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
   and Parent will prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement in

   of Company and Parent will respond to any comments of the SEC, will use its
   respective commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration
   Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
   practicable after such filing and Company will cause the Proxy
   Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its stockholders at the earliest
   practicable time after the Registration Statement is declared effective by

   required in order to effectuate any filings pursuant to this Section 5.1.

      (b) Each of Company and Parent will notify the other promptly (i) upon
   the occurrence of any event which is required to be set forth in an

   any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the
   Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Merger or any
   Antitrust Filing or Other Filing. Except where prohibited by applicable
   Legal Requirements, and subject to the mutual confidentiality agreement,
   dated as of September 10, 2001 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), each of
   Company and Parent shall consult with the other prior to taking a position
   with respect to any such filing, shall permit the other to review and
   discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in
   connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,

   (and its counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations or submissions

   presentation or submission, each of Parent and Company need not supply the
   other (or its counsel) with copies (or in case of oral presentations, a
   summary) to the extent that any law, treaty, rule or regulation of any
   Governmental Entity applicable to such party requires such party or its
   Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or
   information or where such properties or information is subject to the
   attorney-client privilege (it being understood that the participation and
   cooperation contemplated herein is not intended to constitute, nor shall be
   deemed to constitute, any form of direct or indirect waiver of the
   attorney-client privilege maintained by any party hereto). Each of Company
   and Parent will cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with
   the SEC or other regulatory authorities under this Section 5.1 to comply in
   all material respects with all applicable requirements of law and the rules
   and regulations promulgated thereunder.

                                     A-29

   5.2 Meeting of Company Stockholders.

      (a) Promptly after the date hereof, Company will take all action
   necessary in accordance with the Delaware Law and its Certificate of
   Incorporation and Bylaws to convene and hold the Company Stockholders'
   Meeting to be held as promptly as practicable, and in any event (to the
   extent permissible under applicable law) within 45 days after the
   declaration of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, for the purpose
   of voting upon approval and adoption of this Agreement and approval of the
   Merger. Subject to Section 5.2(c), Company will use its commercially
   reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
   adoption and approval of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger and
   will take all other action necessary or advisable to obtain such approvals
   and to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders required by the rules
   of the Nasdaq Stock Market, Delaware Law and its Certificate of
   Incorporation and Bylaws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
   in this Agreement, Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders'
   Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or
   amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to Company's
   stockholders in advance of a vote on the Merger and this Agreement or, if as
   of the time for which Company Stockholders' Meeting is originally scheduled
   (as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient
   shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
   constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
   Stockholders' Meeting. Company shall ensure that the Company Stockholders'
   Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all
   proxies solicited by Company in connection with the Company Stockholders'
   Meeting are solicited, in compliance with the Delaware Law, its Certificate
   of Incorporation and Bylaws, the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market and all
   other applicable legal requirements. Company's obligation to call, give
   notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting in accordance
   with this Section 5.2(a) shall not be limited to or otherwise affected by
   the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to Company of any
   Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 5.3), or Superior Offer, or by
   any withdrawal, amendment or modification of the recommendation of the Board
   of Directors of Company with respect to this Agreement or the Merger.

      (b) Subject to Section 5.2(c): (i) the Board of Directors of Company
   shall recommend that Company's stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and
   approve this Agreement and approve the Merger at the Company Stockholders'
   Meeting; (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include a statement to
   the effect that the Board of Directors of Company has recommended that
   Company's stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve this Agreement
   and the Merger at the Company Stockholders' Meeting; and (iii) neither the
   Board of Directors of Company nor any committee thereof shall withdraw,
   amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a
   manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Board of Directors of
   Company that Company's stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve
   this Agreement and the Merger.

      (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of
   Company from withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its
   recommendation in favor of the Merger if (i) a Superior Offer (as defined
   below) is made to Company and is not withdrawn, (ii) Company shall have
   provided written notice to Parent (a "Notice of Superior Offer") advising
   Parent that Company has received a Superior Offer, specifying all of the
   material terms and conditions of such Superior Offer and identifying the
   person or entity making such Superior Offer, (iii) Parent shall not have,
   within five business days of Parent's receipt of the Notice of Superior
   Offer, made an offer that Company's Board of Directors by a majority vote
   determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial
   advisor of national standing) to be at least as favorable to Company's
   stockholders as such Superior Offer (it being agreed that the Board of
   Directors of Company shall convene a meeting to consider any such offer by
   Parent promptly following the receipt thereof), (iv) the Board of Directors
   of Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
   counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer, the withholding, withdrawal,
   amendment or modification of such recommendation is required in order for
   the Board of Directors of Company to comply with its fiduciary obligations
   to Company's stockholders under applicable law and (v) Company shall not
   have violated any of the restrictions set forth in Section 5.3 or this
   Section 5.2. Company shall provide

                                     A-30

   Parent with at least three business days prior notice (or such lesser prior
   notice as provided to the members of Company's Board of Directors but in no
   event less than twenty-four hours) of any meeting of Company's Board of
   Directors at which Company's Board of Directors is reasonably expected to
   consider any Acquisition Proposal to determine whether such Acquisition
   Proposal is a Superior Offer. Nothing contained in this Section 5.2(c) shall
   limit Company's obligation to hold and convene the Company Stockholders'
   Meeting (regardless of whether the recommendation of the Board of Directors
   of Company shall have been withdrawn, amended or modified). For purposes of
   this Agreement, "Superior Offer" shall mean an unsolicited, bona fide
   written offer made by a third party to consummate any of the following
   transactions: (i) a merger or consolidation involving Company pursuant to
   which the stockholders of Company immediately preceding such transaction
   hold less than 50% of the equity interest in the surviving or resulting
   entity of such transaction or (ii) the acquisition by any person or group
   (including by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or a two step
   transaction involving a tender offer followed with reasonable promptness by
   a merger involving Company), directly or indirectly, of ownership of 100% of
   the then outstanding shares of capital stock of Company, on terms that the
   Board of Directors of Company determines, in its reasonable judgment (after
   consultation with a financial advisor of national standing) to be more
   favorable to Company stockholders from a financial point of view than the
   terms of the Merger; provided, however, that any such offer shall not be
   deemed to be a "Superior Offer" if any financing required to consummate the
   transaction contemplated by such offer is not committed or is not likely in
   the reasonable judgment of Company's Board of Directors (after consultation
   with its financial advisor) to be obtained by such third party on a timely
   basis.

      (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Company or its
   Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
   contemplated by Rules14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act;
   provided, however, that the Board of Directors of Company shall not
   recommend that the stockholders of Company tender their shares in connection
   with a tender offer except to the extent that the Board of Directors
   determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with outside
   counsel and a financial advisor of national standing, that the tender offer
   constitutes a Superior Offer and that such recommendation is required in
   order for the Board of Directors of Company to comply with its fiduciary
   duties to Company's stockholders under applicable law.

   5.3 No Solicitation.

      (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or
   termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, Company and its
   subsidiaries will not, nor will they authorize or permit any of their
   respective officers, directors, affiliates or employees or any investment
   banker, attorney or other advisor or representative retained by any of them
   to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, seek, entertain,
   encourage, facilitate, support or induce the making, submission or
   announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined), (ii)
   participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
   person any non-public information with respect to, or take any other action
   to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes,
   or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
   engage in discussions with any person with respect to any Acquisition
   Proposal, except as to the existence of these provisions, (iv) approve,
   endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any letter
   of intent or any other Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any
   Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that prior to the approval of this
   Agreement and the Merger at the Company Stockholders' Meeting, this Section
   5.3(a) shall not prohibit Company from furnishing nonpublic information
   regarding Company and its subsidiaries to, or entering into discussions
   with, any person or group who has submitted (and not withdrawn) to Company
   an unsolicited, written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
   Directors of Company reasonably concludes (after consultation with a
   financial advisor of national standing) may constitute a Superior Offer if
   (1) neither Company nor any representative of Company and its subsidiaries
   shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3,
   (2) the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith, after
   consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such action is required in
   order for the Board of Directors of Company to comply with its

                                     A-31

   fiduciary obligations to Company's stockholders under applicable law, (3)
   prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or entering into any
   such discussions with, such person or group, Company gives Parent written
   notice of the identity of such person or group and all of the material terms
   and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and of Company's intention to
   furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions with, such
   person or group, and Company receives from such person or group an executed
   confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive with
   regard to Company's confidential information as the Confidentiality
   Agreement (as defined in Section 5.1), (4) Company gives Parent at least
   three business days advance notice of its intent to furnish such nonpublic
   information or enter into such discussions, and (5) contemporaneously with
   furnishing any such nonpublic information to such person or group, Company
   furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic
   information has not been previously furnished by Company to Parent). Company
   and its subsidiaries will immediately cease any and all existing activities,
   discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with
   respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is
   understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
   two sentences by any officer, director or employee of Company or any of its
   subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or
   representative of Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a
   breach of this Section 5.3 by Company.

   For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any offer
or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by Parent) relating to, or
involving: (A) any acquisition or purchase from Company by any person or
"group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder) of more than a 20% interest in the total outstanding
voting securities of Company or any of its subsidiaries or any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or "group" (as
defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder) beneficially owning 20% or more of the total outstanding voting

   5.8 Stock Options and ESPP.

      (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option, whether or
   not then exercisable, will be converted into an option to purchase Parent
   Common Stock. Each Company Option so converted will continue to have, and be
   subject to, substantially the same terms and conditions set forth in the
   Company Stock Option Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
   any repurchase rights or vesting provisions), except that (i) each Company
   Stock Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance
   with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal
   to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
   issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the
   Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
   whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share
   exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise
   of such converted Company Option will be equal to the quotient determined by
   dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such
   Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by
   the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Continuous
   employment with Company or its subsidiaries shall be credited to the
   optionee for purposes of determining the vesting of all converted Company
   Options after the Effective Time.

      (b) Company shall take all actions necessary pursuant to the terms of the
   Company ESPP in order to shorten the Option Period(s) under such plan which
   includes the Effective Time (the "Current Offerings") such that a new
   purchase date for each such Option Period shall occur prior to the Effective
   Time and shares shall be purchased by Company ESPP participants prior to the
   Effective Time. The Current Offerings shall expire immediately following
   such new purchase date, and the Company ESPP shall terminate immediately
   prior to the earlier of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the date upon which
   the Company ESPP terminates by its terms. Subsequent to such new purchase
   date, Company shall take no action, pursuant to the terms of the Company
   ESPP, to commence any new offering period.

   5.9 Form S-8. Parent agrees to file a registration statement on Form S-8 for
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to converted Company
Options as soon as is reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and shall
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement on a basis comparable
to registration statements applicable to other outstanding stock options of the
Parent.

   5.10 Indemnification.

      (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving
   Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of Company
