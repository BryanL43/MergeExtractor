(1) This Registration Statement covers shares to be issued by Cross Media
    Marketing Corporation in connection with a proposed merger transaction. It
    does not include additional shares that may be issued by reason of potential
    adjustment for recapitalization. Pursuant to Rule 416 of the Securities Act
    of 1933, as amended, this Registration Statement covers such additional
    shares, the number of which is indeterminable as of the date hereof. Because
    such additional shares, if issued, will be issued for no additional
    consideration, no additional registration fee is required.

(2) Pursuant to Rule 457(f)(1) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the
    proposed maximum offering price is based upon (i) the market value of the
    outstanding shares of common stock of LifeMinders, Inc. being acquired in
    the proposed merger determined by using the average of the high and low sale
    prices per share of the LifeMinders, Inc. common stock as reported on the
    Nasdaq National Market on August 20, 2001 and (ii) the exercise price of the
    options to purchase LifeMinders common stock that are exercisable at a price
    below the market price of LifeMinders common stock.

     THE REGISTRANT HEREBY AMENDS THIS REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON SUCH DATE OR
DATES AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO DELAY ITS EFFECTIVE DATE UNTIL THE REGISTRANT SHALL
FILE A FURTHER AMENDMENT WHICH SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT THIS REGISTRATION
STATEMENT SHALL THEREAFTER BECOME EFFECTIVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 8(a) OF
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR UNTIL THIS REGISTRATION STATEMENT
SHALL BECOME EFFECTIVE ON SUCH DATE AS THE COMMISSION, ACTING PURSUANT TO
SECTION 8(a), MAY DETERMINE.

                 MERGER PROPOSED -- YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

To the Stockholders of Cross Media and LifeMinders:

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus relates to the proposed merger of
Cross Media Marketing Corporation and LifeMinders, Inc. In order to complete the
merger, stockholders of both companies must adopt the merger agreement. We
believe that this merger will benefit the stockholders of both companies and we
ask for your support in adopting the merger agreement at our special meetings.

     When the merger is completed, shares of LifeMinders common stock held by
LifeMinders stockholders will be converted into the right to receive cash, Cross
Media common stock or a prescribed mix of cash and Cross Media common stock, as
described on page [  ] as each LifeMinders stockholder elects, subject to the
procedures and limitations described on page [  ]. If LifeMinders stockholders
collectively elect to receive more than the maximum cash consideration available
for LifeMinders stockholders in the merger, those LifeMinders stockholders
electing to receive all cash will instead receive a mix of cash and Cross Media
common stock. See page [  ] for more information. If a LifeMinders stockholder
does not make a timely effective election to receive cash, Cross Media common
stock or a prescribed mix of cash and Cross Media common stock, that stockholder
will be deemed to have elected to receive only Cross Media common stock.

      IF A LIFEMINDERS                THAT LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDER IS ASKING TO RECEIVE          THIS CHOICE IS
    STOCKHOLDER CHOOSES:       FOR EACH SHARE OF LIFEMINDERS COMMON STOCK HELD APPROXIMATELY*:     GENERALLY:
- -----------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------

Cash                           $2.57 in cash                                                         Taxable
Cross Media common stock       1.29 shares of Cross Media common stock                             Not taxable
Cash and Cross Media common    $0.86 in cash and .86 of a share of Cross Media common stock     Partially taxable
  stock

* The estimates set forth are based on certain assumptions. See page [     ] for
  more information.

     Any cash a LifeMinders stockholder receives in the merger will generally be
taxable to the extent that any gain is realized in the transaction. It is
anticipated, however, that a LifeMinders stockholder generally will not
recognize gain or loss as a result of the merger if the stockholder receives
only Cross Media common stock. For a more complete description of the tax
consequences associated with the merger, see "Material Federal Income Tax
Consequences" beginning on page [  ].

     Cross Media shares are listed on the American Stock Exchange under the
symbol "XMM."

     Information about the merger and the other items to be voted on at your
company's special meeting is contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
We urge you to read this material, including the section describing risk factors
relating to the merger that begins on page [  ].

     The boards of directors of both Cross Media and LifeMinders have approved
the amended and restated merger agreement and recommend that their respective
stockholders adopt the amended and restated merger agreement as described in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Additionally, the board of directors of
Cross Media approved the amendment and restatement of Cross Media's certificate
of incorporation and the amendment to Cross Media's 1998 Stock Option Plan and

Media's certificate of incorporation and the amendment to Cross Media's 1998
Stock Option Plan. To grant your proxy to vote your shares, please complete,

paid envelope. You may also cast your vote in person at the special meeting. If

against adoption of the amendment and restatement of Cross Media's certificate
of incorporation.

         QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CROSS MEDIA/LIFEMINDERS MERGER

Q. WHY ARE WE PROPOSING THE MERGER?

A. We believe that combining the products, technologies, assets and expertise of
   the two companies will allow us to become a leading multi-channel,
   multi-product direct marketing company. The merger will combine LifeMinders'
   proprietary technology, expertise in online direct marketing, large
   membership base and substantial assets with Cross Media's established direct
   marketing operations.

Q. WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A. Sign your proxy card, mark your vote on it, and mail it to us in the enclosed
   postage-paid envelope.

   LifeMinders stockholders should also complete the election form and deliver
   it to [          ], the exchange agent, in the enclosed envelope prior to the
   close of business on the date of the LifeMinders special meeting. A
   LifeMinders stockholder who does not do so will lose the right to choose the
   consideration he or she will receive as a result of the merger and will be
   deemed to have elected to receive only Cross Media common stock. Once you
   sign and return your election form, you will no longer be able to trade or
   sell your shares of LifeMinders common stock. Please see page [ ] for more
   information.

Q. IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
   SHARES FOR ME?

A. Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to
   vote by completing and returning the proxy card provided to you by your
   broker.

   For a complete description of voting shares held in "street name," see the
   section titled "Special Meetings of Stockholders" on pages [  ] and [  ].

Q. SHOULD LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS SEND IN THEIR STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A. Yes. LifeMinders stockholders should send their stock certificates along with
   their election forms to the exchange agent in the enclosed envelope. NO STOCK
   CERTIFICATES OR ELECTION FORMS SHOULD BE SENT TO EITHER CROSS MEDIA OR
   LIFEMINDERS. If your LifeMinders common stock is held by your broker, you may
   either request your share certificate from your broker and follow the
   instructions above, or return to your broker the election form with the proxy
   card sent to you by your broker, who will then deliver your share certificate
   (or a properly completed guarantee of delivery) and election form to the
   exchange agent.

Q. HOW DO I MAKE MY MERGER CONSIDERATION ELECTION IF MY LIFEMINDERS SHARES ARE
   HELD IN "STREET NAME"?

A. You should either request your share certificate from your broker and follow
   the instructions above, or complete your election form and return it to your
   broker, along with the proxy card sent to you by your broker, who will then
   submit the election form to the exchange agent.

Q. WHAT IF A LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDER WANTS TO CHANGE HIS OR HER ELECTION?

A. A LifeMinders stockholder may change his or her election by delivering to the
   exchange agent prior to the close of business on the date of the LifeMinders
   special meeting a later-dated, signed election form.

Q. WHAT IF A LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDER HAS LOST HIS OR HER STOCK CERTIFICATES?

A. The LifeMinders stockholder will need to indicate in the space provided in
   his or her election form that he or she has lost his or her stock
   certificates. In addition, the LifeMinders stockholder will have to sign an
   affidavit, which is included as part of the election form, that provides,
   among other things, that the LifeMinders stockholder agrees to indemnify
   Cross Media and the exchange agent for any loss Cross Media or the exchange
   agent may incur as a result of the LifeMinders stockholder's lost or
   destroyed stock certificate.

Q. DO LIFEMINDERS' OPTIONHOLDERS WHO INTEND TO EXERCISE THEIR OPTIONS AT OR
   PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ELECT THE FORM OF MERGER
   CONSIDERATION THEY RECEIVE?

A. LifeMinders' optionholders may complete and return an election form to the
   exchange agent at the time they exercise their options, up to the close of
   business on the date of the LifeMinders special meeting. Holders of op-

   tions who exercise their options after the close of business on the date of
   the LifeMinders special meeting will be deemed to elect to receive only
   shares of Cross Media common stock. For a complete description of the
   treatment of LifeMinders options, see page [  ].

Q. WHAT IF I WANT TO CHANGE MY VOTE?

A. Just send in a later-dated, signed proxy card before your special meeting or
   attend your special meeting in person and vote.

Q. WILL I HAVE APPRAISAL RIGHTS?

A. Neither Cross Media stockholders nor LifeMinders stockholders will have
   appraisal rights.

Q. WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A. We expect to complete the merger during the fourth quarter of 2001.

Q. WHAT WILL CROSS MEDIA STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A. Cross Media stockholders will keep their current stock holdings in Cross
   Media.

Q. WHAT WILL CROSS MEDIA PAY AS MERGER CONSIDERATION?

A. Under the terms of the amended and restated merger agreement, Cross Media
   will pay a total of $24 million in cash and issue approximately 22.3 million
   shares of its common stock, assuming that no LifeMinders' stock options are
   exercised prior to the date on which the merger is completed and that
   LifeMinders stockholders elect to receive the maximum cash consideration. If
   LifeMinders stockholders do not elect to receive the maximum cash
   consideration, then the number of shares of common stock that Cross Media
   will issue in the merger will increase by that number of shares equal to $24
   million less the amount of the total cash consideration paid in the merger,
   divided by $1.9845. The $1.9845 value of the Cross Media common stock used
   for this purpose is based on the average last sale price of Cross Media
   common stock for the 20 trading days immediately preceding July 18, 2001, the
   date of the original merger agreement, and is not necessarily indicative of
   the value of such stock. The value of the aggregate merger consideration will
   depend upon the market price of Cross Media common stock on the date the
   merger is completed.

  The aggregate merger consideration is subject to a reduction of up to $1.75
  million to the extent that LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents are less
  than $49 million at August 31, 2001 (referred to as a cash shortfall), but no
  reduction will be made if LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents on that
  date are at least $48.9 million. In the event of a reduction in the aggregate
  merger consideration resulting from a cash shortfall, the cash portion of the
  merger consideration will be reduced by an amount equal to approximately 33.3%
  of the reduction, and the stock portion of the merger consideration will be
  reduced by approximately that number of shares of Cross Media common stock
  equal to 66.7% of the reduction divided by $1.9845. For a definition of net
  cash and cash equivalents, see page [ ].

  The aggregate merger consideration will increase by an amount equal to the
  aggregate exercise price of any LifeMinders options with an exercise price of
  $2.57 per share or less that are exercised before the merger is completed. The
  per share consideration payable to LifeMinders stockholders is not affected by
  any such increase in the aggregate merger consideration.

Q. WHAT WILL LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A. In connection with the merger, each LifeMinders stockholder will be able to
   elect to receive all cash, all Cross Media common stock, or a prescribed mix
   of approximately 33.3% cash and 66.7% stock. Assuming there is no change in
   the aggregate merger consideration, LifeMinders stockholders can elect to
   receive for each share of LifeMinders common stock held approximately $2.57
   in cash, approximately 1.29 shares of Cross Media common stock or
   approximately $0.86 in cash and approximately .86 shares of Cross Media
   common stock.

  In no event will the aggregate cash consideration paid to the LifeMinders
  stockholders collectively exceed $24 million, plus approximately 33.3% of the
  aggregate exercise price of

  any options to purchase LifeMinders common stock with an exercise price equal
  to or below $2.57 per share that are exercised on a cash basis between July
  18, 2001 and the closing of the merger, and reduced by approximately 33.3% of
  a reduction in the aggregate merger consideration resulting from a cash
  shortfall, if any.

  In the event that the cash elections, including the cash portion to be
  received by LifeMinders stockholders who elect the prescribed mix of cash and
  stock, exceed the maximum cash consideration, the amount of cash paid to those
  LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive all cash will be reduced and they
  will receive shares of Cross Media common stock, valued for this purpose at
  $1.9845 per share, for the balance. We cannot predict the actual mix of cash
  and Cross Media common stock that will be received by LifeMinders stockholders
  electing to receive all cash, but the per share cash portion cannot be less
  than approximately $0.86, and the per share stock portion cannot exceed
  approximately .86 shares of Cross Media common stock. Any LifeMinders
  stockholder who does not make an effective election before the election
  deadline will be deemed to have elected to receive all Cross Media common
  stock.

   No fractional shares of Cross Media common stock will be issued. Any
   LifeMinders stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction
   of a share of LifeMinders common stock will instead receive cash for that
   fraction of a share.

   Upon completion of the merger, Cross Media will assume all of LifeMinders
   stock options outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the merger.
   Please refer to page [ ] for more information regarding the treatment of
   LifeMinders stock options.

Q. WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THE CONSIDERATION THAT LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS WILL
   RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A. The per share cash consideration to be paid to LifeMinders stockholders is
   $2.57. For LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive either all Cross
   Media common stock or the prescribed mix of cash and Cross Media common
   stock, the per share consideration will depend on the market price of Cross
   Media common stock on the date on which the merger is completed. In the event
   that the cash elections, including the cash portion to be received by
   LifeMinders stockholders who elect the prescribed mix of cash and stock,
   exceed the maximum cash consideration, the amount of cash to be received by
   stockholders electing to receive all cash will be reduced and they will
   receive shares of Cross Media common stock, valued for this purpose at
   $1.9845 per share, for the balance. In that case, the value of the per share
   consideration to be paid to such stockholders also will depend on the market
   price of Cross Media common stock on the date on which the merger is
   completed.

Q. CAN THE MERGER CONSIDERATION CHANGE?

A. Yes. The aggregate merger consideration is subject to a reduction of up to
   $1.75 million to the extent that LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents
   are less than $49 million at August 31, 2001, but no reduction will be made
   if LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents on that date are at least $48.9
   million. If the aggregate merger consideration is reduced as a result of a
   cash shortfall, the per share consideration payable to LifeMinders
   stockholders also will be reduced. The aggregate merger consideration will
   increase by an amount equal to the aggregate exercise price of any
   LifeMinders options with an exercise price of $2.57 per share or less that
   are exercised before the merger is completed. The per share consideration
   payable to LifeMinders stockholders will not be affected by any such
   increase. Please refer to pages [  ] and [  ] for more information on this
   issue.

Q. WHEN WILL LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE CASH AND/OR SHARES OF CROSS MEDIA
   COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER?

A. If the merger agreement is adopted by both the Cross Media and LifeMinders
   stockholders, then the LifeMinders stock will be converted into the right to
   receive the merger consideration on the date the merger is completed.
   LifeMinders stockholders who have returned their election forms, together
   with LifeMinders stock certificates, a properly completed guarantee of
   delivery or proof of lost certificate and the necessary affidavit, before the
   election deadline, will be sent the Cross

   Media common stock and/or cash to which they are entitled within 15 business
   days after the merger is completed. Within 15 business days after the merger
   is completed, LifeMinders stockholders who did not timely send in their stock
   certificates and effective election forms will be sent a letter of
   transmittal and instructions for exchanging their stock certificates. Those
   LifeMinders stockholders will be sent their Cross Media stock certificates
   within 10 business days after the exchange agent receives their letter of
   transmittal and supporting documents.

Q. WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO ME?

A. It is anticipated that the merger will qualify as a "reorganization" for
   federal income tax purposes. If it so qualifies, the tax consequences of the
   merger will depend on the merger consideration received by a LifeMinders
   stockholder:

     - LifeMinders stockholders who receive only cash will generally recognize
       gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as though they had sold
       their shares for that cash;

     - LifeMinders stockholders who receive only Cross Media common stock in
       exchange for their LifeMinders common stock will not recognize any gain
       or loss for federal income tax purposes; and

     - LifeMinders stockholders who receive a mix of cash and Cross Media common
       stock will recognize gain (up to the amount of cash received) for federal
       income tax purposes and will not recognize loss for income tax purposes.

   See "The Merger -- Material Federal Income Tax Consequences" on page [ ] for
   a more complete description of the tax consequences of the merger. Cross
   Media expects to receive a legal opinion from Cross Media's counsel with
   respect to these matters. The form of this legal opinion is filed as an
   exhibit to Cross Media's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this
   joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part. Also, LifeMinders expects to
   receive a legal opinion from LifeMinders' counsel with respect to these
   matters. The form of this legal opinion is filed as an exhibit to Cross
   Media's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy
   statement/prospectus is a part.

   TAX MATTERS ARE VERY COMPLICATED AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO
   YOU WILL DEPEND ON THE FACTS OF YOUR OWN SITUATION. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR
   TAX ADVISORS FOR A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER
   TO YOU.

Q. IF I RECEIVE CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER, WILL I RECEIVE DIVIDENDS
   IN THE FUTURE?

A. You will be entitled to receive dividends, if, when and to the extent
   declared by Cross Media's board of directors. To date, Cross Media has never
   paid or declared any dividends on its common stock and does not contemplate
   paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. The declaration, payment and
   amount of dividends in the future is within the discretion of Cross Media's
   board of directors and will depend upon Cross Media's earnings, capital
   requirements, restrictions under financing documents, financial condition and
   other relevant factors.

Q. WHOM SHOULD I CALL WITH QUESTIONS?

A. Stockholders of Cross Media should call Jason Buerkle, Director of Financial
   Operations of Cross Media Marketing Corporation, at (212) 457-1200 with any
   questions about the merger. Stockholders of LifeMinders should call Allison
   Abraham, President of LifeMinders, Inc., at (703) 885-1315 with any questions
   about the merger.

                                    SUMMARY

     This summary highlights material information from this document. To
understand the merger more fully, and for more complete descriptions of the
terms of the merger, you should read carefully this entire document, including
the amended and restated merger agreement attached as Annex A, and the documents
to which we have referred you. See "Where You Can Find More Information" on page
[  ].

                                   THE MERGER

     The amended and restated merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read the amended and
restated merger agreement because it is the legal document that governs the
merger.

CROSS MEDIA WILL PAY A TOTAL OF $24 MILLION IN CASH AND ISSUE APPROXIMATELY 22.3
MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER, SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT (see
page [  ])

     Under the terms of the amended and restated merger agreement, Cross Media
will pay a total of $24 million in cash and issue approximately 22.3 million
shares of its common stock, assuming that no LifeMinders' stock options are
exercised prior to the date on which the merger is completed and that
LifeMinders stockholders elect to receive the maximum cash consideration. If
LifeMinders stockholders do not elect to receive the maximum cash consideration,
then the number of shares of common stock that Cross Media will issue in the
merger will increase by that number of shares equal to $24 million less the
amount of the total cash consideration paid in the merger, divided by $1.9845.
The $1.9845 value of the Cross Media common stock used for this purpose is based
on the average last sale price of Cross Media common stock for the 20 trading
days immediately preceding July 18, 2001, the date of the original merger
agreement, and is not necessarily indicative of the value of such stock. The
value of the aggregate merger consideration will depend upon the market price of
Cross Media common stock on the date the merger is completed.

     The aggregate merger consideration is subject to a reduction of up to $1.75
million to the extent that LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents are less
than $49 million at August 31, 2001, but no reduction will be made if
LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents on that date are at least $48.9
million. In the event of a reduction in the aggregate merger consideration
resulting from a cash shortfall, the cash portion of the merger consideration
will be reduced by an amount equal to approximately 33.3% of the reduction, and
the stock portion of the merger consideration will be reduced by approximately
that number of shares equal to 66.7% of the reduction divided by $1.9845. For a
definition of net cash and cash equivalents, see page [  ].

     The aggregate merger consideration will increase by an amount equal to the
aggregate exercise price of any LifeMinders options with an exercise price of
$2.57 per share or less that are exercised before the merger is completed. The
per share consideration payable to LifeMinders stockholders is not affected by
any such increase in the aggregate merger consideration.

IN THE MERGER, LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS CAN ELECT TO RECEIVE CASH, SHARES OF
CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK OR A PRESCRIBED MIX OF CASH AND SHARES OF CROSS MEDIA
COMMON STOCK (see page [  ])

     In connection with the merger, each LifeMinders stockholder can elect to
receive all cash, all stock or a prescribed mix of approximately 33.3% cash and
66.7% stock, provided that in no event will the aggregate cash consideration
paid to LifeMinders stockholders exceed $24 million, plus approximately 33.3% of
the aggregate exercise price of any options to purchase LifeMinders common stock
with an exercise price equal to or below $2.57 per share that are exercised on a
cash basis between July 18, 2001 and the closing date of the merger, and reduced
by approximately 33.3% of a reduction in the aggregate merger consideration
resulting from a cash shortfall, if any. Assuming there is no change in the
aggregate merger consideration, each share of LifeMinders common stock will be
converted into approximately:

     - $2.57 in cash, for those LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive all
       cash, but if

elections made by LifeMinders stockholders would require Cross Media to pay more
than the aggregate maximum cash portion of the merger consideration, the amount
of cash will be reduced, with the difference being paid in shares of Cross Media
       common stock, valued for this purpose at $1.9845 per share;

     - 1.29 shares of Cross Media common stock for those LifeMinders
       stockholders electing to receive all stock; or

     - $0.86 in cash and .86 shares of Cross Media common stock, for those
       LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive the prescribed mix.

     We cannot predict the actual mix of cash and Cross Media common stock that
will be received by LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive all cash, but
the per share cash portion cannot be less than approximately $0.86, and the per
share stock portion cannot exceed approximately .86 shares of Cross Media common
stock. Any LifeMinders stockholder who does not make an effective election prior
to the election deadline, and any LifeMinders stockholder who acquires shares of
LifeMinders common stock after the election deadline, will receive all Cross
Media common stock.

     Assuming that there is no cash shortfall and that no LifeMinders stock
options are exercised prior to the date on which the merger is completed, and
using the per share price of $[       ], the closing price of Cross Media common
stock as of [       ], 2001, the last practicable date prior to the printing of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus:

     - the value of the per share merger consideration that a LifeMinders
       stockholder who elects to receive only Cross Media common stock would
       receive would be $[       ];

     - the value of the per share merger consideration that a LifeMinders
       stockholder electing to receive the prescribed mix would be $[     ]; and

     - LifeMinders stockholders who receive all cash in the merger would be paid
       $2.57 per share of LifeMinders common stock.

     LifeMinders stockholders are urged to obtain a current market quotation for
Cross Media common stock prior to electing the form of merger consideration they
will receive in the merger.

     No fractional shares of Cross Media common stock will be issued. Any
LifeMinders stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of Cross Media common stock will instead receive cash for that fraction
of a share.

CROSS MEDIA WILL ASSUME ALL OF THE LIFEMINDERS' STOCK OPTIONS OUTSTANDING
IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER (see page [  ])

     Upon completion of the merger, Cross Media will assume all of the
LifeMinders stock options outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the
merger. After completion of the merger, each LifeMinders stock option will
thereafter be exercisable for approximately 1.29 shares of Cross Media common
stock multiplied by the number of shares of LifeMinders common stock that would
have been issued upon exercise of the LifeMinders stock option immediately prior
to completion of the merger, with an exercise price equal to the exercise price
per share of LifeMinders common stock immediately prior to completion of the
merger divided by 1.29, the per share stock consideration.

     As of [     ], 2001, the latest practicable date preceding the mailing of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, there were outstanding options to
purchase approximately 2.2 million shares of LifeMinders common stock with an
exercise price equal to or below $2.57 per share, and options to purchase
approximately [     ] shares of LifeMinders common stock with an exercise price
above $2.57 per share.

LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS' OWNERSHIP OF CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK IMMEDIATELY
AFTER THE MERGER (see page [  ])

     Assuming there is no change in the merger consideration, LifeMinders
stockholders elect to receive the maximum cash consideration of $24

million and no options to purchase LifeMinders common stock are exercised before
the date on which the merger is completed, Cross Media will issue approximately
22.3 million shares of Cross Media common stock to LifeMinders stockholders.
Assuming that none of the options to purchase approximately 2.2 million shares
of LifeMinders common stock with an exercise price equal to or below $2.57 per
share are exercised before the date on which the merger is completed, Cross
Media will issue options to purchase approximately 2.9 million shares of Cross
Media common stock in exchange for such outstanding options to purchase
LifeMinders common stock. Assuming that the issuance of approximately 1.7
million shares of Cross Media common stock to The Shaar Fund, Ltd. upon the
conversion of half of its shares of Cross Media's Series A convertible preferred
stock in accordance with the Series A agreement described on page [  ], the
issuance of approximately 22.3 million shares of Cross Media common stock
anticipated to be issued in the merger and none of the outstanding Cross Media
options, warrants, or other equity rights are exercised or converted, the shares
of Cross Media common stock issued to LifeMinders stockholders in the merger
will constitute approximately 36.8% of the common stock of Cross Media
outstanding after the merger. If all of the approximately 2.9 million options to
purchase Cross Media common stock which may be issued in the merger, as
described above, are exercised, based on the assumptions set forth in the
previous sentence, after the merger, LifeMinders stockholders will own
approximately 39.7% of the common stock of Cross Media.

     LIFEMINDERS

proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read this opinion.

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER (see page [  ])

     The completion of the merger depends upon the satisfaction or waiver of a
number of conditions.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (see page [  ])

     Cross Media and LifeMinders can agree to terminate the merger agreement
without completing the merger, and either company can terminate the merger
agreement under various circumstances.

     For example, each of Cross Media and LifeMinders has the right to terminate
the merger agreement if:

     - LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2001 have not
       been finally determined in accordance with the merger agreement by
       November 30, 2001; or

     - the merger has not been completed by December 31, 2001, or a later date
       agreed upon by the parties, as a result of a failure to satisfy any
       condition to closing by that date that the other party does not choose to
       waive.

     Cross Media has the right to terminate the merger agreement if:

     - LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2001 are less
       than $47.25 million;

     - the board of directors of LifeMinders fails to include in this joint
       proxy statement/prospectus its recommendation to LifeMinders stockholders
       that they adopt the merger agreement or withdraws, ad-

       versely modifies or fails to reaffirm its recommendation;

     - the board of directors of LifeMinders approves or recommends any
       Alternative Transaction, as described on page [  ]; or

     - the board of directors of LifeMinders fails, within 10 business days of
       the commencement of a tender or exchange offer, to recommend to the
       LifeMinders stockholders that they reject the tender or exchange offer.

     LifeMinders has the right to terminate the merger agreement if:

     - the volume weighted average closing price for Cross Media common stock
       over any 10 consecutive trading days prior to the closing date is less
       than $1.0915 per share; or

     - the board of directors of LifeMinders determines in good faith, after
       receipt of advice from outside counsel, that the failure to terminate the
       merger agreement upon receipt of a Superior Proposal would likely be
       inconsistent with LifeMinders' board of directors' fiduciary duties to
       LifeMinders stockholders under applicable law. For a definition of
       "Superior Proposal," see page [  ].

     Either Cross Media and/or LifeMinders may decide not to exercise its right
to terminate the merger agreement even if its right to terminate is triggered.
Neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders is required to resolicit stockholder
approval of the merger agreement if either Cross Media's or LifeMinders' right
to terminate is exercisable and Cross Media's or LifeMinders' board of directors
decides not to terminate and proceeds with the merger.

TERMINATION FEES AND EXPENSES (see page [  ])

     The merger agreement requires LifeMinders to pay Cross Media a termination
fee of $2.8 million if:

     - LifeMinders terminates the proposed merger because its board of directors
       determines in good faith, after receipt of advice from outside counsel,
       that the failure to terminate the merger agreement upon receipt of a
       Superior Proposal would likely be inconsistent with LifeMinders' board of
       directors' fiduciary duties to LifeMinders stockholders under applicable
       law;

     - Cross Media terminates the proposed merger because the board of directors
       of LifeMinders fails to include in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
       its recommendation to LifeMinders stockholders that they adopt the merger
       agreement or withdraws, adversely modifies, or fails to reaffirm its
       recommendation;

     - Cross Media terminates the proposed merger because the board of directors
       of LifeMinders approves or recommends any Alternative Transaction, as
       described on page [ ];

     - Cross Media terminates the proposed merger because the board of directors
       of LifeMinders fails, within 10 business days of the commencement of a
       tender or exchange offer, to recommend to LifeMinders stockholders that
       they reject the tender or exchange offer; or

     - LifeMinders receives an offer to enter into an Alternative Transaction
       with a third party, the merger agreement is terminated because of the
       failure to obtain LifeMinders stockholder approval and within 12 months
       after the termination of the merger agreement LifeMinders consummates an
       Alternative Transaction with a third party.

     In the event that there is a dispute as to whether the termination fee is
payable under the terms of the merger agreement, the prevailing party is
entitled to receive costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees, in
connection with any action relating to the dispute.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT OF CROSS MEDIA FOLLOWING THE MERGER (see page
[  ])

     After the merger, Cross Media will continue to be managed by its current
directors and officers. In addition, to fill two vacancies on Cross Media's
board of directors, Jonathan Bulkeley, who is currently the Chairman of the
Board of

Directors and Chief Executive Officer of LifeMinders, and Douglas A. Lindgren, a
director of LifeMinders, will become directors of Cross Media. Further, Mr.
Bulkeley will serve on the executive committee and the compensation committee of
Cross Media's board of directors and Mr. Lindgren will serve on the audit
committee of Cross Media's board of directors.

LIFEMINDERS' DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES WILL RECEIVE ACCELERATED VESTING
OF OPTIONS UNDER LIFEMINDERS STOCK OPTION PLAN AND RECEIVE OTHER BENEFITS FROM
THE MERGER (see pages [  ] and [  ])

     In considering the board of directors' recommendations that you vote in
favor of the merger agreement, you should be aware that directors, officers and
other employees of LifeMinders will receive benefits from the merger in addition
to any benefits they may receive as stockholders of LifeMinders. These benefits
include the accelerated vesting of awards under LifeMinders stock option plans
and indemnification and insurance benefits. Using a Black-Scholes option pricing
model, and based on certain assumptions on volatility, rate of return and
average time of exercise which LifeMinders considers reasonable, LifeMinders
estimates that the value of the options for which vesting will accelerate as a
result of the merger is approximately $2.3 million. The holders of LifeMinders
options for which vesting will accelerate will receive only Cross Media common
stock upon exercise of those options.

     Jonathan Bulkeley and Douglas A. Lindgren will also have positions on the
board of directors of Cross Media after the merger, and will be entitled to
receive directors' fees in those positions.

     Cross Media has extended employment offers to 20 of LifeMinders' 29
employees, including one of LifeMinders executive officers.

CROSS MEDIA

favor of the merger agreement and the amendment and restatement of Cross Media's
certificate of incorporation.

                             REASONS FOR THE MERGER

CROSS MEDIA

     The Cross Media board of directors recommends the merger because the board
believes, among other reasons, that LifeMinders will:

     - complement Cross Media's proven marketing skills in both traditional and
       online direct marketing channels because of LifeMinders' extensive
       database and personalization capabilities;

     - provide Cross Media with access to LifeMinders' 20 million member
       database that will enable Cross Media to reduce customer acquisition
       costs and increase margins by targeting offers to LifeMinders' highly
       profiled members;

     - significantly strengthen the financial position of Cross Media with
       LifeMinders' strong balance sheet; and

     - provide funding to continue Cross Media's strategy of combining internal
       growth with growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses.

     In addition, the Cross Media board of directors believes that the cost of
the merger in financial terms represents a reasonable investment by Cross Media
in furthering its business strategy.

     To review Cross Media's reasons for the merger in greater detail, see page
[  ].

LIFEMINDERS

     The LifeMinders board of directors recommends the merger because the board
of directors believes that the merger provides benefits to its stockholders,
including:

     - the creation of a stronger company that combines LifeMinders' proprietary
       technology, online direct marketing expertise, large membership base and
       substantial assets with Cross Media's established direct marketing
       operations;

     - the ability to retain ownership in a combined company that expects to
       continue LifeMinders' primary objective of becoming a leading online
       direct marketing company; and

     - the ability to receive a favorable return on their investment in
       LifeMinders common stock while also allowing those stockholders who want
       to continue their ownership interest or delay the taxation of gain on
       their stock to do so through electing to receive Cross Media common stock
       instead of cash.

     The pro forma equivalent per share price of each share of LifeMinders
common stock is the value of the Cross Media common stock that would be received
for each share of LifeMinders common stock if the merger had been completed and
shares of LifeMinders common stock had been exchanged for Cross Media common
stock on the dates indicated. The pro forma equivalent per share price is
calculated by multiplying the closing sale price per share of Cross Media common
stock reflected in the table by 1.29, the per share stock exchange ratio in the
merger.

     CROSS MEDIA AND LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO OBTAIN A CURRENT
MARKET QUOTATION FOR CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK BEFORE VOTING SHARES OR, IN THE
CASE OF LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS, MAKING AN ELECTION. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN
AS TO THE FUTURE PRICES OF, OR MARKETS FOR, CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK.

     The 1.29 stock exchange ratio fixed by the merger agreement will not change
even if the market prices of Cross Media and LifeMinders common stock change,
but can adjust for other reasons. For this reason, the market price of the
shares of Cross Media common stock that holders of LifeMinders common stock will
receive in the merger may vary significantly from the market price of the shares
of Cross Media common stock that holders of LifeMinders common stock would
receive if the merger were consummated on the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. See page [  ] for a discussion of the factors that can
cause the aggregate merger consideration to adjust.

- ---------------
(1) LifeMinders acquired four businesses in 2000. The acquisitions were
    accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, which resulted in the
    recording of approximately $51.2 million of goodwill and approximately $15.1
    million of other intangible assets. In addition to the amortization of
    goodwill, cost of revenue and depreciation and amortization expense include
    approximately $0.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively, of amortization
    expense related to other intangible assets. Revenue generated from the
    acquired businesses during 2000 was approximately $1.5 million.

(2) In December 2000, LifeMinders recorded an impairment charge of approximately
    $54.0 million, of which approximately $6.0 million is recorded in cost of
    revenue, in connection with its decision not to pursue the development and
    expansion of its wireless segment and write-down of other long-lived
    impaired assets. Prior to June 30, 2001, LifeMinders began negotiations to
    merge with Cross Media, and on July 18, 2001, LifeMinders and Cross Media
    entered into a merger agreement which was amended and restated on August 20,
    2001. Based on the value of the proposed merger transaction, LifeMinders
    determined that the carrying value of its long-lived assets as of June 30,
    2001, exceeded their fair value. LifeMinders calculated and recorded an
    impairment charge of approximately $18.0 million during the six-month period
    ended June 30, 2001, of which approximately $2.5 million is recorded in cost
    of revenue.

(3) During the six months ended June 30, 2001, LifeMinders undertook a
    restructuring plan to reduce costs and focus its efforts on reducing
    operating losses, while evaluating strategic alternatives. In connection
    with that plan, restructuring charges totaling approximately $14.2 million
    were recorded during the period.

                               DIVIDEND POLICIES

     Cross Media has never paid or declared any dividends on its common stock
and does not contemplate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Cross
Media currently intends to reinvest earnings, if any, in the development and
expansion of its business. The declaration, payment and amount of dividends in
the future is within the discretion of Cross Media's board of directors and will
depend upon Cross Media's earnings, capital requirements, financial condition
restrictions under financing documents and other relevant factors. Cross Media
is restricted from paying dividends on the common stock unless all accrued and
unpaid cumulative dividends on the outstanding Series A convertible preferred
stock have been paid or set apart for payment. As described on page [  ], Cross
Media has entered into an agreement under which, simultaneously with the
completion of the merger, all of the Series A convertible preferred stock will
be converted into Cross Media common stock and/or redeemed, thereby eliminating
this dividend payment restriction upon completion of the merger.

     LifeMinders has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common
stock or other securities. The declaration, payment and amount of dividends is
within the discretion of LifeMinders' board of directors. If the merger does not
occur, the current board of directors does not anticipate paying cash dividends
in the future, except pursuant to a plan of liquidation if the LifeMinders'
board of directors were to make a determination to liquidate LifeMinders.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     IN CONSIDERING WHETHER TO APPROVE THE MERGER AND, FOR LIFEMINDERS
STOCKHOLDERS, WHETHER TO ELECT TO CONVERT YOUR SHARES OF LIFEMINDERS COMMON
STOCK INTO CASH, CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK OR THE PRESCRIBED MIX OF CASH AND
CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK, YOU SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE RISKS WE HAVE
DESCRIBED BELOW.

RISKS RELATING TO THE MERGER

THE VALUE OF THE AGGREGATE MERGER CONSIDERATION WILL DEPEND ON THE MARKET PRICE
OF THE CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE ON WHICH THE MERGER IS COMPLETED.

     Under the terms of the amended and restated merger agreement, Cross Media
will pay a total of $24 million in cash and issue approximately 22.3 million
shares of its common stock, assuming that there is no cash shortfall, that no
LifeMinders' stock options are exercised prior to the date on which the merger
is completed and that LifeMinders stockholders elect to receive the maximum cash
consideration. The value of the aggregate merger consideration will depend upon
the market price of Cross Media common stock on the date on which the merger is
completed. Therefore, LifeMinders stockholders will not know the value of the
aggregate merger consideration at the time they vote on the merger or elect the
form of merger consideration they will receive.

     The market price of Cross Media common stock fluctuates and has declined
substantially since July 18, 2001, the date on which the original merger
agreement was signed. The market price of Cross Media common stock on the date
the merger is completed could be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the
market price of Cross Media common stock on July 18, 2001, which would result in
a lower aggregate merger consideration payable to LifeMinders securityholders.

THE VALUE OF THE PER SHARE CONSIDERATION TO BE PAID TO LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS
WHO RECEIVE CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER CANNOT CURRENTLY BE
DETERMINED AND WILL VARY DEPENDING ON THE ELECTION THAT A LIFEMINDERS
STOCKHOLDER MAKES.

     Since the value of the Cross Media common stock being issued in the merger
will depend on the market price of Cross Media common stock on the date on which
the merger is completed, the value of the per share consideration to be received
by LifeMinders stockholders who receive all or a portion of the merger
consideration in shares of Cross Media common stock cannot currently be
determined. The per share cash consideration is based on a fixed exchange ratio
and will not vary if the market price of the Cross Media common stock changes.
Therefore, the value of the per share merger consideration that LifeMinders
stockholders receive in the merger will likely vary among LifeMinders
stockholders depending on which form of merger consideration that a LifeMinders
stockholder elects to receive.

THE VALUE OF THE PER SHARE STOCK CONSIDERATION MAY BE LESS THAN THE VALUE OF THE
PER SHARE CONSIDERATION PAID TO LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS WHO ELECT TO RECEIVE
ALL OR A PORTION OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION IN CASH.

     The value of the per share merger consideration was determined based on a
market price of Cross Media common stock of $1.9845 per share, which was the
average last sale price of Cross Media common stock for the 20 trading days
immediately preceding the date of the original merger agreement. Therefore, the
value of the per share merger consideration received by stockholders electing to
receive all or a portion of the merger consideration in shares of Cross Media
common stock will be less, and could be significantly less, than the per share
merger consideration received by LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive
all cash, if the market price per share of Cross Media common stock is less than
$1.9845 on the date the merger is completed.

     Using a per share price of $[  ], the closing price of Cross Media common
stock as of [            ], 2001, the last practicable date prior to the
printing of this joint proxy statement/

prospectus, the value of the per share merger consideration that a LifeMinders
stockholder who elects to receive only Cross Media common stock would receive
would be $[       ]. Using the same per share price, the value of the per share
merger consideration that a LifeMinders stockholder electing to receive the
prescribed mix would be $[          ]. LifeMinders stockholders who receive all
cash in the merger would be paid $2.57 per share of LifeMinders common stock.
LifeMinders stockholders are urged to obtain a current market quotation for
Cross Media common stock prior to electing the form of merger consideration they
will receive in the merger.

THE AGGREGATE MERGER CONSIDERATION WILL BE REDUCED IF LIFEMINDERS' NET CASH AND
NET CASH EQUIVALENTS AT AUGUST 31, 2001 ARE LESS THAN $48.9 MILLION.

     If LifeMinders has net cash and cash equivalents, as defined on page [  ],
of less than $48.9 million on August 31, 2001, the aggregate merger
consideration to be paid to LifeMinders securityholders will be reduced by the
amount that net cash and cash equivalents are below $49 million on that date, up
to $1.75 million. In the event of a reduction in the aggregate merger
consideration resulting from a cash shortfall, the cash portion of the merger
consideration will be reduced by an amount equal to approximately 33.3% of the
reduction, and the stock portion of the merger consideration will be reduced by
approximately that number of shares equal to 66.7% of the reduction divided by
$1.9845. The determination of LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents as of
August 31, 2001 will only be an estimate and LifeMinders' actual net cash and
cash equivalents may be less.

     Cross Media has the option to terminate the merger agreement if
LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents are less than $47.25 million at
August 31, 2001. If Cross Media elects not to exercise its option to terminate
and proceeds with the merger, the reduction of the merger consideration to be
paid by Cross Media will be less than the net cash and cash equivalents
shortfall.

     For further discussion about the possible adjustments to the merger
consideration, see page [  ].

LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS WHO ELECT TO RECEIVE ALL CASH IN THE MERGER ARE LIKELY
TO RECEIVE A PORTION OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION IN CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK.

     Cross Media will not pay more than $24 million of the merger consideration
in cash, plus a portion of the proceeds from the exercise of certain options to
purchase LifeMinders common stock, less any reduction resulting from a cash
shortfall. If elections made by LifeMinders stockholders would require Cross
Media to pay more than the aggregate cash portion of the merger consideration,
the amount of cash received by those LifeMinders stockholders making all cash
elections will be reduced, with the difference being paid out in the form of
Cross Media common stock, valued at $1.9845 for this purpose. Accordingly, the
higher the percentage of LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive all cash
or the prescribed mix of cash and Cross Media common stock, the greater the
reduction of the cash portion of the merger consideration that will be paid to
those LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive all cash. At the time
LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive all cash vote on the merger and
make elections, such stockholders will not know the portion of the merger
consideration that will be paid in cash. Unless some LifeMinders stockholders
elect to receive or are deemed to have elected to receive only Cross Media
common stock, the ratio of cash to stock that LifeMinders stockholders electing
to receive all cash will receive will not be significantly greater than that of
the LifeMinders stockholders electing the prescribed mix of cash and Cross Media
common stock.

LIFEMINDERS HAS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE MERGER AGREEMENT BASED ON THE MARKET
PRICE OF CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK ONLY IF THE MARKET PRICE DROPS BELOW $1.0915
FOR MORE THAN 10 CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS.

     A reduction in the market price of Cross Media common stock could cause
some LifeMinders stockholders to vote against adoption of the amended and
restated merger agreement. LifeMinders does not have any right to terminate the
merger agreement based on the market price of Cross Media common stock, unless
the volume weighted average closing price for Cross Media common stock over any

consecutive trading days between July 18, 2001 and the closing date of the
merger is less than $1.0915 per share.

CROSS MEDIA INTENDS TO FILE A REGISTRATION STATEMENT TO REGISTER FOR RESALE
APPROXIMATELY 36 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK, WHICH MAY CAUSE THE MARKET
PRICE OF THE CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.

     Current Cross Media stockholders have the right to require Cross Media to
register for resale a substantial number of shares of common stock or shares of
common stock into or for which their convertible securities, options or warrants
are convertible or exercisable, which may facilitate the sale of these shares in
the public market. Cross Media intends to file one or more registration
statements prior to the closing of the merger to register approximately 36
million shares of Cross Media common stock, and to cause such registration
statements to become effective as soon as practicable following filing. As a
result, a substantial number of shares of Cross Media common stock in relation
to the public float of Cross Media common stock will become eligible for sale in
the public market. As a result of future sales of such common stock, or the
perception that these sales could occur, the market price of Cross Media common
stock may decline and could decline significantly before or at the time the
merger is completed or immediately thereafter. See "Description of Cross Media
Capital Stock."

IF LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS WHO RECEIVE CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER
SELL THAT STOCK IMMEDIATELY, IT COULD CAUSE A DECLINE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF
CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK.

     All of the shares of Cross Media common stock to be issued in the merger
will be registered with the SEC and therefore will be immediately available for
resale in the public market, except that shares issued in the merger to
LifeMinders stockholders who are affiliates of LifeMinders before the merger or
who become affiliates of Cross Media after the merger will be subject to certain
restrictions on transferability. The number of shares of Cross Media common
stock to be issued to LifeMinders stockholders in connection with the merger and
immediately available for resale will be substantial compared to the number of
shares of Cross Media common stock currently in the public market. LifeMinders
stockholders who are not affiliates may elect to sell the stock they receive
immediately after the merger. As a result of future sales of such common stock,
or the perception that these sales could occur, the market price of Cross Media
common stock may decline and could decline significantly before or at the time
the merger is completed or immediately thereafter. If this occurs, or if other
holders of Cross Media common stock sell significant amounts of Cross Media
common stock immediately after the merger is completed, it is likely that these
sales would cause a decline in the market price of Cross Media common stock.

THE ANTICIPATED TAX TREATMENT OF THE MERGER MAY NOT BE SUSTAINED.

     Both Cross Media and LifeMinders anticipate that the merger will qualify as
a "reorganization" for federal income tax purposes, so that LifeMinders
stockholders receiving Cross Media common stock in exchange for their
LifeMinders common stock may defer tax on all or a portion of any gain realized
on the exchange. It is anticipated that each of Cross Media and LifeMinders will
receive an opinion from its respective counsel that the merger will qualify as a
reorganization. However, factual developments could make it uncertain whether
the merger would so qualify. In addition, an opinion, though received, might be
disputed by the Internal Revenue Service. Neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders
can assure you that the merger will qualify as a reorganization.

THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE MERGER MAY NOT BE REALIZED IN A TIMELY FASHION,
OR AT ALL, AND CROSS MEDIA'S OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE
OPERATION OF LIFEMINDERS' BUSINESS DIVERTS TOO MUCH ATTENTION AWAY FROM CROSS
MEDIA'S EXISTING BUSINESS.

     The success of the merger will depend, in part, on Cross Media's ability to
realize the anticipated revenue enhancements, growth opportunities and synergies
of combining with LifeMinders and effectively utilize the net cash and other
resources Cross Media will have following the merger. The merger involves risks
related to the integration and management of acquired technology and operations
and personnel. The integration of the businesses will be a complex,
time-consuming and potentially expensive process and may

disrupt Cross Media's business if not completed in a timely and efficient
manner. Some of the difficulties that may be encountered by the combined company
include:

     - potential conflicts in distribution, marketing or other important
       relationships;

     - the diversion of management's attention from other ongoing business
       concerns;

     - the inability to utilize the acquired member database and technology
       effectively to grow Cross Media's business; and

     - potential conflicts between business cultures.

     Moreover, Cross Media and LifeMinders believe that the success of the
combined businesses is dependent, in part, on a strong media advertising market,
of which there can be no assurance. These factors could contribute to the
combined company not achieving the expected benefits from the merger in a timely
fashion, or at all.

     If Cross Media's management focuses too much time, money and effort to
integrate LifeMinders' operations and assets, they may not be able to execute
Cross Media's overall business strategy.

FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE MERGER COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT CROSS MEDIA'S OR
LIFEMINDERS' STOCK PRICES, FUTURE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS.

     If the merger is not completed for any reason, Cross Media and LifeMinders
may be subject to a number of material risks, including the following:

     - LifeMinders may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay to Cross
       Media a termination fee of up to $2.8 million;

     - Both companies may experience a negative reaction, from both the
       financial markets and customers of each company, to the termination of
       the merger; and

     - Each company must pay the costs related to the merger, such as amounts
       payable to legal and financial advisors and independent accountants, even
       if the merger is not completed.

THE LIFEMINDERS' BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS DETERMINED THAT THE CROSS MEDIA MERGER
IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF ALL OF THE LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS; HOWEVER,
INDIVIDUAL LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER OR
VOTE UPON AN ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTION.

     Under the amended and restated merger agreement, LifeMinders is obligated
to complete the merger with Cross Media unless, among other things, the
LifeMinders board of directors determines in good faith, after receipt of advice
from outside counsel, that the failure to terminate the merger agreement would
likely be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of LifeMinders' directors to
the LifeMinders stockholders under applicable law with respect to a superior
proposal. Therefore, even though LifeMinders may receive communications from
other parties regarding possible alternative transactions, LifeMinders may not
be able to pursue alternative transactions that an individual LifeMinders
stockholder finds to be more favorable to such individual stockholder's
interests than the Cross Media merger. LifeMinders stockholders that vote
against adoption of the amended and restated merger agreement will not have
appraisal rights in connection with the merger. See "The Merger" for additional
information about LifeMinders' right to consider and pursue alternative
transactions.

RISKS RELATING TO CROSS MEDIA

CROSS MEDIA HAS A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE
ITS PROSPECTS.

     Cross Media developed its present business strategy in 1999, completed its
first acquisition in January 2000 and opened its first company-owned call center
and undertook its first e-mail campaign in the last quarter of 2000. Therefore,
Cross Media has a limited history of operations under its present business
strategy upon which the likelihood of its success can be evaluated. The
implementation of a new

business strategy frequently involves risks, expenses and uncertainties that may
adversely affect Cross Media's business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.

CROSS MEDIA HAS A HISTORY OF LOSSES, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF NON-CASH CHARGES
AND INTEREST EXPENSE, AND MAY INCUR FUTURE LOSSES.

     Cross Media's net losses available to common stockholders for the year
ended December 31, 2000 were $44.6 million, or $1.84 per share. Cross Media's
net losses were primarily as a result of dividends on its preferred stock of
$39.6 million and $1.1 million, including non-cash dividends of $38.7 million
and $0.9 million. Non-cash dividends represent the accretion of the difference
between the carrying value and the mandatory redemption amounts of preferred
stock that resulted from allocating a portion of the proceeds to common stock,
common stock purchase warrants, and the beneficial conversion features of the
shares. Cross Media may incur additional non-cash dividends in connection with
the Series A agreement if the merger is not completed.

     If Cross Media's net revenues grow more slowly than it anticipates, or if
its operating expenses exceed its expectations, Cross Media's business, results
of operations, financial condition and prospects would be materially and
adversely affected. Although Cross Media realized net income during the first
six months of 2001, there can be no assurance that Cross Media will continue to
realize net income.

CROSS MEDIA MAY NEED ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO IMPLEMENT ITS STRATEGY AND EXPAND
ITS BUSINESS.

     Cross Media may need additional debt or equity financing to pursue its
strategy of expanding its business through the acquisition of companies whose
businesses are strategically appropriate for it or for its existing operations.
Although Media Outsourcing, Cross Media's principal subsidiary, has in the past
generated positive cash flow, Cross Media's credit facility limits the amount of
distributions Media Outsourcing can make to Cross Media. Any financing that
Cross Media needs may not be available at all and, if available, may not be
available on terms that are acceptable to Cross Media. The failure to obtain
financing on a timely basis, or on economically favorable terms, could prevent
Cross Media from continuing its strategy or from responding to changing business
or economic conditions, and could cause Cross Media to experience difficulty in
withstanding adverse operating results or competing effectively.

     If Cross Media raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, Cross
Media stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interest.
Moreover, Cross Media could issue preferred stock that has rights senior to
those of its common stock. If Cross Media raises funds by issuing debt
securities, these securities would have rights, preferences and privileges
senior to holders of common stock and lenders may place limitations on Cross
Media's operations.

CROSS MEDIA IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIVE CREDIT FACILITY COVENANTS WHICH COULD HARM
ITS FINANCIAL STATUS AND HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ITS STOCK PRICE.

     In January 2000, Cross Media entered into an agreement with Coast Business
Credit to provide a credit facility to finance the acquisition of its magazine
subscription teleservicing business and the ongoing working capital needs of
Media Outsourcing. Cross Media has guaranteed Media Outsourcing's obligations
under the Coast credit facility and all of Media Outsourcing's assets are
pledged to Coast to secure its obligations under the Coast facility.

     Under the agreement with Coast, Cross Media is required, among other
things, to maintain a consolidated net worth of not less than $9 million and
excess borrowing availability of $750,000. If Cross Media cannot satisfy these
or other covenants under the Coast facility, Cross Media will be required to
seek a waiver or amendment from Coast. In May 2001, Coast waived the requirement
that Cross Media maintain a minimum tangible net worth through March 31, 2001
and waived any violation of the limitation on distributions by Media Outsourcing
to Cross Media with respect to a $1 million distribution in February 2001.
Although Cross Media expects to be in compliance with the provisions of the
Coast facility agreement going forward, if it should require waivers or
amendments to the agreement, there can be no assurance that Coast will agree. If
Cross Media defaults in performing its obligations to Coast,

Coast would be entitled to accelerate the maturity of outstanding indebtedness
under the credit facility, $14.6 million as of June 30, 2001, and to enforce its
security interest in Media Outsourcing's assets.

IF CROSS MEDIA IS UNABLE TO COLLECT ITS RECEIVABLES IN A TIMELY MANNER, ITS CASH
FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

     Cross Media is subject to the risks associated with selling products on
credit, including delays in collection or uncollectibility of accounts
receivable. If Cross Media experiences significant delays in collection or
uncollectibility of accounts receivable, its liquidity and working capital
position could suffer.

IF SUBSCRIPTION CANCELLATION RESERVES ARE NOT ADEQUATE, CROSS MEDIA COULD BE
REQUIRED TO INCREASE ITS RESERVES, WHICH WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF REVENUES.

     Cross Media extends credit to subscribers who purchase multi-magazine
subscription packages. Cross Media has established a reserve to cover
subscription cancellation based upon its past history with magazine subscription
orders. In the past, Cross Media has had to increase the reserves on its 20 pay
contracts. If Cross Media's accounts subscription cancellation reserves are
inadequate, it will be required to increase reserves, which will reduce revenues
and could otherwise materially adversely effect Cross Media's results of
operations.

THE NATURE OF CROSS MEDIA'S BUSINESS MAKES IT SUSCEPTIBLE TO AN ECONOMIC
SLOWDOWN.

     Cross Media's business may be adversely affected by periods of economic
slowdown, inflation or recession, which may be accompanied by a decrease in the
availability of consumer credit. Any material decline in the availability of
consumer credit may result in a decrease in consumer demand to make credit card
purchases, which could adversely affect the demand for Cross Media's products
and services.

FUTURE GROWTH COULD PLACE SIGNIFICANT STRAIN ON CROSS MEDIA'S RESOURCES AND
CROSS MEDIA MAY BE UNABLE TO MANAGE FUTURE GROWTH.

     Growth in Cross Media operations could place a significant strain on its
operational systems and employee resources. As a result, Cross Media may have to
implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. In
order to manage and accommodate its planned growth, if it occurs, Cross Media
will need to continue to improve and adapt its financial planning, accounting
systems, information systems and management structures. Cross Media will also
need to expand, train, retain and manage its employee base. If Cross Media is
unable to manage its growth effectively, its financial condition and results of
operations could be materially adversely affected.

IF CROSS MEDIA ACQUIRES OR MAKES STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN OTHER BUSINESSES OR
ACQUIRES OR LICENSES TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER ASSETS, IT MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY
INTEGRATING THESE BUSINESSES, TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSETS OR GENERATING AN
ACCEPTABLE RETURN ON ITS INVESTMENTS.

     Cross Media may acquire or enter into strategic relationships with other
businesses and acquire or license technology and other assets. Cross Media
cannot assure you that acquisition or licensing opportunities will be available
on terms acceptable to it or at all. Any future acquisitions and strategic
relationships will involve risks, including:

     - inability to raise the required capital;

     - difficulty in assimilating the acquired assets, operations and personnel;

     - disruption of ongoing business;

     - distraction of management from other responsibilities; and

     - lack of the necessary experience to enter new markets.

     Cross Media may not successfully overcome problems encountered in
connection with potential acquisitions or licensing arrangements. In addition,
acquisitions or strategic relationships could materially impair Cross Media's
operating results, causing Cross Media to incur additional debt, or requiring
Cross Media to amortize acquisition expenses and acquired assets.

THE LOSS OF CROSS MEDIA'S LARGEST CALL CENTERS WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN A
REDUCTION OF REVENUES AND OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT OPERATING RESULTS.

     In the year ended December 31, 2000, two independent call centers accounted
for approximately 35% of Cross Media's magazine subscription revenues. These
call centers do not have any commitment to generate sales for Cross Media and
could therefore, at any time, terminate their relationships with Cross Media
without notice, which could have a material adverse effect on Cross Media's
business.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION COULD ADD SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL COSTS TO CROSS MEDIA'S
BUSINESS AND IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON ITS MARKETING PRACTICES WHICH COULD
INTERFERE WITH CROSS MEDIA'S OPERATIONS AND HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON
REVENUES.

     Laws and regulations applicable to direct marketing, telemarketing,
Internet marketing, consumer protection and membership club services are
becoming more prevalent. Each of the 50 states and the Federal government has
laws regulating telemarketing, sweepstakes promotions, promotional incentives
and advertising to consumers, which vary from state to state. While Cross Media
reviews its telemarketing scripts and advertising copy to ensure that they
comply with applicable laws, there is no guarantee that Federal or state
authorities will not find that its marketing efforts do not comply with these
laws. In addition, it is likely that additional Federal and/or state regulations
regarding telemarketing, sweepstakes, e-mail marketing and other marketing
practices engaged in by Cross Media will be enacted. If enacted, these
regulations could have an adverse effect on revenues and result in additional
expenses to Cross Media and could require Cross Media to refrain from engaging
in specific activities or modify its business practices.

     The Federal Trade Commission is currently in the process of reviewing the
provisions of the Telemarketing Sales Rule and Negative Option Rule to determine
if any changes to the rule should be made. If the Federal Trade Commission
determines that changes to the rule are necessary, changes could have a
significant adverse effect on Cross Media's business.

     In 1999, Congress enacted the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement
Act, which imposes various restrictions on the offering of sweepstakes through
the mail. Additional sweepstakes legislation has been enacted or is pending in
various states. This additional regulation could have an adverse impact on Cross
Media's marketing activities.

     Federal and state authorities have also been investigating various
companies' use of marketing practices, such as the use of personal information,
magazine subscription agents' sweepstakes practices and the marketing of
membership club services through the use of inbound and outbound telemarketing
campaigns. These investigations could result in additional rules, regulations or
industry standards, which could have an adverse impact on Cross Media's
marketing practices. At least two of the state investigations have directly
involved Memberworks, whose club memberships Cross Media is marketing. To the
extent Cross Media derives revenue from the sale of memberships in the
Memberworks club, there is a risk that Cross Media could be subject to
investigation as well, which could have an adverse impact on it.

EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND LEGAL UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO DOING
BUSINESS ON THE INTERNET COULD LIMIT CROSS MEDIA'S SALES OR ADD SIGNIFICANT
ADDITIONAL COSTS TO ITS BUSINESS.

     Laws and regulations directly applicable to Internet communications,
commerce, marketing and data protection are becoming more prevalent. If any of
these laws hinder the growth of Internet use generally or decreases the
acceptance of the Internet as a medium of communications, commerce and
marketing, Cross Media's business and prospects may suffer materially. The
United States Congress has enacted Internet

laws regarding children's privacy, copyrights and taxation. Other laws and
regulations may be adopted covering issues such as user privacy, marketing
activities, pricing, content, taxation and quality of products and services. The
governments of some states and foreign countries have begun to regulate Cross
Media's transactions and levy sales or other taxes relating to its activities
and will likely continue to do so. The laws governing the Internet remain
largely unsettled, even in areas where legislation has been enacted. It may take
years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing
intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation apply to the Internet and
Internet advertising and marketing services. In addition, the growth and
development of the market for Internet commerce may prompt calls for more
stringent consumer protection laws, both in the United States and abroad, that
may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the
Internet.

     Laws and regulations governing the transmission of unsolicited email
marketing messages are being considered in many jurisdictions. Legislation of
that type has recently been adopted by numerous states, and similar legislation
is pending in several states and in Congress. These laws could have an adverse
impact on Cross Media's Internet marketing activities. The Telecommunications
Act of 1996 prohibits some types of information and content from being
transmitted over the Internet. The prohibition's scope and the liability
associated with a Telecommunications Act violation are currently unsettled. In
addition, although substantial portions of the Communications Decency Act were
held to be unconstitutional, Cross Media cannot be certain that similar
legislation will not be enacted and upheld in the future.

CHANGES IN LAWS RELATING TO CONSUMER PRIVACY AND POTENTIALLY HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY
OF CROSS MEDIA'S SERVICES COULD HARM ITS BUSINESS.

     There has been increasing public debate about the collection, distribution
and use of information about consumers. Although this debate has primarily
focused on information collected through the Internet, many of the issues apply
to data gathered through other media. Cross Media interacts with consumers
through its various direct marketing efforts, both online and offline. As a
consequence of government regulation or evolving standards of consumer privacy
protection, Cross Media may be required to make changes to its marketing media
and platforms in ways that could diminish the effectiveness of its marketing
efforts, which could harm its business. Recently Congress passed the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which restricts the transfer of personal information,
including credit card information, by financial institutions. The Federal Trade
Commission is also considering regulations under that act. This could restrict
Cross Media's ability to acquire personal information from financial
institutions and thus adversely affect its direct marketing activities.

CROSS MEDIA HAS NOT MET ITS OBLIGATION TO REGISTER A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF
SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AND COULD HAVE LIABILITY AS A RESULT.

     Cross Media has granted holders of a substantial number of shares of its
common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise or conversion of options,
warrants and other equity rights, the rights to have their shares included in
one or more registration statements that were required to have been filed. Cross
Media has not yet filed a registration statement covering these shares and may
have liability as a result of its failure to timely file registration statement.

MARKET RELATED RISKS OF CROSS MEDIA

THE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF OPTIONS AND WARRANTS TO PURCHASE CROSS MEDIA COMMON
STOCK COULD RESULT IN DILUTION TO CROSS MEDIA STOCKHOLDERS.

     If the holders of the outstanding Cross Media options and common stock
purchase warrants exercise those options and warrants, including those issuable
in connection with the merger and warrants being issued as partial consideration
for conversion of outstanding preferred stock, and the holders of all
outstanding convertible securities converted them into common stock, Cross Media
would be required to issue approximately 19.8 million additional shares of
common stock, based on current exercise and conversion prices. The exercise of
options and warrants and convertible rights, most of which have exercise

prices or conversion rates below the current market price of Cross Media common
stock, will result in dilution to Cross Media stockholders, including
LifeMinders stockholders receiving Cross Media common stock in the merger.

OTHER RISKS RELATING TO CROSS MEDIA

BECAUSE OWNERSHIP OF CROSS MEDIA IS CONCENTRATED, A SMALL NUMBER OF STOCKHOLDERS
EXERT SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER CROSS MEDIA.

     The five largest stockholders of Cross Media beneficially owned
approximately 57% of Cross Media's issued and outstanding common stock as of
August 1, 2001, and following the merger these stockholders will continue to own
a controlling interest in Cross Media common stock. As a result, these
stockholders have the ability to exert significant influence over Cross Media's
business, including the election of directors and the approval of any other
action requiring the approval of stockholders. This concentration of share
ownership may:

     - delay or prevent a change of control of Cross Media;

     - impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination
       involving Cross Media; and/or

     - discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise
       attempting to obtain control of Cross Media.

PROVISIONS OF CROSS MEDIA'S CORPORATE CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE LAW COULD
DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL.

     Cross Media's certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of
directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred
stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined
at the time of issuance by Cross Media's board of directors, without further
action by stockholders, and may include, among other things, voting rights
(including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as
to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, and sinking fund
provisions. There is one series of preferred stock currently outstanding which
has a preference over the common stock if Cross Media is liquidated. This series
of preferred stock will be converted to common stock or redeemed simultaneously
with the completion of the merger. In addition, specific rights granted to
future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict Cross Media's
ability to merge with, or sell its assets to, a third party. The ability of
Cross Media's board of directors to issue preferred stock could discourage,
delay, or prevent a takeover of Cross Media, thereby preserving control by the
current stockholders.

     As a Delaware corporation, Cross Media is subject to the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, including Section 203, an
anti-takeover law enacted in 1988. In general, Section 203 restricts the ability
of a public Delaware corporation from engaging in a "business combination" with
an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years after the date of the
transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder. Subject to
exceptions, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates
and associates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of a
corporation's voting stock. As a result of the application of Section 203,
potential acquirers may be discouraged from attempting to acquire Cross Media,
thereby possibly depriving its stockholders of acquisition opportunities to sell
or otherwise dispose of its stock at above-market prices typical of
acquisitions.

RISKS RELATED TO LIFEMINDERS

IF THE MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED, LIFEMINDERS MAY DISCONTINUE ITS OPERATIONS AND
LIQUIDATE.

     If the merger is not completed and LifeMinders is unable to conclude that
another sale or merger transaction would be in the best interests of its
stockholders, the board of directors may determine that the best alternative is
to discontinue operations, sell LifeMinders remaining non-cash assets and, after
payment of all obligations, distribute the net proceeds to its stockholders. The
amount and timing of any

distributions to stockholders in a liquidation cannot be determined because they
would depend on a variety of factors, including the amount of proceeds received
from any asset sales or dispositions, the time and amount required to resolve
outstanding obligations and the amount of any reserves for future contingencies.
In addition, LifeMinders will have incurred substantial costs associated with
the merger which will be payable regardless of whether the merger is
consummated. Payment of these costs will reduce LifeMinders' remaining cash
balance and the amount that would otherwise be distributable to LifeMinders'
stockholders in a liquidation. In certain circumstances, LifeMinders is
obligated to pay Cross Media a fee of $2.8 million if the merger agreement is
terminated, which would further reduce LifeMinders' cash balance.

LIFEMINDERS HAS SCALED BACK ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND HAS SIGNIFICANTLY
REDUCED ITS WORK FORCE. LIFEMINDERS EXPECTS THAT THESE ACTIONS, COUPLED WITH
CONTINUING WEAKNESS IN THE ONLINE ADVERTISING MARKET, WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE
ANY FUTURE REVENUES.

     As announced on May 10, 2001, the LifeMinders' board of directors decided
to significantly scale back its business operations and reduce its work force.
LifeMinders believes that its revenues from online advertising and other
existing lines of business for the foreseeable future will continue to decline
substantially from that reported in prior periods. LifeMinders expects this
decline because, among other reasons, it believes that:

     - the market for online advertising will continue to decline significantly;

     - opportunities for online advertising revenues will decline because the
       company will be producing and delivering a substantially lower number of
       emails;

     - LifeMinders does not expect to develop any new email products during this
       period; and

     - LifeMinders' management and other key employees will spend a significant
       portion of their time completing the merger, or in the event the merger
       is not completed, in identifying and evaluating strategic alternatives.

     In addition, LifeMinder's existing advertising customers may choose not to
place online advertising with LifeMinders as a result of concerns about the
future of its business operations.

LIFEMINDERS HAS INCURRED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AND, IF THE MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED,
EXPECTS CONTINUED LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

     LifeMinders has never achieved profitability and, if the merger is not
completed and LifeMinders continues its operations, expects to continue to incur
operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of June 30, 2001, LifeMinders
had an accumulated deficit of $194.3 million. LifeMinders incurred net losses of
$50.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001, and $109.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2000. LifeMinders cannot be certain that, if the merger
is not completed and the company continues its operations, it will ever generate
sufficient revenue to achieve profitability. If LifeMinders' future revenue is
lower than currently anticipated, or its operating expenses exceed its
estimates, it would incur greater losses than anticipated and LifeMinders would
be required to further reduce its cash balance to support its continued
operations. Such circumstances could make LifeMinders less desirable as an
acquisition candidate, reduce its value in any sale or merger transaction, and
reduce the amount of proceeds available to LifeMinders' stockholders in the
event of a liquidation. If this merger is not completed, there is no guarantee
that LifeMinders will be able to identify or successfully complete a sale or
merger of LifeMinders.

LIFEMINDERS COMMON STOCK HAS EXPERIENCED A SHARP DECLINE IN VALUE. IF THE MERGER
IS NOT COMPLETED, LIFEMINDERS' STOCK PRICE MAY CONTINUE TO DECLINE.

     The market price of LifeMinders common stock has experienced a decline and,
if the merger is not completed, may decline further as a result of LifeMinders'
decision to scale back business operations, or as a result of fluctuations in
its quarterly results of operations. The market price of LifeMinders common

stock has declined from a high of $91.00 per common share at March 9, 2000 to a
low of $0.53 at April 3, 2001. On August 10, 2001, the closing price per share
of LifeMinders common stock as reported on The Nasdaq National Market was $1.54
per share. LifeMinders believes that the market price of its common stock has
been significantly and adversely affected by the sharp decline in the online
advertising market. LifeMinders also believes that, if the merger is not
completed, its common stock price may decline further in the future as a result
of LifeMinders' decision to scale back operations and because of the
significantly lower revenues reported in its quarterly results of operations for
the quarters ended December 31, 2000, March 31, 2001 and June 30, 2001. In
addition, LifeMinders believes that in the future, fluctuations in its quarterly
results and the negative online advertising market, as well as many of the other
risk factors pertaining to LifeMinders, may negatively affect LifeMinders'
quarterly operating results and contribute to fluctuations in its common stock
price.

     If the merger is not completed, LifeMinders may continue to seek and
evaluate potential strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger
of LifeMinders. A further decline in the price of LifeMinders common stock may
adversely affect LifeMinders' ability to complete an alternative transaction
using LifeMinders stock as all or part of the consideration.

     In addition, if the price of LifeMinders common stock remains low, it may
be delisted by Nasdaq and become subject to special rules applicable to low
priced stocks, which may reduce the liquidity of the shares.

LIFEMINDERS' ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE ITS SCALED DOWN BUSINESS, COMPLETE
THIS MERGER, OR IDENTIFY, EVALUATE AND COMPLETE ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTIONS IF THIS
MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED, IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO RETAIN THE REMAINING
MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES.

     Since the fourth quarter of 2000, LifeMinders has laid off approximately
85% of its workforce. LifeMinders may have difficulty retaining the remaining
members of its management team and other key employees on whom it will depend to
continue to operate its scaled down business and complete this merger, and, if
the merger is not completed, to assist in identifying, evaluating and completing
any alternative transactions. If LifeMinders is unable to retain its management
and other key employees through this process, continuation of its business
operations and its ability, if necessary, to identify, evaluate and complete an
alternative transaction could be materially and adversely affected. LifeMinders
has agreed to pay bonuses to certain employees that are key to LifeMinders'
continued operations if they remain employed until August 31, 2001. The merger
will not be completed by this date, and LifeMinders cannot be certain that these
key employees will remain with LifeMinders until the merger is completed or, if
this merger is not completed, until it can identify, evaluate and complete an
alternative transaction.

LIFEMINDERS HAS ONLY A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY UPON WHICH TO EVALUATE ITS
BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS.

     LifeMinders has only a limited operating history upon which to evaluate its
business and prospects and the online direct marketing industry is relatively
new and rapidly evolving. This presents many risks and uncertainties including:

     - the ability to compete effectively against other companies;

     - the need to retain and motivate qualified personnel;

     - the ability to anticipate and adapt to the changing market;

     - the ability to develop and introduce new products and services and
       continue to develop and upgrade technology; and

     - the need to attract and retain a large number of customers from a variety
       of industries.

     LifeMinders has also historically depended on the growing use of the
Internet for advertising, commerce and communications, and on general economic
conditions.

     LifeMinders cannot assure you that it will successfully address these risks
and uncertainties, particularly because of its recent scaling back of
operations. If the merger is not completed, and LifeMinders is unsuccessful in
addressing these risks and uncertainties, it may not be able to generate
sufficient revenue to fund its continued operations. In that event, LifeMinders
would be required to reduce its cash balances to fund operations, which could
make it less desirable as an acquisition candidate or reduce its value in any
sale or merger transaction, and would reduce the amount of proceeds available
for distribution to LifeMinders stockholders in the event of a liquidation of
LifeMinders.

IF THE MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED, LIFEMINDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE
SUFFICIENT REVENUE TO SUPPORT ITS CONTINUED OPERATIONS IF THE MARKET FOR ONLINE
ADVERTISING, WHICH IS NEW AND UNPREDICTABLE, DOES NOT DEVELOP AND EXPAND.

     LifeMinders has historically derived a substantial portion of its revenue
from online advertising and direct marketing, including both email and Web-based
programs. The profit potential for this business model is unproven. The Internet
has not existed long enough as an advertising medium to demonstrate its
effectiveness relative to traditional advertising. Advertisers and advertising
agencies that have historically relied on traditional advertising may be
reluctant or slow to adopt online advertising. Many potential advertisers have
limited or no experience using email or the Web as an advertising medium. They
may have allocated only a limited portion of their advertising budgets to online
advertising, or may find online advertising to be less effective for promoting
their products and services than traditional advertising media. Further,
LifeMinders' email and Web-based programs may not generate sufficient user
traffic with demographic characteristics attractive to advertisers. LifeMinders
is also affected by general industry conditions governing the supply and demand
of Internet advertising.

     LifeMinders' results of operations have been adversely affected in recent
quarters as a result of a significantly declining market for online advertising,
and LifeMinders expects that those adverse market conditions will continue. If
the market for online advertising fails to improve or deteriorates more than
LifeMinders expects and the merger is not completed, LifeMinders may not be able
to generate sufficient revenue to support its continued operations. In that
event, LifeMinders would be required to reduce its cash balance, which could
make it less desirable as an acquisition candidate or reduce its value in any
sale or merger transaction, and would reduce the amount of proceeds available
for distribution to its stockholders in the event of a liquidation of
LifeMinders.

LIFEMINDERS' ADVERTISING CUSTOMERS AND THE COMPANIES WITH WHICH IT HAS OTHER
BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS MAY EXPERIENCE ADVERSE BUSINESS CONDITIONS THAT COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT LIFEMINDERS' BUSINESS.

     Some of LifeMinders' customers may experience difficulty in supporting
their current operations and implementing their business plans. These customers
may reduce their spending on LifeMinders' products and services, or may not be
able to discharge their payment and other obligations to LifeMinders. The
non-payment or late payment of amounts due to LifeMinders from a significant
customer would negatively impact LifeMinders' financial condition. These
circumstances are influenced by general economic and industry conditions, and
could have a material adverse impact on LifeMinders' business, financial
condition and results of operations. In addition to intense competition, the
overall market for Internet advertising has been characterized in recent
quarters by increasing softness of demand, the reduction or cancellation of
advertising contracts, an increased risk of uncollectible receivables from
advertisers, and the reduction of Internet advertising budgets, especially by
Internet-related companies. LifeMinders' customers may experience difficulty in
raising capital, or may be anticipating such difficulties, and therefore may
elect to scale back the resources they devote to advertising, including on
LifeMinders' system. Other companies in the Internet industry have depleted
their available capital, and could cease operations or file for bankruptcy
protection. If the merger is not completed and the current environment for
LifeMinders' customers and the demand for Internet advertising does not improve,
LifeMinders' business, results of operations and financial condition could be
materially adversely affected.

IF LIFEMINDERS DOES NOT MAINTAIN AN ENGAGED MEMBER BASE, IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
COMPETE EFFECTIVELY FOR, OR MAINTAIN, ADVERTISERS AND ITS BUSINESS COULD BE
ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

     LifeMinders' revenue has been derived primarily from advertisers seeking an
engaged, targeted audience for their advertisements. Although LifeMinders
intends to continue to produce and distribute emails to its members, it has
scaled back its business operations and has reduced the number of emails it
sends to members. LifeMinders has discontinued most of its member related
marketing activities. Accordingly, LifeMinders does not expect growth in its
member base, nor does it expect to develop new products.

     A significant portion of LifeMinders' revenue has historically been derived
from performance-based and revenue sharing arrangements. Under these
arrangements, advertisers pay LifeMinders in part based on member responses to
advertisements and promotions placed in email newsletters. If LifeMinders'
members do not respond to advertisements and promotions placed in email
newsletters, the company's revenue could be materially and adversely affected.

     If LifeMinders is unable to maintain an engaged member base by keeping its
current members active (i.e., opening email newsletters and responding to the
advertisements contained in those newsletters), advertisers could find
LifeMinders' audience less attractive and effective for promoting their products
and services. LifeMinders currently expects that it will experience difficulty
retaining its existing advertisers, and has ceased its efforts to solicit
additional advertisers, which will likely reduce its future revenues from online
advertising and opt-in advertising, which represent a majority of LifeMinders'
revenues to date.

COMPETITION IN THE ONLINE ADVERTISING MARKET INDUSTRY IS INTENSE, AND
LIFEMINDERS' SCALED BACK OPERATIONS MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR IT TO COMPETE
EFFECTIVELY AND MAY REDUCE ITS ABILITY TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT ADVERTISERS.

     If the merger is not completed and LifeMinders continues operations, it
will continue to face intense competition from both traditional and online
advertising and direct marketing businesses. LifeMinders scaled back operations
will make it more difficult to compete effectively with its competitors. If it
is not able to compete effectively, LifeMinders may not be able to retain
current advertisers or attract new advertisers. This would reduce LifeMinders'
revenues and it would need to reduce its cash balance to support its continued
operations, which could make LifeMinders less desirable for an alternative
transaction and would reduce the amount of proceeds available for distribution
to stockholders in the event of a liquidation. LifeMinders faces competition for
marketing dollars from online portals and community Web sites such as AOL,
Yahoo!, and CNET Networks, Inc. In addition, other companies offer competitive
email direct marketing services, including coolsavings.com, MyPoints.com,
NetCreations, YesMail.com and Digital Impact. Additionally, traditional
advertising agencies and direct marketing companies may seek to offer online
products or services that compete with those offered by LifeMinders.

     Many of LifeMinders' existing competitors, as well as a number of potential
new competitors, have longer operating histories, greater name recognition,
larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical and
marketing resources than LifeMinders. LifeMinders' competitors will most likely
continue to develop and market new technologies and products and to conduct
research allowing them to identify and respond to changes in customer
requirements. In addition, these competitors will continue to aggressively
market and sell their products and services. LifeMinders has scaled back its
operations, resulting in a lack of material resources being committed to
marketing and sales activities by LifeMinders. As a result, it is unlikely that,
if the merger is not completed, LifeMinders will be able to effectively compete
in the market for a long period of time, and its business, results of operations
or financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.

LIFEMINDERS RELIES HEAVILY ON ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND OTHER
PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, AND ANY FAILURE TO PROTECT AND MAINTAIN THESE RIGHTS
AND INFORMATION COULD PREVENT LIFEMINDERS FROM COMPETING EFFECTIVELY.

     LifeMinders' ability to continue operations in the event the merger is not
completed is substantially dependent on its internally developed technologies
and trademarks, which LifeMinders seeks to protect through a combination of
patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark law, as well as confidentiality or
license agreements with employees, consultants, and corporate and strategic
partners. If LifeMinders is unable to prevent the unauthorized use of its
proprietary information or if its competitors are able to develop similar
technologies independently, the competitive benefits of LifeMinders'
technologies, intellectual property rights and proprietary information will be
diminished. These circumstances could also make the company less desirable in an
alternative transaction.

     LifeMinders depends heavily on its network infrastructure and if this fails
it could result in unanticipated expenses, as well as prevent LifeMinders'
members from effectively utilizing LifeMinders' services. This could negatively
impact LifeMinders' ability to retain members and advertisers.

     LifeMinders' ability to successfully create and deliver its email
newsletters depends in large part on the capacity, reliability and security of
its networking hardware, software and telecommunications infrastructure.
Failures of the network infrastructure could result in unanticipated expenses to
address such failures and could prevent LifeMinders' members from effectively
utilizing its services, which could prevent LifeMinders from retaining members
and advertisers. LifeMinders does not have fully redundant systems or a formal
disaster recovery plan. The system is susceptible to natural and man-made
disasters, including earthquakes, fires, floods, power loss and vandalism.
Further, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, electronic break-ins or
other similar disruptive problems could adversely affect the operation of the
systems. LifeMinders' insurance policies may not adequately compensate it for
any losses that may occur due to any damages or interruptions in the systems.
Accordingly, LifeMinders could be required to make capital expenditures in the
event of unanticipated damage.

     In addition, LifeMinders' members depend on Internet service providers, or
ISPs, for access to the LifeMinders Web site. Due to the rapid growth of the
Internet, ISPs and Web sites have experienced significant system failures and
could experience outages, delays and other difficulties due to system failures
unrelated to LifeMinders' systems. These problems could harm LifeMinders'
business by preventing its members from effectively utilizing its services.

LIFEMINDERS' QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS AND
IT MAY BE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL AND CYCLICAL PATTERNS THAT MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT
ITS STOCK PRICE.

     LifeMinders believes that its business may be subject to seasonal
fluctuations. Advertisers historically have placed fewer advertisements during
the first and third calendar quarters of each year.

     Further, Internet user traffic typically drops during the summer months,
which potentially could reduce the amount of advertising placed during that
period. Expenditures by advertisers and direct marketers tend to vary in cycles
that reflect overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying
patterns. LifeMinders revenue has in the past been, and may in the future be,
materially affected by a decline in the economic prospects of customers or in
the economy in general, which could alter the company's customers' spending
priorities or budget cycles. Because of these and other factors, LifeMinders
revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.

THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN LIFEMINDERS' EMAILS MAY SUBJECT IT TO SIGNIFICANT
LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENCE, COPYRIGHT OR TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER MATTERS.

     If any of the content that LifeMinders creates and delivers to its members
or any content that is accessible from its emails through links to other Web
sites contains errors, third parties could make claims against LifeMinders for
losses incurred in reliance on such information. In addition, the content
contained in or accessible from LifeMinders' emails could include material that
is defamatory, violates the copyright

or trademark rights of third parties, or subjects it to liability for other
types of claims. LifeMinders' general liability insurance may not cover claims
of these types or may not be adequate to indemnify it for all liability that may
be imposed. Any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not
covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could result in
significant costs and expenses and damage LifeMinders' reputation.

     LifeMinders has also entered into agreements with certain e-commerce
partners under which LifeMinders may be entitled to receive a share of certain
revenue generated from the purchase of goods and services through direct links
to LifeMinders' e-commerce partners from the emails sent by LifeMinders. These
agreements may expose LifeMinders to additional legal risks and uncertainties,
including potential liabilities to consumers of those products and services by
virtue of its involvement in providing access to those products or services,
even if LifeMinders itself does not provide those products or services. Any
indemnification provided to LifeMinders in its agreements with these parties, if
available, may not adequately protect it.

CONCERNS ABOUT, OR BREACHES OF, THE SECURITY OF LIFEMINDERS' MEMBER DATABASE
COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES TO PREVENT BREACHES, AND SUBJECT THE
COMPANY TO LIABILITY FOR FAILING TO PROTECT THE MEMBERS' INFORMATION.

     LifeMinders maintains a database containing information about its members.
Unauthorized users accessing LifeMinders' systems remotely may access its
database or authorized users may make unauthorized copies of all or part of the
database for their own use in violation of specific agreements to the contrary.
As a result of these security and privacy concerns, LifeMinders may incur
significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to
alleviate problems caused by security breaches, and it may be unable to
effectively target direct marketing offers to members or may be subject to legal
claims of members if unauthorized third parties gain access to LifeMinders'
system and alter or destroy information in its database. Also, any public
perception that LifeMinders engaged in the unauthorized release of member
information, whether or not correct, would adversely affect its ability to
retain members.

LIFEMINDERS' BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE REFUSAL OF ONE OR MORE
ELECTRONIC EMAIL DELIVERY PROVIDERS TO DELIVER LIFEMINDERS', OR ITS CUSTOMERS',
MESSAGES.

     LifeMinders' business may be adversely affected by the unilateral election
of certain domain administrators to block, filter or otherwise prevent the
delivery of Internet advertising or commercial emails to their users.
LifeMinders cannot assure you that the number of domains which establish
policies restricting their users receipt of commercial deliveries as
consideration for receiving service will not become increasingly more popular,
thereby diminishing the reach of LifeMinders' service, or the service of its
customers.

LIFEMINDERS' BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY PRODUCTS OFFERED BY THIRD
PARTIES.

     LifeMinders ability to continue operating its business may be adversely
affected by the adoption by computer users of technologies that harm the
performance of its products and services, such as technologies that allow domain
administrators on the aggregate level, or individual users managing their own
electronic email accounts, to block, filter or otherwise prevent the delivery of
Internet advertising or commercial emails, or to block access to any services
that use cookies or other tracking technologies. LifeMinders cannot assure you
that the number of domains or individual computer users who employ these or
other similar technologies will not increase, thereby diminishing the efficacy
of LifeMinders', or its customers', services. LifeMinders' business, financial
condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected
if one or more of these technologies is widely accepted.

SWEEPSTAKES REGULATION MAY LIMIT LIFEMINDERS' ABILITY TO CONDUCT SWEEPSTAKES AND
OTHER CONTESTS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT ITS ABILITY TO RETAIN MEMBERS.

     The conduct of sweepstakes, lotteries and similar contests, including by
means of the Internet, is subject to extensive federal, state and local
regulation, which may restrict LifeMinders' ability to offer contests and
sweepstakes in some geographic areas or altogether. Any restrictions on these
promotions could adversely affect LifeMinders' ability to retain members.

IF THE PRICE OF LIFEMINDERS STOCK REMAINS VOLATILE, LIFEMINDERS MAY BECOME
SUBJECT TO SECURITIES LITIGATION, WHICH IS EXPENSIVE AND COULD DIVERT ITS
RESOURCES.

     In the past, following periods of market volatility in the price of a
company's securities, security holders have instituted class action litigation.
Many companies in the industry in which LifeMinders operates have been subject
to this type of litigation. LifeMinders' stock price has been volatile since the
company's initial public offering in November 1999. If the market value of
LifeMinders stock continues to experience adverse fluctuations, and LifeMinders
becomes involved in this type of litigation, regardless of the outcome,
LifeMinders could incur substantial legal costs and management's attention could
be diverted, causing the business to suffer.

LIFEMINDERS' BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF DEMAND FOR INTERNET
ADVERTISING FAILS TO GROW AS PREDICTED OR DIMINISHES.

     The Internet advertising industry is new and rapidly evolving, and it
cannot yet be compared with traditional advertising media to gauge its
effectiveness. As a result, demand and acceptance for Internet advertising
solutions is uncertain. Many of LifeMinders' advertising customers have limited
experience using the Internet for advertising purposes and they have allocated
only a limited portion of their advertising budgets to Internet advertising. The
adoption of Internet advertising, particularly by those entities that have
historically relied upon traditional media for advertising, requires the
acceptance of a new way of conducting business, exchanging information and
advertising products and services. These customers may find Internet advertising
to be less effective for promoting their products and services relative to
traditional advertising media. LifeMinders cannot assure you that its
advertising customers will continue to allocate a portion of their advertising
budget to Internet advertising or that the demand for Internet advertising will
continue to develop to sufficiently support Internet advertising as a
significant advertising medium. LifeMinders' results of operations have been
adversely affected in recent quarters as a result of a significantly declining
market for online advertising, and the company expects that these adverse market
conditions will continue. If the market for online advertising fails to improve
or deteriorates more than expected, LifeMinders' business, results of operations
and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

     There are currently no generally accepted standards or tools for the
measurement of the effectiveness of Internet advertising or the planning of
advertising purchases, and generally accepted standard measurements and tools
may need to be developed to support and promote Internet advertising as a
significant advertising medium. LifeMinders' advertising customers may challenge
or refuse to accept the measurements of advertisement delivery results developed
by LifeMinders or a third party. In addition, the accuracy of database
information used to target advertisements is essential to the effectiveness of
Internet advertising that may be developed in the future. The information in
LifeMinders' database, like any database, may contain inaccuracies that its
customers may not accept.

     A significant portion of LifeMinders' revenue has historically been derived
from the delivery of advertisements, which are designed to contain the features
and measuring capabilities requested by advertisers. If advertisers determine
that those ads are ineffective or unattractive as an advertising medium or if
LifeMinders is unable to deliver the features or measuring capabilities
requested by advertisers, the long-term growth of its online advertising
business could be limited and revenue levels could decline. There are also
'filter' software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being
delivered to a user's computer. The commercial viability of Internet
advertising, and LifeMinders' business, results of operations

and financial condition, would be materially and adversely affected by Web
users' widespread adoption of this software.

THE UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OF CONFIDENTIAL MEMBER INFORMATION THAT LIFEMINDERS
TRANSMITS OVER PUBLIC NETWORKS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO RETAIN
MEMBERS.

     Members transmit confidential information to LifeMinders over public
networks and the unauthorized access of such information by third parties could
harm LifeMinders' reputation and significantly hinder its efforts to retain
members. LifeMinders relies on a variety of security techniques and
authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security
and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential
information, including customer credit card numbers. Advances in computer
capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments
may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by LifeMinders to
protect customer transaction data.

PROBLEMS WITH THE PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY OF THE INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE
COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
LIFEMINDERS OFFERS ITS MEMBERS AND ADVERTISERS.

     LifeMinders depends on the Internet infrastructure to deliver attractive,
reliable and timely email newsletters to its members. If Internet usage grows,
the Internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it
by this growth, and its performance and reliability may decline. Among other
things, continued development of the Internet infrastructure will require a
reliable network backbone with necessary speed, data capacity and security.
Currently, there are regular failures of the Internet network infrastructure,
including outages and delays, and the frequency of these failures may increase
in the future. These failures may reduce the benefits of LifeMinders' products
and services to its members and undermine the company's advertising partners'
and members' confidence in the Internet as a viable commercial medium. In
addition, the Internet could lose its viability as a commercial medium due to
delays in the development or adoption of new technology required to accommodate
increased levels of Internet activity or due to government regulation.

LIFEMINDERS MAY HAVE TO LITIGATE TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER
PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OR TO DEFEND CLAIMS OF THIRD PARTIES, AND SUCH LITIGATION MAY
SUBJECT IT TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY AND EXPENSE.

     There is a substantial risk of litigation regarding intellectual property
rights in Internet-related businesses. Legal standards relating to the validity,
enforceability and scope of protection of certain proprietary rights in
Internet-related businesses are uncertain and still evolving. LifeMinders may
have to litigate in the future to enforce its intellectual property rights,
protect its trade secrets or defend itself against claims of violating the
proprietary rights of third parties. This litigation may subject LifeMinders to
significant liability for damages and result in invalidation of proprietary
rights. In addition, such litigation could be time-consuming and expensive to
defend, even if not meritorious, and result in the diversion of management time
and attention. Any of these factors could adversely affect LifeMinders' business
operations, financial results, condition and cash flows.

CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATION COULD DECREASE LIFEMINDERS' REVENUE AND
INCREASE ITS COSTS.

     Laws applicable to Internet communications, on-line privacy, digital
advertising, data protection and direct marketing are becoming more prevalent.
Any legislation enacted or regulation issued could dampen the growth and
acceptance of the digital marketing industry in general and of LifeMinders'
offerings in particular. Existing and proposed legislation in the United States,
Europe (following the directive of the European Union) and Canada may impose
limits on LifeMinders collection and use of certain kinds of information about
its members.

     Moreover, the laws governing the Internet remain largely unsettled, even in
areas where there has been some legislative action. It may take years to
determine whether, and how, existing laws such as those governing intellectual
property, data protection, libel and taxation apply to the Internet and Internet
advertising. In addition, the growth and development of Internet commerce may
prompt calls for more

stringent consumer protection laws, both in the United States and abroad, that
may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the
Internet.

CHANGES IN LAWS RELATING TO DATA COLLECTION AND USE PRACTICES AND THE PRIVACY OF
INTERNET USERS AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS COULD HARM LIFEMINDERS' BUSINESS.

     New limitations on the collection and use of information relating to
Internet users are currently being considered by legislatures and regulatory
agencies in the United States and internationally. LifeMinders is unable to
predict whether any particular proposal will pass, or the nature of the
limitations in those proposals that do pass. Since many of the proposals are in
their developmental stages, LifeMinders is unable to determine the impact these
may have on its business. In addition, it is possible that changes to existing
law, including new interpretations of existing law, could have a material and
adverse impact on LifeMinders' business, financial condition and results of
operations.

                        SPECIAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

     Cross Media and LifeMinders are sending you this joint proxy
statement/prospectus in order to provide you with important information
regarding the merger and for Cross Media stockholders, the amendment and
restatement of Cross Media's certificate of incorporation and the amendment to
Cross Media's 1998 Stock Option Plan and to solicit your proxy for use at the
special meetings and at any adjournments or postponements of the special
meetings. The special meetings are scheduled to be held at the times and places
described below.

CROSS MEDIA SPECIAL MEETING

     General.  The Cross Media special meeting is scheduled to be held on
[            ], 2001 at [            ] local time, at the American Stock
Exchange, 86 Trinity Place, 14th Floor, New York, New York 10006. At the Cross
Media special meeting, Cross Media stockholders will have the opportunity to
consider and vote upon the following:

     - the adoption of the amended and restated merger agreement;

     - the adoption of the amendment and restatement of Cross Media's
       certificate of incorporation including, among other things, increasing
       the number of shares of common stock that Cross Media has authority to
       issue from 100,000,000 to 150,000,000 shares;

     - the adoption of the amendment to Cross Media's 1998 Stock Option Plan to
       increase the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued
       under the plan from 8,000,000 to 14,000,000; and

     - any other matters properly brought before the Cross Media special
       meeting, including approval of any adjournment or postponement of the
       special meeting.

     THE CROSS MEDIA BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED THE AMENDED AND RESTATED
MERGER AGREEMENT, THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF CROSS MEDIA'S CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION AND THE AMENDMENT TO CROSS MEDIA'S 1998 STOCK OPTION PLAN, AND
RECOMMENDS THAT CROSS MEDIA STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" ADOPTION OF THE AMENDED AND
RESTATED MERGER AGREEMENT, THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF CROSS MEDIA'S
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND THE AMENDMENT TO CROSS MEDIA'S 1998 STOCK
OPTION PLAN.

     Record Date.  The Cross Media board of directors has fixed the close of
business on [            ], 2001, as the record date for the determination of
holders of shares of Cross Media common stock entitled to notice of and to vote
at the Cross Media special meeting.

     Stock Entitled to Vote.  As of [            ], 2001, there were
[            ] shares of Cross Media common stock issued and outstanding held by
approximately [            ] stockholders of record. Each holder of Cross Media
common stock as of the record date will have the right to one vote with respect
to the matters to be acted upon at the Cross Media special meeting for each
share registered in the holder's name on the books of Cross Media as of the
close of business on [            ], 2001.

     Quorum; Required Vote.  The presence, in person or by properly executed
proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Cross Media
common stock entitled to vote at the Cross Media special meeting is necessary to
constitute a quorum. Under Delaware law, the affirmative vote of the majority of
the shares outstanding and entitled to vote is required for adoption of the
amended and restated merger agreement and adoption of the amendment and
restatement of Cross Media's certificate of incorporation. The affirmative vote
of the holders of Cross Media common stock representing a majority of the shares
present in person or represented by proxy at the Cross Media special meeting and
entitled to vote on the proposal is required to adopt the amendment to Cross
Media's 1998 Stock Option Plan.

     The merger agreement requires Cross Media to have a sufficient number of
authorized but unissued shares to complete the merger. Accordingly, Cross Media
stockholders must adopt the amendment and restatement of Cross Media's
certificate of incorporation in order for Cross Media to consummate the merger.

     Stock Ownership.  As of [            ], 2001, the directors and executive
officers of Cross Media had the right to vote, in the aggregate, 36,533,328
shares of Cross Media common stock representing approximately 3.1% of the total
votes entitled to be cast at the Cross Media special meeting. Stockholders who
collectively have the power to vote 59.6% of Cross Media common stock have
agreed in writing to vote their shares at the Cross Media Special Meeting in
favor of the amended and restated merger agreement and the amendment and
restatement of Cross Media's certificate of incorporation.

     Voting and Revocation of Proxies.  All shares of Cross Media common stock
represented by a proxy properly signed and received at or prior to the Cross
Media special meeting, unless subsequently revoked, will be voted in accordance
with the instructions on the proxy. IF A PROXY IS SIGNED AND RETURNED WITHOUT
INDICATING ANY VOTING INSTRUCTIONS, THE SHARES OF CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK
REPRESENTED BY THE PROXY WILL BE VOTED "FOR" ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT,
THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF CROSS MEDIA'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND
THE AMENDMENT TO CROSS MEDIA'S 1998 STOCK OPTION PLAN. You may revoke your proxy
by giving written notice of revocation to Cross Media at any time before it is
voted, by submitting to Cross Media a duly executed, later-dated proxy or by
voting the shares subject to the proxy by written ballot at the Cross Media
special meeting. All written notices of revocation and other communications with
respect to revocation of Cross Media proxies should be addressed to: Cross Media
Marketing Corporation, 461 Fifth Avenue, 19th Floor, New York, New York 10017,
Attention: Jason Buerkle, Director of Financial Operations. Attendance at the
Cross Media special meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of
a proxy.

     The Cross Media board of directors is not aware of any business to be acted
upon at the Cross Media special meeting other than as described in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. If however, other matters are brought before the
Cross Media special meeting which are incident to the conduct of the Cross Media
special meeting, the persons appointed as proxies will have discretion to vote
or act on the matters according to their best judgment.

     If a stockholder's shares are held of record in "street name" by a broker,
bank or other nominee and the stockholder intends to vote the shares in person
at the Cross Media special meeting, the stockholder must bring to the meeting a
letter from the broker, bank or other nominee confirming the stockholder's
beneficial ownership of the shares to be voted.

     Abstentions and "broker non-votes," explained below, will be counted as
shares present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.
Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against the
amended and restated merger agreement, the amendment and restatement of Cross
Media's certificate of incorporation. Abstentions will have the effect of a vote
against adoption of the amendment to Cross Media's 1998 Stock Option Plan.
Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote to adopt the
amendment to Cross Media's 1998 Stock Option Plan. Similarly, the failure to
either return your proxy card or attend the Cross Media special meeting in
person and vote in favor of adoption of the amended and restated merger
agreement, the amendment and restatement to Cross Media's certificate of
incorporation will have the same effect as a vote against the proposals. Broker
non-votes are shares held in the name of a broker or nominee for which an
executed proxy is received, but which are not voted on the proposal because the
voting instructions have not been received from the beneficial owner or persons
entitled to vote and the broker or nominee does not have the discretionary power
to vote those shares.

     Solicitation of Proxies.  Proxies are being solicited on behalf of Cross
Media's board of directors. The solicitation of proxies may be made by
directors, officers and regular employees of Cross Media or its subsidiaries in
person or by mail, telephone, facsimile or telegraph without additional
compensation payable for that solicitation. Arrangements will be made with
brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward proxy
soliciting materials to the beneficial owners of Cross Media common stock held
of record by these persons, and Cross Media will reimburse them for reasonable
expenses incurred by them in so doing. The cost of the solicitation will be
borne by Cross Media.

     No Appraisal Rights.  Cross Media stockholders will not be entitled to
appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the merger. See "The
Merger -- No Appraisal Rights for Cross Media and LifeMinders Stockholders."

     Stockholder Proposals.  A stockholder proposal must be received by Cross
Media on or prior to January 9, 2002 at 461 Fifth Avenue, 19th Floor, New York,
New York 10017 in order to be eligible for inclusion in Cross Media's proxy
statement for its 2002 annual meeting of stockholders.

LIFEMINDERS SPECIAL MEETING

     General.  The LifeMinders special meeting is scheduled to be held on [ ],
2001, at [            ], located at [            ] at [            ], local
time. At the LifeMinders special meeting, LifeMinders stockholders will have the
opportunity to consider and vote upon the following items:

     - the adoption of the amended and restated merger agreement; and

     - any other matters properly brought before the LifeMinders special
       meeting, including approval of any adjournment or postponement of the
       special meeting.

     THE LIFEMINDERS BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED THE AMENDED AND RESTATED
MERGER AGREEMENT AND RECOMMENDS THAT LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE
ADOPTION OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED MERGER AGREEMENT.

     Record Date.  The LifeMinders board of directors has fixed the close of
business on [            ], 2001, as the LifeMinders record date for the
determination of holders of shares of LifeMinders common stock entitled to
notice of and to vote at the LifeMinders special meeting.

     Stock Entitled to Vote.  As of August 1, 2001, there were 26,625,463 shares
of LifeMinders common stock issued and outstanding, held by approximately 391
stockholders of record. Each holder of LifeMinders common stock as of the record
date will have the right to one vote with respect to the matters to be acted
upon at the LifeMinders special meeting for each share registered in the
holder's name on the stock records of LifeMinders as of the close of business on
[            ], 2001.

     Quorum.  The presence, in person or by properly executed proxy, of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of LifeMinders common stock
entitled to vote at the LifeMinders special meeting, is necessary to constitute
a quorum. The shares owned by stockholders present at the meeting or represented
by a properly executed proxy, but who abstain from voting on any proposal, will
be treated as shares that are present and entitled to vote at the LifeMinders
special meeting for determining whether or not a quorum exists, but will not be
counted as a vote cast in favor of any proposal.

     Required Vote.  Under Delaware law, the affirmative vote of the holders of
a majority of shares outstanding and entitled to vote is required for adoption
of the amended and restated merger agreement. Broker non-votes and abstentions
have the same effect as a vote against adoption of the amended and restated
merger agreement. LifeMinders' bylaws provide that the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of common stock present in person or by proxy at the
meeting is required to postpone or adjourn the LifeMinders special meeting.

     Stock Ownership.  As of [            ], 2001, the current directors and
executive officers of LifeMinders held the right to vote in the aggregate
approximately [          ] shares of LifeMinders common stock, representing
approximately [     ]% of the shares outstanding. Stockholders who collectively
have the power to vote [   ]% of LifeMinders common stock have agreed in writing
to vote their shares at the LifeMinders special meeting in favor of the merger
agreement.

     Voting and Revocation of Proxies.  All shares of LifeMinders common stock
represented by a proxy properly signed and received at or prior to the vote
being taken at the LifeMinders special meeting, unless

subsequently revoked, will be voted in accordance with the instructions on the
proxy. A proxy may be revoked by:

     - a written, dated document delivered to LifeMinders prior to the meeting
       stating that the proxy is revoked;

     - a subsequent proxy that is signed by the same person who signed the
       earlier proxy and is presented at or prior to the meeting; or

     - attendance at the LifeMinders special stockholders meeting and voting in
       person.

     If a stockholder's shares are held of record in "street name" by a broker,
bank or other nominee and the stockholder intends to vote the shares in person
at the LifeMinders special meeting, the stockholder must bring to the meeting a
letter from the broker, bank or other nominee confirming the stockholder's
beneficial ownership of the shares to be voted.

     LifeMinders is not currently aware of any business other than the proposal
to approve and adopt the merger agreement to be acted upon at the LifeMinders
special meeting. If, however, any other matters are properly brought before the
meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the persons named in the
enclosed form of proxy, and acting under that proxy, will have discretion to
vote or act on those matters in accordance with their best judgment, including
any proposal to adjourn the meeting (except that a proxy voted against adoption
and approval of the merger agreement will not be voted in favor of adjournment
of the meeting). Adjournments may be made for the purpose of, among other
things, soliciting additional proxies. Any adjournment may be made from time to
time by approval of the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes
present in person or by proxy at the meeting, whether or not a quorum exists,
without further notice other than by an announcement at the meeting. LifeMinders
does not currently intend to seek an adjournment of its meeting unless an
adjournment is necessary to solicit additional votes.

     You may abstain from voting on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
If you mark your proxy "ABSTAIN" with respect to the proposal, you will in
effect be voting against the merger. In addition, if you fail to send in your
proxy, this, too, will have the same negative effect. If your broker holds your
shares in its name, the broker cannot vote your shares on the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement without your instructions. This is a "broker non-vote." A
broker non-vote with respect to the proposal will have the effect of a vote
against the proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on
the outcome of any vote to postpone or adjourn the LifeMinders special meeting.

     Solicitation of Proxies.  Directors, officers and employees will not
receive additional compensation for their efforts during this solicitation, but
may be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
solicitation. After the original mailing of the proxies and other solicitation
materials, LifeMinders will request that brokers, custodians, nominees and other
record holders of LifeMinders common stock forward copies of the proxy and
solicitation materials to beneficial owners for whom they hold shares.
LifeMinders intends to reimburse these holders of record for reasonable expenses
incurred in forwarding these materials.

     No Appraisal Rights.  LifeMinders stockholders are not entitled to
appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the merger. See "The
Merger -- No Appraisal Rights for Cross Media and LifeMinders Stockholders."

     Stockholder Proposals.  LifeMinders expects that the merger will be
completed before its 2001 annual meeting and therefore, does not anticipate that
it will hold an annual meeting in 2001. In the event that the merger is not
completed and LifeMinders does continue to hold annual meetings, stockholder
proposals intended to be included in the proxy statement for the 2002
LifeMinders annual meeting should be sent to the Secretary of LifeMinders at
13530 Dulles Technology Drive, Suite 500, Herndon, Virginia 20171. Notice of any
stockholder proposal to be made at the 2002 LifeMinders annual meeting of
stockholders, if held, must be received on or prior to December 17, 2001.

                                   THE MERGER

     At their respective special meetings, Cross Media stockholders and
LifeMinders stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to
adopt the amended and restated merger agreement.

MATERIAL TERMS OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following is a brief summary of the material terms of the amended and
restated merger agreement. This summary is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the amended and restated merger agreement which is incorporated by
reference and attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. You
are urged to read the amended and restated merger agreement carefully.

     MERGER CONSIDERATION; ELECTION OF CONSIDERATION; NO FRACTIONAL AMOUNTS

     As a result of the merger, LifeMinders will be merged with and into Cross
Media, with Cross Media being the surviving company. Under the terms of the
amended and restated merger agreement, Cross Media will pay a total of $24
million in cash and issue approximately 22.3 million shares of its common stock,
assuming that no LifeMinders' stock options are exercised prior to the date on
which the merger is completed and that LifeMinders stockholders elect to receive
the maximum cash consideration. If LifeMinders stockholders do not elect to
receive the maximum cash consideration, then the number of shares of common
stock that Cross Media will issue in the merger will increase by an amount equal
to $24 million less the amount of the total cash consideration paid in the
merger, divided by $1.9845. The $1.9845 value of the Cross Media common stock
used for this purpose is based on the average last sale price of Cross Media
common stock for the 20 trading days immediately preceding July 18, 2001, the
date of the original merger agreement, and is not necessarily indicative of the
value of such stock. The aggregate value of the merger consideration will depend
upon the market price of Cross Media common stock on the date the merger is
completed. The aggregate merger consideration that Cross Media will pay to
LifeMinders securityholders will increase by an amount equal to the aggregate
exercise price of any LifeMinders options with an exercise price of $2.57 or
less, that are exercised before the merger is completed. The per share
consideration payable to LifeMinders stockholders will not affected by such
increase in the aggregate merger consideration.

     The aggregate merger consideration is subject to a reduction of up to $1.75
million to the extent that LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents are less
than $49 million at August 31, 2001, but no reduction will be made if
LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents on that date are at least $48.9
million. In the event of a reduction in the aggregate merger consideration
resulting from a cash shortfall, the cash portion of the merger consideration
will be reduced by an amount equal to approximately 33.3% of the reduction, and
the stock portion of the merger consideration will be reduced by approximately
the number of shares equal to 66.7% of the reduction divided by $1.9845. See
page [  ] for a definition of net cash and cash equivalents.

     Upon completion of the merger, each share of LifeMinders common stock will
be converted into cash, shares of Cross Media common stock, or a mix of cash and
Cross Media common stock. Under the merger agreement, each LifeMinders
stockholder will be able to elect to receive all cash, all stock or a prescribed
mix of approximately 33.3% cash and 66.7% stock, provided that in no event will
the aggregate cash consideration paid to the LifeMinders stockholders exceed the
aggregate maximum cash portion of the merger consideration. The aggregate
maximum cash portion of the merger consideration is $24 million, subject to the
following adjustments:

     - an increase of approximately 33.3% of the aggregate exercise price of any
       LifeMinders options with an exercise price of $2.57 or less that are
       exercised on a cash basis before the merger is completed; and/or

     - a decrease of approximately 33.3% of any reduction in the aggregate
       merger consideration resulting from a cash shortfall, if any.

In the event that the cash elections, including the cash portion to be received
by LifeMinders stockholders who elect the prescribed mix of cash and stock,
exceed the maximum aggregate cash portion of the merger consideration, the cash
portion to be paid to LifeMinders stockholders electing all cash will be reduced
and they will receive shares of Cross Media common stock, valued for this
purpose at $1.9845 per share (regardless of the actual market value of Cross
Media common stock at the time the merger is completed), for the balance. Any
LifeMinders stockholder who does not make an effective election prior to the
election deadline, and any LifeMinders stockholder who acquires shares of
LifeMinders common stock after the election deadline, will be deemed to have
elected to receive all Cross Media common stock.

     LifeMinders stockholders should complete and return the enclosed election
form in the enclosed envelope so that it is received by the close of business on
the date of the LifeMinders special meeting. In addition, prior to the close of
business on the date of the LifeMinders special meeting, each LifeMinders
stockholder must:

     - return his or her stock certificate, if the LifeMinders stockholder's
       shares are registered in the stockholder's name;

     - complete and return the guarantee of delivery included as part of the
       election form if the LifeMinders stockholder's shares are held in "street
       name;" or

     - complete and return a lost certificate affidavit which is included as
       part of the election form.

If a LifeMinders stockholder does not properly complete and return an election
form along with the applicable stock certificates, a guarantee of delivery for
the shares of LifeMinders common stock covered by the election form or a
completed lost certificate affidavit by the by the close of business on the date
of the LifeMinders special meeting, then that stockholder will receive only
Cross Media common stock as set forth above.

     No fractional shares of Cross Media common stock will be issued in the
merger. Any LifeMinders stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Cross Media common stock will instead receive cash in
accordance with the terms of the amended and restated merger agreement.

     You should carefully review Section 2.4 of the amended and restated merger
agreement attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

     PER SHARE CASH AND PER SHARE STOCK CONSIDERATION FOR LIFEMINDERS COMMON
STOCK

     Assuming there is no adjustment for a shortfall in LifeMinders' net cash
and cash equivalents at August 31, 2001, LifeMinders stockholders receive the
maximum cash consideration of $24 million and no options to purchase LifeMinders
common stock are exercised before the date on which the merger is completed,
Cross Media will issue approximately 22.3 million shares of its common stock to
LifeMinders stockholders in the merger. Based on these assumptions each share of
LifeMinders common stock will be converted into approximately:

     - $2.57 in cash for those LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive all
       cash, but if elections made by LifeMinders stockholders would require
       Cross Media to pay more than the aggregate maximum cash portion of the
       merger consideration, the amount of cash will be reduced, with the
       difference being paid in shares of Cross Media common stock, valued for
       this purpose at $1.9845 per share;

     - 1.29 shares of Cross Media common stock for those LifeMinders
       stockholders electing to receive all stock; or

     - $0.86 in cash and .86 shares of Cross Media common stock for those
       LifeMinder stockholders electing to receive the prescribed mix.

     If any options to purchase LifeMinders common stock with an exercise price
above $2.57 per share are exercised before the consummation of the merger, the
per share cash and per share stock consideration that LifeMinders stockholders
will receive will be reduced because the number of shares of LifeMinders' common
stock outstanding at the time the merger is completed will increase.

     The value of the Cross Media common stock being issued in the merger will
depend on the market price on the date on which the merger is completed. The
value of the per share merger consideration was determined based on a market
price of Cross Media common stock of $1.9845 per share, which was the average
last sale price of Cross Media common stock for the 20 trading days immediately
preceding the date of the original merger agreement. The value of the per share
consideration to be received by LifeMinders stockholders who elect to receive
all or a portion of the merger consideration in shares of Cross Media common
stock cannot currently be determined. The per share cash consideration is based
on a fixed exchange ratio and will not vary if the market price of the Cross
Media common stock changes. Therefore, the value of the per share merger
consideration that LifeMinders stockholders receive in the merger will likely
vary among LifeMinders stockholders depending on which form of merger
consideration that a LifeMinders stockholder elects to receive.

     Assuming that there is no cash shortfall and that no LifeMinders stock
options are exercised prior to the date on which the merger is completed, and
using the per share price of $[  ], the closing price of Cross Media common
stock as of [            ], 2001, the last practicable date prior to the
printing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus:

     - the value of the per share merger consideration that a LifeMinders
       stockholder who elects to receive only Cross Media common stock would
       receive would be $[  ];

     - the value of the per share merger consideration that a LifeMinders
       stockholder electing to receive the prescribed mix would be $[  ]; and

     - LifeMinders stockholders who receive all cash in the merger would be paid
       $2.57 per share of LifeMinders common stock.

     LifeMinders stockholders are urged to obtain a current market quotation for
Cross Media common stock prior to electing the form of merger consideration they
will receive in the merger.

     You should carefully review Section 2.4 of the amended and restated merger
agreement attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

     THE AGGREGATE CONSIDERATION THAT LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE IN
THE MERGER WILL BE REDUCED IF LIFEMINDERS' NET CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT
AUGUST 31, 2001 ARE LESS THAN $48.9 MILLION

     The merger agreement provides that the aggregate nominal merger
consideration that LifeMinders stockholders will receive in the merger is
subject to a reduction of up to $1.75 million to the extent that LifeMinders'
net cash and cash equivalents, as defined below, are less than $49 million at
August 31, 2001, but no reduction will be made if LifeMinders' net cash and cash
equivalents on that date are at least equal to $48.9 million. In the event of a
reduction in the aggregate merger consideration resulting from a cash shortfall,
the cash portion of the merger consideration will be reduced by an amount equal
to approximately 33.3% of the reduction, and the stock portion of the merger
consideration will be reduced by approximately that number of shares equal to
66.7% of the reduction divided by $1.9845. Accordingly, the amount of cash
and/or the number of shares that a LifeMinders stockholder will receive as
consideration for its LifeMinders' shares will be reduced if LifeMinders' net
cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2001 are less than $48.9 million. See
"The Merger -- Material Terms of the Amended and Restated Merger
Agreement -- Merger Consideration; Election of Consideration; No Fractional
Amounts." You should carefully review Section 2.4 of the amended and restated
merger agreement attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

     LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents includes its:

     - cash, excluding restricted cash and cash received from option exercises
       after July 18, 2001;

     - marketable securities, including accrued interest income; and

     - selected accounts receivable and prepaid accounts; and

     are reduced by LifeMinders':

     - accounts payable;

     - accrued expenses;

     - certain severance payments;

     - additional payoffs for certain liabilities; and

     - a reasonable estimate of LifeMinders' expenses incurred in connection
       with the merger between September 1, 2001 and the date on which the
       merger is completed.

     TREATMENT OF LIFEMINDERS STOCK OPTIONS

     Under the merger agreement, each outstanding option to purchase LifeMinders
common stock issued under the LifeMinders option plans, whether or not vested or
immediately exercisable, will be assumed by Cross Media, through Cross Media's
assumption of the plans. Upon the completion of the merger, each LifeMinders
stock option will be automatically adjusted to provide that:

     - the number of shares of Cross Media common stock which will be issued
       upon the exercise of the LifeMinders stock option will be that number of
       shares of LifeMinders common stock which would have been issued upon
       exercise of the LifeMinders stock option immediately before the
       completion of the merger multiplied by the per share exchange ratio for
       LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive only Cross Media common
       stock of approximately 1.29, rounded down to the nearest whole share; and

     - the exercise price per share of Cross Media common stock under the
       LifeMinders stock option will be an amount equal to the exercise price
       per share of LifeMinders common stock under the LifeMinders stock option
       immediately before the completion of the merger, divided by the per share
       exchange ratio for LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive only
       Cross Media common stock of approximately 1.29; provided, that if the
       above formula results in an aggregate exercise price that requires the
       payment of a fraction of a cent at the time of exercise, with the
       exercise price considered in the aggregate for all options being
       exercised by each holder, then the aggregate exercise price for the
       shares shall be further adjusted upwards to the nearest whole cent.

     There are outstanding options to purchase approximately 2.2 million shares
of LifeMinders common stock with an exercise price equal to or below $2.57 per
share, and options to purchase approximately 942,990 shares of LifeMinders
common stock with an exercise price above $2.57 per share.

     In March 2001, LifeMinders granted options to its executive officers and a
small number of employees. These option grants provide that vesting of these
options will accelerate upon certain events, including the merger. If the merger
is completed, options to purchase approximately 1.5 million shares of
LifeMinders common stock will vest at the effective time of the merger. If the
merger is not completed, these options may still vest on an accelerated schedule
if LifeMinders completes:

     - an alternative merger; or

     - an event of liquidation.

     The options will vest at the effective time of either event.

     In addition, if the employment of a holder of a March 2001 option grant is
involuntarily terminated without cause, as that term is described in the option
grant, prior to the effective date of an alternative merger or liquidation
event, the vesting of his or her options will accelerate to the time of such
termination.

     LifeMinders will amend the LifeMinders Employee Stock Purchase Plan to
provide that upon consummation of the merger:

     - no additional purchase rights will be issued under the LifeMinders
       Employee Stock Purchase Plan; and

     - each purchase right granted under LifeMinders Employee Stock Purchase
       Plan will terminate, if it has not previously terminated by its terms.

     IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MERGER, LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS WILL OWN A MINIMUM
OF APPROXIMATELY 36.8% OF THE OUTSTANDING CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK

     Assuming there is no reduction in the merger consideration for a cash
shortfall, LifeMinders stockholders elect to receive the maximum cash portion of
the merger consideration and no options to purchase LifeMinders common stock
with an exercise price equal to or below $2.57 per share are exercised before
the date on which the merger is completed, Cross Media will issue in the merger
approximately 22.3 million shares of Cross Media common stock to LifeMinders
stockholders. Assuming none of the options to purchase approximately 2.2 million
shares of LifeMinders common stock with an exercise price equal to or below
$2.57 per share are exercised before the merger, Cross Media will issue options
to purchase approximately 2.9 million shares of Cross Media common stock in
exchange for such options to purchase LifeMinders common stock. Assuming that
the issuance of approximately 1.7 million shares of Cross Media common stock to
The Shaar Fund, Ltd. upon the conversion of half of its shares of Cross Media
Series A convertible preferred stock in accordance with the Series A agreement
described on page [  ], the issuance of approximately 22.3 million shares of
Cross Media common stock in the merger and none of the Cross Media options,
warrants and other equity rights are exercised or converted, the shares of Cross
Media common stock issued to LifeMinders stockholders in the merger will
constitute approximately 36.8% of the common stock of Cross Media after the
merger. If all of the options to purchase approximately 2.9 million shares of
Cross Media common stock which may be issued in the merger, as described above,
are exercised, based on the assumptions set forth in the previous sentence,
after the merger, LifeMinders stockholders will own approximately 39.7% of the
common stock of Cross Media.

     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     The merger agreement contains statements and promises made by Cross Media
about itself called representations and warranties. In addition, the merger
agreement contains representations and warranties made by LifeMinders. You can
review the representations and warranties contained in Articles III and IV of
the merger amended and restated agreement attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex A.

     CONDUCT OF BUSINESS PENDING THE MERGER

     The merger agreement contains covenants and agreements that govern Cross
Media's and LifeMinders' actions until the merger is completed or the merger
agreement is terminated. These covenants and agreements require each of Cross
Media and LifeMinders to take actions or to refrain from taking actions with
respect to various matters, including that:

     - unless consented to in writing by the other party, Cross Media,
       LifeMinders and their respective subsidiaries will not take any action,
       except in the ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent with
       the business plans disclosed to the other party; and

     - Cross Media, LifeMinders and their respective subsidiaries will use their
       best efforts to preserve substantially intact their existing businesses
       and business organizations, to keep available the services of those of
       their present officers, employees and consultants who are integral to the
       operation of their businesses as presently conducted and to preserve
       their present relationships with

       significant customers and suppliers and with other persons with whom they
       have significant business relations.

     The merger agreement also lists specific actions that Cross Media and
LifeMinders are restricted from taking or must take, from the time the merger
agreement was signed until the merger is consummated or the merger agreement is
terminated, and each in effect agree to operate their respective companies in
substantially the same manner as the respective company was operating prior to
the signing of the merger agreement. A complete list of these actions is set
forth in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the merger agreement, and include, among other
things, the following:

     - neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders may amend its certificate of
       incorporation or bylaws, except Cross Media may amend its certificate of
       incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Cross Media
       common stock from 100,000,000 shares to 150,000,000, and clarify the
       indemnification provisions of its certificate of incorporation as
       described on page [  ];

     - neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders may enter into any contract with
       provisions or obligations that would require actions or omissions that
       are inconsistent with the provisions of the merger agreement;

     - neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders may take any action, other than those
       set forth in the merger agreement, that would cause the shares of the
       respective company to cease to be quoted or listed on the exchange or
       quotation system on which such shares were quoted at the time the merger
       agreement was signed;

     - neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders may take any action that would
       prevent the merger from qualifying as a tax-free reorganization under
       Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code;

     - neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders may participate in the sale of all or
       substantially all of its assets or any merger, other than as permitted in
       the merger agreement;

     - neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders may acquire the business or bulk
       assets of any person, except Cross Media may acquire the business or any
       bulk assets of any person for an amount not to exceed $1 million
       individually or in the aggregate;

     - neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders may issue, sell, transfer, pledge,
       hypothecate or otherwise encumber or dispose of any shares of its capital
       stock or any shares of capital stock or other securities of any of its
       subsidiaries; except that Cross Media or LifeMinders may issue shares of
       capital stock pursuant to equity rights outstanding on August 20, 2001;
       and, subject to LifeMinders' consent, which consent shall not be
       unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, Cross Media may issue and
       sell up to 1.0 million shares of its unregistered common stock at a per
       share price which is not less than 75% of the closing price for a share
       of Cross Media common stock on the American Stock Exchange on the
       business day immediately prior to the date on which Cross Media requests
       LifeMinders' consent;

     - neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders will acquire any shares of its
       capital stock or other securities, except Cross Media may purchase shares
       of its stock pursuant to the terms of its Series A purchase agreement;
       and

     - neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders will incur any material indebtedness,
       except Cross Media may incur, in addition to the indebtedness outstanding
       on August 20, 2001, additional indebtedness of up to $2 million.

     To review all of the covenants contained in the merger agreement, you
should read Articles V and VI of the merger agreement which is attached to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

     NO SOLICITATION

     LifeMinders has agreed that neither it nor its employees, subsidiaries or
advisors will, directly or indirectly through another person:

     - solicit, initiate, encourage or induce the making, submission or
       announcement of any "Alternative Transaction" (as described below);

     - furnish any non-public information to any person in connection with, or
       participate in any negotiations with respect to, or knowingly take any
       other action designed to facilitate, any Alternative Transaction; or

     - participate in any discussions regarding any Alternative Transaction.

     However, this prohibition will not apply if at any time prior to receiving
the approval of LifeMinders stockholders, the board of directors of LifeMinders
determines in good faith, after receipt of advice from outside counsel, that the
failure to provide information or participate in negotiations or discussions
would likely be inconsistent with LifeMinders' board of directors' fiduciary
duties to LifeMinders stockholders under applicable law. In that case and
subject to restrictions set forth in the merger agreement, LifeMinders may, in
response to a "Superior Proposal" (as described below), furnish information with
respect to it and its subsidiaries to any person pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement and participate in negotiations regarding the
proposal. LifeMinders will promptly notify Cross Media orally and in writing of
any request for information or of any proposal in connection with an Alternative
Transaction, its material terms and conditions and the identity of the person
making the request or proposal and will keep Cross Media reasonably informed of
the status and details of the request or proposal on a current basis.

     For purposes of the merger agreement, an "Alternative Transaction" means a
proposal, intended proposal, signed agreement or completed action for any of the
following:

     - a transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any third party
       acquires or would acquire beneficial ownership of more than 20% of the
       outstanding shares of LifeMinders common stock;

     - any acquisition or proposed acquisition of, or business combination with,
       LifeMinders, or any of its subsidiaries;

     - any other transaction pursuant to which any third party acquires or would
       acquire, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the assets of LifeMinders
       or any of its subsidiaries; or

     - the grant of any license to use LifeMinders' intellectual property, other
       than licenses in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
       practice.

     A "Superior Proposal" means any proposal made by a third party to enter
into an Alternative Transaction which LifeMinders' board of directors determines
in its good faith judgment (based on, among other things, the advice of a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable to
LifeMinders stockholders than the merger, taking into account all relevant
factors.

     The merger agreement does not prohibit LifeMinders from:

     - taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a
       tender offer required by law; or

     - making any disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good faith judgment
       of the LifeMinders board of directors, after receipt of advice from
       outside counsel, failure to make disclosure would likely be inconsistent
       with LifeMinders' board of directors' fiduciary duties to LifeMinders
       stockholders under applicable law.

     STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS

     Cross Media and LifeMinders have agreed to hold meetings of their
stockholders to consider and vote on the adoption of the merger agreement and,
for Cross Media, the adoption of the amendment and

restatement of Cross Media's certificate of incorporation promptly after the SEC
declares this joint proxy statement/prospectus effective. The Cross Media board
of directors has recommended adoption of the amended and restated merger
agreement and adoption of the amendment and restatement of its certificate of
incorporation and the LifeMinders board of directors has recommended adoption of
the merger agreement. LifeMinders has agreed that its board of directors will
not:

     - except as discussed below, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify or
       propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
       adverse to Cross Media, its recommendation of adoption of the merger
       agreement;

     - approve or recommend or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
       Alternative Transaction; or

     - cause LifeMinders to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
       principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to
       any Alternative Transaction.

     However, if the LifeMinders' board of directors receives a Superior
Proposal and determines in good faith that the failure to do so would likely be
inconsistent with LifeMinders' board of directors' fiduciary duties to
LifeMinders stockholders under applicable law, the LifeMinders board of
directors may inform its stockholders that it no longer recommends adoption of
the merger agreement. LifeMinders' board of directors may do this at a time that
is after the fifth business day following notice to Cross Media, and after
giving a reasonable opportunity to Cross Media to make adjustments in the terms
and conditions of the merger agreement.

     INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

     In the merger agreement, Cross Media agreed to continue to indemnify
directors and officers of LifeMinders and its subsidiaries, for a period of
three years following the completion of the merger, to the extent and in
accordance with the provisions for indemnification and advancement of fees and
expenses contained in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of LifeMinders
in effect on August 20, 2001 to the extent arising out of any action or omission
occurring at any time before the completion of the merger and made in his or her
capacity as a director or officer of LifeMinders or its subsidiaries. This
indemnification obligation is in addition to any obligation Cross Media will
have under Sections 145 and 259 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

     For a period of six years following the completion of the merger, Cross
Media has agreed to maintain in effect, to the extent available, directors' and
officers' liability insurance covering directors and officers of LifeMinders and
its subsidiaries who were covered by LifeMinders' directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy on terms no less favorable to those covered as those
applicable under the policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance
maintained by LifeMinders on August 20, 2001.

     Each person seeking indemnification is subject to and must adhere to the
limitations, procedures and guidelines set forth in the merger agreement. To
review all of the limitations, procedures and guidelines related to the
provisions of indemnification and insurance coverage, you should read Section
5.5 of the merger agreement attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Annex A.

     - Cross Media will have received releases, in form reasonably satisfactory
       to LifeMinders, from certain of its securityholders for failure to timely
       register certain securities; and

     - LifeMinders' calculation of the Shortfall, as defined in Section 2.4 of
       the merger agreement, and Shortfall Adjustment, as defined in Section 2.4
       of the merger agreement, pursuant to the merger agreement will have been
       calculated based upon financial information provided to Cross Media which
       was true, correct and complete in all material respects; and to the
       extent the calculations included estimated amounts, the estimates will
       have been made in good faith based upon reasonable assumptions.

     To review all of the conditions contained in the merger agreement, you
should read Article VII of the amended and restated merger agreement, which is
attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

     CLOSING DATE AND EFFECTIVE TIME

     The closing of the merger will take place as soon as practicable after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to closing stated in the merger
agreement at the offices of legal counsel for Cross Media in New York City
unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Cross Media and
LifeMinders. Immediately following the closing of the merger, the parties will
file a certificate of merger with the State of Delaware. The merger will take
effect at the time this filing is made with the State of Delaware.

     TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     At any time before the closing of the merger, Cross Media and LifeMinders
may terminate the merger agreement by mutual consent in writing. In addition,
either Cross Media or LifeMinders may terminate the merger agreement for any of
the following reasons:

     - LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2001 have not
       been finally determined by November 30, 2001;

     - the merger has not been completed by December 31, 2001, or a later date
       agreed upon by the parties;

     - any of the required approvals of stockholders of Cross Media or
       LifeMinders have not been obtained at a duly held meeting, including any
       adjournments thereof; or

     - if a court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental entity shall
       have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, in any
       case having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
       prohibiting the merger, which order, decree, ruling or other action is
       final and nonappealable.

     In addition, the merger agreement may be terminated by Cross Media if:

     - LifeMinders breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of
       its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained
       in the merger agreement whereby the conditions to Cross Media
       consummating the merger would not be satisfied, which breach or failure
       to perform is not, or cannot be, cured within 20 calendar days after
       written notice thereof;

     - a condition to Cross Media consummating the merger cannot be satisfied
       prior to December 31, 2001, or a later date agreed upon by the parties;

     - LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2001 are less
       than $47.25 million; Cross Media's failure to give written notice to
       LifeMinders within 10 days after the Shortfall is determined will
       constitute a waiver of its right to terminate the merger agreement under
       this provision; or

     - the board of directors of LifeMinders or any committee of the board of
       directors of LifeMinders:

        - fails to include in the joint proxy statement/prospectus its
          recommendation without modification or qualification that the
          LifeMinders stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the
          transactions contemplated thereby;

        - withdraws or adversely modifies its recommendation to the LifeMinders
          stockholders that they adopt the merger agreement and approve the
          transactions contemplated thereby;

        - fails to reaffirm its recommendation upon Cross Media's request;

        - approves or recommends any Alternative Transaction, as described on
          page [  ];

        - fails, within 10 business days of the commencement of a tender or
          exchange offer, to recommend to the LifeMinders stockholders and, if
          applicable, holders of LifeMinders equity rights, as defined in the
          merger agreement, that they reject the tender or exchange offer; or

        - resolves to take any of the foregoing actions.

     Further, the merger agreement may be terminated by LifeMinders if:

     - Cross Media breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of
       its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained
       in the merger agreement whereby the conditions to LifeMinders
       consummating the merger would not be satisfied, which breach or failure
       to perform is not, or cannot be, cured within 20 calendar days after
       written notice thereof;

     - if a condition to LifeMinders consummating the merger cannot be satisfied
       prior to December 31, 2001, or a later date agreed upon by the parties;

     - if the board of directors of LifeMinders determines in good faith, after
       receipt of advice from outside counsel, that the failure to terminate the
       merger agreement would likely be inconsistent with LifeMinders' board of
       directors' fiduciary duties to LifeMinders stockholders under applicable
       law with respect to a Superior Proposal; or

     - the volume weighted average closing price for Cross Media common stock
       over any 10 consecutive trading days prior to the closing date is less
       than $1.0915 and LifeMinders notifies Cross Media

       within 10 calendar days after the date on which the volume weighted
       average closing price for Cross Media common stock over a 10 consecutive
       trading day period first falls below $1.0915; LifeMinders failure to give
       this notice will constitute a waiver of its right to terminate the merger
       agreement under this provision.

     TERMINATION FEES

     The merger agreement requires LifeMinders to pay to Cross Media a cash
termination fee of $2.8 million in the event the merger agreement is terminated
for any of the following reasons:

     - LifeMinders terminates the merger agreement because its board of
       directors determines in good faith, after receipt of advice from outside
       counsel, that the failure to terminate the merger agreement would likely
       be inconsistent with LifeMinders' board of directors' fiduciary duties to
       LifeMinders' stockholders under applicable law with respect to a Superior
       Proposal;

     - Cross Media terminates the merger agreement because the board of
       directors of LifeMinders or any committee of the board of directors of
       LifeMinders:

        - fails to include in the joint proxy statement/prospectus its
          recommendation without modification or qualification that the
          LifeMinders stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the
          transactions contemplated thereby;

        - withdraws or adversely modifies its recommendation to the LifeMinders
          stockholders that they adopt the merger agreement and approve the
          transactions contemplated thereby;

        - fails to reaffirm its recommendation upon Cross Media's request;

        - approves or recommends any Alternative Transaction;

        - fails, within 10 business days of the commencement of a tender or
          exchange offer, to recommend to the LifeMinders stockholders and, if
          applicable, holders of LifeMinders equity rights, as defined in the
          merger agreement, that they reject the tender or exchange offer; or

        - resolves to take any of the foregoing actions; or

        - if the merger agreement could not have been terminated by Cross Media
          as a result of LifeMinders board of directors failure to recommend
          (without modification or qualification), or withdrawal of its
          recommendation of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement to
          its stockholders, but the merger agreement is subsequently terminated
          by Cross Media or LifeMinders as the result of the failure to obtain
          LifeMinders stockholder approval, and prior to the LifeMinders
          stockholders meeting, another party proposes an Alternative
          Transaction, and within twelve months after the termination of the
          merger agreement, LifeMinders or its stockholders consummate an
          Alternative Transaction.

     In the event that there is a dispute as to whether the termination fee is
payable under the terms of the merger agreement, the prevailing party is
entitled to receive costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees, in
connection with any action relating to the dispute.

     EXPENSES

     Cross Media and LifeMinders will each pay its own costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the related transactions.
However, if the merger is not consummated, Cross Media and LifeMinders will
share equally the expenses incurred in connection with the printing of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and the related filing fees.

     PROCEDURES FOR LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS TO RECEIVE PAYMENT

     Cross Media and LifeMinders have jointly selected, [          ], to act as
the "exchange agent" under the merger agreement. Within 15 business days after
the merger is completed, the exchange agent

will issue to LifeMinders stockholders who have returned their completed
election forms together with LifeMinders stock certificates, guaranty of
delivery or proof of lost certificate, the cash and/or shares of Cross Media
common stock to which each stockholder is entitled. Within 15 business days
after the merger is completed, the exchange agent will send to LifeMinders
stockholders who did not timely send in their stock certificates (or guaranty of
delivery or affidavit of lost stock certificates) and effective election forms,
a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging their stock
certificates. Cross Media shall also make appropriate provisions with the
exchange agent to enable LifeMinders stockholders to obtain the letter of
transmittal and instructions for exchanging their stock certificates from, and
to deliver the certificates formerly representing shares of LifeMinders common
stock to, the exchange agent in person, commencing on or not later than 15
business days following the completion of the merger. Within 10 business days
after receiving a LifeMinders stockholder's stock certificate(s) together with a
completed letter of transmittal, the exchange agent will issue the Cross Media
common stock to which that stockholder is entitled.

     Upon the effectiveness of the merger, each outstanding LifeMinders stock
certificate will be deemed to evidence the right to receive the number of shares
of Cross Media common stock and/or the cash into which the shares of LifeMinders
common stock have been converted in accordance with the merger agreement. The
shares of Cross Media common stock and/or cash will not be paid to the record
holder of any LifeMinders common stock until the certificate therefor is sent to
the exchange agent. A LifeMinders stockholder whose certificate(s) have been
lost or destroyed may nevertheless receive shares of Cross Media common stock
and/or cash to which that LifeMinders stockholder is entitled, provided that the
LifeMinders stockholder first delivers to Cross Media or to the exchange agent
his or her election form indicating that his or her stock certificate(s) have
been lost, stolen or destroyed. In addition, the LifeMinders stockholder will
have to sign an affidavit that is included in the election form that provides,
among other things, that the LifeMinders stockholder agrees to indemnify Cross
Media and the exchange agent for any loss Cross Media may incur as a result of
the LifeMinders stockholder's lost or destroyed stock certificate(s). The
LifeMinders stockholder may also be required to provide an indemnity bond from
an insurance company protecting Cross Media and the exchange agent from any
damage which may result if someone presents the lost certificate for payment of
the merger consideration.

     BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT OF CROSS MEDIA UPON CONSUMMATION OF THE
MERGER

     When the merger is complete, Cross Media will continue to be managed by its
current directors and officers. In addition, Jonathan Bulkeley, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of LifeMinders, and Douglas A. Lindgren, a director of
LifeMinders, will be appointed as directors of Cross Media upon completion of
the merger for a term expiring at the annual meeting of Cross Media stockholders
to be held in 2002. The Cross Media board of directors will nominate Messrs.
Bulkeley and Lindgren for election as directors for one-year terms at the annual
meeting of Cross Media stockholders to be held in 2002. Mr. Bulkeley will serve
on the executive committee and the compensation committee of Cross Media's board
of directors so long as he is a member of the Cross Media board of directors.
Mr. Lindgren will serve as a member of the audit committee of Cross Media's
board of directors so long as he is a member of the Cross Media board. In
addition, if Mr. Bulkeley is no longer a Cross Media director, Mr. Lindgren will
serve as a member of the executive committee so long as he is a member of the
Cross Media board of directors.

     HIRING OF LIFEMINDERS' EMPLOYEES

     Cross Media has notified those LifeMinders employees whom it intends to
employ as of the completion of the merger. The merger is not conditioned upon
any LifeMinders' employees accepting employment with Cross Media.

     LISTING OF CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK ON THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE

     Cross Media will cause the shares of Cross Media common stock to be issued
in connection with the merger to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     Since before its initial public offering in 1999, LifeMinders has
considered or sought out potential acquirers or merger partners, considering
both opportunities to expand and grow the LifeMinders business through
acquisitions and attractive opportunities to be acquired. In June 1999,
LifeMinders engaged Thomas Weisel Partners to assist it in identifying and
evaluating potential merger and acquisition candidates. Although LifeMinders
contacted or engaged in discussions with a number of these potential partners,
none of these discussions resulted in a proposal to merge with or acquire
LifeMinders. The engagement of Thomas Weisel Partners terminated in June 2000,
with certain obligations on the part of LifeMinders regarding compensation
continuing for an additional ten months beyond that date.

     In January 2001, recognizing that the market for online advertising
revenues had changed significantly, the LifeMinders board of directors decided
to streamline its business to focus on the core direct marketing business.
LifeMinders reduced expenses significantly, and laid off approximately 24% of
its employees. During the first quarter of 2001, LifeMinders' revenue base
continued to deteriorate, and the LifeMinders board of directors determined that
its prospects for growth and profitability as a stand-alone company were not
strong. Although the LifeMinders board of directors had previously been open to
merger or acquisition proposals, at this time, its board directed LifeMinders'
management to solicit and evaluate possible business combinations, or a sale of
all or a portion of the assets of LifeMinders.

     In early May of this year, at a special meeting of the LifeMinders board of
directors, LifeMinders' management and Thomas Weisel Partners reported to the
LifeMinders' board of directors regarding activities related to a possible
merger, acquisition or sale of LifeMinders over the past several months. Thomas
Weisel Partners made a presentation to the LifeMinders board of directors about
its efforts to locate and evaluate potential acquirers and merger partners for
LifeMinders. Thomas Weisel Partners and outside legal counsel discussed with the
LifeMinders board of directors a number of possible strategies, including the
liquidation of LifeMinders. LifeMinders' management and LifeMinders' outside
advisors discussed with the board six specific merger and acquisition
opportunities that were being investigated. Over the next several weeks, at the
direction of the board of directors, LifeMinders' management continued to
evaluate these six merger and acquisition proposals, but ultimately was not able
to recommend that any of these proposals should be pursued further.

     At a board meeting held on June 4, 2001, Cross Media's board of directors
discussed an offer that had been made to merge Cross Media with MyPoints.com,
Inc. Cross Media's offer had been rejected by MyPoints the previous weekend in
favor of an offer from a subsidiary of United Airlines. Cross Media's board of
directors instructed Cross Media's management to identify other potential
acquisition candidates. Subsequently, Cross Media's management began
conversations with Robertson Stephens, who recommended consideration of
LifeMinders.

     Representatives of Robertson Stephens contacted LifeMinders on behalf of
Cross Media to propose Cross Media as a possible merger partner for LifeMinders.
Introductory telephone calls were held and preliminary information about the two
companies was exchanged. On June 7, 2001, representatives of LifeMinders and
Cross Media executed a mutual nondisclosure agreement.

     At the direction of the LifeMinders board of directors, LifeMinders'
management also continued to solicit other merger, acquisition and asset sale
proposals in an effort to negotiate the best possible transaction for
LifeMinders stockholders. In early June of this year, LifeMinders entered into a
letter of intent and term sheet with an individual representing an investment
group seeking to purchase substantially all of LifeMinders' operating assets.
The terms of this offer allowed LifeMinders to continue to solicit and negotiate
other offers to purchase it or its assets, but gave the offeror the exclusive
right to consummate the purchase under the terms offered in the letter of intent
until June 19, 2001.

     During the first few weeks of June, a number of meetings were held among
senior executives of Cross Media and LifeMinders, and their outside advisors.
Information was exchanged between the companies and due diligence meetings and
investigations continued. Cross Media presented LifeMinders with a proposed
letter of intent and preliminary terms of a proposed merger transaction.

     The LifeMinders board of directors met on June 18, 2001, to consider the
status of its efforts to negotiate an acceptable merger or acquisition proposal
or a sale of all or substantially all of its assets. The terms of the Cross
Media proposal were discussed in detail, including the proposed price, the
cash/stock election, the proposed board of directors of the combined company and
the terms of the non-solicitation covenants. The proposal by the investment fund
to purchase substantially all of the operating assets of LifeMinders also was
discussed. The LifeMinders board of directors considered and compared the Cross
Media proposal to the investment fund proposal, which was an all cash offer
subject to financing. The LifeMinders board of directors considered, among other
factors, the possible upside opportunities for LifeMinders stockholders in the
Cross Media stock proposal compared with the investment group's all cash offer.
Following a full discussion of both proposals, the LifeMinders board of
directors authorized management to pursue a definitive agreement with the
investment group subject to the investment group providing an assurance of
adequate financing. The LifeMinders board of directors also authorized
management to continue discussions with, and conduct a due diligence review of,
Cross Media in the event that the investment group did not obtain adequate
financing.

     The investment group continued to conduct its due diligence review of
LifeMinders and numerous discussions were held among employees and
representatives of LifeMinders and the investment group during this period.
However, the investment group was unable to give LifeMinders assurances that its
offer would be fully financed. Accordingly, LifeMinders did not enter into a
definitive agreement with the investment group by the June 19, 2001, date in the
letter of intent, and the investment group's exclusive right to consummate the
purchase of LifeMinders' assets under the terms of the letter of intent lapsed.

     In late June, Robertson Stephens, on behalf of Cross Media, delivered to
LifeMinders a revised draft letter of intent and term sheet. Negotiations
regarding the proposed letter of intent and term sheet continued between
representatives of Cross Media and LifeMinders. On June 21, 2001, Cross Media
and LifeMinders executed a letter of intent and term sheet. The letter of intent
provided, among other terms, that LifeMinders and Cross Media would in good
faith use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate and execute a definitive
agreement by July 18, 2001, and that LifeMinders could not solicit, facilitate
or negotiate other offers for LifeMinders or its assets until July 18, 2001 (or
an earlier date as mutually agreed by the parties). The letter of intent also
contemplated that a meeting would be held between certain LifeMinders' board
members and senior management of Cross Media on June 26, 2001. LifeMinders was
given the right following that meeting, in its sole discretion, to decide not to
proceed with the proposed transaction, provided it so notified Cross Media that
the letter of intent was terminated by noon on June 27, 2001.

     Pursuant to the letter of intent, on June 26, 2001, a meeting was held
among certain members of LifeMinders' senior management and board of directors,
and senior management of Cross Media. Cross Media presented its business plan to
the LifeMinders' board members, discussed the terms of proposed transaction and
the integration of the two companies and responded to questions posed by the
LifeMinders board members. About this time, LifeMinders also received an
unsolicited further proposal from the investment group that was seeking to
purchase substantially all of the operating assets of LifeMinders. In accordance
with the terms of its letter of intent with Cross Media, LifeMinders responded
to that group, advising it that it was subject to a non-solicitation agreement
and could not engage in any discussions with the investment group.

     On June 26, 2001, the LifeMinders board of directors held a special meeting
to consider the results of the board members' due diligence visit to Cross
Media. The LifeMinders board members reported on that meeting. After a full
discussion of the meeting and the proposed terms of a transaction with Cross
Media, the LifeMinders board of directors decided that additional information
would be required before the board could decide whether to terminate the letter
of intent. Management of LifeMinders also discussed with the LifeMinders board
of directors the revised proposal received from the investment group. The
LifeMinders board of directors discussed the proposed terms of the revised
proposal and concluded that the Cross Media proposal appeared to be more
attractive, from an economic point of view.

     On June 27, 2001, Cross Media and LifeMinders amended the letter of intent
to, among other things, extend the date by which the LifeMinders' board of
directors could terminate the letter of intent until 5:00 p.m. on June 29, 2001.
Due diligence meetings continued between LifeMinders and Cross Media and their
respective advisors.

     A special meeting of the LifeMinders board of directors was held on June
29, 2001 to, among other things, discuss the terms of a proposed transaction
with Cross Media and the results of its due diligence. After a full discussion
of the proposed transaction, the LifeMinders board of directors decided not to
terminate the letter of intent with Cross Media, but also decided that certain
remaining due diligence questions needed to be answered before the LifeMinders
board of directors would authorize signing a definitive agreement. The
LifeMinders board of directors also authorized the retention of Legg Mason Wood
Walker, Incorporated as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed
transaction.

     During this period, members of senior management of Cross Media and
LifeMinders, and their outside legal advisors, held numerous conference calls
and meetings to discuss the terms of the proposed merger of the two companies,
including the form of consideration. LifeMinders negotiated a revised
consideration in the transaction that provided LifeMinders stockholders with an
opportunity to obtain cash for all or a portion of their LifeMinders' shares,
and Cross Media agreed that LifeMinders could designate two individuals for
appointment to the Cross Media board of directors, including representation on
the compensation and audit committees. Several revised drafts of a proposed
merger agreement were exchanged, and further due diligence investigations were
conducted.

     On July 12 and July 13, 2001, the LifeMinders board of directors held two
more special meetings to review the status of the proposed transaction with
Cross Media. LifeMinders' management and outside counsel reviewed the principal
terms of the merger agreement, including, among other things, the structure of
the transaction as a direct merger between LifeMinders and Cross Media, the
cash/stock election, the exchange ratio, the representations and warranties of
the parties, indemnification of LifeMinders directors and officers, the
covenants under which LifeMinders and Cross Media would be required to operate
their businesses prior to the closing of the merger and conditions to closing of
the merger. They also discussed termination rights of the parties under the
merger agreement including a provision that would allow LifeMinders to consider
and respond to future unsolicited proposals if the LifeMinders board of
directors made a finding that it was required to do so to comply with its
fiduciary duties to its stockholders and a provision that would require
LifeMinders to pay to Cross Media a $2.8 million termination fee if the merger
agreement were to be terminated under certain circumstances. Legg Mason gave the
board its preliminary assessment of the merger consideration being offered to
the LifeMinders stockholders by Cross Media. The LifeMinders board of directors
authorized management to continue to negotiate with Cross Media towards a
definitive merger agreement.

     On July 17, 2001, at a meeting of Cross Media's board of directors held to
consider and vote upon the original proposed merger agreement and related
agreements, Robertson Stephens delivered to Cross Media's board of directors its
oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of July 17, 2001, and
based on the matters considered and the limitations on the review undertaken
described in the written opinion, the merger consideration, comprised of up to
$12.1 million in cash and the balance payable in shares of Cross Media common
stock valued at $1.9845 per share, was fair, from a financial point of view, to
Cross Media. Mr. Altbach and Mr. Kaufman discussed the status of the
negotiations with LifeMinders, the outstanding issues regarding the merger and
the comments and questions raised by the directors. Cross Media's board of
directors approved the transaction.

     Following the continued satisfactory progress toward resolution of
outstanding issues between LifeMinders and Cross Media, on July 17, 2001, the
LifeMinders board of directors met to review and approve the original terms of
the merger with Cross Media. LifeMinders' management and outside counsel updated
the LifeMinders board of directors on the results of the parties' further
negotiations and reviewed with the board of directors the terms of the merger
agreement. Management reported on due diligence matters. Legg Mason discussed
the financial performance of LifeMinders and Cross Media, and presented an
analysis of comparable public companies, an analysis of comparable merger and
acquisition transactions

and a liquidation analysis of LifeMinders. Legg Mason delivered its oral opinion
to the LifeMinders board of directors that, as of that date, and subject to a
number of assumptions, qualifications and limitations, the original merger
consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
LifeMinders common stock. Following these discussions, the LifeMinders board of
directors unanimously determined that, subject to satisfactory resolution of
certain remaining issues with Cross Media, the proposed merger was advisable,
fair to, and in the best interests of LifeMinders and its stockholders and
approved the terms of the original merger agreement and authorized its Chief
Executive Officer to execute, on behalf of LifeMinders, the original merger
agreement subject to any non-material changes. In a conference call between
representatives of LifeMinders and Cross Media following the board of directors
meeting, all remaining issues were resolved. On July 18, 2001, counsel to
LifeMinders and Cross Media completed negotiations on the remaining terms of the
original merger agreement.

     In the early evening on July 18, 2001, Cross Media and LifeMinders signed
the original merger agreement. The transaction was publicly announced on the
morning of July 19, 2001, and a conference call was held later that day to
discuss the material terms of the merger.

     During the period between July 18, 2001 and August 19, 2001,
representatives of Cross Media and LifeMinders conducted numerous meetings
regarding operational matters.

     On or about August 10, 2001, members of senior management of LifeMinders
and Cross Media began to discuss revising the terms of the merger agreement to
increase the total amount of cash available for payment to LifeMinders
stockholders in the merger from $12.1 million to $24 million, and increase the
stock exchange ratio from approximately 1.23 to 1.29 shares of Cross Media
common stock for each share of LifeMinders common stock exchanged for Cross
Media stock in the merger, while simultaneously decreasing the number of Cross
Media shares issuable in the merger by up to 4 million, reducing dilution by up
to approximately 13%. As part of these discussions, representatives of Cross
Media and LifeMinders determined that it would be mutually advantageous to
obtain voting agreements in support of the revised merger terms.

     On August 10 and August 13, 2001, the LifeMinders board of directors held
two special meetings to review the proposed revisions to the terms of the
merger. The LifeMinders board discussed with outside counsel its fiduciary
obligations to LifeMinders stockholders and its obligations under the merger
agreement with respect to potential third party proposals regarding a possible
merger or acquisition transaction involving LifeMinders. During the period
between August 10 and August 19, 2001, members of senior management of Cross
Media and LifeMinders and their outside legal counsel held numerous conference
calls and meetings to discuss the proposed revised terms of the amended and
restated merger agreement.

     On August 15, 2001, at a meeting of Cross Media's board of directors held
to consider and vote upon the revisions to the terms of the merger agreement and
related agreements, Robertson Stephens delivered to Cross Media's board of
directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of
August 15, 2001, and based on the matters considered and the limitations on the
review undertaken described in the written opinion attached as Annex C to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, the revised merger consideration, comprised of
up to $24 million in cash and 24.2 million shares of Cross Media common stock
(with per share amounts calculated under the treasury stock method), provided
that the number of shares of Cross Media common stock may be increased to the
extent that the stockholders of LifeMinders elect to receive less than the
maximum cash consideration, was fair, from a financial point of view, to Cross
Media. Mr. Altbach and Mr. Kaufman discussed the status of the negotiations with
LifeMinders, the outstanding issues regarding the merger and the comments and
questions raised by Cross Media's directors. Cross Media's board of directors
approved the terms of the amended and restated merger agreement at the August
15, 2001 meeting.

     On August 19, 2001, the LifeMinders board of directors met to review and
approve the proposed revised terms of the merger. LifeMinders' management and
outside counsel updated the LifeMinders board on the results of the parties'
further negotiations and reviewed with the board the terms of the amended and
restated merger agreement. Legg Mason discussed the financial performance of
LifeMinders

and Cross Media, and presented an analysis of comparable public companies, an
analysis of comparable merger and acquisition transactions and a liquidation
analysis of LifeMinders. Legg Mason delivered its oral opinion to the
LifeMinders board that, as of that date, and subject to a number of assumptions,
qualifications and limitations which are set forth in its written opinion the
revised merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of LifeMinders common stock. This oral opinion was later confirmed in
writing and a copy of the written opinion is attached to this joint proxy
statement/ prospectus as Annex D. Following these discussions, the LifeMinders
board of directors approved the terms of the amended and restated merger
agreement and authorized its Chief Executive Officer to execute, on behalf of
LifeMinders, the amended and restated merger agreement subject to any non-
material changes. In conference calls between representatives of LifeMinders and
Cross Media on August 20, 2001, all remaining issues were resolved. In the
evening of August 20, 2001, Cross Media and LifeMinders signed the amended and
restated merger agreement. The revised transaction was publicly announced on
August 21, 2001.

     Since the date of the original merger agreement, LifeMinders has received
correspondence from unrelated third parties regarding a possible merger or
acquisition transaction involving LifeMinders, or a proposal to acquire
substantially all of its assets. LifeMinders may receive other similar
communications before the Cross Media merger is consummated. The LifeMinders
board of directors intends to give appropriate consideration to such
communications, consistent with the directors' fiduciary obligations to all
LifeMinders stockholders and LifeMinders' obligations under the amended and
restated merger agreement.

     The boards of directors of both Cross Media and LifeMinders have approved
the amended and restated merger agreement and recommend that their respective
stockholders adopt the amended and restated merger agreement.

     CROSS MEDIA'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     Cross Media's board of directors has determined that the terms of the
merger agreement and the merger are in the best interests of Cross Media and its
stockholders. In arriving at its determination, the Cross Media board of
directors consulted with Cross Media's management, as well as its legal counsel,
accountants and financial advisors, and gave significant consideration to a
number of factors bearing on its decision. The following were the material
factors that were considered by the Cross Media board of directors:

     - Cross Media seeks to grow both internally and through the acquisition of
       complementary businesses. LifeMinders, which has an extensive consumer
       database and personalization capabilities, will complement Cross Media's
       proven marketing skills in both traditional and online direct marketing
       channels;

     - The belief that Cross Media will obtain access to LifeMinders' 20 million
       member database as a result of the merger, and that this access will
       enable it to reduce customer acquisition costs and increase margins by
       targeting offers to LifeMinders highly profiled members;

     - The belief that LifeMinders' strong balance sheet will significantly
       strengthen the financial position of Cross Media;

     - The belief that LifeMinders' significant net cash will provide funding to
       continue Cross Media's strategy of internal growth and growth through the
       acquisition of complementary businesses;

     - The belief that, while no assurance could be given, Cross Media could
       improve the operating results of LifeMinders;

     - The belief that the cost of the merger in financial terms represents a
       reasonable investment by Cross Media in furthering its business strategy;

     - The belief that, while no assurances can be given, it was likely that the
       merger would be completed and that the business and financial benefits
       contemplated in connection with the merger are likely to be achieved
       within a reasonable time frame;

     - The structure of the merger and the terms of the merger agreement,
       including the fact that the exchange ratio provides reasonable certainty
       as to the amount of cash to be paid and the number of shares of Cross
       Media common stock to be issued in the merger; and

     - The opinion of Robertson Stephens, Inc. to Cross Media's board of
       directors that, as of August 15, 2001, and based on and subject to the
       considerations set forth in the written opinion, the consideration
       offered in connection with the amended and restated merger agreement was
       fair, from a financial point of view, to Cross Media.

     Cross Media does not intend this discussion of the information and factors
considered by the Cross Media board of directors to be exhaustive, although this
discussion does include all material factors considered by the Cross Media board
of directors. In reaching its determination to approve and recommend the amended
and restated merger agreement to the Cross Media stockholders for adoption, the
Cross Media board of directors did not assign any relative or specific weights
to the factors considered, and individual directors of Cross Media might have
weighed factors differently.

     LIFEMINDERS' REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     At a meeting of LifeMinders' board of directors held on July 18, 2001, the
board of directors voted to enter into the original merger agreement with Cross
Media. At that time, the board of directors unanimously concluded that the
original merger agreement and the merger were advisable, fair to, and in the
best interests of LifeMinders and its stockholders, and voted to recommend to
LifeMinders stockholders that the merger agreement be adopted. On August 10,
2001, LifeMinders board of directors began to renegotiate the terms of the
original merger agreement because of changed market conditions. On August 19,
2001, LifeMinders board of directors approved the amended and restated merger
agreement and voted to recommend to the LifeMinders stockholders that the
amended and restated merger agreement be adopted. This decision was taken after
the board of directors consulted with LifeMinders' management, legal counsel and
financial advisors, and was based on the board of directors' belief that the
potential benefits of the merger, taken as a whole, made the possibility of the
success of the combined companies a more attractive option for LifeMinders
stockholders than LifeMinders continuing to operate as an independent business,
combining with another business, or liquidating and dissolving. These potential
benefits included:

     - The combination of LifeMinders' proprietary technology, expertise in
       online direct marketing, large membership base and substantial assets,
       including a significant cash balance after the merger, with Cross Media's
       established direct marketing operations would create a company with
       significantly better prospects for success than LifeMinders had as a
       stand-alone business;

     - The combined company's expected continuation of LifeMinders' primary
       business objective of becoming a leading online direct marketing company
       which would provide LifeMinders stockholders with a potential opportunity
       to participate in and benefit from the accomplishment of that objective;

     - The complementary nature of each company's product offering and the
       synergistic business that is expected to be created by combining the
       LifeMinders' proprietary member-targeted technology and databases
       containing member specific information with the well-developed direct
       marketing capabilities of Cross Media; and

     - The opportunity for LifeMinders stockholders to receive a favorable
       return on their investment in LifeMinders stock while allowing
       stockholders who wish to continue ownership interest or delay the
       taxation of gain on their stock to do so through electing to receive
       Cross Media common stock instead of cash.

     In evaluating the proposed merger with Cross Media, LifeMinders' board of
directors considered a number of factors, including the following:

     - Historical information concerning Cross Media's and LifeMinders'
       respective businesses, financial performance and condition, operations,
       technology and management, including reports for each company filed with
       the SEC;

     - LifeMinders' management's view of the financial condition, results of
       operations and businesses of LifeMinders and Cross Media before and after
       giving effect to the merger;

     - LifeMinders' management's assessment of the effect of the merger on the
       stockholders of LifeMinders;

     - Current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
       volatility and trading information;

     - The consideration LifeMinders stockholders would receive in the merger in
       light of other acquisition proposals and the value that could be
       distributed to LifeMinders stockholders in a liquidation;

     - The ownership of the combined company by LifeMinders stockholders;

     - The opinion of Legg Mason that, as of the date of its opinion and subject
       to the limitations and considerations described in the opinion, the
       consideration was fair to the holders of the outstanding shares of
       LifeMinders common stock, and the financial presentations made by Legg
       Mason to the board of directors of LifeMinders in connection with the
       delivery of its opinion;

     - The belief that the terms of the merger agreement are reasonable;

     - The impact of the merger on LifeMinders' customers and employees;

     - Reports from management, legal, and financial advisors as to the results
       of LifeMinders' due diligence investigation of Cross Media; and

     - The expectations that the merger would be treated as tax-free
       reorganization for federal income tax purposes for LifeMinders, Cross
       Media and LifeMinders stockholders (except for tax resulting from any
       cash received for shares and fractional shares by the holders of
       LifeMinders common stock).

     LifeMinders' board of directors also identified and considered a number of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger
including the following:

     - The risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized;

     - The risk that downward movement in the market price of Cross Media common
       stock would make the stock component of the consideration payable in
       connection with the merger less valuable;

     - The risk that the merger consideration would be reduced by up to $1.75
       million if LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2001
       are less than $48.9 million;

     - The risk that the merger may not be consummated;

     - The risk that Cross Media and LifeMinders would not be able to integrate
       their products, technologies and organizations;

     - The potential effect of the termination fee in deterring other potential
       acquirors from proposing an alternative transaction that might be more
       advantageous to LifeMinders stockholders; and

     - Other applicable risks that are described in this joint proxy
       statement/prospectus under "Risk Factors."

     The LifeMinders board of directors concluded, however, that on balance the
potential benefits of the merger to LifeMinders and its stockholders outweighed
the risks associated with the merger.

     The discussion of the information and factors considered by the LifeMinders
board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive. In view of the variety and
complexity of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the
merger, the LifeMinders board of directors did not find it practicable to, and
did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to, the specific factors
listed above that included discussions with LifeMinders' senior management and
its legal and financial advisers. Individual members of the LifeMinders board of
directors may have given different weight to different factors.

     There can be no assurance that the potential synergies, opportunities or
other benefits considered by the LifeMinders board of directors will be achieved
by completing the merger. See "Risk Factors" beginning on page [  ].

     The board of directors of LifeMinders unanimously recommends that
LifeMinders stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the amended and restated
merger agreement.

OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS

     OPINION OF ROBERTSON STEPHENS

     Under a letter agreement dated July 2, 2001, Cross Media engaged Robertson
Stephens to act as its financial advisor in connection with a possible
acquisition of, or business combination involving, LifeMinders, and to render an
opinion to Cross Media's board of directors as to the fairness of the
transaction, from a financial point of view, to Cross Media.

     On August 15, 2001, at a meeting of the Cross Media board held to consider
and vote upon the proposed amended and restated merger agreement and related
agreements, Robertson Stephens delivered to Cross Media's board of directors its
oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of August 15, 2001,
and based on the matters considered and the limitations on the review undertaken
described in the written opinion, the value of the merger consideration as of
the date thereof, comprised of up to $24 million in cash and 24.2 million shares
of Cross Media common stock, provided that the number of shares of Cross Media
common stock may be increased to the extent that the stockholders of LifeMinders
elect to receive reduced cash consideration, was fair, from a financial point of
view, to Cross Media. Robertson Stephens has consented to the use of its opinion
in this proxy statement and the full text of this opinion is reprinted as Annex
C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. No limitations were imposed by Cross
Media's board on Robertson Stephens with respect to the investigations made or
procedures followed by it in furnishing its opinion.

     You should consider the following when reading the discussion of the
opinion of Cross Media's financial advisor in this document:

     - We urge you to read carefully the entire opinion of Robertson Stephens,
       which is set forth in Annex C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus
       and is incorporated by reference.

     - The following description of the opinion of Robertson Stephens is
       qualified by reference to the full opinion located in Annex C to this
       joint proxy statement/prospectus. The full opinion sets forth, among
       other things, the assumptions made by Robertson Stephens, the matters it
       considered and the limitations on the review undertaken.

     - The Robertson Stephens opinion was prepared for the benefit and use of
       the Cross Media board in its consideration of the merger and does not
       constitute a recommendation to stockholders of Cross Media as to how they
       should vote at the special meeting or take any other action in connection
       with the merger.

     - The Robertson Stephens opinion was necessarily based upon market,
       economic and other conditions as in effect on, and information made
       available to Robertson Stephens as of, the date of the opinion. You
       should understand that subsequent developments may affect the conclusion
       expressed in the Robertson Stephens opinion and that Robertson Stephens
       disclaims any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any
       change in any matter affecting its opinion which may come or be brought
       to Robertson Stephens' attention after the date of its opinion.

     - The Robertson Stephens opinion was limited to the fairness, from a
       financial point of view and as of the date thereof, of the merger
       consideration to Cross Media.

     Opinion and Analysis of Robertson Stephens.  In connection with the
preparation of the Robertson Stephens opinion, Robertson Stephens:

     - reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other
       business and financial information of LifeMinders and Cross Media;

     - reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and
       operating data, including certain financial forecasts and other forward
       looking information, concerning Cross Media and LifeMinders;

     - held discussions with the managements of LifeMinders and Cross Media
       concerning the businesses, past and current operations, financial
       condition and future prospects of both LifeMinders and Cross Media,
       independently and combined;

     - reviewed the financial terms and conditions set forth in the draft of the
       Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger of August 13, 2001 and
       drafts of the Voting Agreements;

     - reviewed the stock price and trading history of LifeMinders common stock
       and Cross Media common stock;

     - compared the financial performance of LifeMinders and the prices and
       trading activity of LifeMinders common stock with that of certain other
       publicly traded companies comparable to LifeMinders;

     - compared the financial terms of the merger with the financial terms, to
       the extent publicly available, of other transactions that Robertson
       Stephens deemed relevant;

     - participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of
       LifeMinders and Cross Media and their legal advisors; and

     - made other studies and inquiries, and reviewed other data, as Robertson
       Stephens deemed relevant.

     In its review and analysis, and in arriving at its opinion, Robertson
Stephens assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial and other information provided to it, including information furnished
to it orally or otherwise discussed with it by the managements of LifeMinders
and Cross Media, or publicly available and neither attempted to verify, nor
assumed responsibility for verifying, any of this information. Robertson
Stephens relied upon the assurances of the respective managements of LifeMinders
and Cross Media that they were not aware of any facts that would make the
information inaccurate or misleading. Furthermore, Robertson Stephens did not
obtain or make, or assume any responsibility for obtaining or making, any
independent evaluation or appraisal of the properties, assets or liabilities,
contingent or otherwise, of LifeMinders, nor was it furnished with any
evaluation or appraisal. With respect to the financial forecasts and
projections, and the assumptions and bases therefor, for Cross Media and
LifeMinders that Robertson Stephens reviewed, Robertson Stephens assumed that
the forecasts and projections:

     - were reasonably prepared in good faith on the basis of reasonable
       assumptions;

     - reflect the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
       managements of Cross Media and LifeMinders, respectively; and

     - will be realized in the amounts and in the time periods currently
       estimated.

     Robertson Stephens assumed that the merger would be consummated upon the
terms set forth in the draft Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger
of August 13, 2001 without material alteration. In addition, Robertson Stephens
assumed that the historical financial statements of LifeMinders reviewed by it
were prepared and fairly presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied.

     Robertson Stephens expressed no opinion as to:

     - the value of any employee agreement or other arrangement entered into in
       connection with the proposed merger; or

     - any tax or other consequences that might result from the merger.

     Robertson Stephens' opinion does not address the relative merits of the
merger or any other business strategy that Cross Media's board of directors has
considered or may be considering, nor does it address the decision of Cross
Media's board of directors to proceed with the merger. Robertson Stephens'
opinion does not address any legal or accounting matters, as to which it
understands that Cross Media obtained such advice, as it deemed necessary, from
qualified professionals. Robertson Stephens relied as to all legal matters
relevant to rendering its opinion on the advice of its own counsel.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by
Robertson Stephens in connection with rendering its opinion. The summary of the
financial analyses is not a complete description of all of the analyses
performed by Robertson Stephens. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND BETTER THE FINANCIAL
ANALYSES PERFORMED BY ROBERTSON STEPHENS, THE TABLES MUST BE READ TOGETHER WITH
THE ACCOMPANYING TEXT. ROBERTSON STEPHENS' OPINION IS BASED ON THE TOTALITY OF
THE VARIOUS ANALYSES THAT IT PERFORMED, AND NO PARTICULAR PORTION OF THE
ANALYSIS HAS ANY MERIT STANDING ALONE.

     Comparable Company Analysis.  Using publicly available information,
Robertson Stephens analyzed, among other things, the trading multiples of
LifeMinders and the following publicly-traded companies in the Internet
advertising and marketing industry which it believed to be reasonably comparable
to LifeMinders:

     - ClickAction Inc.

     - Digital Impact, Inc.

     - DoubleClick Inc.

     - Engage, Inc.

     - L90, Inc.

     - ValueClick, Inc.

     Revenues.  As set forth in the following table, applying a range of total
capitalization multiples for these companies for calendar years 2000 and 2001 to
corresponding revenue data for LifeMinders resulted in the following range of
implied equity values. Robertson Stephens defined total capitalization as the
equity market capitalization plus funded debt and capital lease obligations less
cash and cash equivalents. If total capitalization was a negative value, then no
multiple was assigned.

                                                               IMPLIED LIFEMINDERS EQUITY VALUE
CALENDAR YEAR                                MULTIPLE RANGE            ($ IN MILLIONS)
- -------------                                --------------    --------------------------------

2000.......................................   0.3x - 0.7x            $65.2 - $86.7
2001.......................................   0.8x - 0.8x            $52.3 - $57.8
                                                                  Mean: $58.7 - $72.3

     Precedent Transaction Analysis.  Robertson Stephens analyzed the aggregate
value and implied transaction value multiples paid or proposed to be paid in
selected precedent transactions in the Internet advertising and marketing, and
related Internet services segments, including:

     - Mediaplex, Inc./ValueClick, Inc. -- July 2, 2001

     - MyPoints.com, Inc./United NewVentures -- June 4, 2001

     - MessageMedia, Inc./DoubleClick Inc. -- June 1 ,2001

     - Exactis.com (of 24/7 Media, Inc.)/Direct Marketing Technologies, Inc. (of
       Experian Information Solutions, Inc.) -- May 18, 2001

     - Uproar Inc./Vivendi Universal -- February 6, 2001

     - NetCreations, Inc./SEAT Pagine Gialle S.p.A. -- December 21, 2000

     Robertson Stephens compared, among other things, the aggregate value in
these transactions as a multiple of the latest 12 months' revenues and the
projected next 12 months' revenues. Applying these multiples to similar revenue
figures for LifeMinders resulted in the range of implied equity values listed
below. In addition, the 1-day and 1-month premium analyses resulted in the
following range of implied equity values.

                                              MULTIPLE OR     IMPLIED LIFEMINDERS EQUITY VALUE

                                             -------------    --------------------------------

Latest twelve months revenue...............  0.3x - 1.0x            $59.7 - $84.6
Next twelve months revenue.................  0.4x - 1.2x            $52 - $ 57.9
                                                                 Mean: $55.8 - $71.2
1-day premium..............................   40% - 80%             $69.9 - $89.9
1-month premium............................   30% - 60%             $54.0 - $66.5
                                                                 Mean: $62.0 - $78.2

     Liquid Assets Analysis.  Robertson Stephens compared, among other things,
the liquid assets ratio, computed as the equity market capitalization divided by
cash and cash equivalents less funded debt and capital lease obligations, for
the selected publicly traded companies in the Internet advertising and marketing
industry listed above. As set forth in the following table, applying a range of
equity market capitalization to liquid assets ratios to the corresponding liquid
assets data for LifeMinders resulted in the following range of implied equity
values. In addition, Robertson Stephens compared the premium of equity
consideration paid or proposed to be paid in selected precedent transactions in
the Internet advertising and marketing, and related Internet services segments
as listed above to the projected liquid assets at estimated closing of the
target company for each transaction. As set forth in the following table,
applying a range of premiums to the corresponding liquid assets data for
LifeMinders resulted in the following range of implied equity values.

                                              MULTIPLE OR     IMPLIED LIFEMINDERS EQUITY VALUE
                                             PREMIUM RANGE             (IN MILLIONS)
                                             -------------    --------------------------------

Market capitalization/liquid assets........  1.1x - 2.0x            $53.9 - $78.4
Premium to target liquid assets............   10% - 60%             $53.9 - $78.4
                                                                 Mean: $53.9 - $78.4

     Other Factors.  No company, transaction or business used in the comparable
company analysis, the selected precedent transaction analysis or the liquid
assets analysis as a comparison is identical to LifeMinders or the proposed
merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing is not entirely
mathematical; rather it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors and
trends that could affect the acquisition, public trading and other values of the
comparable companies or the business segment, company or transactions to which
they are compared. In addition, while the foregoing summary describes the
analyses and factors that Robertson Stephens deemed material in its presentation
to Cross Media's board of directors, it is not a comprehensive description of
all analysis and factors considered by Robertson Stephens.

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process that involves
various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analysis and to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness
opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.
In arriving at its opinion, Robertson Stephens did not attribute any particular
weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made qualitative
judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor.
Accordingly, Robertson Stephens believes that its analyses must be considered as
a

whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors considered
by it, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying its opinion. Several
analytical methodologies were employed and no one method of analysis should be
regarded as critical to the overall conclusion reached by Robertson Stephens.
Each analytical technique has inherent strengths and weaknesses, and the nature
of the available information may further affect the value of particular
techniques. The conclusion reached by Robertson Stephens is based on all
analyses and factors taken as a whole and also on application of Robertson
Stephens' own experience and judgment. This conclusion may involve significant
elements of subjective judgment and qualitative analysis. Robertson Stephens
therefore gives no opinion as to the value or merit standing alone of any one or
more parts of the analysis it performed. In performing its analyses, Robertson
Stephens made numerous assumptions with respect to anticipated industry
performance, general business and other conditions and matters, and present
industry and transaction trends, many of which are beyond the control of Cross
Media or Robertson Stephens, and their likely impact on the future performance
of Cross Media. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or predicative of future results or values, which
may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by these
analyses. Accordingly, analyses relating to the value of businesses do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which these businesses
actually may be sold in the future, and these estimates are inherently subject
to uncertainty.

     Cross Media engaged Robertson Stephens under a letter agreement dated July
2, 2001. The agreement provides that, for its services, contingent upon closing
of the merger, Robertson Stephens is entitled to receive a transaction fee of
$1.5 million. If the merger is not completed and Cross Media receives a
termination fee from LifeMinders, Robertson Stephens will receive a fee of
$500,000, provided that this amount does not exceed 50% of any cash or other
compensation payable to Cross Media by LifeMinders after payment of Cross
Media's expenses incurred in connection with the merger. Cross Media has also
agreed to indemnify and hold harmless Robertson Stephens and its affiliates and
any other person, director, employee or agent of Robertson Stephens or any of
its affiliates, or any person controlling Robertson Stephens or its affiliates,
for certain losses, claims, damages, expenses and liabilities relating to or
arising out of services provided by Robertson Stephens as financial advisor to
Cross Media.

     The terms of the fee arrangement with Robertson Stephens, which Cross Media
and Robertson Stephens believe are customary in transactions of this nature,
were negotiated at arm's length between Cross Media and Robertson Stephens, and
the Cross Media board of directors was aware of these fee arrangements.
Robertson Stephens was retained based on Robertson Stephens' experience as a
financial advisor in connection with mergers and acquisitions and in securities
valuations generally, as well as Robertson Stephens' investment banking
relationship and familiarity with Cross Media.

     In the ordinary course of business, Robertson Stephens may actively trade
securities of Cross Media or LifeMinders for its own account and for the account
of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position
in the securities of either company. Robertson Stephens has served as a co-
manager for a follow-on public equity offering for LifeMinders, and received
customary fees for such services.

     Robertson Stephens is an internationally recognized investment banking
firm. As part of its investment banking business, Robertson Stephens is
frequently engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary
distributions of securities, private placements and other purposes.

     OPINION OF LEGG MASON WOOD WALKER, INCORPORATED

     The board of directors of LifeMinders engaged Legg Mason Wood Walker,
Incorporated, referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Legg
Mason, to act as its financial advisor and evaluate the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of LifeMinders common stock of the
merger consideration provided for in the merger. On July 17, 2001, at a meeting
of the board of directors of LifeMinders held to evaluate the merger, Legg Mason
rendered to the LifeMinders board of directors an

oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated July
18, 2001, the date of the original merger agreement, to the effect that, as of
that date and based on and subject to the matters described in its opinion, the
merger consideration provided for in the merger agreement was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of LifeMinders common stock. On August
19, 2001, at a meeting of the board of directors of LifeMinders held to evaluate
the revised terms of the merger, Legg Mason rendered to the LifeMinders board of
directors an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion, to the effect that, as of that date, and based on and subject
to the matters described in its opinion, the merger consideration provided for
in the amended and restated merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of LifeMinders common stock. As of that date, the merger
consideration, as set forth in the amended and restated merger agreement was
comprised of a maximum allocation of $24 million in cash consideration and 24.2
million shares of Cross Media common stock with a market value on that date of
$1.45 per share.

     The full text of Legg Mason's written opinion, dated August 19, 2001, to
the LifeMinders board of directors, which sets forth, among other things, the
procedures followed, assumptions made and matters considered, is attached as
Annex D and is incorporated into this document by reference. Holders of
LifeMinders common stock are urged to, and should, read this opinion carefully
and in its entirety. The following description of Legg Mason's opinion is only a
summary and is qualified in its entirety by the written opinion.

     Legg Mason directed its opinion to the board of directors of LifeMinders.
The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the stockholders of
LifeMinders as to how they should vote at the LifeMinders special meeting. The
opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
merger consideration as of the date of the opinion. It does not address the
relative merits of the merger or any alternatives to the merger. Further, it
does not address the business decision of the LifeMinders board of directors to
proceed with or consummate the merger.

     In connection with its opinion, Legg Mason, among other things:

     - reviewed publicly available financial statements and other business and
       financial information of LifeMinders and Cross Media, respectively;

     - reviewed internal financial statements and other financial and operating
       data, including liquidation analyses, financial forecasts and other
       forward-looking information, concerning LifeMinders prepared by the
       management of LifeMinders;

     - held discussions with the respective managements of LifeMinders and Cross
       Media concerning the businesses, past and current operations, financial
       condition and future prospects of both LifeMinders and Cross Media;

     - reviewed the financial terms and conditions set forth in a draft of the
       amended and restated merger agreement dated August 17, 2001;

     - reviewed the stock price and trading history of LifeMinders common stock
       and Cross Media common stock;

     - compared the financial performance of LifeMinders and the prices and
       trading activity of LifeMinders common stock with that of certain other
       comparable publicly traded companies and their securities;

     - reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of
       certain comparable acquisition transactions; and

     - performed other analyses and considered such other factors as Legg Mason
       deemed appropriate.

     In connection with its review, Legg Mason did not assume any responsibility
to verify independently the accuracy or completeness of the information supplied
or otherwise made available by LifeMinders for the purposes of its opinion,
including the liquidation analysis supplied by LifeMinders. Legg Mason further
relied upon the assurances of the management of LifeMinders that they were not
aware of any facts that

would make that information inaccurate or misleading. In addition, Legg Mason
assumed that the forecasts and projections provided to them by LifeMinders
represented the best currently available estimates and judgments of LifeMinders'
respective management as to the future financial conditions and results of
operations of LifeMinders and assumed that the forecasts and projections were
reasonably prepared based on the best currently available estimates and
judgments. Legg Mason assumed no responsibility for and expressed no view as to
the forecasts and projections or the assumptions on which they were based.

     Legg Mason's opinion was necessarily based upon economic, market,
financial, and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated as of the
date of its opinion; and Legg Mason assumed no responsibility to update or
revise its opinion based upon events or circumstances occurring after the date
of its opinion. Legg Mason was not requested to consider, and its opinion does
not in any manner address, the prices at which LifeMinders' or Cross Media's
common stock would trade following either the announcement or consummation of
the merger. Although Legg Mason evaluated the consideration in the merger from a
financial point of view, Legg Mason was not requested to, and did not, conduct a
process seeking third party indications of interest in the possible acquisition
of all or any part of LifeMinders. No other limitations were imposed by
LifeMinders' board of directors on Legg Mason with respect to the investigations
made or procedures followed in rendering its opinion.

     In preparing its opinion to the LifeMinders board of directors, Legg Mason
performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses. The following summary
of the material financial analyses performed by Legg Mason in connection with
providing its opinion to the LifeMinders board of directors is not a complete
description of the analyses underlying Legg Mason's opinion. The preparation of
a fairness opinion is a complex process involving various determinations as to
the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the
application of these methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a
fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. In arriving at its opinion, Legg Mason made qualitative judgments
as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor that it
considered. Accordingly, Legg Mason believes that its analyses must be
considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or
focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all
analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create
a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and
opinion.

     Comparable Company Analysis.  Legg Mason compared selected financial
information for LifeMinders with publicly available information for eight
companies in the Internet advertising and marketing industry, including Avenue
A, Inc., Be Free, Inc., ClickAction, Inc., CoolSavings.com, Inc., Digital
Impact, Inc., Engage, Inc., Netcentives, Inc., and ValueClick, Inc. Legg Mason
calculated the multiples of equity market capitalization and enterprise value,
which were defined as equity market capitalization plus debt less unrestricted
cash and cash equivalents, to revenues for the most recently reported twelve
month period, which will be referred to as twelve month revenue, and annualized
revenue for the most recent three month period, which will be referred to as
three month annualized revenue, each period ending March 31, 2001, for each of
LifeMinders and the selected eight companies.

     The following tables set forth the median multiples indicated by this
analysis for the selected eight companies; if enterprise value was a negative
value, then no multiple was assigned:

     Selected Comparable Transaction Analysis.  Based on publicly available
information, Legg Mason calculated the multiples of the transaction value and
transaction enterprise value (defined as the transaction value plus debt less
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) to the twelve month revenues and the
three month annualized revenues, each for the period ending prior to the
announced acquisition date, in the following seven selected comparable
transactions in the Internet advertising, marketing and related services
industry.

         ValueClick, Inc./Mediaplex, Inc. (July 2, 2001)

         Investor Group/Cobalt Group, Inc. (June 4, 2001)

     Premium Paid Analysis.  Based on publicly available information, Legg Mason
calculated the median premiums implied by the offer price of the selected
comparable transactions over the closing price of the common stock of the
acquired company during selected periods prior to the announcement of the
applicable transaction. Legg Mason then reviewed the premium implied in the
LifeMinders merger, using a Cross Media common stock price as of each of July
19, 2001, the announcement date of the original merger agreement, and August 19,
2001, the date of its opinion.

     The following table sets forth the results of the analysis:

                                                                     IMPLIED PREMIUM IN THE

     No company or transaction used in the comparable company, comparable
transaction or premium paid analysis is identical to LifeMinders or Cross Media
or the merger. Although Legg Mason believes that certain of the companies
reviewed have similar operations to some of the operations of LifeMinders, none
of these companies have the same management, composition, size or combination of
businesses as LifeMinders. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the
foregoing is not mathematical; rather it involves complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of
the companies and other factors that could affect the public trading value of
the companies to which LifeMinders, Cross Media and the merger are being
compared.

     Asset Liquidation Analysis.  Based upon a liquidation analysis prepared by
LifeMinders' management, Legg Mason compared an estimate of the net proceeds
available in a liquidation of LifeMinders' assets to the merger consideration.
An asset liquidation analysis is most relevant when a company cannot be sold as
a going concern and is likely to be liquidated. In an asset liquidation
analysis, the liquidation value of a company is derived by estimating the value
of the company's assets and assuming their conversion into cash, then deducting
all of the liabilities of the company from the total cash that could be
received, and then adding (or deducting) the net operating profits (or losses)
incurred by the company through the liquidation process. Liquidation value can
be determined by assuming either an orderly liquidation or a more rapid, forced
liquidation of the business. Ordinarily, the latter approach results in a lower
value.

     In performing the analysis, Legg Mason relied upon estimates made by the
management of LifeMinders of the range of liquidation values for the assets of
LifeMinders, the range of total liabilities of LifeMinders and the range of net
operating expenses to be incurred by LifeMinders. LifeMinders' management
assumed an orderly liquidation of LifeMinders' assets. Further, LifeMinders'
management estimated operating and transaction expenses assuming a cessation of
business operations and a liquidation of assets could be concluded as of August
31, 2001. Legg Mason did not make an appraisal of the assets, and the estimated
values were not appraisals.

     The following table sets forth the range of net asset liquidation values
estimated by LifeMinders' management.

Estimated liquidation value of assets..................  $57.3 million  to   $59.9 million
Estimated liabilities and expenses.....................    5.4 million  to     4.5 million
                                                         -------------       -------------
Net liquidation value..................................   51.9 million  to    55.4 million

     As described above, Legg Mason's opinion and presentation were among the
many factors that the LifeMinders board of directors took into consideration in
making its determination to approve, and to recommend that the shareholders of
LifeMinders approve, the merger. Consequently, the Legg Mason analyses as
described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the
board of directors of LifeMinders with respect to the value of LifeMinders or of
whether LifeMinders' board of directors would have been willing to agree to a
different consideration. The merger consideration to be received by the holders
of LifeMinders common stock pursuant to the amended and restated merger
agreement and other terms of the amended and restated merger agreement were
determined through arm's-length negotiations between LifeMinders and Cross Media
and were approved by LifeMinders' board of directors.

     The board of directors of LifeMinders selected Legg Mason based on Legg
Mason's experience, reputation and expertise. Legg Mason is a nationally
recognized investment banking firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of
businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged
buyouts, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions
of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for
corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of its business, Legg Mason
may actively trade in the equity securities of LifeMinders and Cross Media for
its own account and the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any
time hold a long or short position in such securities.

     Pursuant to an engagement letter dated July 2, 2001, and amended as of
August 15, 2001, Legg Mason provided financial advisory services and two
financial opinions in connection with the merger, and LifeMinders agreed to pay
Legg Mason a fee of $325,000 in connection therewith. LifeMinders also has
agreed to reimburse Legg Mason for its expenses incurred in performing its
services. In addition, LifeMinders has agreed to indemnify Legg Mason and its
affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each
person, if any, controlling Legg Mason or any of its affiliates against certain
liabilities and expenses, including liabilities under the federal securities
laws related to or arising out of Legg Mason's engagement and any related
transactions.

NO APPRAISAL RIGHTS FOR CROSS MEDIA AND LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS

     Under Delaware law, holders of Cross Media and LifeMinders common stock are
not entitled to dissenters' rights or appraisal rights in connection with the
merger.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following are the material federal income tax consequences of the
merger to LifeMinders stockholders, assuming that the merger is effected as
described in the merger agreement and this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The
following discussion is based on currently existing provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, referred to as the Code, existing Treasury
Regulations thereunder and current administrative rulings and court decisions,
all of which are subject to change. Any change, which may or may not be
retroactive, could alter the tax consequences of the transaction to the
stockholders of LifeMinders.

     This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax considerations
that may be relevant to particular LifeMinders stockholders in light of their
particular circumstances, including (without limitation):

     - banks;

     - insurance companies;

     - tax-exempt organizations;

     - dealers in securities;

     - persons that hold their LifeMinders common stock as part of a straddle, a
       hedge against a currency risk or a constructive sale or conversion
       transaction;

     - persons who are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the
       Code; or

     - persons who acquired their LifeMinders stock in connection with a stock
       option or stock purchase plan or in some other compensatory transaction.

     This discussion assumes that LifeMinders stockholders hold their shares of
LifeMinders common stock as capital assets. In addition, the following
discussion does not address the tax consequences of the merger under foreign,
state or local tax laws. Furthermore, the discussion does not address the tax
consequences of transactions effected before, after or at the same time as the
merger, whether or not they are in connection with the merger, including,
without limitation, transactions in which LifeMinders stock is acquired or Cross
Media shares are disposed of.

     It is a condition to the closing under the merger agreement that Blank Rome
Comisky & McCauley LLP and Shaw Pittman LLP render tax opinions to Cross Media
and LifeMinders, respectively, that the merger will constitute a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. These tax opinions will be
based upon and subject to assumptions, limitations and qualifications, and will
be based upon the truth and accuracy of factual representations required to be
made by Cross Media and LifeMinders as of the time of the merger.

     Assuming the merger constitutes a reorganization under Section 368(a) of
the Code, the following federal income tax consequences would generally result
to LifeMinders stockholders:

     Merger Consideration Which Includes Only Cross Media Common Stock.  Subject
to the discussion below regarding fractional shares of Cross Media common stock,
each LifeMinders stockholder receiving only Cross Media common stock in the
merger will not recognize any gain or loss as a result of the receipt of Cross
Media common stock pursuant to the merger.

     Merger Consideration Which Includes Only Cash.  A LifeMinders stockholder
who receives only cash in the exchange and does not actually or constructively
own any Cross Media common stock after the

exchange will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference
between the cash received and the stockholder's tax basis in the LifeMinders
common stock exchanged in the merger.

     Merger Consideration Which Includes Both Cross Media Common Stock and Cash.
Subject to the discussion below regarding fractional shares of Cross Media
common stock, a LifeMinders stockholder receiving a combination of Cross Media
common stock and cash in exchange for LifeMinders common stock in the merger,
will recognize gain, but not loss, in an amount equal to the lesser of:

      (i) the excess, if any, of:

          (x) the sum of the fair market value (at the effective time of the
              merger) of the Cross Media common stock and the cash received,
              over;

          (y) each stockholder's tax basis in the shares of LifeMinders common
              stock surrendered in the merger; and

     (ii) the amount of cash received.

Such gain should generally constitute capital gain (subject to the potential
recharacterization as a dividend as discussed below) and should generally be
long-term capital gain if the LifeMinders common stock exchanged in the merger
has been held for more than one year prior to the merger.

     In general, whether a LifeMinders stockholder will be required to recognize
capital gain or dividend income will depend on the stockholder's particular
facts and circumstances and will be determined under Sections 356(a)(2) and 302
of the Code. Each LifeMinders stockholder who receives cash and stock in the
merger will be treated for tax purposes as if:

     - the stockholder (and other LifeMinders stockholders) had received only
       Cross Media common stock in the merger; and

     - immediately thereafter, as if Cross Media redeemed part of the
       hypothetically issued stock in exchange for the cash actually distributed
       to the stockholder in the merger.

The gain recognized by a LifeMinders stockholder on the exchange will be taxed
as capital gain if the hypothetical redemption from the stockholder:

     - is a "substantially disproportionate redemption" of stock with respect to
       the stockholder; or

     - is "not essentially equivalent to a dividend" with respect to the
       stockholder.

In making this determination, a LifeMinders stockholder will be considered to
own Cross Media common stock after the merger which is either directly or
constructively owned by the stockholder pursuant to applicable stock attribution
rules. These rules generally will treat a stockholder as constructively owning
Cross Media common stock owned by certain individuals and entities related to
the stockholder, as well as Cross Media common stock that the stockholder, or
the related individuals or entities, has the right to acquire upon the exercise
of options or conversion of the other equity instruments.

     The hypothetical redemption of a LifeMinders stockholder's Cross Media
common stock will be a "substantially disproportionate redemption," and
therefore, will not have the effect of a distribution of a dividend with respect
to a stockholder of LifeMinders, if the percentage of Cross Media common stock
actually and constructively owned by the stockholder immediately after the
hypothetical redemption is less than 80% of the percentage of Cross Media common
stock that would be actually and constructively owned by the stockholder
immediately before the hypothetical redemption.

     The hypothetical redemption of a LifeMinders common stockholder's Cross
Media common stock will not be "essentially equivalent to a dividend" if the
stockholder experiences a "meaningful reduction" in his or her proportionate
equity interest in Cross Media by reason of the hypothetical redemption.
Although there are not fixed rules for determining when a meaningful reduction
has occurred, the Internal Revenue Service has indicated in a published ruling
that a stockholder in a publicly-held corporation whose relative stock interest
in the corporation is minimal and who exercises no "control" over corporate
affairs generally is treated as having had a meaningful reduction in his or her
stock interest after a redemption transaction

if his or her percentage stock ownership in the corporation has been reduced to
any extent, taking into account the stockholder's actual and constructive
ownership before and after the redemption.

     If neither of the redemption tests set forth above are satisfied for a
LifeMinders stockholder, any gain recognized by the stockholder will be treated
as dividend income up to the stockholder's ratable share of the accumulated
earnings and profits of LifeMinders, and possibly Cross Media, at the effective
time of the merger. Any gain in excess of the stockholder's ratable share of the
earnings and profits will be treated as capital gain. Neither Cross Media nor
LifeMinders anticipates that it will have any accumulated earnings and profits
as of the effective time of the merger.

     Tax Basis and Holding Period.  A LifeMinders stockholder's aggregate tax
basis in the Cross Media common stock received in the merger (including any
fractional shares deemed received, as described below) will be equal to the
aggregate tax basis of the LifeMinders common stock surrendered in the exchange,

     - decreased by the amount of cash received; and

     - increased by the amount of gain recognized (including gain required to be
       treated as dividend income but not including gain recognized on receipt
       of cash in lieu of fractional shares).

LifeMinders stockholder's holding period of the Cross Media common stock
received will include the holding period of the LifeMinders common stock
surrendered in exchange therefor.

     Cash Payments Received in Lieu of Fractional Shares.  Cash payments
received by LifeMinders stockholders in lieu of a fractional share of Cross
Media common stock will be treated as if the fractional share had been issued in
the merger and then redeemed by Cross Media. A LifeMinders stockholder receiving
the cash in lieu of a fractional share will generally recognize capital gain or
loss upon the payment (subject to potential recharacterization as a dividend, as
discussed above), equal to the difference, if any, between the LifeMinders
stockholder's tax basis in the fractional share and the amount of cash received.

     Backup Withholding.  Certain noncorporate LifeMinders stockholders may be
subject to backup withholding at a rate of 30.5% on cash payments received in
the merger. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a LifeMinders
stockholder who (i) furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and
certifies that he or she is not subject to backup withholding on the substitute
Form W-9 included in the letter of transmittal, (ii) provides a certificate of
foreign status on an appropriate Form W-8, or (iii) is otherwise exempt from
backup withholding.

     No ruling from the Internal Revenue Service has been or will be requested
in connection with the merger. In addition, stockholders of LifeMinders should
be aware that the tax opinions discussed in this section are not binding upon
the Internal Revenue Service. Moreover, the Internal Revenue Service could adopt
a contrary position which could be sustained by a court.

     THE PRECEDING DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN UNITED
STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE
A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL TAX EFFECTS RELEVANT THERETO.
THUS, LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO
THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING TAX RETURN
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF FOREIGN, FEDERAL, STATE,
LOCAL, AND OTHER APPLICABLE TAX LAWS AND THE EFFECT OF ANY PROPOSED CHANGES IN
THE TAX LAWS.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141,
"Business Combinations" and SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."
The new standards require that all business combinations initiated after June
30, 2001 must be accounted for under the purchase method. In addition, all
intangible assets acquired that are obtained through contractual or legal right,
or are capable of being separately sold, transferred, licensed, rented or
exchanged are to be recognized as an asset apart from goodwill. Goodwill and
intangibles with indefinite lives will no longer be subject to

amortization, but will be subject to at least an annual assessment for
impairment by applying a fair value based test.

     The merger will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
Accordingly, under generally accepted accounting principles, the acquired assets
and assumed liabilities of LifeMinders will be recorded on the books of the
combined companies at their fair values at the date the merger is completed. Any
excess of the value of the consideration paid by Cross Media at the date the
merger is completed over the fair value of the identifiable assets of
LifeMinders will be treated as excess of purchase price over the fair value of
net assets acquired (commonly known as goodwill). See "Selected Pro Forma
Combined Financial Information."

                  OTHER CROSS MEDIA SPECIAL MEETING PROPOSALS

AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF CROSS MEDIA'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

     At the special meeting, holders of shares of Cross Media common stock will
be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to amend and restate Cross Media's
current certificate of incorporation. The proposed amendment and restatement, in
the form attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus, amends
Cross Media's current certificate of incorporation by:

     - increasing the number of shares of common stock that Cross Media has
       authority to issue from 100,000,000 to 150,000,000 and consequently, to
       increase the total number of shares of all classes of stock that Cross
       Media has to issue from 110,000,000 to 160,000,000; and

     - clarifying the indemnification provisions.

     The first paragraph of Article THIRD of Cross Media's current certificate
of incorporation, before giving effect to the proposed amendment and
restatement, reads as follows:

     THIRD:  1. The authorized capital stock of the Corporation shall consist of
110,000,000 shares of which 100,000,000 shares shall be designated Common Stock,
par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), and 10,000,000 shares shall be
designated Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Preferred Stock").

     Pursuant to the proposed amendment and restatement, the first paragraph of
Article THIRD of the current certificate of incorporation would be replaced with
the following:

     THIRD:  1. The authorized capital stock of the Corporation shall consist of
160,000,000 shares of which 150,000,000 shares shall be designated Common Stock,
par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), and 10,000,000 shares shall be
designated Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Preferred Stock").

     The second paragraph of Article FIFTH of Cross Media's current certificate
of incorporation, before giving effect to the proposed amendment and
restatement, reads as follows:

     FIFTH:  2. The Corporation shall indemnify to the fullest extent permitted
by the GCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, any person made, or
threatened to be made a defendant or witness to any action, suit or proceeding
(whether civil or criminal or otherwise) by reason of the fact that such person,
or his or her testator or intestate, is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation
as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or enterprise. Nothing contained
herein shall affect any rights to indemnification to which any person may be
entitled by law. No amendment or repeal of this Article FIFTH shall adversely
effect any right to indemnification provided hereunder with respect to any act
or omission occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

     Pursuant to the proposed amendment and restatement, the second paragraph of
Article FIFTH of Cross Media's current certificate of incorporation would be
replaced with the following:

     FIFTH:  2. The Corporation shall indemnify to the fullest extent permitted
by the GCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, any person made, or
threatened to be made a defendant or witness to any action, suit or proceeding
(whether civil or criminal or otherwise) by reason of the fact that such person,
or his or her testator or intestate, is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation
as a director, officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
enterprise. Nothing contained herein shall affect any rights to indemnification
to which any person may be entitled by law or agreement. No amendment or repeal
of this Article FIFTH shall adversely effect any right to indemnification
provided hereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such
amendment or repeal.

     Section (a) of the third paragraph of Article FIFTH of Cross Media's
current certificate of incorporation, before giving effect to the proposed
amendment and restatement reads, as follows:

     FIFTH:  3. (a) the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on
                    behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer,
                    employee or agent of the Corporation, or is serving at the
                    request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee
                    or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
                    trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any
                    liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or
                    her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her
                    status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have
                    the power to indemnify against such liability under the
                    provisions of law; and

     Pursuant to the proposed amendment and restatement, section (a) of the
third paragraph of Article FIFTH of Cross Media's current certificate of
incorporation would be replaced with the following:

     FIFTH:  3. (a) the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on
                    behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer,
                    employee or agent of the Corporation, or is serving at the
                    request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee,
                    partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another
                    corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
                    benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability
                    asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in
                    any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as
                    such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
                    indemnify against such liability under the provisions of
                    law; and

     REASONS FOR THE INCREASE IN AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

     The amended and restated merger agreement requires that Cross Media
increase the number of authorized shares of Cross Media common stock in order to
insure that Cross Media has enough unissued shares to complete the merger.

     Additionally, the board of directors considers the increase in authorized
shares of common stock necessary in order to provide flexibility for potential
acquisitions and future capital requirements. Cross Media intends to seek to
continue to expand its operations which will require additional capital,
including acquisitions for which it may choose to issue equity securities as all
or a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition. Although Cross Media
continuously evaluates potential acquisition candidates, Cross Media does not,
at this time, have any plans, commitments or understandings with respect to any
acquisitions. Approval by the stockholders of the increase in authorized shares
of common stock at the special meeting will avoid the need to call and hold
additional special meetings for this purpose, thereby enabling Cross Media to
act quickly when potential acquisition transactions arise.

     Once authorized, the additional shares of Cross Media common stock may be
issued with approval of the board of directors but without further approval of
the stockholders unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law, rule
or regulation. Accordingly, this solicitation may be the only opportunity for
Cross Media stockholders to approve financings, acquisitions, benefit plans,
recapitalizations and other corporate transactions.

     This proposal could, under certain circumstances, have an anti-takeover
effect. For example, if Cross Media were the subject of a hostile takeover
attempt, it could try to impede the takeover by issuing shares of common stock,
thereby diluting the voting power of the other outstanding shares and increasing
the potential cost of the takeover. The Cross Media board of directors is not
aware of any attempt or plan to acquire control of Cross Media, including the
issuance of Cross Media common stock.

     REASONS FOR CLARIFICATION OF INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS

     The revisions to the indemnification provisions in Article Fifth of Cross
Media's current certificate of incorporation clarify that indemnification will
be provided to and insurance will be purchased and maintained on behalf of a
person who is or was serving at the request of Cross Media as a trustee, partner

or a fiduciary of a trust, employee benefit plan or partnership. Prior to this
proposed amendment and restatement, Cross Media's current certificate of
incorporation stated that Cross Media would indemnify and purchase and maintain
insurance for any person who is or was serving at the request of Cross Media as
a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or enterprise. Under Cross Media's
current certificate of incorporation, it is implied that indemnification and
insurance coverage would be provided to trustees, partners or fiduciaries as,
for example, a partnership has partners who serve in the same capacity as a
director does for a corporation. Accordingly, since Cross Media's current
certification of incorporation provides that Cross Media will indemnify and
purchase and maintain insurance for a director, officer, employee or agent of a
partnership, it is implied that this indemnification would cover partners of a
partnership.

     In addition, the revisions to the indemnification provisions clarify that
the indemnification provisions contained in Cross Media's certificate of
incorporation will not affect any indemnification rights to which a person may
be entitled to by agreement.

     THE CROSS MEDIA BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" ADOPTION OF
THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF CROSS MEDIA'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

     Adoption of this proposal is also a condition to the merger. Cross Media
may not have a sufficient number of shares of common stock authorized to issue
to LifeMinders stockholders in the merger when adding the number of shares of
Cross Media common stock to be issued in the merger and to be reserved for
issuance upon exercise of options to be issued in exchange for LifeMinders
options in the merger to the number of shares of Cross Media common stock
outstanding, the number of shares of Cross Media common stock may be issued in
accordance with the Series A agreement, as described on page [     ] and
reserved for issuance upon outstanding Cross Media options, warrants and other
equity rights. Accordingly, Cross Media stockholders must adopt the amendment
and restatement of Cross Media's current certificate of incorporation at the
special meeting in order for Cross Media to consummate the merger.

     The board of directors has approved the proposed amendment and restatement
and submits the amendment and restatement to the stockholders for adoption.

     If the amendment and restatement is adopted by the requisite number of
shares of Cross Media common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, the
amendment and restatement will become effective upon the filing of the amended
and restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of
Delaware, which is expected to occur shortly after stockholder approval.

     The board of directors believes that the increase in authorized shares of
common stock and the clarification of the indemnification provisions are in the
best interests of Cross Media and its stockholders and recommends that the
stockholders adopt the amendment and restatement of Cross Media's current
certificate of incorporation.

AMENDMENT TO CROSS MEDIA'S 1998 STOCK OPTION PLAN TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF
SHARES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE

     GENERAL

     The board of directors has approved an amendment, referred to as the plan
amendment, to the 1998 Stock Option Plan, referred to as the option plan, to
increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the
option plan from 8 million shares to 14 million shares. The option plan
amendment is being submitted to the stockholders for approval.

     The board of directors approved the plan amendment because substantially
all of the shares available for issuance under the option plan are subject to
outstanding options. In the past, Cross Media has granted an aggregate of
6,954,000 stock options to officers, directors, employees and consultants at
exercise prices ranging from $0.01 to $6.375 per share. The board of directors
believes that the ability to grant stock-based awards is important to the future
success of Cross Media. The grant of stock options can motivate

high levels of performance and provide an effective means of recognizing
employee contributions to the success of Cross Media. In addition, stock options
can be valuable in recruiting and retaining personnel and providing incentives
to its current employees. The increase in the number of shares available for
awards under the option plan will enable Cross Media to continue to realize the
benefits of granting stock-based compensation.

     The plan amendment is intended, in part, to increase the number of shares
available under the option plan to an amount sufficient to allow for the grant
of future options. See [ ].

     SUMMARY OF THE OPTION PLAN

     Purpose.  The purpose of the option plan is to provide incentives and
rewards to selected eligible directors, officers, employees and consultants of
Cross Media and its subsidiaries in order to assist Cross Media and its
subsidiaries in attracting, retaining and motivating those persons by providing
for or increasing the proprietary interests of those persons in Cross Media, and
by associating their interests in Cross Media with those of the Cross Media
stockholders.

     The board of directors approved the option plan in December 1998. The
stockholders approved the option plan by written consent in April 1999 and
approved certain amendments to the option plan at the 1999 annual meeting of
stockholders in September 1999, at the 2000 annual meeting of stockholders in
September 2000, and at the 2001 annual meeting of stockholders in June 2001.

     Administration.  The option plan is administered by the compensation
committee of Cross Media's board of directors, which is referred to as the
"administrator." Subject to the provisions of the option plan, the administrator
has full and final authority to:

     - select from among eligible directors, officers, employees and
       consultants, those persons to be granted options under the option plan;

     - determine the type, size and terms of individual options to be made to
       each person selected, including whether the option will be an incentive
       stock option or a nonqualified option;

     - determine the time when options will be granted and to establish
       objectives and conditions (including, without limitation, vesting and
       performance conditions), if any, for earning options;

     - amend the terms or conditions of any outstanding option, subject to
       applicable legal restrictions and to the consent of the other party to
       such option;

     - determine the duration and purpose of leaves of absences which may be
       granted to holders of options without constituting termination of their
       employment for purposes of their options;

     - authorize any person to execute, on behalf of Cross Media, any instrument
       required to carry out the purposes of the option plan; and

     - make any and all other determinations which the administrator determines
       to be necessary or advisable in the administration of the option plan.

     The administrator has full power and authority to administer and interpret
the option plan and to adopt, amend and revoke rules, regulations, agreements,
guidelines and instruments for the administration of the option plan and for the
conduct of its business as the administrator deems necessary or advisable. The
administrator's interpretation of the option plan, and all actions taken and
determinations made by the administrator pursuant to the powers vested in it
under the option plan, shall be conclusive and binding on all parties concerned,
including Cross Media, its stockholders, any optionee and any other employee of
Cross Media or however, its subsidiaries.

     Eligibility.  Options may be granted to persons selected by the
administrator in its discretion who are, at the time of grant, directors,
officers, employees or consultants of Cross Media, or any of its subsidiaries,
all referred to as a participant; provided, that, incentive stock options may be
granted only to individuals who are employees of Cross Media or its
subsidiaries.

     Options.  The option plan provides for the grant of stock options intended
to qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the
Code and stock options that are not intended to qualify as incentive stock
options within the meaning of the Code, referred to as non-qualified stock
options, collectively referred to as options. Each option is evidenced by an
"option agreement." The administrator, in its sole and absolute discretion,
determines all of the types, terms and conditions of each option granted under
the option plan. The provisions of separate option agreements need not be
identical, but each incentive stock option must be in compliance with each of
the following conditions:

     - The exercise period may not be more than 10 years from the date the
       incentive stock option is granted (five years in the case of any person
       who owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting
       power of all classes of stock of Cross Media).

     - The exercise price per share of each incentive stock option may not be
       less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the
       date on which the incentive stock option is granted (110% of the fair
       market value in the case of a 10% stockholder described in the previous
       paragraph).

     - An incentive stock option is not transferable, except by will or by the
       laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable during the lifetime
       of the person to whom the incentive stock option is granted only by such
       person.

     - If the optionee's employment with Cross Media terminates, the optionee
       must exercise the incentive stock option, to the extent it was
       exercisable at termination, within three months of termination.

     - The aggregate fair market value of shares of common stock with respect to
       which incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time by an
       "optionee" during any calendar year (determined on the grant date) under
       all plans of the company and its affiliates may not exceed $100,000; the
       options or portions thereof that exceed this limit will be treated as
       non-qualified stock options.

     Payment.  The exercise price shall be paid, to the extent permitted by
applicable law and regulations, in cash, with previously-owned common stock, by
reducing the number of shares of common stock otherwise issuable pursuant to the
award, according to a deferred payment or other arrangement, or in another form
of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the administrator.

     Maximum Number of Shares Available for Grant to any Person.  No person may
receive options representing more than 50% of the aggregate number of shares of
common stock that may be issued under the option plan. In addition, the
aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be subject to options
granted to any person in a calendar year may not exceed 2,000,000 shares.

     Transferability.  Options granted under the option plan are not
transferable by the participant except by will or by the laws of descent and
distribution.

     Changes in Capitalization.  Upon a change in capitalization of Cross Media,
a stock dividend or split, a consolidation or merger of Cross Media with another
person where Cross Media is the "surviving company," as defined in the option
plan, a combination of shares and certain other similar events, the option plan
provides for an adjustment in the number of shares of common stock available to
be issued under the option plan, the maximum number of shares with respect to
which options may be granted to a participant in a year, and the number and
exercise price-per-share of shares of common stock subject to options.

     Acceleration.  The administrator has the power to accelerate the time at
which an option may first be exercised or the time during which an option or any
part thereof will vest, notwithstanding the provisions in the option stating the
time at which it may first be exercised or the time during which it will vest.

     Amendment and Termination.  The board of directors may at any time amend
the option plan in whole or in part, provided that no such action may adversely
affect any rights or obligations with respect to any outstanding options.

     The option plan will terminate on the earlier of the date the board of
directors terminates the option plan or December 31, 2007. Termination of the
option plan will not terminate any outstanding options.

     Federal Income Tax Consequences for Stock Options.  The following is a
general discussion of the principal tax considerations for both incentive stock
options and non-qualified stock options and is based upon the tax laws and
regulations of the United States existing as of the date hereof, all of which
are subject to modification at any time. Various state laws may provide for tax
consequences that vary significantly from those described below. In addition,
tax consequences different from those described below may result in the event of
the exercise of an option after termination of the participant's employment by
reason of death.

     Incentive Stock Options.  In general, no income is recognized for federal
income tax purposes by an optionee at the time the option is granted or
exercised. The optionee will recognize capital gain or loss when the optionee
disposes of his or her common stock, with treatment as a long- or short-term
gain or loss being determined by the length of the holding period. This gain or
loss is generally measured by the difference between the exercise price of the
option and the amount received for the common stock at the time of the
disposition.

     However, if an optionee disposes of the common stock acquired upon exercise
of an incentive stock options within two years after grant of the option or
within one year after acquiring the common stock, the disposition will be
considered a "disqualifying disposition" and the treatment will be different. In
such a case, the difference between the exercise price of the stock and the fair
market value of the stock on the date of exercise will be treated as ordinary
income, and any amount realized upon disposition of the common stock in excess
of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise will be treated
as capital gain.

     If an optionee uses shares acquired upon the exercise of an incentive stock
option to exercise another incentive stock option, and the sale of the shares so
surrendered for cash on the date of surrender would be a disqualifying
disposition of such shares, the use of such shares to exercise an incentive
stock option also would constitute a disqualifying disposition.

     For purposes of calculating the "alternative minimum tax," the excess of
the fair market value of the stock at the exercise date over the exercise price
of the incentive stock option is included in computing that year's alternative
minimum taxable income, even though the exercise may not otherwise result in a
taxable event.

     Cross Media is not entitled to a deduction as a result of the grant or
exercise of an incentive stock option. If the optionee has compensation taxable
as ordinary income as a result of a disqualifying disposition, Cross Media shall
be entitled to a deduction in an amount equal to the compensation income
resulting from the disqualifying disposition in the taxable year of Cross Media
in which the disqualifying disposition occurs.

     Non-qualified Stock Options.  No income is recognized by a holder of a
non-qualified stock option at the time of grant. In general, when shares of
common stock are issued to a holder pursuant to exercise of a non-qualified
stock option, the holder will recognize ordinary income equal to the excess of
the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the exercise
price. The shares acquired by the optionee upon such exercise shall have a tax
basis equal to the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date. Upon
any subsequent sale of such shares, the optionee shall recognize a capital gain
(or loss) in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized on
the sale and such tax basis. Whether such gain or loss is characterized as long-
or short-term will depend on the optionee's holding period.

     Generally, in connection with the exercise of a non-qualified stock option,
Cross Media will be entitled to a deduction for federal income tax purposes in
the year and in the same amount as the optionee is considered to have realized
ordinary income.

     In general, the "million-dollar limit" under Section 162(m) of the Code
provides that, subject to certain exceptions, annual remuneration in excess of
$1 million that is paid to certain "covered employees" of a publicly-held
corporation (generally, the corporation's chief executive officer and its four
most highly compensated employees other than the chief executive officer) shall
not be deductible by the corporation. Grants of options under the option plan
made by a committee comprised solely of two or more outside directors and the
exercise price of which is equal to or greater than the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of grant are generally eligible for the exception
applicable to the $1 million limit for qualified "performance-based
compensation."

     REQUIRED VOTE

     The approval of the plan amendment requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of Cross Media common stock present or represented and
entitled to vote on this matter at the special meeting. An abstention will be
counted toward the tabulation of votes cast and will have the same effect as a
vote against the proposal. A broker non-vote, however, will not be treated as a
vote cast for or against approval of the proposal.

     Cross Media's board of directors has approved the plan amendment and
recommends adoption of the plan amendment by the stockholders.

                            BUSINESS OF CROSS MEDIA

GENERAL

     Cross Media is a direct marketing company that integrates sophisticated
marketing skills with new technologies for the sale of multi-magazine
subscription packages, discount buying club memberships and telecommunication
services. Through inbound and outbound teleservices programs at Media
Outsourcing, Inc., its principal operating business, Cross Media contacts and
retains critical data on more than 11 million consumers annually.

     Cross Media's principal office is located at 461 Fifth Avenue, 19th Floor,
New York, New York 10017 and its telephone number at that address is (212)
457-1200.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

     Cross Media's strategy is to integrate well established direct marketing
skills with a variety of new technologies, including e-mail marketing, web-based
systems and interactive voice response, ultimately resulting in a multi-faceted
marketing platform for the sale of products and services. Cross Media expects
that this strategy will enable it to contact consumers on a cost effective basis
through multiple communications channels, such as e-mail, telemarketing,
traditional advertising and interactive voice response. Cross Media plans to use
these consumer contacts to develop a dynamic consumer database and to integrate
all of these activities into a single new system. When completed, the new system
should enable Cross Media to target marketing campaigns to select sub-groups of
its total customer base and to measure the success of campaigns while factoring
in the different communications channels used in those campaigns.

BUSINESS

     Cross Media acts as a clearinghouse which has the direct authority on
behalf of magazine publishers to accept magazine subscription orders and to
place those orders with fulfillment houses designated by the publishers. Cross
Media retains approximately 21 independent telesales agencies, also known as
call centers, to generate sales of magazine subscriptions on its behalf. Two of
these call centers accounted for approximately 35% of Cross Media's magazine
subscription revenues in 2000. In December 2000, Cross Media established company
owned and operated call centers in Orlando, Florida and Peoria, Illinois. Each
month, generally using lists of names and telephone numbers provided by Cross
Media, the independent and company owned call centers contact between 900,000
and 1,000,000 potential customers.

     In the last quarter of 2000, Cross Media commenced an e-mail campaign in
conjunction with a third party to generate inbound telephone calls to many of
the call centers. As a result of the success of the e-mail campaign, Cross Media
expects that in future years it will utilize the Internet to generate a
substantial number of customer contacts for its call centers. Utilizing the
hardware and software platform obtained through the acquisition of WeFusion.com,
Inc., Cross Media is developing a sophisticated system to track and control lead
files, customer contact statistics, customer profiles and internet based
marketing campaigns.

     The call centers offer the customer a bundle of subscriptions for four to
five magazines having an average selling price of approximately $600 per bundle,
for an average subscription period of between one and four years. Generally,
Cross Media does not sell single magazine subscriptions, although it plans to
test several offers for smaller magazine bundles in 2001. Cross Media decides
whether to accept orders submitted by the call centers by calling each customer
to verify the details of the magazine subscription order and the customer's
credit card information. When this process is complete, Cross Media forwards
accepted orders to the magazine publisher's fulfillment center for processing
and pays the publisher an agreed upon amount for the order. Cross Media charges
the subscriber for the order by automatically debiting the subscriber's credit
card on a monthly basis, generally over a 12-month period.

     At the time Cross Media verifies a customer's order, it attempts to
generate additional revenue, and thereby to enhance the profitability of the
sale. This is done by offering the customer the opportunity to participate in
special promotions sponsored by magazine publishers to spur the sale of
subscriptions, as well as discount buying club memberships and
telecommunications services. Cross Media receives a special promotion commission
from the publishers based upon additional subscriptions sold to its customer
base.

     In the year ended December 31, 2000 and six months ended June 30, 2001,
Cross Media sold approximately 2.1 million and 1.0 million special promotion
subscriptions, resulting in revenue of $4.7 million and $2.7 million. The club
membership upsell offer involves a free trial membership in a discount buying
club sold by Cross Media on behalf of Memberworks, an unaffiliated third party.
In the year ended December 31, 2000 and six months ended June 30, 2001, the
upsell of memberships in Memberworks generated revenue to Cross Media of
approximately $3.3 million and $2.5 million. The telecommunications upsells
involve the offer of long distance telephone service or pre-paid long distance
phone cards provided by Talk.com and Direct One, respectively. In the year ended
December 31, 2000 and six months ended June 30, 2001, telecommunications upsells
generated revenue of approximately $0.3 million and $1.0 million. In the year
ended December 31, 2000 and six months ended June 30, 2001, special publisher
commissions and upsells represented 13.4% and 14.4% of total revenues.

COMPETITION

     While there are no limitations on who may sell magazines to the public, the
companies and individuals that sell magazines must forward the subscriptions to
the publisher through a clearinghouse which has been granted authority to do so
by the publisher and must pay a fee to the clearinghouse to clear the order.
Establishing a clearinghouse relationship is difficult due to magazine
publishers' reluctance to grant this authority to new companies. Media
Outsourcing has been granted authority to clear orders for approximately 250
major U.S. magazine publications. In addition to Cross Media, the industry
leaders in sales of magazine subscriptions are Synapse, USA Pubs and E News. Of
these, only USA Pubs utilizes a call center as its primary means of contacting
potential customers.

     Cross Media competes on the basis of the total value of the bundle of
magazines sold to the customer versus the cost of purchasing individual magazine
subscriptions as well as the convenience for the customer of dealing with a
single source for all of their magazine subscriptions.

REGULATION

     Telemarketing operations are subject to various state and federal
regulations. The Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 limits the
hours during which telemarketers may call consumers to between 8:00 AM and 9:00
PM, and prohibits the use of automated telephone dialing equipment to call
certain telephone numbers. The Federal Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and
Abuse Prevention Act of 1994, and the Federal Trade Commission regulations
promulgated thereunder, prohibit deceptive, unfair or abusive practices in
telemarketing sales. Both the Federal Trade Commission and state attorney
generals have authority to prevent telemarketing activities that constitute
unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Additionally, some states have enacted
laws and others are considering enacting laws targeted directly at telemarketing
practices. There can be no assurance that any laws, if enacted, will not
adversely affect Cross Media's current or future operations by adversely
affecting the operations and practices of the call centers owned by Cross Media
or the independent call centers with which Cross Media has relationships.
Compliance with regulations promulgated by these agencies is generally the
responsibility of the call center. As a result, the call centers owned by Cross
Media, as well as the independent call centers with which Cross Media has
relationships could be subject to a variety of enforcement actions for any
failure to comply with such regulations.

     Laws and regulations applicable to direct marketing, telemarketing,
Internet marketing and consumer protection are becoming more prevalent. Each of
the 50 states and the federal government has laws regulating telemarketing,
sweepstakes promotions, promotional incentives and advertising to consumers,

which vary from state to state. While Cross Media reviews its telemarketing
scripts and advertising copy to ensure that they comply with applicable laws,
there is no guarantee that federal or state authorities will not find that Cross
Media's marketing efforts do not comply with these laws. In addition, it is
likely that additional federal and/or state regulations regarding telemarketing,
sweepstakes, e-mail marketing and other marketing practices engaged in by Cross
Media will be enacted. If enacted, these regulations could have an adverse
effect on revenues and result in additional expenses to Cross Media.

     The Federal Trade Commission is currently in the process of reviewing the
provisions of the Telemarketing Sales Rule to determine if any changes to the
rule should be made. If the Federal Trade Commission determines that changes to
the rule are necessary, such changes could have a significant adverse effect on
Cross Media.

     In 1999, Congress enacted the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement
Act, which imposes various restrictions on the offering of sweepstakes through
the mail. Additional sweepstakes legislation has been enacted or is pending in
various states. This additional regulation could have an adverse impact on Cross
Media's marketing activities.

     Federal and state authorities have also been investigating various
companies' use of marketing practices, such as the use of personal information,
magazine subscription agents' sweepstakes practices and the marketing of
membership club services through the use of inbound and outbound telemarketing
campaigns. These investigations could result in additional rules, regulations or
industry standards, which could have an adverse impact on Cross Media's
marketing practices.

     Laws and regulations directly applicable to Internet communications,
commerce, marketing and data protection are becoming more prevalent. If any of
these laws hinders the growth in use of the Internet generally, or decreases the
acceptance of the Internet as a medium of communications, commerce and
marketing, the business and prospects may suffer materially. The United States
Congress has enacted Internet laws regarding children's privacy, copyrights and
taxation. Other laws and regulations may be adopted covering issues such as user
privacy, marketing activities, pricing, content, taxation and quality of
products and services. The governments of some states and foreign countries have
begun to regulate transactions and levy sales or other taxes relating to Cross
Media's activities and will likely continue to do so. The laws governing the
Internet remain largely unsettled, even in areas where legislation has been
enacted. It may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as
those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation apply to the
Internet and Internet advertising and marketing services. In addition, the
growth and development of the market for Internet commerce may prompt calls for
more stringent consumer protection laws, both in the United States and abroad,
that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the
Internet.

     Laws and regulations regulating the transmission of unsolicited e-mail
marketing messages are being considered by many jurisdictions. Legislation of
that type has recently been adopted by the States of California, Virginia and
Washington, and similar legislation is pending in the State of New York and in
Congress. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits some types of information
and content from being transmitted over the Internet. The prohibition's scope
and the liability associated with a Telecommunications Act violation are
currently unsettled. In addition, although substantial portions of the
Communications Decency Act were held to be unconstitutional, Cross Media cannot
be certain that similar legislation will not be enacted and upheld in the
future.

     There has been increasing public debate about the collection, distribution
and use of information about consumers. Although this debate has primarily
focused on information collected through the Internet, many of the issues apply
to data gathered through other media. Cross Media interacts with consumers
through various direct marketing efforts, both online and offline. As a
consequence of government regulation or evolving standards of consumer privacy
protection, it may be required to make changes to its marketing media and
platforms in ways that could diminish the effectiveness of marketing efforts,
which could harm business.

     As of August 1, 2001, Cross Media had approximately 422 full-time and 31
part-time employees.

        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
                      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF CROSS MEDIA

     The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the
consolidated financial statements of Cross Media and the accompanying "Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements" included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. This discussion summarizes the significant factors
affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity
and cash flows of Cross Media for the three month periods ended March 31, 2001
and 2000 and years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

INTRODUCTION

     Cross Media was incorporated in Delaware on May 9, 1997 under the name
Brack Industries Inc. Cross Media changed its name to Symposium Corporation in
December 1998 and changed its name to Cross Media Marketing Corporation in
December 2000.

     Cross Media's principal business strategy is to integrate well established
direct marketing skills with a variety of new technologies, including e-mail
marketing, web-based systems and interactive voice response, ultimately
resulting in a multi-faceted marketing platform for the sale of products and
services.

     Cross Media was inactive until December 1998. From December 1998 through
June 1999, Cross Media, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Publishers Advantage
Corporation, had minimal operations and was principally engaged in telemarketing
in the United States for magazine and periodical subscription renewals to
persons whose subscriptions had recently expired. Cross Media discontinued the
operations of Publishers Advantage of June 30, 1999.

     In November 1999, Cross Media formed Media Outsourcing, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary, to acquire the assets of Direct Sales International. On
January 28, 2000, Cross Media, through Media Outsourcing, acquired substantially
all the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Direct Sales International, a
magazine subscription agency based in Atlanta, Georgia, which sold new
subscriptions for magazines of major US publishers. Cross Media paid
approximately $27.6 million to acquire Direct Sales International, including
$25.0 million in cash, an agreement to loan $1.5 million to a company in which
Direct Sales International's former owner holds a majority interest and
approximately $1.1 million in closing costs and fees incurred in connection with
the acquisition. Cross Media also granted to the seller of Direct Sales
International the right, which has an intrinsic value of $1.2 million, to sell
up to 600,000 shares of Cross Media common stock back to Cross Media at a fixed
price which has been included in the calculation of purchase price in excess of
net assets acquired. Cross Media financed the cash portion of the purchase price
by borrowing $16.0 million under a credit facility provided by Coast Business
Credit, resulting in proceeds of $15.8 million, net of fees, and by using
proceeds totaling approximately $9.2 million from the issuance of its common
stock, warrants to purchase its common stock, convertible preferred stock and
convertible debt.

     On November 30, 2000, Cross Media acquired WeFusion.com, Inc., an
application service provider which has developed a database architecture that
will enable Cross Media to develop sophisticated customer profiles. Cross Media
paid approximately $2.5 million to acquire WeFusion, including $0.6 million in
cash and approximately $1.9 million of its common stock and warrants to purchase
its common stock.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2001 AND JUNE 30, 2000

     REVENUES

     During the six months ended June 30, 2001, revenues were $43.3 million, a
60% increase from revenues of $27.1 million for the six months ended June 30,
2000. Revenues increased as a result of higher sales of magazine contracts,
increased revenue from sales of memberships, higher publisher bonus revenues,
revenues from the sales of long distance telephone service and other revenues.
For the six months ended June 30, 2001, revenues were derived primarily from the
sales of magazines contracts at

Media Outsourcing totaling approximately $33.9 million, commission revenues from
sales of memberships in a third party discount-buying club of $2.5 million,
publisher bonus revenues of $2.7 million, commissions on sales of discount long
distance telephone service of $1.0 million and other revenues of approximately
$3.2 million.

     COMMISSION EXPENSE

     Commission expense increased 49% to $20.9 million during the six months
ended June 30, 2001 from $14.0 million in the same period of 2000 as a result of
higher sales.

     OTHER DIRECT COSTS

     For the six months ended June 30, 2001, Cross Media recorded $11.4 million
of other direct costs related to sales of magazine contracts and other revenues,
a $6.6 million increase from the $4.8 million of costs recorded in the six
months ended June 30, 2001. The increase consists largely of $3.0 million of
direct recurring payroll, rent and other costs related to the expansion of Cross
Media's operations.

     GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

     General and administrative expenses increased $2.5 million to $5.5 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $3.0 million for the same period in
2000. This increase primarily reflects an increase in administrative personnel
at Media Outsourcing, professional fees and operational expenses of Cross Media.

     CONSULTING EXPENSES

     Consulting expenses decreased by $1.8 million to $0.5 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2001 from $2.3 million for the six months ended June 30,
2000. Consulting expenses were significantly higher for the six months ended
June 30, 2000 due to the acquisition of Direct Sales International in calendar
year 2000.

     AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL

     During the six months ended June 30, 2001, Cross Media amortized $0.3
million of the $7.0 million of goodwill recorded in connection with the
acquisition of Direct Sales International on January 28, 2000 and $0.2 million
of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of WeFusion on November
30, 2000. During the six-month period June 30, 2000, Cross Media amortized $0.2
million relating to the acquisition of Direct Sales International.

     INTEREST EXPENSE

     Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2001 was $1.0 million, a
decrease of $1.9 million from $2.9 million for the six months ended June 30,
2000. The decrease is primarily related to the one time non-cash interest
expense of $1.9 million recorded in the six-month period ended June 30, 2000
representing the fair value of shares and warrants issued in connection with the
initial issuance and subsequent conversion of the Direct Sales International
acquisition bridge financing.

     INCOME TAXES

     For the six months ended June 30, 2001, Cross Media recorded a $0.7 million
tax provision based on an estimate of its effective tax rate projected for the
year ended December 31, 2001. Cross Media may adjust the assumptions of its
projected earnings used to calculate the tax rate. Cross Media has Federal and
state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $7.0 million available
to offset future taxable income, if any, through December 2020. Cross Media's
ability to use these net operating losses may be substantially limited because
of the "change of ownership" provisions under Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code and similar state provisions. As a result of these limitations,
some or all of Cross Media's net operating losses may expire before it can use
them. Cross Media has established a valuation allowance

to reserve for the deferred tax assets arising from the net operating losses and
other temporary differences, since Cross Media cannot be sure that it will
benefit from them in the future.

     PREFERRED DIVIDENDS

     For the six months ended June 30, 2001, Cross Media recorded $1.3 million
of dividends including $0.9 million of non-cash deemed dividends and
approximately $0.4 million of contractual dividends. On February 15, 2001, Cross
Media redeemed 22,992 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock. The
remaining 39,363 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock were converted
into 3,946,250 shares of common stock. In consideration of the agreement of the
holders to convert the Series C convertible preferred stock, Cross Media agreed
to issue to the holders a total of 666,400 additional shares of Cross Media
common stock, pro rata in accordance with the number of shares each holder
converted. The non-cash deemed dividend of $0.9 million represents the fair
value of the additional shares issued. For the six months ended June 30, 2000,
Cross Media recorded $31.9 million of dividends including $31.6 million of
non-cash deemed dividends in connection with the Series A-1, B and C preferred
stock Cross Media issued to complete the acquisition of Direct Sales
International.

     NET INCOME (LOSS) AND NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE

     During the six months ended June 30, 2001, net income applicable to common
stockholders was $1.6 million or basic earnings per share of $0.05 compared to a
net loss applicable to common stockholders of $32.3 million or $(1.58) per share
for the six months ended June 30, 2000.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 1999

     REVENUES

     Cross Media recorded revenues totaling $55.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000. These revenues were derived from the sale of magazine
contracts at Media Outsourcing totaling approximately $52.2 million and
commission revenues from sales of memberships in a third party discount-buying
club totaling approximately $3.3 million. There were no revenues in the
comparable period in 1999 as these revenues related to the operations of Direct
Sales International that were acquired on January 28, 2000. Cross Media records
its revenues from sales of magazine subscriptions net of cancellation and
collection reserves and payments to publishers for fulfillment costs. In the
third and fourth quarters of 2000, Cross Media increased the reserves on its 20
pay contracts (magazine subscriptions payable by the subscriber in 20 monthly
installments) resulting in a reduction of revenues of $1.1 million and $880,000,
respectively.

     COMMISSION EXPENSE

     Cross Media recognized approximately $30.8 million in commission expense
for the year ended December 31, 2000, reflecting payments made to brokers on
Media Outsourcing magazine sales. There were no commission expenses in the
comparable period in 1999 as such commission expenses related to the operations
of Direct Sales International that were acquired on January 28, 2000.

     OTHER DIRECT COSTS

     Cross Media recorded $10.6 million of other direct costs related to the
magazine sales at Media Outsourcing. Other direct costs consisted primarily of
wages of approximately $5.4 million, bank charges related to the processing of
payments received by credit cards of approximately $1.4 million and other costs
of approximately $3.8 million. There were no other direct costs for the
comparable period in 1999, as such other direct costs related to the operations
of Direct Sales International that were acquired on January 28, 2000.

     GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

     General and administrative expenses increased $6.1 million to $8.4 million
in 2000 from $2.3 million in 1999. This increase reflects salary expense of
approximately $2.5 million related to Media Outsourcing and approximately $1.3
million of increased cost related to increased staff at Cross Media. Cross Media
had approximately 233 full-time and 51 part-time employees as of December 31,
2000. The increase is also related to $2.1 million of other operating expenses
incurred at Media Outsourcing since the acquisition of the operations of Direct
Sales International, including accounting and legal expenses of $306,000, travel
and entertainment expenses of $166,000, rent of $162,000 and depreciation of
$84,000. Other operating expenses in 1999 consisted primarily of accounting and
legal expenses of approximately $462,000, travel and entertainment expenses of
approximately $211,000 and office expenses of approximately $195,000. Also
included in other operating expenses for 1999 are the net loss of $178,511
incurred on Cross Media's Publisher's Advantage operations that were closed in
June 1999 and a bad debt expense of $500,000 related to the 100% valuation
reserve recorded on a $500,000 loan made to AmeriNet in 1999.

     CONSULTING EXPENSES

     Consulting expenses decreased $2.5 million, or 37.9%, to $4.1 million in
2000 from $6.6 million in 1999. Included in consulting expenses for 2000 are
approximately $1.6 million of non-cash charges for investor and public relations
and strategic planning services reflecting the estimated fair value of warrants
and options granted to purchase 2,512,000 shares of Cross Media common stock
ranging between $1.00 and $4.00 per share with terms of between two and five
years. Included in consulting expenses for 1999 are approximately $3.3 million
of non-cash charges for investor relations and strategic planning services
reflecting the estimated fair value of five-year warrants granted to purchase
860,000 shares of Cross Media common stock ranging between $1.00 and $2.00 per
share. The fair value of these warrants was estimated using the Black-Scholes
option pricing formula. Additionally, approximately $1.1 million and $2.7
million of the consulting expenses incurred in 2000 and 1999, respectively,
reflects the fair value of 535,000 shares and 870,000 shares of Cross Media
common stock issued for professional services rendered in 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

     AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL

     During 2000, Cross Media recorded $0.5 million of goodwill amortization
primarily related to the $7.0 million of goodwill recorded in connection with
the January 28, 2000 acquisition of Direct Sales International. Goodwill related
to the acquisition of Direct Sales International is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over a ten-year period.

     In connection with the acquisition of WeFusion.com, Cross Media recorded
$1.9 million of goodwill, which is being amortized over a seven-year period and
will result in an increase in goodwill amortization of approximately $275,000
per year beginning in 2001.

     In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued of SFAS No.
141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets." The new standards require that all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001 must be accounted for under the purchase method. In
addition, all intangible assets acquired that are obtained through contractual
or legal right, or are capable of being separately sold, transferred, licensed,
rented or exchanged shall be recognized as an asset apart from goodwill.
Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives will no longer be subject to
amortization, but will be subject to at least an annual assessment for
impairment by applying a fair value based test.

     INTEREST EXPENSE

     During 2000, Cross Media recorded interest expense of $4.4 million,
primarily consisting of $2.4 million of non-cash interest related to the fair
value of shares and warrants issued in connection with the initial issuance and
subsequent conversions of the acquisition of Direct Sales International
financings and

approximately $1.9 million related to the amortization of deferred financing
fees and interest on the Coast facility.

     COSTS OF ACQUISITIONS NOT CONSUMMATED

     In August 2000, Cross Media entered into an agreement to acquire National
Syndications, Inc., a direct marketer of consumer products and a party to
service advertising contracts. In February 2001, Cross Media and National
Syndications terminated the agreement. As a result of this termination, in the
fourth quarter of 2000, Cross Media recorded a charge of $967,500, representing
the write-off of non-refundable deposits and professional fees incurred related
to the transaction.

     In February 2000, Cross Media announced its decision not to exercise its
options to purchase 50.1% of the outstanding common stock of AmeriNet or all of
the outstanding common stock of Hamilton Telecommunications, Ltd. As a result,
Cross Media recorded a charge of $621,716 during the fourth quarter of 1999,
representing the cost of legal and professional fees. This charge, which is
presented as the cost of acquisitions not consummated, consists principally of
professional and consulting fees, including $38,000 representing the fair value
of Cross Media common stock purchase warrants and $432,000 representing the fair
value of 225,000 shares of Cross Media common stock that were issued to various
consultants.

     OTHER INCOME

     Other income increased $317,000 to $347,000 in 2000 from $30,000 in 1999.
Included in other income for 2000 is approximately $245,000 of fees earned from
the sale of third-party long distance telephone service, interest income and
other fee income of approximately $102,000. Other income for 1999 represented
interest income earned on Cross Media's overnight investments.

     INCOME TAXES

     Cross Media recorded a $0.3 million provision for income taxes in 2000
reflecting a state tax liability resulting from the Media Outsourcing
operations. No provision was recorded for federal income taxes in 2000 or 1999,
as Cross Media had incurred net operating losses since inception.

     The utilization of net operating losses is subject to a substantial
limitation due to the change of ownership provisions under Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. This limitation may result
in the expiration of the net operating losses before their utilization. A 100%
valuation allowance has been established to reserve for the deferred tax assets
arising from the net operating losses and other temporary differences since
there is no assurance that their benefit will be realized in the future.

     PREFERRED DIVIDENDS

     Cross Media accounted for the issuances of its preferred stock in
accordance with EITF Issue No. 98-5, as amended by EITF Issue 00-27. Both Issues
are titled "Convertible Securities With Beneficial Conversion Features or
Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios." As a result of the issuance and
adoption of EITF 00-27 in November 2000, Cross Media has adjusted preferred
stock dividends recorded in prior fiscal 2000 quarters that were related to
effective beneficial conversion features. In accordance with EITF 00-27, Cross
Media recorded $39.6 million of dividends for 2000, including $38.7 million of
non-cash deemed dividends and contractual dividends of approximately $0.9
million in connection with the issuance of shares of Series A-1, B, and C
preferred stock to complete the acquisition of Direct Sales International on
January 28, 2000 and the issuance of shares of another Series A convertible
preferred stock, referred to as the Series A preferred stock, and additional
shares of Series C convertible preferred stock.

     Deemed dividends represent:

     - the accretion of the difference between the carrying value and the
       mandatory redemption amounts of preferred stock that resulted from
       allocating a portion of the proceeds to Cross Media common

       stock, Cross Media common stock purchase warrants, and the beneficial
       conversion features of the shares;

     - dividends received in connection with the conversion of the Series A-1
       preferred stock into Cross Media common stock on March 27, 2000; and

     - dividends received upon the extension of the redemption date and the
       adjustment of the default conversion price of the Series C convertible
       preferred stock.

     EXTRAORDINARY LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF ACQUISITION LIABILITY

     In connection with the acquisition of Direct Sales International, Cross
Media agreed to provide a $1.5 million credit facility to AmeriNet. In 2000,
Cross Media loaned AmeriNet an aggregate $300,000 pursuant to this credit
facility. In November 2000, Cross Media exchanged 1.0 million shares of its
common stock, with a fair value of $1.9 million, in full satisfaction of the
remaining obligation to AmeriNet and, accordingly, recognized in the fourth
quarter 2000, an extraordinary loss on the extinguishment of acquisition
liability of $767,500.

     NET LOSS AND NET LOSS PER SHARE

     The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $44.6 million, or
$1.84 per share, compared to a net loss of $9.5 million, or $0.80 per share, for
1999. The increase in the net loss to common stockholders reflects the impact of
the $39.6 million of preferred dividends recorded for the year ended December
31, 2000 and increased interest charges related to the acquisition financings,
partially offset by decreased consulting costs and Media Outsourcing's earnings
from January 28, 2000 through December 31, 2000.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     At June 30, 2001, Cross Media had cash on hand of $1.8 million. For the
three months ended June 30, 2001, Cross Media used $2.1 million in operations
and $1.5 million in investing activities and generated $3.1 million from
financing activities. Through the operations of Media Outsourcing, Cross Media
generates cash flow from the sale and collection of consumer receivables,
commissions earned from publishers in connection with originating paid
subscriptions for certain publications, and commissions earned on the sale of
third party discount buying club memberships. Media Outsourcing uses these funds
as well as funds available under its revolving credit facility to fund its
working capital needs.

     Under the Coast facility, Media Outsourcing is generally permitted to make
distributions to Cross Media of up to $400,000 per month, plus any amounts
necessary for Cross Media to satisfy tax obligations attributable to Media
Outsourcing's operations. Cross Media believes that the cash flow from
operations at Media Outsourcing, and the amount available for borrowing under
the revolving credit facility is currently sufficient to meet its day-to-day
operating requirements. However, Media Outsourcing's cash flow would not be
sufficient to complete any additional acquisitions in furtherance of Cross
Media's overall strategy. Consequently, Cross Media may be required to raise
additional financing to fund any future acquisitions.

     During the quarter ended March 31, 2000, Cross Media financed the cash
portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of Direct Sales International
by borrowing $16.0 million under a credit facility provided by Coast Business
Credit and by using proceeds totaling approximately $9.2 million from the
issuance of its common stock, warrants to purchase common stock, convertible
preferred stock and convertible debt. As of March 31, 2001, all of the
convertible debt issued in connection with the acquisition of Direct Sales
International had either been converted into common stock or paid and all of the
convertible preferred stock issued in connection with the acquisition of Direct
Sales of International had either been converted into common stock or redeemed.

     AMERINET COMMITMENT

     In February 2000, Cross Media decided not to exercise its option to acquire
50.1% of the outstanding stock of AmeriNet, Inc., but as a prerequisite to
consummating the acquisition of Direct Sales International, agreed to provide a
$1.5 million credit facility to AmeriNet in addition to a $500,000 loan made
during 1999. Richard Prochnow, the seller of Direct Sales International owns 50%
of the common stock of AmeriNet. Due to the uncertainty of AmeriNet's ability to
repay any of these loans, Cross Media treated its commitment to provide
additional funding to AmeriNet as an increase in the purchase price of Direct
Sales International. Under the original terms of the credit facility, Cross
Media was obligated to lend AmeriNet $100,000 per month for the ten months
beginning in March 2000 through December 2000 inclusive, and on or before July
28, 2000, to purchase for $500,000 a $500,000 principal amount note issued by
AmeriNet to RLP Holdings L.P., an affiliate of Mr. Prochnow. Cross Media loaned
AmeriNet an aggregate of $300,000 in connection with the credit facility. In
November 2000, Cross Media exchanged 1.0 million shares of its common stock,
with a fair value of $1.9 million, in full satisfaction of the remaining
obligation to AmeriNet of $1.2 million and accordingly, recognized in the fourth
quarter of 2000, an extraordinary loss on the extinguishment of acquisition
liability of $767,500.

     COAST BUSINESS CREDIT FINANCING FACILITY

     In connection with the acquisition of Direct Sales International, Media
Outsourcing and Cross Media entered into an agreement with Coast Business Credit
to provide a credit facility used to fund the acquisition of Direct Sales
International and working capital needs of Media Outsourcing. The Coast facility
is for a term of three years, and provides a maximum credit line of $20.0
million, subject to certain availability limitations. As a result of these
limitations, the amount available for borrowing under the Coast facility at the
time of the acquisition of Direct Sales International was $16.0 million, which
Media Outsourcing drew down in its entirety to finance the acquisition of Direct
Sales International. Interest on outstanding advances under the Coast facility
accrues at an annual rate equal to the higher of (a) the prime rate plus 200
basis points, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a
360 day year, and (b) 9.0%. The Coast facility requires Cross Media and Media
Outsourcing to comply with specified financial covenants.

     When the Coast facility was established, Cross Media issued to Coast a
five-year warrant to purchase its common stock. As of December 31, 2000, Coast
was entitled to purchase 443,884 shares of common stock under this warrant at an
exercise price of $2.39 per share. As a result of anti-dilution adjustments, the
number of shares Coast was entitled to purchase under the warrant as of June 30,
2001 increased to 484,669 and the exercise price of the warrant was reduced to
$2.19 per share. Cross Media recorded a non-cash interest charge of
approximately $20,491 for the six month period ended June 30, 2001 as a result
of these adjustments.

     Coast extended the facility to Cross Media, subject to the condition that
we raise additional equity capital of not less than $3 million by February 28,
2000, which was subsequently extended to March 31, 2000. On March 30, 2000, the
Coast facility was amended as follows:

     - the covenant requiring Cross Media to raise additional cash equity of
       $3.0 million was eliminated;

     - the parties reduced the consolidated net worth covenant to $9.0 million
       from $12.0 million at March 31, 2000; and

     - a new covenant was added requiring that Cross Media maintain excess
       borrowing availability of $750,000.

     As of June 30, 2001, the outstanding loan balance under the Coast facility
was approximately $14.6 million and the total amount available for borrowing was
$18.0 million. Therefore, Media Outsourcing was entitled to borrow an additional
$3.4 million under the Coast facility as of June 30, 2001.

     In May 2001, the Coast facility was amended to provide for, among other
things:

     - Coast's waiver of the requirement that Cross Media maintain a minimum
       tangible net worth through March 31, 2001;

     - Coast's waiver of any violation of the limitation on distributions by
       Media Outsourcing to Cross Media with respect to a $1,000,000
       distribution in February 2001 and agreement that commencing in May 2001,
       as long as Media Outsourcing has excess borrowing availability of at
       least $2.0 million under the facility, Media Outsourcing will be
       permitted to distribute a total of up to $400,000 per month to Cross
       Media (in addition to any amounts necessary for Cross Media to satisfy
       tax obligations attributable to Media Outsourcing's operations). Prior to
       the May 2001 amendment, Media Outsourcing was only entitled to distribute
       a total of $150,000 per month plus tax distributions; and

     - Cross Media's agreement to maintain a minimum ratio of senior debt to
       earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization of no
       greater than 1.5 to 1.

     Management expects to be fully in compliance with the provisions of this
agreement going forward.

     SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

     In June and August 2000, Cross Media issued and sold an aggregate of 50,625
shares of Series A convertible preferred stock to The Shaar Fund, Ltd., or
Shaar. The Series A convertible preferred stock is referred to as the Series A
preferred stock or Series A Shares, and is a different series from the Series A
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock referred to below as the Series A-1
preferred stock. The face amount of the Series A preferred stock is $100 per
share or a total of $5,062,500 for all of the outstanding Series A Shares. Cross
Media also issued to Shaar five year warrants to purchase 375,000 shares of
common stock at an initial exercise price of $1.485, subject to certain
anti-dilution and similar adjustments.

     Dividends are payable on the Series A Shares on July 1 and January 1 of
each year, at an annual rate of 10% of the face amount. Dividends are payable in
cash or, if the conditions described in the certificate of designations are
satisfied, in additional shares of Cross Media common stock valued at the
conversion price on the dividend payment date.

     Initially, Cross Media had the right to redeem all, but not less than all,
of the outstanding Series A Shares at a redemption price of 100% of face value
plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, provided that the average of the closing
ask prices of the common stock for the 20 trading days preceding the notice of
redemption were less than $5.00 per share. Cross Media has agreed with Shaar not
to exercise its right of redemption, except as described below.

     The Series A Shares are convertible at the option of Shaar into a number of
shares of Cross Media common stock determined by dividing the applicable
conversion price into the stated value of the Series A Shares. The conversion
price is currently the lower of either $1.9250 or 91% of the average of the
three lowest, non-consecutive closing bid prices for the common stock during the
10 trading days preceding the date of Shaar's notice to Cross Media of the
conversion, with a minimum conversion price of $1.50.

     The conversion price of the Series A Shares, and the exercise price of the
related warrants, are currently subject to downward adjustment to equal the
lowest price at which shares of Cross Media common stock or securities
convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of Cross Media
common stock, are issued while the Series A Shares remain outstanding, subject
to specified exceptions.

     On July 18, 2001, Cross Media entered into agreements with Shaar which
provide that the following will occur, simultaneously with and conditioned upon
the consummation of the merger:

     - Cross Media will redeem 25,312.5 Series A Shares for a cash payment of
       $2,531,250, or $100 per share, provided that Shaar may elect to convert
       these shares into shares of Cross Media common stock at a conversion
       price of $1.48 per share, in which event Shaar would receive 1,710,304
       shares

       of common stock; and Shaar will convert the remaining 25,312.2 Series A
       Shares, at a conversion price of $1.48 per share, into 1,710,304 shares
       of common stock.

     - In consideration of Shaar's agreement to convert at least half of the
       Series A Shares into Cross Media common stock, Cross Media will pay Shaar
       $968,750. Shaar may elect to receive this payment:

        - wholly in cash;

        - in cash and Cross Media common stock, based on a $1.48 price per
          share; or

        - wholly in Cross Media common stock, based on a $1.48 price per share.

     - All accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A Shares that are
       converted and redeemed will be paid through the issuance of additional
       shares of Cross Media common stock, based upon the $1.48 per share
       conversion price.

     - The warrants to purchase 375,000 shares of Cross Media common stock
       issued to Shaar in connection with its purchase of the Series A Shares
       will be amended to replace the existing anti-dilution provisions with
       standard broad-based weighted average anti-dilution provisions. Cross
       Media will issue to Shaar additional 5-year warrants to purchase 250,000
       shares of its common stock with an exercise price of $1.9845. These
       warrants will have the same anti-dilution provisions as the amended
       warrants referred to above.

     These agreements with Shaar also provide that, if the merger agreement is
terminated or the merger is not completed by June 18, 2002, Shaar must elect to:

     - exchange the Series A Shares for a new series of convertible preferred
       stock with a conversion price fixed at $1.48 per share, subject to
       broad-based weighted average anti-dilution protection; or

     - exchange the Series A Shares for a new series of convertible preferred
       stock with the same terms and provisions as the existing Series A Shares,
       except that, during the period beginning on the date of the exchange
       through the earlier of the six month anniversary of the date of the
       exchange and June 9, 2002, the minimum conversion price for the shares in
       the new series will be $1.50 per share, and Cross Media will not be
       permitted to redeem the shares in the new series.

     Cross Media's agreements with Shaar also provide that during the period
from July 18, 2001 through the earlier of the closing of the merger and the
exchange of new Series A Shares for a new series of preferred stock described
above, but in any event no later than July 18, 2002, the minimum conversion
price for the Series A Shares will be $1.50, unless an anti-dilution adjustment
reduces the conversion price to less than $1.50, in which event the $1.50
minimum would no longer apply, and Cross Media will not be permitted to redeem
the Series A Shares.

     SERIES A-1 MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

     On January 28, 2000, in a private placement, Cross Media sold 21,500 units,
each unit consisting of one share of Series A-1 preferred stock, with a face
value of $100, and 20 shares of Cross Media common stock, for gross proceeds of
$2.0 million. The Series A-1 preferred stock was initially convertible into
1,075,000 shares of Cross Media common stock at a conversion ratio of $2.00 per
share and was entitled to a 16% cumulative dividend. Since Series A-1 preferred
stock remained outstanding subsequent to February 27, 2000, Cross Media was
required to issue to the holders an aggregate of 16,125 shares of common stock
per day for each day that the Series A-1 convertible preferred stock remained
outstanding from February 28 through March 28, 2000 and 26,875 shares of common
stock per day for each day that the Series A-1 preferred stock remained
outstanding after March 28, 2000. The Series A-1 preferred stock was mandatorily
redeemable on or before March 28, 2000.

     On March 21, 2000, the holders of the Series A-1 preferred stock extended
the due date for the redemption of their shares from March 28, 2000 to April 12,
2000 in exchange for 275,000 shares of Cross Media common stock. On March 27,
2000, they agreed to convert their shares of Series A-1 preferred

stock into Cross Media common stock. In addition, the Series A-1 preferred
stockholders were issued 2,317,334 five-year common stock purchase warrants,
including 1,158,667 with an exercise price of $0.50 per share and 1,158,667 with
an exercise price of $1.00 per share. One of the Series A-1 preferred stock
holders was issued a warrant to purchase 300,000 shares of Cross Media common
stock at an exercise price of $2.25 per share as a fee in connection with the
March 27, 2000 agreement.

     On March 27, 2000, Cross Media issued an aggregate of 5,118,416 shares to
the former Series A-1 preferred stock holders in respect of Cross Media's
failure to redeem the Series A-1 shares during the period February 28 through
March 27, 2000, the extension of the redemption due date from March 28 to April
12, 2000 and the conversion of the Series A-1 shares into common stock. Cross
Media also issued to these holders warrants to purchase 2,317,334 shares of
common stock.

     SERIES B MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

     On January 28, 2000, in a private placement, Cross Media sold 15,350 units,
each unit consisting of one share of Series B preferred stock, with a face value
of $100, and warrants to purchase 25 shares of Cross Media common stock, for
gross proceeds of $1.5 million. The Series B preferred stock was originally
convertible into 767,500 shares of Cross Media common stock at a conversion
ratio of $2.00 per share and was entitled to a 10% cumulative dividend, payable
quarterly. The common stock purchase warrants were exercisable for three years
from the date of issuance and had an exercise price of $1.50 per share. The
Series B preferred stock was mandatorily redeemable on the earlier of July 26,
2000 or upon the consummation of an additional financing transaction resulting
in gross proceeds of at least $10 million to Cross Media.

     By letter agreement dated June 16, 2000, Cross Media offered to permit the
holders of Series B preferred stock to convert their shares of Series B
preferred stock into Cross Media common stock at an effective conversion ratio
of $0.50 or to redeem the Series B preferred stock at the then effective
redemption price, $100 per share plus accrued dividends. In addition, whether a
holder elected to convert shares of Series B preferred stock or to be redeemed,
Cross Media agreed to issue to the holders, ratably in accordance with their
respective percentage interests in the outstanding Series B preferred stock, an
aggregate of 122,800 three-year warrants to purchase Cross Media common stock at
an exercise price of $0.75 per share and 200,000 three-year warrants to purchase
Cross Media common stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share. Cross Media
also agreed to reduce the exercise price of the original warrants from $1.50 to
$0.75. In addition, Cross Media agreed to issue to placements agents who
received commissions consisting of three-year warrants to purchase a total of
58,163 shares of Cross Media common stock in connection with the original Series
B preferred stock financing a total of 17,820 three-year warrants to purchase

the exercise price of the warrants originally from $1.50 per share to $0.75 per
share.

     The holders of 3,000 shares elected to convert their Series B preferred
stock, and accrued dividends thereon, into an aggregate of 610,333 shares of
Cross Media common stock. Cross Media redeemed the remaining shares of Series B
preferred stock on June 29, 2000 for an aggregate redemption price of

     SERIES C MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

     On January 28, 2000, in a private placement, Cross Media sold 52,892 shares
of Series C convertible preferred stock resulting in proceeds of approximately
$5.0 million. The Series C convertible preferred stock was initially convertible
into shares of Cross Media common stock at a conversion ratio of $2.00 per share
and was entitled to a 10% cumulative dividend. In connection with the initial
issuance and sale of these shares Cross Media also issued 1,763,067 shares of
its common stock to the holders of the Series C convertible preferred stock and
reduced the exercise price of warrants to purchase 2,000,000 shares of common
stock previously issued to a holder of Series C convertible preferred stock from
$3.50 per share to $1.00 per share.

     The Series C convertible preferred stock was originally mandatorily
redeemable on the earlier of July 26, 2000 or upon the consummation of a
financing transaction resulting in gross proceeds of at least $10.0 million to
Cross Media. On April 24, 2000, the holders of the Series C convertible
preferred stock agreed to extend the mandatory redemption date of the Series C
convertible preferred stock from July 26, 2000 to December 26, 2000 in exchange
for 2,247,067 shares of Cross Media common stock and a reduction in the
effective conversion ratio from $2.00 per share to $1.00 per share. The value of
the shares of Cross Media common stock issued and change in the effective
conversion ratio were reflected during the second quarter of 2000 as an
additional deemed dividend in the amount of $8,560,417.

     On June 14, 2000, Cross Media sold an additional 7,500 shares of Series C
convertible preferred stock and 250,000 shares of common stock for a total price
of $750,000. Cross Media also agreed to reduce the exercise price of warrants to
purchase 2,000,000 shares of its common stock held by the purchaser of the
additional shares of Series C convertible preferred stock from $1.00 to $0.50
per share. Cross Media paid a fee in connection with the issuance of the
additional shares of Series C convertible preferred stock of 562.5 shares of
Series C convertible preferred stock, five-year warrants to purchase 100,000
shares of common stock at a price of $1.88 per share and 18,750 shares of Cross
Media common stock.

     On July 18, 2000, the holders of the Series C convertible preferred stock
agreed to waive the requirement that a failure to redeem the Series C
convertible preferred stock on or before December 26, 2000 would trigger a
reduction in the conversion ratio of the Series C convertible preferred stock to
$0.25 per share. In consideration for this waiver, Cross Media agreed to issue
to the holders a total of 1,523,750 shares of common stock, pro rata in
accordance with their percentage holdings of the Series C convertible preferred
stock and additional shares of Series C convertible preferred stock. Cross Media
also paid a fee in connection with the waiver by issuing an additional 1,500
shares of Series C convertible preferred stock and 50,000 shares of common
stock. The value of the shares Cross Media issued in order to obtain the waiver
was reflected during the third quarter of 2000 as an additional deemed dividend
in the amount of $3,026,028.

     On December 19, 2000, the holders of the Series C convertible preferred
stock and the additional shares of Series C convertible preferred stock agreed
to extend the mandatory redemption date of the Series C convertible preferred
stock from December 26, 2000 to January 26, 2001. On January 25, 2001, the
holders agreed to further extend the redemption date from January 26, 2001 to
February 15, 2001. On February 15, 2001, Cross Media redeemed 22,992 shares of
Series C convertible preferred stock for an aggregate redemption price of

of Cross Media common stock at an effective conversion ratio of $1.00 per share.
In consideration of the agreement of the holders to convert the Series C Shares
and New Series C convertible preferred stock, which would otherwise have been
mandatorily redeemable by Cross Media in full on February 15, 2001, Cross Media
agreed to issue to the holders 666,400 additional shares of its common stock,
pro rata in accordance with the number of shares they converted. The value of
the shares of common stock Cross Media issued was reflected in the first quarter
of 2001 as an additional deemed dividend in the amount of $899,640. Cross Media
also agreed to pay a fee of $100,000 to one of the Series C convertible
preferred stockholders in connection with its services relating to the
negotiation of these agreements. There is a note payable of $199,200 related to
the redemption of the Series C convertible preferred stock.

     Cross Media obtained a portion of the funds required to redeem the Series C
convertible preferred stock by selling 1,500,000 shares of its common stock, in
private placements, at a price of $1.00 per share.

ACQUISITION BRIDGE FINANCING

     COMMTEL SERVICES LTD. NOTE

     On January 20, 2000, Cross Media entered into a note agreement with Commtel
Services Ltd. for a 30-day bridge loan in the principal amount of $300,000. The
proceeds of this loan were used in connection with the financing of the
acquisition of Direct Sales International. The Commtel note accrued interest of
a rate of 10% per annum, with principal and interest due and payable on February
20, 2000. In

consideration of the loan, Cross Media issued 75,000 shares of its common stock
to Commtel. Cross Media failed to pay the Commtel note at maturity, as a result
of which:

     - the annual interest rate on the Commtel note increased to 18% on all
       outstanding principal and accrued interest; and

     - Cross Media was required to issue to Commtel an additional 50,000 shares
       of its common stock as of February 21, 2000 and an additional 2,500
       shares of its common stock for each subsequent day until the Commtel note
       was paid or converted, aggregating 77,500 shares on March 21, 2000.

     On March 21, 2000, Commtel converted the Commtel Note into approximately
614,048 shares of Cross Media common stock in satisfaction of all principal and
interest due. The proceeds received from the issuance of the Commtel note with
Cross Media common stock are being allocated to each component based on their
relative fair values on January 20, 2000, the date of issuance. The fair value
of Cross Media common stock on January 20, 2000 was $2.31 per share and resulted
in discounted carrying value to the Commtel note of $200,000 and an increase to
stockholders' equity of $100,000.

     As a result of the conversion of the Commtel note, during the first quarter
of 2000, Cross Media recorded additional interest expense of approximately $1.2
million including interest of 10% on the Commtel note, the fair market value of
additional common stock issued under the penalty provision of the Commtel note,
and the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion of the Commtel note into
614,048 shares of Cross Media common stock.

     FONTENELLE NOTE

     On January 25, 2000, Cross Media borrowed $500,000 from Fontenelle LLC,

     The proceeds of this loan were used primarily in connection with the
financing of the acquisition of Direct Sales International. Interest accrued on
the Fontenelle note at an annual rate of 10% and was due and payable along with
the outstanding principal at maturity. The Fontenelle note was convertible into
shares of Cross Media common stock at a conversion price of $2.00 per share.
Cross Media paid the Fontenelle note in full on March 24, 2000.

     D2 LOAN

     On January 25, 2000, Cross Media borrowed $300,000 from D2 Co. LLC, which

along with the outstanding principal at maturity. The outstanding principal
amount of the loan was convertible into 150,000 shares of Cross Media common
stock at a conversion price of $2.00 per share. If Cross Media did not pay the
loan by July 26, 2000, the conversion price would have been reduced to $0.50 per
share, representing 600,000 shares of Cross Media common stock. Cross Media paid
the loan in full on June 12, 2000.

NOTES PAYABLE

     MANAGEMENT GROUP NOTE

     On April 6, 2000, Cross Media entered into a term loan agreement with the

and Board of Directors level positions with D'Arcy Macius Benton & Bowles, Inc.,
an international marketing communications organization.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETINGS AND BOARD COMMITTEES

     The board of directors held nine meetings during 2000. None of the
directors attended fewer than 75% of all of the meetings of the board of
directors (held during the period for which he was a director) and the meetings
of all committees of the board of directors on which the director served.

     The board of directors has an audit committee and a compensation committee,
but does not have a nominating committee. The audit committee, which is
currently composed of Messrs. Cohen, Dorskind and Lambert, reviews the
professional services provided by Cross Media's independent auditors and
monitors the scope and results of the annual audit; reviews proposed changes in
Cross Media's financial and accounting standards and principles; reviews Cross
Media's policies and procedures with respect to its internal accounting,
auditing and financial controls; makes recommendations to the board of directors
on the engagement of the independent auditors and addresses other matters that
may come before it or as directed by the board of directors. None of Messrs.
Cohen, Dorskind or Lambert is currently an officer of Cross Media or of any of
its subsidiaries, and all are "independent" under the American Stock Exchange
listing requirements as currently in effect. The audit committee held two
meetings during the 2000 fiscal year.

     The compensation committee currently consists of Messrs. Lambert, Cohen and
Dorskind. The purpose of the compensation committee is to review, on an annual
basis or more frequently as it deems appropriate, the performance of the
executive officers of Cross Media, review the amount and form of compensation
payable to the executive officers of Cross Media and report to the board of
directors on an annual basis, making recommendations regarding compensation of
the executive officers. In addition, the compensation committee administers the
1998 Stock Option Plan. The compensation committee held five meetings during
2000.

     The board of directors also has an executive committee, which currently
consists of Messrs. Altbach, Kaufman and Cohen. The executive committee has been
empowered to exercise all of the powers and authorities of the board of
directors in the management of the business and affairs of Cross Media, except
that the executive committee does not have power and authority with respect to
the following matters:

     - approving or adopting, or recommending to the stockholders, any action or
       matter expressly required by the Delaware General Corporation Law to be
       submitted to the stockholders for approval; or

     - adopting, amending or repealing any bylaw of Cross Media.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

     DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

     Prior to August 23, 2000, directors did not receive cash compensation for
services rendered as directors. On August 23, 2000, the Cross Media board of
directors adopted a resolution setting director compensation at $2,500 for each
meeting attended in person. During 2000, Richard Cohen, Bruce Dorskind and Ken
Lambert each received $5,000 for attending meetings of the board of directors.
During 2000, each non-management director was granted options to purchase
120,000 shares of Cross Media common stock as compensation for services provided
as a director, and each member of the audit committee of the board of directors
was granted options to purchase 30,000 shares of Cross media common stock as
compensation for serving as a member of the audit committee. Any additional
option grants will be in the discretion of the compensation committee.

     Board of directors members are reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred
in connection with attending meetings of the board of directors and of
committees.

- ---------------
(1) In connection with the termination, effective as of January 28, 2000, of the
    consulting agreement among Cross Media, Executive Management Services and
    Rupert Galliers-Pratt, Cross Media granted Executive Management Services
    options to purchase 125,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of
    $2.50 per share, with an expiration date of August 3, 2005. By letter dated
    November 1, 1999, Mr. Galliers-Pratt resigned as Chief Executive Officer and
    Co-Chairman of the Board of Directors, effective January 28, 2000. In
    addition, Mr. Ledwick resigned as Chief Financial Officer effective April
    27, 2001.

(2) Each option has a maximum term of 10 years, subject to earlier termination
    in the event of the optionee's cessation of service with Cross Media. Each
    option provides for adjustments to the exercise price and corresponding
    proportional adjustments in the number of shares purchasable upon exercise
    in the event of any stock splits, reverse stock splits and the payment of
    dividends on the common stock of Cross Media. In the event of any capital
    reorganization, any reclassification of the common stock of Cross Media, or
    the consolidation or merger of Cross Media, each referred to as a
    reorganization, in which Cross Media is the continuing corporation, the
    option holder is entitled, upon exercise of the options, to purchase the
    number and kind of shares, interests or other property that the option
    holder would have been entitled to receive had the option holder exercised
    the options immediately prior to any reorganization. In the event of a
    dissolution or liquidation of Cross Media, or any reorganization in which
    Cross Media is not the continuing corporation, each option terminates;
    provided, however, that in the event of a reorganization in which Cross
    Media is not the continuing corporation, the continuing corporation may, but
    is not obligated to, tender to any optionee options to purchase shares of
    the continuing corporation and if the continuing corporation does not so
    tender options to purchase shares of the continuing corporation, all options
    granted become immediately exercisable notwithstanding any installment
    provision provided for under any option grant.

(3) The exercise price may be paid in cash or, in the sole discretion of the
    board of directors:

     - by delivery of other shares of Cross Media common stock (valued at fair
       market value on the exercise date);

     - through cashless exercise (by reducing the number of shares otherwise
       purchasable upon exercise);

     - through use of a note payable to the order of Cross Media in the amount
       of the purchase price due upon exercise, or through any other deferred
       payment arrangement approval by the board of directors; or

     - by use of any other legal consideration.

     EMPLOYMENT AND CONSULTING CONTRACTS

     In January 1999, Cross Media entered into an employment agreement with
Ronald Altbach. Under Mr. Altbach's 1999 employment agreement, Cross Media paid
Mr. Altbach $112,500, in consideration of services rendered as Chief Operating
Officer through June 30, 1999, and $175,000 in consideration of services
rendered as Chief Operating Officer from July 1 through December 31, 1999.
During each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 1999 and December 31, 2000,
Cross Media also paid Mr. Altbach a $2,000 monthly car allowance. In April 2001,
Cross Media entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Altbach, effective
May 1, 2001. Under Mr. Altbach's 2001 employment agreement, Mr. Altbach will be
entitled to a minimum annual base salary of $425,000 plus non-discretionary
quarterly bonuses, ranging from a minimum of $25,000 to a maximum of $75,000,
based, for fiscal year 2001, upon Cross Media's earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, results for the last three fiscal quarters of the
fiscal year and, for subsequent fiscal years, upon Cross Media achieving
quarterly performance goals set by the board of directors. Mr. Altbach will also
be entitled to an annual bonus of $50,000 for 2001 if Cross Media's consolidated
revenues are at least $100 million and an annual bonus for 2002 and 2003, in

amounts determined by the board of directors, based upon performance goals
established by the board of directors. Mr. Altbach receives a maximum monthly
car allowance of $2,000, which amount will increase by five percent on each May
1 subsequent to the effective date of the new Altbach employment agreement. The
term of Mr. Altbach's 2001 employment agreement continues through December 31,
2003. However, Cross Media may terminate Mr. Altbach's employment at any time,
with or without cause, provided that any termination without cause requires
Cross Media to continue to pay Mr. Altbach his base salary, benefits and
guaranteed bonuses through the end of the term and results in acceleration of
vesting of all unvested options granted to him. If Mr. Altbach's employment is
terminated by Cross Media following a change in control of Cross Media, he is
entitled to his base salary and bonus pro-rated through the date of termination,
a $200,000 severance payment and immediate vesting of all unvested options. Mr.
Altbach is also entitled to a $425,000 severance payment if Cross Media fails to
extend the term of Mr. Altbach's employment beyond December 31, 2003.

     In May 2000, Cross Media entered into an employment agreement with Richard
Kaufman, which agreement was amended, effective May 1, 2001. Under Mr. Kaufman's
employment agreement, Mr. Kaufman is entitled to a minimum annual base salary of
$330,000 plus non-discretionary quarterly bonuses, ranging from a minimum of
$25,000 to a maximum of $75,000, based, for fiscal year 2001, upon Cross Media's
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization results for the
last three fiscal quarters of the fiscal year and, for subsequent fiscal years,
upon Cross Media achieving quarterly performance goals set by the board of
directors. Mr. Kaufman will also be entitled to an annual bonus of $50,000 for
