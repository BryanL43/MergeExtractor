(1) This Registration Statement covers shares to be issued by Cross Media
    Marketing Corporation in connection with a proposed merger transaction. It
    does not include additional shares that may be issued by reason of potential
    adjustment for recapitalization. Pursuant to Rule 416 of the Securities Act
    of 1933, as amended, this Registration Statement covers such additional
    shares, the number of which is indeterminable as of the date hereof. Because
    such additional shares, if issued, will be issued for no additional
    consideration, no additional registration fee is required.

(2) Pursuant to Rule 457(f)(1) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the
    proposed maximum offering price is based upon (i) the market value of the
    outstanding shares of common stock of LifeMinders, Inc. being acquired in
    the proposed merger determined by using the average of the high and low sale
    prices per share of the LifeMinders, Inc. common stock as reported on the
    Nasdaq National Market on August 20, 2001 and (ii) the exercise price of the
    options to purchase LifeMinders common stock that are exercisable at a price
    below the market price of LifeMinders common stock.

     THE REGISTRANT HEREBY AMENDS THIS REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON SUCH DATE OR
DATES AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO DELAY ITS EFFECTIVE DATE UNTIL THE REGISTRANT SHALL
FILE A FURTHER AMENDMENT WHICH SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT THIS REGISTRATION
STATEMENT SHALL THEREAFTER BECOME EFFECTIVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 8(a) OF
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR UNTIL THIS REGISTRATION STATEMENT
SHALL BECOME EFFECTIVE ON SUCH DATE AS THE COMMISSION, ACTING PURSUANT TO
SECTION 8(a), MAY DETERMINE.

                 MERGER PROPOSED -- YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

To the Stockholders of Cross Media and LifeMinders:

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus relates to the proposed merger of
Cross Media Marketing Corporation and LifeMinders, Inc. In order to complete the
merger, stockholders of both companies must adopt the merger agreement. We
believe that this merger will benefit the stockholders of both companies and we
ask for your support in adopting the merger agreement at our special meetings.

     When the merger is completed, shares of LifeMinders common stock held by
LifeMinders stockholders will be converted into the right to receive cash, Cross
Media common stock or a prescribed mix of cash and Cross Media common stock, as
described on page [  ] as each LifeMinders stockholder elects, subject to the
procedures and limitations described on page [  ]. If LifeMinders stockholders
collectively elect to receive more than the maximum cash consideration available
for LifeMinders stockholders in the merger, those LifeMinders stockholders
electing to receive all cash will instead receive a mix of cash and Cross Media
common stock. See page [  ] for more information. If a LifeMinders stockholder
does not make a timely effective election to receive cash, Cross Media common
stock or a prescribed mix of cash and Cross Media common stock, that stockholder
will be deemed to have elected to receive only Cross Media common stock.

      IF A LIFEMINDERS                THAT LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDER IS ASKING TO RECEIVE          THIS CHOICE IS
    STOCKHOLDER CHOOSES:       FOR EACH SHARE OF LIFEMINDERS COMMON STOCK HELD APPROXIMATELY*:     GENERALLY:
- -----------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------

Cash                           $2.57 in cash                                                         Taxable
Cross Media common stock       1.29 shares of Cross Media common stock                             Not taxable
Cash and Cross Media common    $0.86 in cash and .86 of a share of Cross Media common stock     Partially taxable
  stock

* The estimates set forth are based on certain assumptions. See page [     ] for
  more information.

     Any cash a LifeMinders stockholder receives in the merger will generally be
taxable to the extent that any gain is realized in the transaction. It is
anticipated, however, that a LifeMinders stockholder generally will not
recognize gain or loss as a result of the merger if the stockholder receives
only Cross Media common stock. For a more complete description of the tax
consequences associated with the merger, see "Material Federal Income Tax
Consequences" beginning on page [  ].

     Cross Media shares are listed on the American Stock Exchange under the
symbol "XMM."

     Information about the merger and the other items to be voted on at your
company's special meeting is contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
We urge you to read this material, including the section describing risk factors
relating to the merger that begins on page [  ].

     The boards of directors of both Cross Media and LifeMinders have approved
the amended and restated merger agreement and recommend that their respective
stockholders adopt the amended and restated merger agreement as described in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Additionally, the board of directors of
Cross Media approved the amendment and restatement of Cross Media's certificate
of incorporation and the amendment to Cross Media's 1998 Stock Option Plan and

Media's certificate of incorporation and the amendment to Cross Media's 1998
Stock Option Plan. To grant your proxy to vote your shares, please complete,

paid envelope. You may also cast your vote in person at the special meeting. If

against adoption of the amendment and restatement of Cross Media's certificate
of incorporation.

         QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CROSS MEDIA/LIFEMINDERS MERGER

Q. WHY ARE WE PROPOSING THE MERGER?

A. We believe that combining the products, technologies, assets and expertise of
   the two companies will allow us to become a leading multi-channel,
   multi-product direct marketing company. The merger will combine LifeMinders'
   proprietary technology, expertise in online direct marketing, large
   membership base and substantial assets with Cross Media's established direct
   marketing operations.

Q. WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A. Sign your proxy card, mark your vote on it, and mail it to us in the enclosed
   postage-paid envelope.

   LifeMinders stockholders should also complete the election form and deliver
   it to [          ], the exchange agent, in the enclosed envelope prior to the
   close of business on the date of the LifeMinders special meeting. A
   LifeMinders stockholder who does not do so will lose the right to choose the
   consideration he or she will receive as a result of the merger and will be
   deemed to have elected to receive only Cross Media common stock. Once you
   sign and return your election form, you will no longer be able to trade or
   sell your shares of LifeMinders common stock. Please see page [ ] for more
   information.

Q. IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
   SHARES FOR ME?

A. Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to
   vote by completing and returning the proxy card provided to you by your
   broker.

   For a complete description of voting shares held in "street name," see the
   section titled "Special Meetings of Stockholders" on pages [  ] and [  ].

Q. SHOULD LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS SEND IN THEIR STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A. Yes. LifeMinders stockholders should send their stock certificates along with
   their election forms to the exchange agent in the enclosed envelope. NO STOCK
   CERTIFICATES OR ELECTION FORMS SHOULD BE SENT TO EITHER CROSS MEDIA OR
   LIFEMINDERS. If your LifeMinders common stock is held by your broker, you may
   either request your share certificate from your broker and follow the
   instructions above, or return to your broker the election form with the proxy
   card sent to you by your broker, who will then deliver your share certificate
   (or a properly completed guarantee of delivery) and election form to the
   exchange agent.

Q. HOW DO I MAKE MY MERGER CONSIDERATION ELECTION IF MY LIFEMINDERS SHARES ARE
   HELD IN "STREET NAME"?

A. You should either request your share certificate from your broker and follow
   the instructions above, or complete your election form and return it to your
   broker, along with the proxy card sent to you by your broker, who will then
   submit the election form to the exchange agent.

Q. WHAT IF A LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDER WANTS TO CHANGE HIS OR HER ELECTION?

A. A LifeMinders stockholder may change his or her election by delivering to the
   exchange agent prior to the close of business on the date of the LifeMinders
   special meeting a later-dated, signed election form.

Q. WHAT IF A LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDER HAS LOST HIS OR HER STOCK CERTIFICATES?

A. The LifeMinders stockholder will need to indicate in the space provided in
   his or her election form that he or she has lost his or her stock
   certificates. In addition, the LifeMinders stockholder will have to sign an
   affidavit, which is included as part of the election form, that provides,
   among other things, that the LifeMinders stockholder agrees to indemnify
   Cross Media and the exchange agent for any loss Cross Media or the exchange
   agent may incur as a result of the LifeMinders stockholder's lost or
   destroyed stock certificate.

Q. DO LIFEMINDERS' OPTIONHOLDERS WHO INTEND TO EXERCISE THEIR OPTIONS AT OR
   PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ELECT THE FORM OF MERGER
   CONSIDERATION THEY RECEIVE?

A. LifeMinders' optionholders may complete and return an election form to the
   exchange agent at the time they exercise their options, up to the close of
   business on the date of the LifeMinders special meeting. Holders of op-

   tions who exercise their options after the close of business on the date of
   the LifeMinders special meeting will be deemed to elect to receive only
   shares of Cross Media common stock. For a complete description of the
   treatment of LifeMinders options, see page [  ].

Q. WHAT IF I WANT TO CHANGE MY VOTE?

A. Just send in a later-dated, signed proxy card before your special meeting or
   attend your special meeting in person and vote.

Q. WILL I HAVE APPRAISAL RIGHTS?

A. Neither Cross Media stockholders nor LifeMinders stockholders will have
   appraisal rights.

Q. WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A. We expect to complete the merger during the fourth quarter of 2001.

Q. WHAT WILL CROSS MEDIA STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A. Cross Media stockholders will keep their current stock holdings in Cross
   Media.

Q. WHAT WILL CROSS MEDIA PAY AS MERGER CONSIDERATION?

A. Under the terms of the amended and restated merger agreement, Cross Media
   will pay a total of $24 million in cash and issue approximately 22.3 million
   shares of its common stock, assuming that no LifeMinders' stock options are
   exercised prior to the date on which the merger is completed and that
   LifeMinders stockholders elect to receive the maximum cash consideration. If
   LifeMinders stockholders do not elect to receive the maximum cash
   consideration, then the number of shares of common stock that Cross Media
   will issue in the merger will increase by that number of shares equal to $24
   million less the amount of the total cash consideration paid in the merger,
   divided by $1.9845. The $1.9845 value of the Cross Media common stock used
   for this purpose is based on the average last sale price of Cross Media
   common stock for the 20 trading days immediately preceding July 18, 2001, the
   date of the original merger agreement, and is not necessarily indicative of
   the value of such stock. The value of the aggregate merger consideration will
   depend upon the market price of Cross Media common stock on the date the
   merger is completed.

  The aggregate merger consideration is subject to a reduction of up to $1.75
  million to the extent that LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents are less
  than $49 million at August 31, 2001 (referred to as a cash shortfall), but no
  reduction will be made if LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents on that
  date are at least $48.9 million. In the event of a reduction in the aggregate
  merger consideration resulting from a cash shortfall, the cash portion of the
  merger consideration will be reduced by an amount equal to approximately 33.3%
  of the reduction, and the stock portion of the merger consideration will be
  reduced by approximately that number of shares of Cross Media common stock
  equal to 66.7% of the reduction divided by $1.9845. For a definition of net
  cash and cash equivalents, see page [ ].

  The aggregate merger consideration will increase by an amount equal to the
  aggregate exercise price of any LifeMinders options with an exercise price of
  $2.57 per share or less that are exercised before the merger is completed. The
  per share consideration payable to LifeMinders stockholders is not affected by
  any such increase in the aggregate merger consideration.

Q. WHAT WILL LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A. In connection with the merger, each LifeMinders stockholder will be able to
   elect to receive all cash, all Cross Media common stock, or a prescribed mix
   of approximately 33.3% cash and 66.7% stock. Assuming there is no change in
   the aggregate merger consideration, LifeMinders stockholders can elect to
   receive for each share of LifeMinders common stock held approximately $2.57
   in cash, approximately 1.29 shares of Cross Media common stock or
   approximately $0.86 in cash and approximately .86 shares of Cross Media
   common stock.

  In no event will the aggregate cash consideration paid to the LifeMinders
  stockholders collectively exceed $24 million, plus approximately 33.3% of the
  aggregate exercise price of

  any options to purchase LifeMinders common stock with an exercise price equal
  to or below $2.57 per share that are exercised on a cash basis between July
  18, 2001 and the closing of the merger, and reduced by approximately 33.3% of
  a reduction in the aggregate merger consideration resulting from a cash
  shortfall, if any.

  In the event that the cash elections, including the cash portion to be
  received by LifeMinders stockholders who elect the prescribed mix of cash and
  stock, exceed the maximum cash consideration, the amount of cash paid to those
  LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive all cash will be reduced and they
  will receive shares of Cross Media common stock, valued for this purpose at
  $1.9845 per share, for the balance. We cannot predict the actual mix of cash
  and Cross Media common stock that will be received by LifeMinders stockholders
  electing to receive all cash, but the per share cash portion cannot be less
  than approximately $0.86, and the per share stock portion cannot exceed
  approximately .86 shares of Cross Media common stock. Any LifeMinders
  stockholder who does not make an effective election before the election
  deadline will be deemed to have elected to receive all Cross Media common
  stock.

   No fractional shares of Cross Media common stock will be issued. Any
   LifeMinders stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction
   of a share of LifeMinders common stock will instead receive cash for that
   fraction of a share.

   Upon completion of the merger, Cross Media will assume all of LifeMinders
   stock options outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the merger.
   Please refer to page [ ] for more information regarding the treatment of
   LifeMinders stock options.

Q. WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THE CONSIDERATION THAT LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS WILL
   RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A. The per share cash consideration to be paid to LifeMinders stockholders is
   $2.57. For LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive either all Cross
   Media common stock or the prescribed mix of cash and Cross Media common
   stock, the per share consideration will depend on the market price of Cross
   Media common stock on the date on which the merger is completed. In the event
   that the cash elections, including the cash portion to be received by
   LifeMinders stockholders who elect the prescribed mix of cash and stock,
   exceed the maximum cash consideration, the amount of cash to be received by
   stockholders electing to receive all cash will be reduced and they will
   receive shares of Cross Media common stock, valued for this purpose at
   $1.9845 per share, for the balance. In that case, the value of the per share
   consideration to be paid to such stockholders also will depend on the market
   price of Cross Media common stock on the date on which the merger is
   completed.

Q. CAN THE MERGER CONSIDERATION CHANGE?

A. Yes. The aggregate merger consideration is subject to a reduction of up to
   $1.75 million to the extent that LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents
   are less than $49 million at August 31, 2001, but no reduction will be made
   if LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents on that date are at least $48.9
   million. If the aggregate merger consideration is reduced as a result of a
   cash shortfall, the per share consideration payable to LifeMinders
   stockholders also will be reduced. The aggregate merger consideration will
   increase by an amount equal to the aggregate exercise price of any
   LifeMinders options with an exercise price of $2.57 per share or less that
   are exercised before the merger is completed. The per share consideration
   payable to LifeMinders stockholders will not be affected by any such
   increase. Please refer to pages [  ] and [  ] for more information on this
   issue.

Q. WHEN WILL LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE CASH AND/OR SHARES OF CROSS MEDIA
   COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER?

A. If the merger agreement is adopted by both the Cross Media and LifeMinders
   stockholders, then the LifeMinders stock will be converted into the right to
   receive the merger consideration on the date the merger is completed.
   LifeMinders stockholders who have returned their election forms, together
   with LifeMinders stock certificates, a properly completed guarantee of
   delivery or proof of lost certificate and the necessary affidavit, before the
   election deadline, will be sent the Cross

   Media common stock and/or cash to which they are entitled within 15 business
   days after the merger is completed. Within 15 business days after the merger
   is completed, LifeMinders stockholders who did not timely send in their stock
   certificates and effective election forms will be sent a letter of
   transmittal and instructions for exchanging their stock certificates. Those
   LifeMinders stockholders will be sent their Cross Media stock certificates
   within 10 business days after the exchange agent receives their letter of
   transmittal and supporting documents.

Q. WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO ME?

A. It is anticipated that the merger will qualify as a "reorganization" for
   federal income tax purposes. If it so qualifies, the tax consequences of the
   merger will depend on the merger consideration received by a LifeMinders
   stockholder:

     - LifeMinders stockholders who receive only cash will generally recognize
       gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as though they had sold
       their shares for that cash;

     - LifeMinders stockholders who receive only Cross Media common stock in
       exchange for their LifeMinders common stock will not recognize any gain
       or loss for federal income tax purposes; and

     - LifeMinders stockholders who receive a mix of cash and Cross Media common
       stock will recognize gain (up to the amount of cash received) for federal
       income tax purposes and will not recognize loss for income tax purposes.

   See "The Merger -- Material Federal Income Tax Consequences" on page [ ] for
   a more complete description of the tax consequences of the merger. Cross
   Media expects to receive a legal opinion from Cross Media's counsel with
   respect to these matters. The form of this legal opinion is filed as an
   exhibit to Cross Media's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this
   joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part. Also, LifeMinders expects to
   receive a legal opinion from LifeMinders' counsel with respect to these
   matters. The form of this legal opinion is filed as an exhibit to Cross
   Media's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy
   statement/prospectus is a part.

   TAX MATTERS ARE VERY COMPLICATED AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO
   YOU WILL DEPEND ON THE FACTS OF YOUR OWN SITUATION. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR
   TAX ADVISORS FOR A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER
   TO YOU.

Q. IF I RECEIVE CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER, WILL I RECEIVE DIVIDENDS
   IN THE FUTURE?

A. You will be entitled to receive dividends, if, when and to the extent
   declared by Cross Media's board of directors. To date, Cross Media has never
   paid or declared any dividends on its common stock and does not contemplate
   paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. The declaration, payment and
   amount of dividends in the future is within the discretion of Cross Media's
   board of directors and will depend upon Cross Media's earnings, capital
   requirements, restrictions under financing documents, financial condition and
   other relevant factors.

Q. WHOM SHOULD I CALL WITH QUESTIONS?

A. Stockholders of Cross Media should call Jason Buerkle, Director of Financial
   Operations of Cross Media Marketing Corporation, at (212) 457-1200 with any
   questions about the merger. Stockholders of LifeMinders should call Allison
   Abraham, President of LifeMinders, Inc., at (703) 885-1315 with any questions
   about the merger.

                                    SUMMARY

     This summary highlights material information from this document. To
understand the merger more fully, and for more complete descriptions of the
terms of the merger, you should read carefully this entire document, including
the amended and restated merger agreement attached as Annex A, and the documents
to which we have referred you. See "Where You Can Find More Information" on page
[  ].

                                   THE MERGER

     The amended and restated merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read the amended and
restated merger agreement because it is the legal document that governs the
merger.

CROSS MEDIA WILL PAY A TOTAL OF $24 MILLION IN CASH AND ISSUE APPROXIMATELY 22.3
MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER, SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT (see
page [  ])

     Under the terms of the amended and restated merger agreement, Cross Media
will pay a total of $24 million in cash and issue approximately 22.3 million
shares of its common stock, assuming that no LifeMinders' stock options are
exercised prior to the date on which the merger is completed and that
LifeMinders stockholders elect to receive the maximum cash consideration. If
LifeMinders stockholders do not elect to receive the maximum cash consideration,
then the number of shares of common stock that Cross Media will issue in the
merger will increase by that number of shares equal to $24 million less the
amount of the total cash consideration paid in the merger, divided by $1.9845.
The $1.9845 value of the Cross Media common stock used for this purpose is based
on the average last sale price of Cross Media common stock for the 20 trading
days immediately preceding July 18, 2001, the date of the original merger
agreement, and is not necessarily indicative of the value of such stock. The
value of the aggregate merger consideration will depend upon the market price of
Cross Media common stock on the date the merger is completed.

     The aggregate merger consideration is subject to a reduction of up to $1.75
million to the extent that LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents are less
than $49 million at August 31, 2001, but no reduction will be made if
LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents on that date are at least $48.9
million. In the event of a reduction in the aggregate merger consideration
resulting from a cash shortfall, the cash portion of the merger consideration
will be reduced by an amount equal to approximately 33.3% of the reduction, and
the stock portion of the merger consideration will be reduced by approximately
that number of shares equal to 66.7% of the reduction divided by $1.9845. For a
definition of net cash and cash equivalents, see page [  ].

     The aggregate merger consideration will increase by an amount equal to the
aggregate exercise price of any LifeMinders options with an exercise price of
$2.57 per share or less that are exercised before the merger is completed. The
per share consideration payable to LifeMinders stockholders is not affected by
any such increase in the aggregate merger consideration.

IN THE MERGER, LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS CAN ELECT TO RECEIVE CASH, SHARES OF
CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK OR A PRESCRIBED MIX OF CASH AND SHARES OF CROSS MEDIA
COMMON STOCK (see page [  ])

     In connection with the merger, each LifeMinders stockholder can elect to
receive all cash, all stock or a prescribed mix of approximately 33.3% cash and
66.7% stock, provided that in no event will the aggregate cash consideration
paid to LifeMinders stockholders exceed $24 million, plus approximately 33.3% of
the aggregate exercise price of any options to purchase LifeMinders common stock
with an exercise price equal to or below $2.57 per share that are exercised on a
cash basis between July 18, 2001 and the closing date of the merger, and reduced
by approximately 33.3% of a reduction in the aggregate merger consideration
resulting from a cash shortfall, if any. Assuming there is no change in the
aggregate merger consideration, each share of LifeMinders common stock will be
converted into approximately:

     - $2.57 in cash, for those LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive all
       cash, but if

elections made by LifeMinders stockholders would require Cross Media to pay more
than the aggregate maximum cash portion of the merger consideration, the amount
of cash will be reduced, with the difference being paid in shares of Cross Media
       common stock, valued for this purpose at $1.9845 per share;

     - 1.29 shares of Cross Media common stock for those LifeMinders
       stockholders electing to receive all stock; or

     - $0.86 in cash and .86 shares of Cross Media common stock, for those
       LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive the prescribed mix.

     We cannot predict the actual mix of cash and Cross Media common stock that
will be received by LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive all cash, but
the per share cash portion cannot be less than approximately $0.86, and the per
share stock portion cannot exceed approximately .86 shares of Cross Media common
stock. Any LifeMinders stockholder who does not make an effective election prior
to the election deadline, and any LifeMinders stockholder who acquires shares of
LifeMinders common stock after the election deadline, will receive all Cross
Media common stock.

     Assuming that there is no cash shortfall and that no LifeMinders stock
options are exercised prior to the date on which the merger is completed, and
using the per share price of $[       ], the closing price of Cross Media common
stock as of [       ], 2001, the last practicable date prior to the printing of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus:

     - the value of the per share merger consideration that a LifeMinders
       stockholder who elects to receive only Cross Media common stock would
       receive would be $[       ];

     - the value of the per share merger consideration that a LifeMinders
       stockholder electing to receive the prescribed mix would be $[     ]; and

     - LifeMinders stockholders who receive all cash in the merger would be paid
       $2.57 per share of LifeMinders common stock.

     LifeMinders stockholders are urged to obtain a current market quotation for
Cross Media common stock prior to electing the form of merger consideration they
will receive in the merger.

     No fractional shares of Cross Media common stock will be issued. Any
LifeMinders stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of Cross Media common stock will instead receive cash for that fraction
of a share.

CROSS MEDIA WILL ASSUME ALL OF THE LIFEMINDERS' STOCK OPTIONS OUTSTANDING
IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER (see page [  ])

     Upon completion of the merger, Cross Media will assume all of the
LifeMinders stock options outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the
merger. After completion of the merger, each LifeMinders stock option will
thereafter be exercisable for approximately 1.29 shares of Cross Media common
stock multiplied by the number of shares of LifeMinders common stock that would
have been issued upon exercise of the LifeMinders stock option immediately prior
to completion of the merger, with an exercise price equal to the exercise price
per share of LifeMinders common stock immediately prior to completion of the
merger divided by 1.29, the per share stock consideration.

     As of [     ], 2001, the latest practicable date preceding the mailing of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, there were outstanding options to
purchase approximately 2.2 million shares of LifeMinders common stock with an
exercise price equal to or below $2.57 per share, and options to purchase
approximately [     ] shares of LifeMinders common stock with an exercise price
above $2.57 per share.

LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS' OWNERSHIP OF CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK IMMEDIATELY
AFTER THE MERGER (see page [  ])

     Assuming there is no change in the merger consideration, LifeMinders
stockholders elect to receive the maximum cash consideration of $24

million and no options to purchase LifeMinders common stock are exercised before
the date on which the merger is completed, Cross Media will issue approximately
22.3 million shares of Cross Media common stock to LifeMinders stockholders.
Assuming that none of the options to purchase approximately 2.2 million shares
of LifeMinders common stock with an exercise price equal to or below $2.57 per
share are exercised before the date on which the merger is completed, Cross
Media will issue options to purchase approximately 2.9 million shares of Cross
Media common stock in exchange for such outstanding options to purchase
LifeMinders common stock. Assuming that the issuance of approximately 1.7
million shares of Cross Media common stock to The Shaar Fund, Ltd. upon the
conversion of half of its shares of Cross Media's Series A convertible preferred
stock in accordance with the Series A agreement described on page [  ], the
issuance of approximately 22.3 million shares of Cross Media common stock
anticipated to be issued in the merger and none of the outstanding Cross Media
options, warrants, or other equity rights are exercised or converted, the shares
of Cross Media common stock issued to LifeMinders stockholders in the merger
will constitute approximately 36.8% of the common stock of Cross Media
outstanding after the merger. If all of the approximately 2.9 million options to
purchase Cross Media common stock which may be issued in the merger, as
described above, are exercised, based on the assumptions set forth in the
previous sentence, after the merger, LifeMinders stockholders will own
approximately 39.7% of the common stock of Cross Media.

OPINIONS RECEIVED BY CROSS MEDIA AND LIFEMINDERS BOARDS OF DIRECTORS REGARDING
THE FAIRNESS OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION (see pages [  ] to [  ])

     CROSS MEDIA

     Cross Media's board of directors received an opinion from its financial
advisor, Robertson Stephens, Inc., that the consideration to be paid in the
merger was fair, as of the date thereof, from a financial point of view, to
Cross Media. This opinion is attached as Annex C to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read this opinion.

     LIFEMINDERS

     LifeMinders' board of directors received an opinion from its financial
advisor, Legg Mason Wood Walker, Incorporated, that the merger consideration was
fair, as of the date of the opinion, from a financial point of view, to the
stockholders of LifeMinders. This opinion is attached as Annex D to this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read this opinion.

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER (see page [  ])

     The completion of the merger depends upon the satisfaction or waiver of a
number of conditions.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (see page [  ])

     Cross Media and LifeMinders can agree to terminate the merger agreement
without completing the merger, and either company can terminate the merger
agreement under various circumstances.

     For example, each of Cross Media and LifeMinders has the right to terminate
the merger agreement if:

     - LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2001 have not
       been finally determined in accordance with the merger agreement by
       November 30, 2001; or

     - the merger has not been completed by December 31, 2001, or a later date
       agreed upon by the parties, as a result of a failure to satisfy any
       condition to closing by that date that the other party does not choose to
       waive.

     Cross Media has the right to terminate the merger agreement if:

     - LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2001 are less
       than $47.25 million;

     - the board of directors of LifeMinders fails to include in this joint
       proxy statement/prospectus its recommendation to LifeMinders stockholders
       that they adopt the merger agreement or withdraws, ad-

       versely modifies or fails to reaffirm its recommendation;

     - the board of directors of LifeMinders approves or recommends any
       Alternative Transaction, as described on page [  ]; or

     - the board of directors of LifeMinders fails, within 10 business days of
       the commencement of a tender or exchange offer, to recommend to the
       LifeMinders stockholders that they reject the tender or exchange offer.

     LifeMinders has the right to terminate the merger agreement if:

     - the volume weighted average closing price for Cross Media common stock
       over any 10 consecutive trading days prior to the closing date is less
       than $1.0915 per share; or

     - the board of directors of LifeMinders determines in good faith, after
       receipt of advice from outside counsel, that the failure to terminate the
       merger agreement upon receipt of a Superior Proposal would likely be
       inconsistent with LifeMinders' board of directors' fiduciary duties to
       LifeMinders stockholders under applicable law. For a definition of
       "Superior Proposal," see page [  ].

     Either Cross Media and/or LifeMinders may decide not to exercise its right
to terminate the merger agreement even if its right to terminate is triggered.
Neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders is required to resolicit stockholder
approval of the merger agreement if either Cross Media's or LifeMinders' right
to terminate is exercisable and Cross Media's or LifeMinders' board of directors
decides not to terminate and proceeds with the merger.

TERMINATION FEES AND EXPENSES (see page [  ])

     The merger agreement requires LifeMinders to pay Cross Media a termination
fee of $2.8 million if:

     - LifeMinders terminates the proposed merger because its board of directors
       determines in good faith, after receipt of advice from outside counsel,
       that the failure to terminate the merger agreement upon receipt of a
       Superior Proposal would likely be inconsistent with LifeMinders' board of
       directors' fiduciary duties to LifeMinders stockholders under applicable
       law;

     - Cross Media terminates the proposed merger because the board of directors
       of LifeMinders fails to include in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
       its recommendation to LifeMinders stockholders that they adopt the merger
       agreement or withdraws, adversely modifies, or fails to reaffirm its
       recommendation;

     - Cross Media terminates the proposed merger because the board of directors
       of LifeMinders approves or recommends any Alternative Transaction, as
       described on page [ ];

     - Cross Media terminates the proposed merger because the board of directors
       of LifeMinders fails, within 10 business days of the commencement of a
       tender or exchange offer, to recommend to LifeMinders stockholders that
       they reject the tender or exchange offer; or

     - LifeMinders receives an offer to enter into an Alternative Transaction
       with a third party, the merger agreement is terminated because of the
       failure to obtain LifeMinders stockholder approval and within 12 months
       after the termination of the merger agreement LifeMinders consummates an
       Alternative Transaction with a third party.

     In the event that there is a dispute as to whether the termination fee is
payable under the terms of the merger agreement, the prevailing party is
entitled to receive costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees, in
connection with any action relating to the dispute.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT OF CROSS MEDIA FOLLOWING THE MERGER (see page
[  ])

     After the merger, Cross Media will continue to be managed by its current
directors and officers. In addition, to fill two vacancies on Cross Media's
board of directors, Jonathan Bulkeley, who is currently the Chairman of the
Board of

Directors and Chief Executive Officer of LifeMinders, and Douglas A. Lindgren, a
director of LifeMinders, will become directors of Cross Media. Further, Mr.
Bulkeley will serve on the executive committee and the compensation committee of
Cross Media's board of directors and Mr. Lindgren will serve on the audit
committee of Cross Media's board of directors.

LIFEMINDERS' DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES WILL RECEIVE ACCELERATED VESTING
OF OPTIONS UNDER LIFEMINDERS STOCK OPTION PLAN AND RECEIVE OTHER BENEFITS FROM
THE MERGER (see pages [  ] and [  ])

     In considering the board of directors' recommendations that you vote in
favor of the merger agreement, you should be aware that directors, officers and
other employees of LifeMinders will receive benefits from the merger in addition
to any benefits they may receive as stockholders of LifeMinders. These benefits
include the accelerated vesting of awards under LifeMinders stock option plans
and indemnification and insurance benefits. Using a Black-Scholes option pricing
model, and based on certain assumptions on volatility, rate of return and
average time of exercise which LifeMinders considers reasonable, LifeMinders
estimates that the value of the options for which vesting will accelerate as a
result of the merger is approximately $2.3 million. The holders of LifeMinders
options for which vesting will accelerate will receive only Cross Media common
stock upon exercise of those options.

     Jonathan Bulkeley and Douglas A. Lindgren will also have positions on the
board of directors of Cross Media after the merger, and will be entitled to
receive directors' fees in those positions.

     Cross Media has extended employment offers to 20 of LifeMinders' 29
employees, including one of LifeMinders executive officers.

                             REASONS FOR THE MERGER

CROSS MEDIA

     The Cross Media board of directors recommends the merger because the board
believes, among other reasons, that LifeMinders will:

     - complement Cross Media's proven marketing skills in both traditional and
       online direct marketing channels because of LifeMinders' extensive
       database and personalization capabilities;

     - provide Cross Media with access to LifeMinders' 20 million member
       database that will enable Cross Media to reduce customer acquisition
       costs and increase margins by targeting offers to LifeMinders' highly
       profiled members;

     - significantly strengthen the financial position of Cross Media with
       LifeMinders' strong balance sheet; and

     - provide funding to continue Cross Media's strategy of combining internal
       growth with growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses.

     In addition, the Cross Media board of directors believes that the cost of
the merger in financial terms represents a reasonable investment by Cross Media
in furthering its business strategy.

     To review Cross Media's reasons for the merger in greater detail, see page
[  ].

LIFEMINDERS

     The LifeMinders board of directors recommends the merger because the board
of directors believes that the merger provides benefits to its stockholders,
including:

     - the creation of a stronger company that combines LifeMinders' proprietary
       technology, online direct marketing expertise, large membership base and
       substantial assets with Cross Media's established direct marketing
       operations;

     - the ability to retain ownership in a combined company that expects to
       continue LifeMinders' primary objective of becoming a leading online
       direct marketing company; and

     - the ability to receive a favorable return on their investment in
       LifeMinders common stock while also allowing those stockholders who want
       to continue their ownership interest or delay the taxation of gain on
       their stock to do so through electing to receive Cross Media common stock
       instead of cash.

     The pro forma equivalent per share price of each share of LifeMinders
common stock is the value of the Cross Media common stock that would be received
for each share of LifeMinders common stock if the merger had been completed and
shares of LifeMinders common stock had been exchanged for Cross Media common
stock on the dates indicated. The pro forma equivalent per share price is
calculated by multiplying the closing sale price per share of Cross Media common
stock reflected in the table by 1.29, the per share stock exchange ratio in the
merger.

     CROSS MEDIA AND LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO OBTAIN A CURRENT
MARKET QUOTATION FOR CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK BEFORE VOTING SHARES OR, IN THE
CASE OF LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS, MAKING AN ELECTION. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN
AS TO THE FUTURE PRICES OF, OR MARKETS FOR, CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK.

     The 1.29 stock exchange ratio fixed by the merger agreement will not change
even if the market prices of Cross Media and LifeMinders common stock change,
but can adjust for other reasons. For this reason, the market price of the
shares of Cross Media common stock that holders of LifeMinders common stock will
receive in the merger may vary significantly from the market price of the shares
of Cross Media common stock that holders of LifeMinders common stock would
receive if the merger were consummated on the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. See page [  ] for a discussion of the factors that can
cause the aggregate merger consideration to adjust.

(1) LifeMinders acquired four businesses in 2000. The acquisitions were
    accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, which resulted in the
    recording of approximately $51.2 million of goodwill and approximately $15.1
    million of other intangible assets. In addition to the amortization of
    goodwill, cost of revenue and depreciation and amortization expense include
    approximately $0.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively, of amortization
    expense related to other intangible assets. Revenue generated from the
    acquired businesses during 2000 was approximately $1.5 million.

(2) In December 2000, LifeMinders recorded an impairment charge of approximately
    $54.0 million, of which approximately $6.0 million is recorded in cost of
    revenue, in connection with its decision not to pursue the development and
    expansion of its wireless segment and write-down of other long-lived
    impaired assets. Prior to June 30, 2001, LifeMinders began negotiations to
    merge with Cross Media, and on July 18, 2001, LifeMinders and Cross Media
    entered into a merger agreement which was amended and restated on August 20,
    2001. Based on the value of the proposed merger transaction, LifeMinders
    determined that the carrying value of its long-lived assets as of June 30,
    2001, exceeded their fair value. LifeMinders calculated and recorded an
    impairment charge of approximately $18.0 million during the six-month period
    ended June 30, 2001, of which approximately $2.5 million is recorded in cost
    of revenue.

(3) During the six months ended June 30, 2001, LifeMinders undertook a
    restructuring plan to reduce costs and focus its efforts on reducing
    operating losses, while evaluating strategic alternatives. In connection
    with that plan, restructuring charges totaling approximately $14.2 million
    were recorded during the period.

                               DIVIDEND POLICIES

     Cross Media has never paid or declared any dividends on its common stock
and does not contemplate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Cross
Media currently intends to reinvest earnings, if any, in the development and
expansion of its business. The declaration, payment and amount of dividends in
the future is within the discretion of Cross Media's board of directors and will
depend upon Cross Media's earnings, capital requirements, financial condition
restrictions under financing documents and other relevant factors. Cross Media
is restricted from paying dividends on the common stock unless all accrued and
unpaid cumulative dividends on the outstanding Series A convertible preferred
stock have been paid or set apart for payment. As described on page [  ], Cross
Media has entered into an agreement under which, simultaneously with the
completion of the merger, all of the Series A convertible preferred stock will
be converted into Cross Media common stock and/or redeemed, thereby eliminating
this dividend payment restriction upon completion of the merger.

     LifeMinders has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common
stock or other securities. The declaration, payment and amount of dividends is
within the discretion of LifeMinders' board of directors. If the merger does not
occur, the current board of directors does not anticipate paying cash dividends
in the future, except pursuant to a plan of liquidation if the LifeMinders'
board of directors were to make a determination to liquidate LifeMinders.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     IN CONSIDERING WHETHER TO APPROVE THE MERGER AND, FOR LIFEMINDERS
STOCKHOLDERS, WHETHER TO ELECT TO CONVERT YOUR SHARES OF LIFEMINDERS COMMON
STOCK INTO CASH, CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK OR THE PRESCRIBED MIX OF CASH AND
CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK, YOU SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE RISKS WE HAVE
DESCRIBED BELOW.

RISKS RELATING TO THE MERGER

THE VALUE OF THE AGGREGATE MERGER CONSIDERATION WILL DEPEND ON THE MARKET PRICE
OF THE CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE ON WHICH THE MERGER IS COMPLETED.

     Under the terms of the amended and restated merger agreement, Cross Media
will pay a total of $24 million in cash and issue approximately 22.3 million
shares of its common stock, assuming that there is no cash shortfall, that no
LifeMinders' stock options are exercised prior to the date on which the merger
is completed and that LifeMinders stockholders elect to receive the maximum cash
consideration. The value of the aggregate merger consideration will depend upon
the market price of Cross Media common stock on the date on which the merger is
completed. Therefore, LifeMinders stockholders will not know the value of the
aggregate merger consideration at the time they vote on the merger or elect the
form of merger consideration they will receive.

     The market price of Cross Media common stock fluctuates and has declined
substantially since July 18, 2001, the date on which the original merger
agreement was signed. The market price of Cross Media common stock on the date
the merger is completed could be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the
market price of Cross Media common stock on July 18, 2001, which would result in
a lower aggregate merger consideration payable to LifeMinders securityholders.

THE VALUE OF THE PER SHARE CONSIDERATION TO BE PAID TO LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS
WHO RECEIVE CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER CANNOT CURRENTLY BE
DETERMINED AND WILL VARY DEPENDING ON THE ELECTION THAT A LIFEMINDERS
STOCKHOLDER MAKES.

     Since the value of the Cross Media common stock being issued in the merger
will depend on the market price of Cross Media common stock on the date on which
the merger is completed, the value of the per share consideration to be received
by LifeMinders stockholders who receive all or a portion of the merger
consideration in shares of Cross Media common stock cannot currently be
determined. The per share cash consideration is based on a fixed exchange ratio
and will not vary if the market price of the Cross Media common stock changes.
Therefore, the value of the per share merger consideration that LifeMinders
stockholders receive in the merger will likely vary among LifeMinders
stockholders depending on which form of merger consideration that a LifeMinders
stockholder elects to receive.

THE VALUE OF THE PER SHARE STOCK CONSIDERATION MAY BE LESS THAN THE VALUE OF THE
PER SHARE CONSIDERATION PAID TO LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS WHO ELECT TO RECEIVE
ALL OR A PORTION OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION IN CASH.

     The value of the per share merger consideration was determined based on a
market price of Cross Media common stock of $1.9845 per share, which was the
average last sale price of Cross Media common stock for the 20 trading days
immediately preceding the date of the original merger agreement. Therefore, the
value of the per share merger consideration received by stockholders electing to
receive all or a portion of the merger consideration in shares of Cross Media
common stock will be less, and could be significantly less, than the per share
merger consideration received by LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive
all cash, if the market price per share of Cross Media common stock is less than
$1.9845 on the date the merger is completed.

     Using a per share price of $[  ], the closing price of Cross Media common
stock as of [            ], 2001, the last practicable date prior to the
printing of this joint proxy statement/

prospectus, the value of the per share merger consideration that a LifeMinders
stockholder who elects to receive only Cross Media common stock would receive
would be $[       ]. Using the same per share price, the value of the per share
merger consideration that a LifeMinders stockholder electing to receive the
prescribed mix would be $[          ]. LifeMinders stockholders who receive all
cash in the merger would be paid $2.57 per share of LifeMinders common stock.
LifeMinders stockholders are urged to obtain a current market quotation for
Cross Media common stock prior to electing the form of merger consideration they
will receive in the merger.

THE AGGREGATE MERGER CONSIDERATION WILL BE REDUCED IF LIFEMINDERS' NET CASH AND
NET CASH EQUIVALENTS AT AUGUST 31, 2001 ARE LESS THAN $48.9 MILLION.

     If LifeMinders has net cash and cash equivalents, as defined on page [  ],
of less than $48.9 million on August 31, 2001, the aggregate merger
consideration to be paid to LifeMinders securityholders will be reduced by the
amount that net cash and cash equivalents are below $49 million on that date, up
to $1.75 million. In the event of a reduction in the aggregate merger
consideration resulting from a cash shortfall, the cash portion of the merger
consideration will be reduced by an amount equal to approximately 33.3% of the
reduction, and the stock portion of the merger consideration will be reduced by
approximately that number of shares equal to 66.7% of the reduction divided by
$1.9845. The determination of LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents as of
August 31, 2001 will only be an estimate and LifeMinders' actual net cash and
cash equivalents may be less.

     Cross Media has the option to terminate the merger agreement if
LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents are less than $47.25 million at
August 31, 2001. If Cross Media elects not to exercise its option to terminate
and proceeds with the merger, the reduction of the merger consideration to be
paid by Cross Media will be less than the net cash and cash equivalents
shortfall.

     For further discussion about the possible adjustments to the merger
consideration, see page [  ].

LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS WHO ELECT TO RECEIVE ALL CASH IN THE MERGER ARE LIKELY
TO RECEIVE A PORTION OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION IN CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK.

     Cross Media will not pay more than $24 million of the merger consideration
in cash, plus a portion of the proceeds from the exercise of certain options to
purchase LifeMinders common stock, less any reduction resulting from a cash
shortfall. If elections made by LifeMinders stockholders would require Cross
Media to pay more than the aggregate cash portion of the merger consideration,
the amount of cash received by those LifeMinders stockholders making all cash
elections will be reduced, with the difference being paid out in the form of
Cross Media common stock, valued at $1.9845 for this purpose. Accordingly, the
higher the percentage of LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive all cash
or the prescribed mix of cash and Cross Media common stock, the greater the
reduction of the cash portion of the merger consideration that will be paid to
those LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive all cash. At the time
LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive all cash vote on the merger and
make elections, such stockholders will not know the portion of the merger
consideration that will be paid in cash. Unless some LifeMinders stockholders
elect to receive or are deemed to have elected to receive only Cross Media
common stock, the ratio of cash to stock that LifeMinders stockholders electing
to receive all cash will receive will not be significantly greater than that of
the LifeMinders stockholders electing the prescribed mix of cash and Cross Media
common stock.

LIFEMINDERS HAS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE MERGER AGREEMENT BASED ON THE MARKET
PRICE OF CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK ONLY IF THE MARKET PRICE DROPS BELOW $1.0915
FOR MORE THAN 10 CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS.

     A reduction in the market price of Cross Media common stock could cause
some LifeMinders stockholders to vote against adoption of the amended and
restated merger agreement. LifeMinders does not have any right to terminate the
merger agreement based on the market price of Cross Media common stock, unless
the volume weighted average closing price for Cross Media common stock over any

consecutive trading days between July 18, 2001 and the closing date of the
merger is less than $1.0915 per share.

CROSS MEDIA INTENDS TO FILE A REGISTRATION STATEMENT TO REGISTER FOR RESALE
APPROXIMATELY 36 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK, WHICH MAY CAUSE THE MARKET
PRICE OF THE CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.

     Current Cross Media stockholders have the right to require Cross Media to
register for resale a substantial number of shares of common stock or shares of
common stock into or for which their convertible securities, options or warrants
are convertible or exercisable, which may facilitate the sale of these shares in
the public market. Cross Media intends to file one or more registration
statements prior to the closing of the merger to register approximately 36
million shares of Cross Media common stock, and to cause such registration
statements to become effective as soon as practicable following filing. As a
result, a substantial number of shares of Cross Media common stock in relation
to the public float of Cross Media common stock will become eligible for sale in
the public market. As a result of future sales of such common stock, or the
perception that these sales could occur, the market price of Cross Media common
stock may decline and could decline significantly before or at the time the
merger is completed or immediately thereafter. See "Description of Cross Media
Capital Stock."

IF LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS WHO RECEIVE CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER
SELL THAT STOCK IMMEDIATELY, IT COULD CAUSE A DECLINE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF
CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK.

     All of the shares of Cross Media common stock to be issued in the merger
will be registered with the SEC and therefore will be immediately available for
resale in the public market, except that shares issued in the merger to
LifeMinders stockholders who are affiliates of LifeMinders before the merger or
who become affiliates of Cross Media after the merger will be subject to certain
restrictions on transferability. The number of shares of Cross Media common
stock to be issued to LifeMinders stockholders in connection with the merger and
immediately available for resale will be substantial compared to the number of
shares of Cross Media common stock currently in the public market. LifeMinders
stockholders who are not affiliates may elect to sell the stock they receive
immediately after the merger. As a result of future sales of such common stock,
or the perception that these sales could occur, the market price of Cross Media
common stock may decline and could decline significantly before or at the time
the merger is completed or immediately thereafter. If this occurs, or if other
holders of Cross Media common stock sell significant amounts of Cross Media
common stock immediately after the merger is completed, it is likely that these
sales would cause a decline in the market price of Cross Media common stock.

THE ANTICIPATED TAX TREATMENT OF THE MERGER MAY NOT BE SUSTAINED.

     Both Cross Media and LifeMinders anticipate that the merger will qualify as
a "reorganization" for federal income tax purposes, so that LifeMinders
stockholders receiving Cross Media common stock in exchange for their
LifeMinders common stock may defer tax on all or a portion of any gain realized
on the exchange. It is anticipated that each of Cross Media and LifeMinders will
receive an opinion from its respective counsel that the merger will qualify as a
reorganization. However, factual developments could make it uncertain whether
the merger would so qualify. In addition, an opinion, though received, might be
disputed by the Internal Revenue Service. Neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders
can assure you that the merger will qualify as a reorganization.

THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE MERGER MAY NOT BE REALIZED IN A TIMELY FASHION,
OR AT ALL, AND CROSS MEDIA'S OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE
OPERATION OF LIFEMINDERS' BUSINESS DIVERTS TOO MUCH ATTENTION AWAY FROM CROSS
MEDIA'S EXISTING BUSINESS.

     The success of the merger will depend, in part, on Cross Media's ability to
realize the anticipated revenue enhancements, growth opportunities and synergies
of combining with LifeMinders and effectively utilize the net cash and other
resources Cross Media will have following the merger. The merger involves risks
related to the integration and management of acquired technology and operations
and personnel. The integration of the businesses will be a complex,
time-consuming and potentially expensive process and may

disrupt Cross Media's business if not completed in a timely and efficient
manner. Some of the difficulties that may be encountered by the combined company
include:

     - potential conflicts in distribution, marketing or other important
       relationships;

     - the diversion of management's attention from other ongoing business
       concerns;

     - the inability to utilize the acquired member database and technology
       effectively to grow Cross Media's business; and

     - potential conflicts between business cultures.

     Moreover, Cross Media and LifeMinders believe that the success of the
combined businesses is dependent, in part, on a strong media advertising market,
of which there can be no assurance. These factors could contribute to the
combined company not achieving the expected benefits from the merger in a timely
fashion, or at all.

     If Cross Media's management focuses too much time, money and effort to
integrate LifeMinders' operations and assets, they may not be able to execute
Cross Media's overall business strategy.

FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE MERGER COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT CROSS MEDIA'S OR
LIFEMINDERS' STOCK PRICES, FUTURE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS.

     If the merger is not completed for any reason, Cross Media and LifeMinders
may be subject to a number of material risks, including the following:

     - LifeMinders may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay to Cross
       Media a termination fee of up to $2.8 million;

     - Both companies may experience a negative reaction, from both the
       financial markets and customers of each company, to the termination of
       the merger; and

     - Each company must pay the costs related to the merger, such as amounts
       payable to legal and financial advisors and independent accountants, even
       if the merger is not completed.

THE LIFEMINDERS' BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS DETERMINED THAT THE CROSS MEDIA MERGER
IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF ALL OF THE LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS; HOWEVER,
INDIVIDUAL LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER OR
VOTE UPON AN ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTION.

     Under the amended and restated merger agreement, LifeMinders is obligated
to complete the merger with Cross Media unless, among other things, the
LifeMinders board of directors determines in good faith, after receipt of advice
from outside counsel, that the failure to terminate the merger agreement would
likely be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of LifeMinders' directors to
the LifeMinders stockholders under applicable law with respect to a superior
proposal. Therefore, even though LifeMinders may receive communications from
other parties regarding possible alternative transactions, LifeMinders may not
be able to pursue alternative transactions that an individual LifeMinders
stockholder finds to be more favorable to such individual stockholder's
interests than the Cross Media merger. LifeMinders stockholders that vote
against adoption of the amended and restated merger agreement will not have
appraisal rights in connection with the merger. See "The Merger" for additional
information about LifeMinders' right to consider and pursue alternative
transactions.

RISKS RELATING TO CROSS MEDIA

CROSS MEDIA HAS A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE
ITS PROSPECTS.

     Cross Media developed its present business strategy in 1999, completed its
first acquisition in January 2000 and opened its first company-owned call center
and undertook its first e-mail campaign in the last quarter of 2000. Therefore,
Cross Media has a limited history of operations under its present business
strategy upon which the likelihood of its success can be evaluated. The
implementation of a new

business strategy frequently involves risks, expenses and uncertainties that may
adversely affect Cross Media's business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.

CROSS MEDIA HAS A HISTORY OF LOSSES, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF NON-CASH CHARGES
AND INTEREST EXPENSE, AND MAY INCUR FUTURE LOSSES.

     Cross Media's net losses available to common stockholders for the year
ended December 31, 2000 were $44.6 million, or $1.84 per share. Cross Media's
net losses were primarily as a result of dividends on its preferred stock of
$39.6 million and $1.1 million, including non-cash dividends of $38.7 million
and $0.9 million. Non-cash dividends represent the accretion of the difference
between the carrying value and the mandatory redemption amounts of preferred
stock that resulted from allocating a portion of the proceeds to common stock,
common stock purchase warrants, and the beneficial conversion features of the
shares. Cross Media may incur additional non-cash dividends in connection with
the Series A agreement if the merger is not completed.

     If Cross Media's net revenues grow more slowly than it anticipates, or if
its operating expenses exceed its expectations, Cross Media's business, results
of operations, financial condition and prospects would be materially and
adversely affected. Although Cross Media realized net income during the first
six months of 2001, there can be no assurance that Cross Media will continue to
realize net income.

CROSS MEDIA MAY NEED ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO IMPLEMENT ITS STRATEGY AND EXPAND
ITS BUSINESS.

     Cross Media may need additional debt or equity financing to pursue its
strategy of expanding its business through the acquisition of companies whose
businesses are strategically appropriate for it or for its existing operations.
Although Media Outsourcing, Cross Media's principal subsidiary, has in the past
generated positive cash flow, Cross Media's credit facility limits the amount of
distributions Media Outsourcing can make to Cross Media. Any financing that
Cross Media needs may not be available at all and, if available, may not be
available on terms that are acceptable to Cross Media. The failure to obtain
financing on a timely basis, or on economically favorable terms, could prevent
Cross Media from continuing its strategy or from responding to changing business
or economic conditions, and could cause Cross Media to experience difficulty in
withstanding adverse operating results or competing effectively.

     If Cross Media raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, Cross
Media stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interest.
Moreover, Cross Media could issue preferred stock that has rights senior to
those of its common stock. If Cross Media raises funds by issuing debt
securities, these securities would have rights, preferences and privileges
senior to holders of common stock and lenders may place limitations on Cross
Media's operations.

CROSS MEDIA IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIVE CREDIT FACILITY COVENANTS WHICH COULD HARM
ITS FINANCIAL STATUS AND HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ITS STOCK PRICE.

     In January 2000, Cross Media entered into an agreement with Coast Business
Credit to provide a credit facility to finance the acquisition of its magazine
subscription teleservicing business and the ongoing working capital needs of
Media Outsourcing. Cross Media has guaranteed Media Outsourcing's obligations
under the Coast credit facility and all of Media Outsourcing's assets are
pledged to Coast to secure its obligations under the Coast facility.

     Under the agreement with Coast, Cross Media is required, among other
things, to maintain a consolidated net worth of not less than $9 million and
excess borrowing availability of $750,000. If Cross Media cannot satisfy these
or other covenants under the Coast facility, Cross Media will be required to
seek a waiver or amendment from Coast. In May 2001, Coast waived the requirement
that Cross Media maintain a minimum tangible net worth through March 31, 2001
and waived any violation of the limitation on distributions by Media Outsourcing
to Cross Media with respect to a $1 million distribution in February 2001.
Although Cross Media expects to be in compliance with the provisions of the
Coast facility agreement going forward, if it should require waivers or
amendments to the agreement, there can be no assurance that Coast will agree. If
Cross Media defaults in performing its obligations to Coast,

Coast would be entitled to accelerate the maturity of outstanding indebtedness
under the credit facility, $14.6 million as of June 30, 2001, and to enforce its
security interest in Media Outsourcing's assets.

IF CROSS MEDIA IS UNABLE TO COLLECT ITS RECEIVABLES IN A TIMELY MANNER, ITS CASH
FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

     Cross Media is subject to the risks associated with selling products on
credit, including delays in collection or uncollectibility of accounts
receivable. If Cross Media experiences significant delays in collection or
uncollectibility of accounts receivable, its liquidity and working capital
position could suffer.

IF SUBSCRIPTION CANCELLATION RESERVES ARE NOT ADEQUATE, CROSS MEDIA COULD BE
REQUIRED TO INCREASE ITS RESERVES, WHICH WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF REVENUES.

     Cross Media extends credit to subscribers who purchase multi-magazine
subscription packages. Cross Media has established a reserve to cover
subscription cancellation based upon its past history with magazine subscription
orders. In the past, Cross Media has had to increase the reserves on its 20 pay
contracts. If Cross Media's accounts subscription cancellation reserves are
inadequate, it will be required to increase reserves, which will reduce revenues
and could otherwise materially adversely effect Cross Media's results of
operations.

THE NATURE OF CROSS MEDIA'S BUSINESS MAKES IT SUSCEPTIBLE TO AN ECONOMIC
SLOWDOWN.

     Cross Media's business may be adversely affected by periods of economic
slowdown, inflation or recession, which may be accompanied by a decrease in the
availability of consumer credit. Any material decline in the availability of
consumer credit may result in a decrease in consumer demand to make credit card
purchases, which could adversely affect the demand for Cross Media's products
and services.

FUTURE GROWTH COULD PLACE SIGNIFICANT STRAIN ON CROSS MEDIA'S RESOURCES AND
CROSS MEDIA MAY BE UNABLE TO MANAGE FUTURE GROWTH.

     Growth in Cross Media operations could place a significant strain on its
operational systems and employee resources. As a result, Cross Media may have to
implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. In
order to manage and accommodate its planned growth, if it occurs, Cross Media
will need to continue to improve and adapt its financial planning, accounting
systems, information systems and management structures. Cross Media will also
need to expand, train, retain and manage its employee base. If Cross Media is
unable to manage its growth effectively, its financial condition and results of
operations could be materially adversely affected.

IF CROSS MEDIA ACQUIRES OR MAKES STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN OTHER BUSINESSES OR
ACQUIRES OR LICENSES TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER ASSETS, IT MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY
INTEGRATING THESE BUSINESSES, TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSETS OR GENERATING AN
ACCEPTABLE RETURN ON ITS INVESTMENTS.

     Cross Media may acquire or enter into strategic relationships with other
businesses and acquire or license technology and other assets. Cross Media
cannot assure you that acquisition or licensing opportunities will be available
on terms acceptable to it or at all. Any future acquisitions and strategic
relationships will involve risks, including:

     - inability to raise the required capital;

     - difficulty in assimilating the acquired assets, operations and personnel;

     - disruption of ongoing business;

     - distraction of management from other responsibilities; and

     - lack of the necessary experience to enter new markets.

     Cross Media may not successfully overcome problems encountered in
connection with potential acquisitions or licensing arrangements. In addition,
acquisitions or strategic relationships could materially impair Cross Media's
operating results, causing Cross Media to incur additional debt, or requiring
Cross Media to amortize acquisition expenses and acquired assets.

THE LOSS OF CROSS MEDIA'S LARGEST CALL CENTERS WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN A
REDUCTION OF REVENUES AND OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT OPERATING RESULTS.

     In the year ended December 31, 2000, two independent call centers accounted
for approximately 35% of Cross Media's magazine subscription revenues. These
call centers do not have any commitment to generate sales for Cross Media and
could therefore, at any time, terminate their relationships with Cross Media
without notice, which could have a material adverse effect on Cross Media's
business.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION COULD ADD SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL COSTS TO CROSS MEDIA'S
BUSINESS AND IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON ITS MARKETING PRACTICES WHICH COULD
INTERFERE WITH CROSS MEDIA'S OPERATIONS AND HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON
REVENUES.

     Laws and regulations applicable to direct marketing, telemarketing,
Internet marketing, consumer protection and membership club services are
becoming more prevalent. Each of the 50 states and the Federal government has
laws regulating telemarketing, sweepstakes promotions, promotional incentives
and advertising to consumers, which vary from state to state. While Cross Media
reviews its telemarketing scripts and advertising copy to ensure that they
comply with applicable laws, there is no guarantee that Federal or state
authorities will not find that its marketing efforts do not comply with these
laws. In addition, it is likely that additional Federal and/or state regulations
regarding telemarketing, sweepstakes, e-mail marketing and other marketing
practices engaged in by Cross Media will be enacted. If enacted, these
regulations could have an adverse effect on revenues and result in additional
expenses to Cross Media and could require Cross Media to refrain from engaging
in specific activities or modify its business practices.

     The Federal Trade Commission is currently in the process of reviewing the
provisions of the Telemarketing Sales Rule and Negative Option Rule to determine
if any changes to the rule should be made. If the Federal Trade Commission
determines that changes to the rule are necessary, changes could have a
significant adverse effect on Cross Media's business.

     In 1999, Congress enacted the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement
Act, which imposes various restrictions on the offering of sweepstakes through
the mail. Additional sweepstakes legislation has been enacted or is pending in
various states. This additional regulation could have an adverse impact on Cross
Media's marketing activities.

     Federal and state authorities have also been investigating various
companies' use of marketing practices, such as the use of personal information,
magazine subscription agents' sweepstakes practices and the marketing of
membership club services through the use of inbound and outbound telemarketing
campaigns. These investigations could result in additional rules, regulations or
industry standards, which could have an adverse impact on Cross Media's
marketing practices. At least two of the state investigations have directly
involved Memberworks, whose club memberships Cross Media is marketing. To the
extent Cross Media derives revenue from the sale of memberships in the
Memberworks club, there is a risk that Cross Media could be subject to
investigation as well, which could have an adverse impact on it.

EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND LEGAL UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO DOING
BUSINESS ON THE INTERNET COULD LIMIT CROSS MEDIA'S SALES OR ADD SIGNIFICANT
ADDITIONAL COSTS TO ITS BUSINESS.

     Laws and regulations directly applicable to Internet communications,
commerce, marketing and data protection are becoming more prevalent. If any of
these laws hinder the growth of Internet use generally or decreases the
acceptance of the Internet as a medium of communications, commerce and
marketing, Cross Media's business and prospects may suffer materially. The
United States Congress has enacted Internet

laws regarding children's privacy, copyrights and taxation. Other laws and
regulations may be adopted covering issues such as user privacy, marketing
activities, pricing, content, taxation and quality of products and services. The
governments of some states and foreign countries have begun to regulate Cross
Media's transactions and levy sales or other taxes relating to its activities
and will likely continue to do so. The laws governing the Internet remain
largely unsettled, even in areas where legislation has been enacted. It may take
years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing
intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation apply to the Internet and
Internet advertising and marketing services. In addition, the growth and
development of the market for Internet commerce may prompt calls for more
stringent consumer protection laws, both in the United States and abroad, that
may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the
Internet.

     Laws and regulations governing the transmission of unsolicited email
marketing messages are being considered in many jurisdictions. Legislation of
that type has recently been adopted by numerous states, and similar legislation
is pending in several states and in Congress. These laws could have an adverse
impact on Cross Media's Internet marketing activities. The Telecommunications
Act of 1996 prohibits some types of information and content from being
transmitted over the Internet. The prohibition's scope and the liability
associated with a Telecommunications Act violation are currently unsettled. In
addition, although substantial portions of the Communications Decency Act were
held to be unconstitutional, Cross Media cannot be certain that similar
legislation will not be enacted and upheld in the future.

CHANGES IN LAWS RELATING TO CONSUMER PRIVACY AND POTENTIALLY HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY
OF CROSS MEDIA'S SERVICES COULD HARM ITS BUSINESS.

     There has been increasing public debate about the collection, distribution
and use of information about consumers. Although this debate has primarily
focused on information collected through the Internet, many of the issues apply
to data gathered through other media. Cross Media interacts with consumers
through its various direct marketing efforts, both online and offline. As a
consequence of government regulation or evolving standards of consumer privacy
protection, Cross Media may be required to make changes to its marketing media
and platforms in ways that could diminish the effectiveness of its marketing
efforts, which could harm its business. Recently Congress passed the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which restricts the transfer of personal information,
including credit card information, by financial institutions. The Federal Trade
Commission is also considering regulations under that act. This could restrict
Cross Media's ability to acquire personal information from financial
institutions and thus adversely affect its direct marketing activities.

CROSS MEDIA HAS NOT MET ITS OBLIGATION TO REGISTER A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF
SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AND COULD HAVE LIABILITY AS A RESULT.

     Cross Media has granted holders of a substantial number of shares of its
common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise or conversion of options,
warrants and other equity rights, the rights to have their shares included in
one or more registration statements that were required to have been filed. Cross
Media has not yet filed a registration statement covering these shares and may
have liability as a result of its failure to timely file registration statement.

MARKET RELATED RISKS OF CROSS MEDIA

THE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF OPTIONS AND WARRANTS TO PURCHASE CROSS MEDIA COMMON
STOCK COULD RESULT IN DILUTION TO CROSS MEDIA STOCKHOLDERS.

     If the holders of the outstanding Cross Media options and common stock
purchase warrants exercise those options and warrants, including those issuable
in connection with the merger and warrants being issued as partial consideration
for conversion of outstanding preferred stock, and the holders of all
outstanding convertible securities converted them into common stock, Cross Media
would be required to issue approximately 19.8 million additional shares of
common stock, based on current exercise and conversion prices. The exercise of
options and warrants and convertible rights, most of which have exercise

prices or conversion rates below the current market price of Cross Media common
stock, will result in dilution to Cross Media stockholders, including
LifeMinders stockholders receiving Cross Media common stock in the merger.

OTHER RISKS RELATING TO CROSS MEDIA

BECAUSE OWNERSHIP OF CROSS MEDIA IS CONCENTRATED, A SMALL NUMBER OF STOCKHOLDERS
EXERT SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER CROSS MEDIA.

     The five largest stockholders of Cross Media beneficially owned
approximately 57% of Cross Media's issued and outstanding common stock as of
August 1, 2001, and following the merger these stockholders will continue to own
a controlling interest in Cross Media common stock. As a result, these
stockholders have the ability to exert significant influence over Cross Media's
business, including the election of directors and the approval of any other
action requiring the approval of stockholders. This concentration of share
ownership may:

     - delay or prevent a change of control of Cross Media;

     - impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination
       involving Cross Media; and/or

     - discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise
       attempting to obtain control of Cross Media.

PROVISIONS OF CROSS MEDIA'S CORPORATE CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE LAW COULD
DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL.

     Cross Media's certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of
directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred
stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined
at the time of issuance by Cross Media's board of directors, without further
action by stockholders, and may include, among other things, voting rights
(including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as
to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, and sinking fund
provisions. There is one series of preferred stock currently outstanding which
has a preference over the common stock if Cross Media is liquidated. This series
of preferred stock will be converted to common stock or redeemed simultaneously
with the completion of the merger. In addition, specific rights granted to
future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict Cross Media's
ability to merge with, or sell its assets to, a third party. The ability of
Cross Media's board of directors to issue preferred stock could discourage,
delay, or prevent a takeover of Cross Media, thereby preserving control by the
current stockholders.

     As a Delaware corporation, Cross Media is subject to the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, including Section 203, an
anti-takeover law enacted in 1988. In general, Section 203 restricts the ability
of a public Delaware corporation from engaging in a "business combination" with
an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years after the date of the
transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder. Subject to
exceptions, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates
and associates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of a
corporation's voting stock. As a result of the application of Section 203,
potential acquirers may be discouraged from attempting to acquire Cross Media,
thereby possibly depriving its stockholders of acquisition opportunities to sell
or otherwise dispose of its stock at above-market prices typical of
acquisitions.

RISKS RELATED TO LIFEMINDERS

IF THE MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED, LIFEMINDERS MAY DISCONTINUE ITS OPERATIONS AND
LIQUIDATE.

     If the merger is not completed and LifeMinders is unable to conclude that
another sale or merger transaction would be in the best interests of its
stockholders, the board of directors may determine that the best alternative is
to discontinue operations, sell LifeMinders remaining non-cash assets and, after
payment of all obligations, distribute the net proceeds to its stockholders. The
amount and timing of any

distributions to stockholders in a liquidation cannot be determined because they
would depend on a variety of factors, including the amount of proceeds received
from any asset sales or dispositions, the time and amount required to resolve
outstanding obligations and the amount of any reserves for future contingencies.
In addition, LifeMinders will have incurred substantial costs associated with
the merger which will be payable regardless of whether the merger is
consummated. Payment of these costs will reduce LifeMinders' remaining cash
balance and the amount that would otherwise be distributable to LifeMinders'
stockholders in a liquidation. In certain circumstances, LifeMinders is
obligated to pay Cross Media a fee of $2.8 million if the merger agreement is
terminated, which would further reduce LifeMinders' cash balance.

LIFEMINDERS HAS SCALED BACK ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND HAS SIGNIFICANTLY
REDUCED ITS WORK FORCE. LIFEMINDERS EXPECTS THAT THESE ACTIONS, COUPLED WITH
CONTINUING WEAKNESS IN THE ONLINE ADVERTISING MARKET, WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE
ANY FUTURE REVENUES.

     As announced on May 10, 2001, the LifeMinders' board of directors decided
to significantly scale back its business operations and reduce its work force.
LifeMinders believes that its revenues from online advertising and other
existing lines of business for the foreseeable future will continue to decline
substantially from that reported in prior periods. LifeMinders expects this
decline because, among other reasons, it believes that:

     - the market for online advertising will continue to decline significantly;

     - opportunities for online advertising revenues will decline because the
       company will be producing and delivering a substantially lower number of
       emails;

     - LifeMinders does not expect to develop any new email products during this
       period; and

     - LifeMinders' management and other key employees will spend a significant
       portion of their time completing the merger, or in the event the merger
       is not completed, in identifying and evaluating strategic alternatives.

     In addition, LifeMinder's existing advertising customers may choose not to
place online advertising with LifeMinders as a result of concerns about the
future of its business operations.

LIFEMINDERS HAS INCURRED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AND, IF THE MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED,
EXPECTS CONTINUED LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

     LifeMinders has never achieved profitability and, if the merger is not
completed and LifeMinders continues its operations, expects to continue to incur
operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of June 30, 2001, LifeMinders
had an accumulated deficit of $194.3 million. LifeMinders incurred net losses of
$50.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001, and $109.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2000. LifeMinders cannot be certain that, if the merger
is not completed and the company continues its operations, it will ever generate
sufficient revenue to achieve profitability. If LifeMinders' future revenue is
lower than currently anticipated, or its operating expenses exceed its
estimates, it would incur greater losses than anticipated and LifeMinders would
be required to further reduce its cash balance to support its continued
operations. Such circumstances could make LifeMinders less desirable as an
acquisition candidate, reduce its value in any sale or merger transaction, and
reduce the amount of proceeds available to LifeMinders' stockholders in the
event of a liquidation. If this merger is not completed, there is no guarantee
that LifeMinders will be able to identify or successfully complete a sale or
merger of LifeMinders.

LIFEMINDERS COMMON STOCK HAS EXPERIENCED A SHARP DECLINE IN VALUE. IF THE MERGER
IS NOT COMPLETED, LIFEMINDERS' STOCK PRICE MAY CONTINUE TO DECLINE.

     The market price of LifeMinders common stock has experienced a decline and,
if the merger is not completed, may decline further as a result of LifeMinders'
decision to scale back business operations, or as a result of fluctuations in
its quarterly results of operations. The market price of LifeMinders common

stock has declined from a high of $91.00 per common share at March 9, 2000 to a
low of $0.53 at April 3, 2001. On August 10, 2001, the closing price per share
of LifeMinders common stock as reported on The Nasdaq National Market was $1.54
per share. LifeMinders believes that the market price of its common stock has
been significantly and adversely affected by the sharp decline in the online
advertising market. LifeMinders also believes that, if the merger is not
completed, its common stock price may decline further in the future as a result
of LifeMinders' decision to scale back operations and because of the
significantly lower revenues reported in its quarterly results of operations for
the quarters ended December 31, 2000, March 31, 2001 and June 30, 2001. In
addition, LifeMinders believes that in the future, fluctuations in its quarterly
results and the negative online advertising market, as well as many of the other
risk factors pertaining to LifeMinders, may negatively affect LifeMinders'
quarterly operating results and contribute to fluctuations in its common stock
price.

     If the merger is not completed, LifeMinders may continue to seek and
evaluate potential strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger
of LifeMinders. A further decline in the price of LifeMinders common stock may
adversely affect LifeMinders' ability to complete an alternative transaction
using LifeMinders stock as all or part of the consideration.

     In addition, if the price of LifeMinders common stock remains low, it may
be delisted by Nasdaq and become subject to special rules applicable to low
priced stocks, which may reduce the liquidity of the shares.

LIFEMINDERS' ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE ITS SCALED DOWN BUSINESS, COMPLETE
THIS MERGER, OR IDENTIFY, EVALUATE AND COMPLETE ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTIONS IF THIS
MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED, IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO RETAIN THE REMAINING
MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES.

     Since the fourth quarter of 2000, LifeMinders has laid off approximately
85% of its workforce. LifeMinders may have difficulty retaining the remaining
members of its management team and other key employees on whom it will depend to
continue to operate its scaled down business and complete this merger, and, if
the merger is not completed, to assist in identifying, evaluating and completing
any alternative transactions. If LifeMinders is unable to retain its management
and other key employees through this process, continuation of its business
operations and its ability, if necessary, to identify, evaluate and complete an
alternative transaction could be materially and adversely affected. LifeMinders
has agreed to pay bonuses to certain employees that are key to LifeMinders'
continued operations if they remain employed until August 31, 2001. The merger
will not be completed by this date, and LifeMinders cannot be certain that these
key employees will remain with LifeMinders until the merger is completed or, if
this merger is not completed, until it can identify, evaluate and complete an
alternative transaction.

LIFEMINDERS HAS ONLY A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY UPON WHICH TO EVALUATE ITS
BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS.

     LifeMinders has only a limited operating history upon which to evaluate its
business and prospects and the online direct marketing industry is relatively
new and rapidly evolving. This presents many risks and uncertainties including:

     - the ability to compete effectively against other companies;

     - the need to retain and motivate qualified personnel;

     - the ability to anticipate and adapt to the changing market;

     - the ability to develop and introduce new products and services and
       continue to develop and upgrade technology; and

     - the need to attract and retain a large number of customers from a variety
       of industries.

     LifeMinders has also historically depended on the growing use of the
Internet for advertising, commerce and communications, and on general economic
conditions.

     LifeMinders cannot assure you that it will successfully address these risks
and uncertainties, particularly because of its recent scaling back of
operations. If the merger is not completed, and LifeMinders is unsuccessful in
addressing these risks and uncertainties, it may not be able to generate
sufficient revenue to fund its continued operations. In that event, LifeMinders
would be required to reduce its cash balances to fund operations, which could
make it less desirable as an acquisition candidate or reduce its value in any
sale or merger transaction, and would reduce the amount of proceeds available
for distribution to LifeMinders stockholders in the event of a liquidation of
LifeMinders.

IF THE MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED, LIFEMINDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE
SUFFICIENT REVENUE TO SUPPORT ITS CONTINUED OPERATIONS IF THE MARKET FOR ONLINE
ADVERTISING, WHICH IS NEW AND UNPREDICTABLE, DOES NOT DEVELOP AND EXPAND.

     LifeMinders has historically derived a substantial portion of its revenue
from online advertising and direct marketing, including both email and Web-based
programs. The profit potential for this business model is unproven. The Internet
has not existed long enough as an advertising medium to demonstrate its
effectiveness relative to traditional advertising. Advertisers and advertising
agencies that have historically relied on traditional advertising may be
reluctant or slow to adopt online advertising. Many potential advertisers have
limited or no experience using email or the Web as an advertising medium. They
may have allocated only a limited portion of their advertising budgets to online
advertising, or may find online advertising to be less effective for promoting
their products and services than traditional advertising media. Further,
LifeMinders' email and Web-based programs may not generate sufficient user
traffic with demographic characteristics attractive to advertisers. LifeMinders
is also affected by general industry conditions governing the supply and demand
of Internet advertising.

     LifeMinders' results of operations have been adversely affected in recent
quarters as a result of a significantly declining market for online advertising,
and LifeMinders expects that those adverse market conditions will continue. If
the market for online advertising fails to improve or deteriorates more than
LifeMinders expects and the merger is not completed, LifeMinders may not be able
to generate sufficient revenue to support its continued operations. In that
event, LifeMinders would be required to reduce its cash balance, which could
make it less desirable as an acquisition candidate or reduce its value in any
sale or merger transaction, and would reduce the amount of proceeds available
for distribution to its stockholders in the event of a liquidation of
LifeMinders.

LIFEMINDERS' ADVERTISING CUSTOMERS AND THE COMPANIES WITH WHICH IT HAS OTHER
BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS MAY EXPERIENCE ADVERSE BUSINESS CONDITIONS THAT COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT LIFEMINDERS' BUSINESS.

     Some of LifeMinders' customers may experience difficulty in supporting
their current operations and implementing their business plans. These customers
may reduce their spending on LifeMinders' products and services, or may not be
able to discharge their payment and other obligations to LifeMinders. The
non-payment or late payment of amounts due to LifeMinders from a significant
customer would negatively impact LifeMinders' financial condition. These
circumstances are influenced by general economic and industry conditions, and
could have a material adverse impact on LifeMinders' business, financial
condition and results of operations. In addition to intense competition, the
overall market for Internet advertising has been characterized in recent
quarters by increasing softness of demand, the reduction or cancellation of
advertising contracts, an increased risk of uncollectible receivables from
advertisers, and the reduction of Internet advertising budgets, especially by
Internet-related companies. LifeMinders' customers may experience difficulty in
raising capital, or may be anticipating such difficulties, and therefore may
elect to scale back the resources they devote to advertising, including on
LifeMinders' system. Other companies in the Internet industry have depleted
their available capital, and could cease operations or file for bankruptcy
protection. If the merger is not completed and the current environment for
LifeMinders' customers and the demand for Internet advertising does not improve,
LifeMinders' business, results of operations and financial condition could be
materially adversely affected.

IF LIFEMINDERS DOES NOT MAINTAIN AN ENGAGED MEMBER BASE, IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
COMPETE EFFECTIVELY FOR, OR MAINTAIN, ADVERTISERS AND ITS BUSINESS COULD BE
ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

     LifeMinders' revenue has been derived primarily from advertisers seeking an
engaged, targeted audience for their advertisements. Although LifeMinders
intends to continue to produce and distribute emails to its members, it has
scaled back its business operations and has reduced the number of emails it
sends to members. LifeMinders has discontinued most of its member related
marketing activities. Accordingly, LifeMinders does not expect growth in its
member base, nor does it expect to develop new products.

     A significant portion of LifeMinders' revenue has historically been derived
from performance-based and revenue sharing arrangements. Under these
arrangements, advertisers pay LifeMinders in part based on member responses to
advertisements and promotions placed in email newsletters. If LifeMinders'
members do not respond to advertisements and promotions placed in email
newsletters, the company's revenue could be materially and adversely affected.

     If LifeMinders is unable to maintain an engaged member base by keeping its
current members active (i.e., opening email newsletters and responding to the
advertisements contained in those newsletters), advertisers could find
LifeMinders' audience less attractive and effective for promoting their products
and services. LifeMinders currently expects that it will experience difficulty
retaining its existing advertisers, and has ceased its efforts to solicit
additional advertisers, which will likely reduce its future revenues from online
advertising and opt-in advertising, which represent a majority of LifeMinders'
revenues to date.

COMPETITION IN THE ONLINE ADVERTISING MARKET INDUSTRY IS INTENSE, AND
LIFEMINDERS' SCALED BACK OPERATIONS MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR IT TO COMPETE
EFFECTIVELY AND MAY REDUCE ITS ABILITY TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT ADVERTISERS.

     If the merger is not completed and LifeMinders continues operations, it
will continue to face intense competition from both traditional and online
advertising and direct marketing businesses. LifeMinders scaled back operations
will make it more difficult to compete effectively with its competitors. If it
is not able to compete effectively, LifeMinders may not be able to retain
current advertisers or attract new advertisers. This would reduce LifeMinders'
revenues and it would need to reduce its cash balance to support its continued
operations, which could make LifeMinders less desirable for an alternative
transaction and would reduce the amount of proceeds available for distribution
to stockholders in the event of a liquidation. LifeMinders faces competition for
marketing dollars from online portals and community Web sites such as AOL,
Yahoo!, and CNET Networks, Inc. In addition, other companies offer competitive
email direct marketing services, including coolsavings.com, MyPoints.com,
NetCreations, YesMail.com and Digital Impact. Additionally, traditional
advertising agencies and direct marketing companies may seek to offer online
products or services that compete with those offered by LifeMinders.

     Many of LifeMinders' existing competitors, as well as a number of potential
new competitors, have longer operating histories, greater name recognition,
larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical and
marketing resources than LifeMinders. LifeMinders' competitors will most likely
continue to develop and market new technologies and products and to conduct
research allowing them to identify and respond to changes in customer
requirements. In addition, these competitors will continue to aggressively
market and sell their products and services. LifeMinders has scaled back its
operations, resulting in a lack of material resources being committed to
marketing and sales activities by LifeMinders. As a result, it is unlikely that,
if the merger is not completed, LifeMinders will be able to effectively compete
in the market for a long period of time, and its business, results of operations
or financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.

LIFEMINDERS RELIES HEAVILY ON ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND OTHER
PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, AND ANY FAILURE TO PROTECT AND MAINTAIN THESE RIGHTS
AND INFORMATION COULD PREVENT LIFEMINDERS FROM COMPETING EFFECTIVELY.

     LifeMinders' ability to continue operations in the event the merger is not
completed is substantially dependent on its internally developed technologies
and trademarks, which LifeMinders seeks to protect through a combination of
patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark law, as well as confidentiality or
license agreements with employees, consultants, and corporate and strategic
partners. If LifeMinders is unable to prevent the unauthorized use of its
proprietary information or if its competitors are able to develop similar
technologies independently, the competitive benefits of LifeMinders'
technologies, intellectual property rights and proprietary information will be
diminished. These circumstances could also make the company less desirable in an
alternative transaction.

     LifeMinders depends heavily on its network infrastructure and if this fails
it could result in unanticipated expenses, as well as prevent LifeMinders'
members from effectively utilizing LifeMinders' services. This could negatively
impact LifeMinders' ability to retain members and advertisers.

     LifeMinders' ability to successfully create and deliver its email
newsletters depends in large part on the capacity, reliability and security of
its networking hardware, software and telecommunications infrastructure.
Failures of the network infrastructure could result in unanticipated expenses to
address such failures and could prevent LifeMinders' members from effectively
utilizing its services, which could prevent LifeMinders from retaining members
and advertisers. LifeMinders does not have fully redundant systems or a formal
disaster recovery plan. The system is susceptible to natural and man-made
disasters, including earthquakes, fires, floods, power loss and vandalism.
Further, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, electronic break-ins or
other similar disruptive problems could adversely affect the operation of the
systems. LifeMinders' insurance policies may not adequately compensate it for
any losses that may occur due to any damages or interruptions in the systems.
Accordingly, LifeMinders could be required to make capital expenditures in the
event of unanticipated damage.

     In addition, LifeMinders' members depend on Internet service providers, or
ISPs, for access to the LifeMinders Web site. Due to the rapid growth of the
Internet, ISPs and Web sites have experienced significant system failures and
could experience outages, delays and other difficulties due to system failures
unrelated to LifeMinders' systems. These problems could harm LifeMinders'
business by preventing its members from effectively utilizing its services.

LIFEMINDERS' QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS AND
IT MAY BE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL AND CYCLICAL PATTERNS THAT MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT
ITS STOCK PRICE.

     LifeMinders believes that its business may be subject to seasonal
fluctuations. Advertisers historically have placed fewer advertisements during
the first and third calendar quarters of each year.

     Further, Internet user traffic typically drops during the summer months,
which potentially could reduce the amount of advertising placed during that
period. Expenditures by advertisers and direct marketers tend to vary in cycles
that reflect overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying
patterns. LifeMinders revenue has in the past been, and may in the future be,
materially affected by a decline in the economic prospects of customers or in
the economy in general, which could alter the company's customers' spending
priorities or budget cycles. Because of these and other factors, LifeMinders
revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.

THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN LIFEMINDERS' EMAILS MAY SUBJECT IT TO SIGNIFICANT
LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENCE, COPYRIGHT OR TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER MATTERS.

     If any of the content that LifeMinders creates and delivers to its members
or any content that is accessible from its emails through links to other Web
sites contains errors, third parties could make claims against LifeMinders for
losses incurred in reliance on such information. In addition, the content
contained in or accessible from LifeMinders' emails could include material that
is defamatory, violates the copyright

or trademark rights of third parties, or subjects it to liability for other
types of claims. LifeMinders' general liability insurance may not cover claims
of these types or may not be adequate to indemnify it for all liability that may
be imposed. Any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not
covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could result in
significant costs and expenses and damage LifeMinders' reputation.

     LifeMinders has also entered into agreements with certain e-commerce
partners under which LifeMinders may be entitled to receive a share of certain
revenue generated from the purchase of goods and services through direct links
to LifeMinders' e-commerce partners from the emails sent by LifeMinders. These
agreements may expose LifeMinders to additional legal risks and uncertainties,
including potential liabilities to consumers of those products and services by
virtue of its involvement in providing access to those products or services,
even if LifeMinders itself does not provide those products or services. Any
indemnification provided to LifeMinders in its agreements with these parties, if
available, may not adequately protect it.

CONCERNS ABOUT, OR BREACHES OF, THE SECURITY OF LIFEMINDERS' MEMBER DATABASE
COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES TO PREVENT BREACHES, AND SUBJECT THE
COMPANY TO LIABILITY FOR FAILING TO PROTECT THE MEMBERS' INFORMATION.

     LifeMinders maintains a database containing information about its members.
Unauthorized users accessing LifeMinders' systems remotely may access its
database or authorized users may make unauthorized copies of all or part of the
database for their own use in violation of specific agreements to the contrary.
As a result of these security and privacy concerns, LifeMinders may incur
significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to
alleviate problems caused by security breaches, and it may be unable to
effectively target direct marketing offers to members or may be subject to legal
claims of members if unauthorized third parties gain access to LifeMinders'
system and alter or destroy information in its database. Also, any public
perception that LifeMinders engaged in the unauthorized release of member
information, whether or not correct, would adversely affect its ability to
retain members.

LIFEMINDERS' BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE REFUSAL OF ONE OR MORE
ELECTRONIC EMAIL DELIVERY PROVIDERS TO DELIVER LIFEMINDERS', OR ITS CUSTOMERS',
MESSAGES.

     LifeMinders' business may be adversely affected by the unilateral election
of certain domain administrators to block, filter or otherwise prevent the
delivery of Internet advertising or commercial emails to their users.
LifeMinders cannot assure you that the number of domains which establish
policies restricting their users receipt of commercial deliveries as
consideration for receiving service will not become increasingly more popular,
thereby diminishing the reach of LifeMinders' service, or the service of its
customers.

LIFEMINDERS' BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY PRODUCTS OFFERED BY THIRD
PARTIES.

     LifeMinders ability to continue operating its business may be adversely
affected by the adoption by computer users of technologies that harm the
performance of its products and services, such as technologies that allow domain
administrators on the aggregate level, or individual users managing their own
electronic email accounts, to block, filter or otherwise prevent the delivery of
Internet advertising or commercial emails, or to block access to any services
that use cookies or other tracking technologies. LifeMinders cannot assure you
that the number of domains or individual computer users who employ these or
other similar technologies will not increase, thereby diminishing the efficacy
of LifeMinders', or its customers', services. LifeMinders' business, financial
condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected
if one or more of these technologies is widely accepted.

SWEEPSTAKES REGULATION MAY LIMIT LIFEMINDERS' ABILITY TO CONDUCT SWEEPSTAKES AND
OTHER CONTESTS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT ITS ABILITY TO RETAIN MEMBERS.

     The conduct of sweepstakes, lotteries and similar contests, including by
means of the Internet, is subject to extensive federal, state and local
regulation, which may restrict LifeMinders' ability to offer contests and
sweepstakes in some geographic areas or altogether. Any restrictions on these
promotions could adversely affect LifeMinders' ability to retain members.

IF THE PRICE OF LIFEMINDERS STOCK REMAINS VOLATILE, LIFEMINDERS MAY BECOME
SUBJECT TO SECURITIES LITIGATION, WHICH IS EXPENSIVE AND COULD DIVERT ITS
RESOURCES.

     In the past, following periods of market volatility in the price of a
company's securities, security holders have instituted class action litigation.
Many companies in the industry in which LifeMinders operates have been subject
to this type of litigation. LifeMinders' stock price has been volatile since the
company's initial public offering in November 1999. If the market value of
LifeMinders stock continues to experience adverse fluctuations, and LifeMinders
becomes involved in this type of litigation, regardless of the outcome,
LifeMinders could incur substantial legal costs and management's attention could
be diverted, causing the business to suffer.

LIFEMINDERS' BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF DEMAND FOR INTERNET
ADVERTISING FAILS TO GROW AS PREDICTED OR DIMINISHES.

     The Internet advertising industry is new and rapidly evolving, and it
cannot yet be compared with traditional advertising media to gauge its
effectiveness. As a result, demand and acceptance for Internet advertising
solutions is uncertain. Many of LifeMinders' advertising customers have limited
experience using the Internet for advertising purposes and they have allocated
only a limited portion of their advertising budgets to Internet advertising. The
adoption of Internet advertising, particularly by those entities that have
historically relied upon traditional media for advertising, requires the
acceptance of a new way of conducting business, exchanging information and
advertising products and services. These customers may find Internet advertising
to be less effective for promoting their products and services relative to
traditional advertising media. LifeMinders cannot assure you that its
advertising customers will continue to allocate a portion of their advertising
budget to Internet advertising or that the demand for Internet advertising will
continue to develop to sufficiently support Internet advertising as a
significant advertising medium. LifeMinders' results of operations have been
adversely affected in recent quarters as a result of a significantly declining
market for online advertising, and the company expects that these adverse market
conditions will continue. If the market for online advertising fails to improve
or deteriorates more than expected, LifeMinders' business, results of operations
and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

     There are currently no generally accepted standards or tools for the
measurement of the effectiveness of Internet advertising or the planning of
advertising purchases, and generally accepted standard measurements and tools
may need to be developed to support and promote Internet advertising as a
significant advertising medium. LifeMinders' advertising customers may challenge
or refuse to accept the measurements of advertisement delivery results developed
by LifeMinders or a third party. In addition, the accuracy of database
information used to target advertisements is essential to the effectiveness of
Internet advertising that may be developed in the future. The information in
LifeMinders' database, like any database, may contain inaccuracies that its
customers may not accept.

     A significant portion of LifeMinders' revenue has historically been derived
from the delivery of advertisements, which are designed to contain the features
and measuring capabilities requested by advertisers. If advertisers determine
that those ads are ineffective or unattractive as an advertising medium or if
LifeMinders is unable to deliver the features or measuring capabilities
requested by advertisers, the long-term growth of its online advertising
business could be limited and revenue levels could decline. There are also
'filter' software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being
delivered to a user's computer. The commercial viability of Internet
advertising, and LifeMinders' business, results of operations

and financial condition, would be materially and adversely affected by Web
users' widespread adoption of this software.

THE UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OF CONFIDENTIAL MEMBER INFORMATION THAT LIFEMINDERS
TRANSMITS OVER PUBLIC NETWORKS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO RETAIN
MEMBERS.

     Members transmit confidential information to LifeMinders over public
networks and the unauthorized access of such information by third parties could
harm LifeMinders' reputation and significantly hinder its efforts to retain
members. LifeMinders relies on a variety of security techniques and
authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security
and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential
information, including customer credit card numbers. Advances in computer
capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments
may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by LifeMinders to
protect customer transaction data.

PROBLEMS WITH THE PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY OF THE INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE
COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
LIFEMINDERS OFFERS ITS MEMBERS AND ADVERTISERS.

     LifeMinders depends on the Internet infrastructure to deliver attractive,
reliable and timely email newsletters to its members. If Internet usage grows,
the Internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it
by this growth, and its performance and reliability may decline. Among other
things, continued development of the Internet infrastructure will require a
reliable network backbone with necessary speed, data capacity and security.
Currently, there are regular failures of the Internet network infrastructure,
including outages and delays, and the frequency of these failures may increase
in the future. These failures may reduce the benefits of LifeMinders' products
and services to its members and undermine the company's advertising partners'
and members' confidence in the Internet as a viable commercial medium. In
addition, the Internet could lose its viability as a commercial medium due to
delays in the development or adoption of new technology required to accommodate
increased levels of Internet activity or due to government regulation.

LIFEMINDERS MAY HAVE TO LITIGATE TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER
PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OR TO DEFEND CLAIMS OF THIRD PARTIES, AND SUCH LITIGATION MAY
SUBJECT IT TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY AND EXPENSE.

     There is a substantial risk of litigation regarding intellectual property
rights in Internet-related businesses. Legal standards relating to the validity,
enforceability and scope of protection of certain proprietary rights in
Internet-related businesses are uncertain and still evolving. LifeMinders may
have to litigate in the future to enforce its intellectual property rights,
protect its trade secrets or defend itself against claims of violating the
proprietary rights of third parties. This litigation may subject LifeMinders to
significant liability for damages and result in invalidation of proprietary
rights. In addition, such litigation could be time-consuming and expensive to
defend, even if not meritorious, and result in the diversion of management time
and attention. Any of these factors could adversely affect LifeMinders' business
operations, financial results, condition and cash flows.

CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATION COULD DECREASE LIFEMINDERS' REVENUE AND
INCREASE ITS COSTS.

     Laws applicable to Internet communications, on-line privacy, digital
advertising, data protection and direct marketing are becoming more prevalent.
Any legislation enacted or regulation issued could dampen the growth and
acceptance of the digital marketing industry in general and of LifeMinders'
offerings in particular. Existing and proposed legislation in the United States,
Europe (following the directive of the European Union) and Canada may impose
limits on LifeMinders collection and use of certain kinds of information about
its members.

     Moreover, the laws governing the Internet remain largely unsettled, even in
areas where there has been some legislative action. It may take years to
determine whether, and how, existing laws such as those governing intellectual
property, data protection, libel and taxation apply to the Internet and Internet
advertising. In addition, the growth and development of Internet commerce may
prompt calls for more

stringent consumer protection laws, both in the United States and abroad, that
may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the
Internet.

CHANGES IN LAWS RELATING TO DATA COLLECTION AND USE PRACTICES AND THE PRIVACY OF
INTERNET USERS AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS COULD HARM LIFEMINDERS' BUSINESS.

     New limitations on the collection and use of information relating to
Internet users are currently being considered by legislatures and regulatory
agencies in the United States and internationally. LifeMinders is unable to
predict whether any particular proposal will pass, or the nature of the
limitations in those proposals that do pass. Since many of the proposals are in
their developmental stages, LifeMinders is unable to determine the impact these
may have on its business. In addition, it is possible that changes to existing
law, including new interpretations of existing law, could have a material and
adverse impact on LifeMinders' business, financial condition and results of
operations.

                        SPECIAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

     Cross Media and LifeMinders are sending you this joint proxy
statement/prospectus in order to provide you with important information
regarding the merger and for Cross Media stockholders, the amendment and
restatement of Cross Media's certificate of incorporation and the amendment to
Cross Media's 1998 Stock Option Plan and to solicit your proxy for use at the
special meetings and at any adjournments or postponements of the special
meetings. The special meetings are scheduled to be held at the times and places
described below.

CROSS MEDIA SPECIAL MEETING

     General.  The Cross Media special meeting is scheduled to be held on
[            ], 2001 at [            ] local time, at the American Stock
Exchange, 86 Trinity Place, 14th Floor, New York, New York 10006. At the Cross
Media special meeting, Cross Media stockholders will have the opportunity to
consider and vote upon the following:

     - the adoption of the amended and restated merger agreement;

     - the adoption of the amendment and restatement of Cross Media's
       certificate of incorporation including, among other things, increasing
       the number of shares of common stock that Cross Media has authority to
       issue from 100,000,000 to 150,000,000 shares;

     - the adoption of the amendment to Cross Media's 1998 Stock Option Plan to
       increase the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued
       under the plan from 8,000,000 to 14,000,000; and

     - any other matters properly brought before the Cross Media special
       meeting, including approval of any adjournment or postponement of the
       special meeting.

     THE CROSS MEDIA BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED THE AMENDED AND RESTATED
MERGER AGREEMENT, THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF CROSS MEDIA'S CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION AND THE AMENDMENT TO CROSS MEDIA'S 1998 STOCK OPTION PLAN, AND
RECOMMENDS THAT CROSS MEDIA STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" ADOPTION OF THE AMENDED AND
RESTATED MERGER AGREEMENT, THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF CROSS MEDIA'S
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND THE AMENDMENT TO CROSS MEDIA'S 1998 STOCK
OPTION PLAN.

     Record Date.  The Cross Media board of directors has fixed the close of
business on [            ], 2001, as the record date for the determination of
holders of shares of Cross Media common stock entitled to notice of and to vote
at the Cross Media special meeting.

     Stock Entitled to Vote.  As of [            ], 2001, there were
[            ] shares of Cross Media common stock issued and outstanding held by
approximately [            ] stockholders of record. Each holder of Cross Media
common stock as of the record date will have the right to one vote with respect
to the matters to be acted upon at the Cross Media special meeting for each
share registered in the holder's name on the books of Cross Media as of the
close of business on [            ], 2001.

     Quorum; Required Vote.  The presence, in person or by properly executed
proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Cross Media
common stock entitled to vote at the Cross Media special meeting is necessary to
constitute a quorum. Under Delaware law, the affirmative vote of the majority of
the shares outstanding and entitled to vote is required for adoption of the
amended and restated merger agreement and adoption of the amendment and
restatement of Cross Media's certificate of incorporation. The affirmative vote
of the holders of Cross Media common stock representing a majority of the shares
present in person or represented by proxy at the Cross Media special meeting and
entitled to vote on the proposal is required to adopt the amendment to Cross
Media's 1998 Stock Option Plan.

     The merger agreement requires Cross Media to have a sufficient number of
authorized but unissued shares to complete the merger. Accordingly, Cross Media
stockholders must adopt the amendment and restatement of Cross Media's
certificate of incorporation in order for Cross Media to consummate the merger.

     Stock Ownership.  As of [            ], 2001, the directors and executive
officers of Cross Media had the right to vote, in the aggregate, 36,533,328
shares of Cross Media common stock representing approximately 3.1% of the total
votes entitled to be cast at the Cross Media special meeting. Stockholders who
collectively have the power to vote 59.6% of Cross Media common stock have
agreed in writing to vote their shares at the Cross Media Special Meeting in
favor of the amended and restated merger agreement and the amendment and
restatement of Cross Media's certificate of incorporation.

     Voting and Revocation of Proxies.  All shares of Cross Media common stock
represented by a proxy properly signed and received at or prior to the Cross
Media special meeting, unless subsequently revoked, will be voted in accordance
with the instructions on the proxy. IF A PROXY IS SIGNED AND RETURNED WITHOUT
INDICATING ANY VOTING INSTRUCTIONS, THE SHARES OF CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK
REPRESENTED BY THE PROXY WILL BE VOTED "FOR" ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT,
THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF CROSS MEDIA'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND
THE AMENDMENT TO CROSS MEDIA'S 1998 STOCK OPTION PLAN. You may revoke your proxy
by giving written notice of revocation to Cross Media at any time before it is
voted, by submitting to Cross Media a duly executed, later-dated proxy or by
voting the shares subject to the proxy by written ballot at the Cross Media
special meeting. All written notices of revocation and other communications with
respect to revocation of Cross Media proxies should be addressed to: Cross Media
Marketing Corporation, 461 Fifth Avenue, 19th Floor, New York, New York 10017,
Attention: Jason Buerkle, Director of Financial Operations. Attendance at the
Cross Media special meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of
a proxy.

     The Cross Media board of directors is not aware of any business to be acted
upon at the Cross Media special meeting other than as described in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. If however, other matters are brought before the
Cross Media special meeting which are incident to the conduct of the Cross Media
special meeting, the persons appointed as proxies will have discretion to vote
or act on the matters according to their best judgment.

     If a stockholder's shares are held of record in "street name" by a broker,
bank or other nominee and the stockholder intends to vote the shares in person
at the Cross Media special meeting, the stockholder must bring to the meeting a
letter from the broker, bank or other nominee confirming the stockholder's
beneficial ownership of the shares to be voted.

     Abstentions and "broker non-votes," explained below, will be counted as
shares present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.
Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against the
amended and restated merger agreement, the amendment and restatement of Cross
Media's certificate of incorporation. Abstentions will have the effect of a vote
against adoption of the amendment to Cross Media's 1998 Stock Option Plan.
Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote to adopt the
amendment to Cross Media's 1998 Stock Option Plan. Similarly, the failure to
either return your proxy card or attend the Cross Media special meeting in
person and vote in favor of adoption of the amended and restated merger
agreement, the amendment and restatement to Cross Media's certificate of
incorporation will have the same effect as a vote against the proposals. Broker
non-votes are shares held in the name of a broker or nominee for which an
executed proxy is received, but which are not voted on the proposal because the
voting instructions have not been received from the beneficial owner or persons
entitled to vote and the broker or nominee does not have the discretionary power
to vote those shares.

     Solicitation of Proxies.  Proxies are being solicited on behalf of Cross
Media's board of directors. The solicitation of proxies may be made by
directors, officers and regular employees of Cross Media or its subsidiaries in
person or by mail, telephone, facsimile or telegraph without additional
compensation payable for that solicitation. Arrangements will be made with
brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward proxy
soliciting materials to the beneficial owners of Cross Media common stock held
of record by these persons, and Cross Media will reimburse them for reasonable
expenses incurred by them in so doing. The cost of the solicitation will be
borne by Cross Media.

     No Appraisal Rights.  Cross Media stockholders will not be entitled to
appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the merger. See "The
Merger -- No Appraisal Rights for Cross Media and LifeMinders Stockholders."

     Stockholder Proposals.  A stockholder proposal must be received by Cross
Media on or prior to January 9, 2002 at 461 Fifth Avenue, 19th Floor, New York,
New York 10017 in order to be eligible for inclusion in Cross Media's proxy
statement for its 2002 annual meeting of stockholders.

LIFEMINDERS SPECIAL MEETING

     General.  The LifeMinders special meeting is scheduled to be held on [ ],
2001, at [            ], located at [            ] at [            ], local
time. At the LifeMinders special meeting, LifeMinders stockholders will have the
opportunity to consider and vote upon the following items:

     - the adoption of the amended and restated merger agreement; and

     - any other matters properly brought before the LifeMinders special
       meeting, including approval of any adjournment or postponement of the
       special meeting.

     THE LIFEMINDERS BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED THE AMENDED AND RESTATED
MERGER AGREEMENT AND RECOMMENDS THAT LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE
ADOPTION OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED MERGER AGREEMENT.

     Record Date.  The LifeMinders board of directors has fixed the close of
business on [            ], 2001, as the LifeMinders record date for the
determination of holders of shares of LifeMinders common stock entitled to
notice of and to vote at the LifeMinders special meeting.

     Stock Entitled to Vote.  As of August 1, 2001, there were 26,625,463 shares
of LifeMinders common stock issued and outstanding, held by approximately 391
stockholders of record. Each holder of LifeMinders common stock as of the record
date will have the right to one vote with respect to the matters to be acted
upon at the LifeMinders special meeting for each share registered in the
holder's name on the stock records of LifeMinders as of the close of business on
[            ], 2001.

     Quorum.  The presence, in person or by properly executed proxy, of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of LifeMinders common stock
entitled to vote at the LifeMinders special meeting, is necessary to constitute
a quorum. The shares owned by stockholders present at the meeting or represented
by a properly executed proxy, but who abstain from voting on any proposal, will
be treated as shares that are present and entitled to vote at the LifeMinders
special meeting for determining whether or not a quorum exists, but will not be
counted as a vote cast in favor of any proposal.

     Required Vote.  Under Delaware law, the affirmative vote of the holders of
a majority of shares outstanding and entitled to vote is required for adoption
of the amended and restated merger agreement. Broker non-votes and abstentions
have the same effect as a vote against adoption of the amended and restated
merger agreement. LifeMinders' bylaws provide that the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of common stock present in person or by proxy at the
meeting is required to postpone or adjourn the LifeMinders special meeting.

     Stock Ownership.  As of [            ], 2001, the current directors and
executive officers of LifeMinders held the right to vote in the aggregate
approximately [          ] shares of LifeMinders common stock, representing
approximately [     ]% of the shares outstanding. Stockholders who collectively
have the power to vote [   ]% of LifeMinders common stock have agreed in writing
to vote their shares at the LifeMinders special meeting in favor of the merger
agreement.

     Voting and Revocation of Proxies.  All shares of LifeMinders common stock
represented by a proxy properly signed and received at or prior to the vote
being taken at the LifeMinders special meeting, unless

subsequently revoked, will be voted in accordance with the instructions on the
proxy. A proxy may be revoked by:

     - a written, dated document delivered to LifeMinders prior to the meeting
       stating that the proxy is revoked;

     - a subsequent proxy that is signed by the same person who signed the
       earlier proxy and is presented at or prior to the meeting; or

     - attendance at the LifeMinders special stockholders meeting and voting in
       person.

     If a stockholder's shares are held of record in "street name" by a broker,
bank or other nominee and the stockholder intends to vote the shares in person
at the LifeMinders special meeting, the stockholder must bring to the meeting a
letter from the broker, bank or other nominee confirming the stockholder's
beneficial ownership of the shares to be voted.

     LifeMinders is not currently aware of any business other than the proposal
to approve and adopt the merger agreement to be acted upon at the LifeMinders
special meeting. If, however, any other matters are properly brought before the
meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the persons named in the
enclosed form of proxy, and acting under that proxy, will have discretion to
vote or act on those matters in accordance with their best judgment, including
any proposal to adjourn the meeting (except that a proxy voted against adoption
and approval of the merger agreement will not be voted in favor of adjournment
of the meeting). Adjournments may be made for the purpose of, among other
things, soliciting additional proxies. Any adjournment may be made from time to
time by approval of the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes
present in person or by proxy at the meeting, whether or not a quorum exists,
without further notice other than by an announcement at the meeting. LifeMinders
does not currently intend to seek an adjournment of its meeting unless an
adjournment is necessary to solicit additional votes.

     You may abstain from voting on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
If you mark your proxy "ABSTAIN" with respect to the proposal, you will in
effect be voting against the merger. In addition, if you fail to send in your
proxy, this, too, will have the same negative effect. If your broker holds your
shares in its name, the broker cannot vote your shares on the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement without your instructions. This is a "broker non-vote." A
broker non-vote with respect to the proposal will have the effect of a vote
against the proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on
the outcome of any vote to postpone or adjourn the LifeMinders special meeting.

     Solicitation of Proxies.  Directors, officers and employees will not
receive additional compensation for their efforts during this solicitation, but
may be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
solicitation. After the original mailing of the proxies and other solicitation
materials, LifeMinders will request that brokers, custodians, nominees and other
record holders of LifeMinders common stock forward copies of the proxy and
solicitation materials to beneficial owners for whom they hold shares.
LifeMinders intends to reimburse these holders of record for reasonable expenses
incurred in forwarding these materials.

     No Appraisal Rights.  LifeMinders stockholders are not entitled to
appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the merger. See "The
Merger -- No Appraisal Rights for Cross Media and LifeMinders Stockholders."

     Stockholder Proposals.  LifeMinders expects that the merger will be
completed before its 2001 annual meeting and therefore, does not anticipate that
it will hold an annual meeting in 2001. In the event that the merger is not
completed and LifeMinders does continue to hold annual meetings, stockholder
proposals intended to be included in the proxy statement for the 2002
LifeMinders annual meeting should be sent to the Secretary of LifeMinders at
13530 Dulles Technology Drive, Suite 500, Herndon, Virginia 20171. Notice of any
stockholder proposal to be made at the 2002 LifeMinders annual meeting of
stockholders, if held, must be received on or prior to December 17, 2001.

                                   THE MERGER

     At their respective special meetings, Cross Media stockholders and
LifeMinders stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to
adopt the amended and restated merger agreement.

MATERIAL TERMS OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following is a brief summary of the material terms of the amended and
restated merger agreement. This summary is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the amended and restated merger agreement which is incorporated by
reference and attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. You
are urged to read the amended and restated merger agreement carefully.

     MERGER CONSIDERATION; ELECTION OF CONSIDERATION; NO FRACTIONAL AMOUNTS

     As a result of the merger, LifeMinders will be merged with and into Cross
Media, with Cross Media being the surviving company. Under the terms of the
amended and restated merger agreement, Cross Media will pay a total of $24
million in cash and issue approximately 22.3 million shares of its common stock,
assuming that no LifeMinders' stock options are exercised prior to the date on
which the merger is completed and that LifeMinders stockholders elect to receive
the maximum cash consideration. If LifeMinders stockholders do not elect to
receive the maximum cash consideration, then the number of shares of common
stock that Cross Media will issue in the merger will increase by an amount equal
to $24 million less the amount of the total cash consideration paid in the
merger, divided by $1.9845. The $1.9845 value of the Cross Media common stock
used for this purpose is based on the average last sale price of Cross Media
common stock for the 20 trading days immediately preceding July 18, 2001, the
date of the original merger agreement, and is not necessarily indicative of the
value of such stock. The aggregate value of the merger consideration will depend
upon the market price of Cross Media common stock on the date the merger is
completed. The aggregate merger consideration that Cross Media will pay to
LifeMinders securityholders will increase by an amount equal to the aggregate
exercise price of any LifeMinders options with an exercise price of $2.57 or
less, that are exercised before the merger is completed. The per share
consideration payable to LifeMinders stockholders will not affected by such
increase in the aggregate merger consideration.

     The aggregate merger consideration is subject to a reduction of up to $1.75
million to the extent that LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents are less
than $49 million at August 31, 2001, but no reduction will be made if
LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents on that date are at least $48.9
million. In the event of a reduction in the aggregate merger consideration
resulting from a cash shortfall, the cash portion of the merger consideration
will be reduced by an amount equal to approximately 33.3% of the reduction, and
the stock portion of the merger consideration will be reduced by approximately
the number of shares equal to 66.7% of the reduction divided by $1.9845. See
page [  ] for a definition of net cash and cash equivalents.

     Upon completion of the merger, each share of LifeMinders common stock will
be converted into cash, shares of Cross Media common stock, or a mix of cash and
Cross Media common stock. Under the merger agreement, each LifeMinders
stockholder will be able to elect to receive all cash, all stock or a prescribed
mix of approximately 33.3% cash and 66.7% stock, provided that in no event will
the aggregate cash consideration paid to the LifeMinders stockholders exceed the
aggregate maximum cash portion of the merger consideration. The aggregate
maximum cash portion of the merger consideration is $24 million, subject to the
following adjustments:

     - an increase of approximately 33.3% of the aggregate exercise price of any
       LifeMinders options with an exercise price of $2.57 or less that are
       exercised on a cash basis before the merger is completed; and/or

     - a decrease of approximately 33.3% of any reduction in the aggregate
       merger consideration resulting from a cash shortfall, if any.

In the event that the cash elections, including the cash portion to be received
by LifeMinders stockholders who elect the prescribed mix of cash and stock,
exceed the maximum aggregate cash portion of the merger consideration, the cash
portion to be paid to LifeMinders stockholders electing all cash will be reduced
and they will receive shares of Cross Media common stock, valued for this
purpose at $1.9845 per share (regardless of the actual market value of Cross
Media common stock at the time the merger is completed), for the balance. Any
LifeMinders stockholder who does not make an effective election prior to the
election deadline, and any LifeMinders stockholder who acquires shares of
LifeMinders common stock after the election deadline, will be deemed to have
elected to receive all Cross Media common stock.

     LifeMinders stockholders should complete and return the enclosed election
form in the enclosed envelope so that it is received by the close of business on
the date of the LifeMinders special meeting. In addition, prior to the close of
business on the date of the LifeMinders special meeting, each LifeMinders
stockholder must:

     - return his or her stock certificate, if the LifeMinders stockholder's
       shares are registered in the stockholder's name;

     - complete and return the guarantee of delivery included as part of the
       election form if the LifeMinders stockholder's shares are held in "street
       name;" or

     - complete and return a lost certificate affidavit which is included as
       part of the election form.

If a LifeMinders stockholder does not properly complete and return an election
form along with the applicable stock certificates, a guarantee of delivery for
the shares of LifeMinders common stock covered by the election form or a
completed lost certificate affidavit by the by the close of business on the date
of the LifeMinders special meeting, then that stockholder will receive only
Cross Media common stock as set forth above.

     No fractional shares of Cross Media common stock will be issued in the
merger. Any LifeMinders stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Cross Media common stock will instead receive cash in
accordance with the terms of the amended and restated merger agreement.

     You should carefully review Section 2.4 of the amended and restated merger
agreement attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

     PER SHARE CASH AND PER SHARE STOCK CONSIDERATION FOR LIFEMINDERS COMMON
STOCK

     Assuming there is no adjustment for a shortfall in LifeMinders' net cash
and cash equivalents at August 31, 2001, LifeMinders stockholders receive the
maximum cash consideration of $24 million and no options to purchase LifeMinders
common stock are exercised before the date on which the merger is completed,
Cross Media will issue approximately 22.3 million shares of its common stock to
LifeMinders stockholders in the merger. Based on these assumptions each share of
LifeMinders common stock will be converted into approximately:

     - $2.57 in cash for those LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive all
       cash, but if elections made by LifeMinders stockholders would require
       Cross Media to pay more than the aggregate maximum cash portion of the
       merger consideration, the amount of cash will be reduced, with the
       difference being paid in shares of Cross Media common stock, valued for
       this purpose at $1.9845 per share;

     - 1.29 shares of Cross Media common stock for those LifeMinders
       stockholders electing to receive all stock; or

     - $0.86 in cash and .86 shares of Cross Media common stock for those
       LifeMinder stockholders electing to receive the prescribed mix.

     If any options to purchase LifeMinders common stock with an exercise price
above $2.57 per share are exercised before the consummation of the merger, the
per share cash and per share stock consideration that LifeMinders stockholders
will receive will be reduced because the number of shares of LifeMinders' common
stock outstanding at the time the merger is completed will increase.

     The value of the Cross Media common stock being issued in the merger will
depend on the market price on the date on which the merger is completed. The
value of the per share merger consideration was determined based on a market
price of Cross Media common stock of $1.9845 per share, which was the average
last sale price of Cross Media common stock for the 20 trading days immediately
preceding the date of the original merger agreement. The value of the per share
consideration to be received by LifeMinders stockholders who elect to receive
all or a portion of the merger consideration in shares of Cross Media common
stock cannot currently be determined. The per share cash consideration is based
on a fixed exchange ratio and will not vary if the market price of the Cross
Media common stock changes. Therefore, the value of the per share merger
consideration that LifeMinders stockholders receive in the merger will likely
vary among LifeMinders stockholders depending on which form of merger
consideration that a LifeMinders stockholder elects to receive.

     Assuming that there is no cash shortfall and that no LifeMinders stock
options are exercised prior to the date on which the merger is completed, and
using the per share price of $[  ], the closing price of Cross Media common
stock as of [            ], 2001, the last practicable date prior to the
printing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus:

     - the value of the per share merger consideration that a LifeMinders
       stockholder who elects to receive only Cross Media common stock would
       receive would be $[  ];

     - the value of the per share merger consideration that a LifeMinders
       stockholder electing to receive the prescribed mix would be $[  ]; and

     - LifeMinders stockholders who receive all cash in the merger would be paid
       $2.57 per share of LifeMinders common stock.

     LifeMinders stockholders are urged to obtain a current market quotation for
Cross Media common stock prior to electing the form of merger consideration they
will receive in the merger.

     You should carefully review Section 2.4 of the amended and restated merger
agreement attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

     THE AGGREGATE CONSIDERATION THAT LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE IN
THE MERGER WILL BE REDUCED IF LIFEMINDERS' NET CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT
AUGUST 31, 2001 ARE LESS THAN $48.9 MILLION

     The merger agreement provides that the aggregate nominal merger
consideration that LifeMinders stockholders will receive in the merger is
subject to a reduction of up to $1.75 million to the extent that LifeMinders'
net cash and cash equivalents, as defined below, are less than $49 million at
August 31, 2001, but no reduction will be made if LifeMinders' net cash and cash
equivalents on that date are at least equal to $48.9 million. In the event of a
reduction in the aggregate merger consideration resulting from a cash shortfall,
the cash portion of the merger consideration will be reduced by an amount equal
to approximately 33.3% of the reduction, and the stock portion of the merger
consideration will be reduced by approximately that number of shares equal to
66.7% of the reduction divided by $1.9845. Accordingly, the amount of cash
and/or the number of shares that a LifeMinders stockholder will receive as
consideration for its LifeMinders' shares will be reduced if LifeMinders' net
cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2001 are less than $48.9 million. See
"The Merger -- Material Terms of the Amended and Restated Merger
Agreement -- Merger Consideration; Election of Consideration; No Fractional
Amounts." You should carefully review Section 2.4 of the amended and restated
merger agreement attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

     LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents includes its:

     - cash, excluding restricted cash and cash received from option exercises
       after July 18, 2001;

     - marketable securities, including accrued interest income; and

     - selected accounts receivable and prepaid accounts; and

     are reduced by LifeMinders':

     - accounts payable;

     - accrued expenses;

     - certain severance payments;

     - additional payoffs for certain liabilities; and

     - a reasonable estimate of LifeMinders' expenses incurred in connection
       with the merger between September 1, 2001 and the date on which the
       merger is completed.

     TREATMENT OF LIFEMINDERS STOCK OPTIONS

     Under the merger agreement, each outstanding option to purchase LifeMinders
common stock issued under the LifeMinders option plans, whether or not vested or
immediately exercisable, will be assumed by Cross Media, through Cross Media's
assumption of the plans. Upon the completion of the merger, each LifeMinders
stock option will be automatically adjusted to provide that:

     - the number of shares of Cross Media common stock which will be issued
       upon the exercise of the LifeMinders stock option will be that number of
       shares of LifeMinders common stock which would have been issued upon
       exercise of the LifeMinders stock option immediately before the
       completion of the merger multiplied by the per share exchange ratio for
       LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive only Cross Media common
       stock of approximately 1.29, rounded down to the nearest whole share; and

     - the exercise price per share of Cross Media common stock under the
       LifeMinders stock option will be an amount equal to the exercise price
       per share of LifeMinders common stock under the LifeMinders stock option
       immediately before the completion of the merger, divided by the per share
       exchange ratio for LifeMinders stockholders electing to receive only
       Cross Media common stock of approximately 1.29; provided, that if the
       above formula results in an aggregate exercise price that requires the
       payment of a fraction of a cent at the time of exercise, with the
       exercise price considered in the aggregate for all options being
       exercised by each holder, then the aggregate exercise price for the
       shares shall be further adjusted upwards to the nearest whole cent.

     There are outstanding options to purchase approximately 2.2 million shares
of LifeMinders common stock with an exercise price equal to or below $2.57 per
share, and options to purchase approximately 942,990 shares of LifeMinders
common stock with an exercise price above $2.57 per share.

     In March 2001, LifeMinders granted options to its executive officers and a
small number of employees. These option grants provide that vesting of these
options will accelerate upon certain events, including the merger. If the merger
is completed, options to purchase approximately 1.5 million shares of
LifeMinders common stock will vest at the effective time of the merger. If the
merger is not completed, these options may still vest on an accelerated schedule
if LifeMinders completes:

     - an alternative merger; or

     - an event of liquidation.

     The options will vest at the effective time of either event.

     In addition, if the employment of a holder of a March 2001 option grant is
involuntarily terminated without cause, as that term is described in the option
grant, prior to the effective date of an alternative merger or liquidation
event, the vesting of his or her options will accelerate to the time of such
termination.

     LifeMinders will amend the LifeMinders Employee Stock Purchase Plan to
provide that upon consummation of the merger:

     - no additional purchase rights will be issued under the LifeMinders
       Employee Stock Purchase Plan; and

     - each purchase right granted under LifeMinders Employee Stock Purchase
       Plan will terminate, if it has not previously terminated by its terms.

     IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MERGER, LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS WILL OWN A MINIMUM
OF APPROXIMATELY 36.8% OF THE OUTSTANDING CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK

     Assuming there is no reduction in the merger consideration for a cash
shortfall, LifeMinders stockholders elect to receive the maximum cash portion of
the merger consideration and no options to purchase LifeMinders common stock
with an exercise price equal to or below $2.57 per share are exercised before
the date on which the merger is completed, Cross Media will issue in the merger
approximately 22.3 million shares of Cross Media common stock to LifeMinders
stockholders. Assuming none of the options to purchase approximately 2.2 million
shares of LifeMinders common stock with an exercise price equal to or below
$2.57 per share are exercised before the merger, Cross Media will issue options
to purchase approximately 2.9 million shares of Cross Media common stock in
exchange for such options to purchase LifeMinders common stock. Assuming that
the issuance of approximately 1.7 million shares of Cross Media common stock to
The Shaar Fund, Ltd. upon the conversion of half of its shares of Cross Media
Series A convertible preferred stock in accordance with the Series A agreement
described on page [  ], the issuance of approximately 22.3 million shares of
Cross Media common stock in the merger and none of the Cross Media options,
warrants and other equity rights are exercised or converted, the shares of Cross
Media common stock issued to LifeMinders stockholders in the merger will
constitute approximately 36.8% of the common stock of Cross Media after the
merger. If all of the options to purchase approximately 2.9 million shares of
Cross Media common stock which may be issued in the merger, as described above,
are exercised, based on the assumptions set forth in the previous sentence,
after the merger, LifeMinders stockholders will own approximately 39.7% of the
common stock of Cross Media.

     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     The merger agreement contains statements and promises made by Cross Media
about itself called representations and warranties. In addition, the merger
agreement contains representations and warranties made by LifeMinders. You can
review the representations and warranties contained in Articles III and IV of
the merger amended and restated agreement attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex A.

     CONDUCT OF BUSINESS PENDING THE MERGER

     The merger agreement contains covenants and agreements that govern Cross
Media's and LifeMinders' actions until the merger is completed or the merger
agreement is terminated. These covenants and agreements require each of Cross
Media and LifeMinders to take actions or to refrain from taking actions with
respect to various matters, including that:

     - unless consented to in writing by the other party, Cross Media,
       LifeMinders and their respective subsidiaries will not take any action,
       except in the ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent with
       the business plans disclosed to the other party; and

     - Cross Media, LifeMinders and their respective subsidiaries will use their
       best efforts to preserve substantially intact their existing businesses
       and business organizations, to keep available the services of those of
       their present officers, employees and consultants who are integral to the
       operation of their businesses as presently conducted and to preserve
       their present relationships with

       significant customers and suppliers and with other persons with whom they
       have significant business relations.

     The merger agreement also lists specific actions that Cross Media and
LifeMinders are restricted from taking or must take, from the time the merger
agreement was signed until the merger is consummated or the merger agreement is
terminated, and each in effect agree to operate their respective companies in
substantially the same manner as the respective company was operating prior to
the signing of the merger agreement. A complete list of these actions is set
forth in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the merger agreement, and include, among other
things, the following:

     - neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders may amend its certificate of
       incorporation or bylaws, except Cross Media may amend its certificate of
       incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Cross Media
       common stock from 100,000,000 shares to 150,000,000, and clarify the
       indemnification provisions of its certificate of incorporation as
       described on page [  ];

     - neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders may enter into any contract with
       provisions or obligations that would require actions or omissions that
       are inconsistent with the provisions of the merger agreement;

     - neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders may take any action, other than those
       set forth in the merger agreement, that would cause the shares of the
       respective company to cease to be quoted or listed on the exchange or
       quotation system on which such shares were quoted at the time the merger
       agreement was signed;

     - neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders may take any action that would
       prevent the merger from qualifying as a tax-free reorganization under
       Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code;

     - neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders may participate in the sale of all or
       substantially all of its assets or any merger, other than as permitted in
       the merger agreement;

     - neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders may acquire the business or bulk
       assets of any person, except Cross Media may acquire the business or any
       bulk assets of any person for an amount not to exceed $1 million
       individually or in the aggregate;

     - neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders may issue, sell, transfer, pledge,
       hypothecate or otherwise encumber or dispose of any shares of its capital
       stock or any shares of capital stock or other securities of any of its
       subsidiaries; except that Cross Media or LifeMinders may issue shares of
       capital stock pursuant to equity rights outstanding on August 20, 2001;
       and, subject to LifeMinders' consent, which consent shall not be
       unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, Cross Media may issue and
       sell up to 1.0 million shares of its unregistered common stock at a per
       share price which is not less than 75% of the closing price for a share
       of Cross Media common stock on the American Stock Exchange on the
       business day immediately prior to the date on which Cross Media requests
       LifeMinders' consent;

     - neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders will acquire any shares of its
       capital stock or other securities, except Cross Media may purchase shares
       of its stock pursuant to the terms of its Series A purchase agreement;
       and

     - neither Cross Media nor LifeMinders will incur any material indebtedness,
       except Cross Media may incur, in addition to the indebtedness outstanding
       on August 20, 2001, additional indebtedness of up to $2 million.

     To review all of the covenants contained in the merger agreement, you
should read Articles V and VI of the merger agreement which is attached to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

     NO SOLICITATION

     LifeMinders has agreed that neither it nor its employees, subsidiaries or
advisors will, directly or indirectly through another person:

     - solicit, initiate, encourage or induce the making, submission or
       announcement of any "Alternative Transaction" (as described below);

     - furnish any non-public information to any person in connection with, or
       participate in any negotiations with respect to, or knowingly take any
       other action designed to facilitate, any Alternative Transaction; or

     - participate in any discussions regarding any Alternative Transaction.

     However, this prohibition will not apply if at any time prior to receiving
the approval of LifeMinders stockholders, the board of directors of LifeMinders
determines in good faith, after receipt of advice from outside counsel, that the
failure to provide information or participate in negotiations or discussions
would likely be inconsistent with LifeMinders' board of directors' fiduciary
duties to LifeMinders stockholders under applicable law. In that case and
subject to restrictions set forth in the merger agreement, LifeMinders may, in
response to a "Superior Proposal" (as described below), furnish information with
respect to it and its subsidiaries to any person pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement and participate in negotiations regarding the
proposal. LifeMinders will promptly notify Cross Media orally and in writing of
any request for information or of any proposal in connection with an Alternative
Transaction, its material terms and conditions and the identity of the person
making the request or proposal and will keep Cross Media reasonably informed of
the status and details of the request or proposal on a current basis.

     For purposes of the merger agreement, an "Alternative Transaction" means a
proposal, intended proposal, signed agreement or completed action for any of the
following:

     - a transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any third party
       acquires or would acquire beneficial ownership of more than 20% of the
       outstanding shares of LifeMinders common stock;

     - any acquisition or proposed acquisition of, or business combination with,
       LifeMinders, or any of its subsidiaries;

     - any other transaction pursuant to which any third party acquires or would
       acquire, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the assets of LifeMinders
       or any of its subsidiaries; or

     - the grant of any license to use LifeMinders' intellectual property, other
       than licenses in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
       practice.

     A "Superior Proposal" means any proposal made by a third party to enter
into an Alternative Transaction which LifeMinders' board of directors determines
in its good faith judgment (based on, among other things, the advice of a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable to
LifeMinders stockholders than the merger, taking into account all relevant
factors.

     The merger agreement does not prohibit LifeMinders from:

     - taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a
       tender offer required by law; or

     - making any disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good faith judgment
       of the LifeMinders board of directors, after receipt of advice from
       outside counsel, failure to make disclosure would likely be inconsistent
       with LifeMinders' board of directors' fiduciary duties to LifeMinders
       stockholders under applicable law.

     STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS

     Cross Media and LifeMinders have agreed to hold meetings of their
stockholders to consider and vote on the adoption of the merger agreement and,
for Cross Media, the adoption of the amendment and

restatement of Cross Media's certificate of incorporation promptly after the SEC
declares this joint proxy statement/prospectus effective. The Cross Media board
of directors has recommended adoption of the amended and restated merger
agreement and adoption of the amendment and restatement of its certificate of
incorporation and the LifeMinders board of directors has recommended adoption of
the merger agreement. LifeMinders has agreed that its board of directors will
not:

     - except as discussed below, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify or
       propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
       adverse to Cross Media, its recommendation of adoption of the merger
       agreement;

     - approve or recommend or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
       Alternative Transaction; or

     - cause LifeMinders to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
       principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to
       any Alternative Transaction.

     However, if the LifeMinders' board of directors receives a Superior
Proposal and determines in good faith that the failure to do so would likely be
inconsistent with LifeMinders' board of directors' fiduciary duties to
LifeMinders stockholders under applicable law, the LifeMinders board of
directors may inform its stockholders that it no longer recommends adoption of
the merger agreement. LifeMinders' board of directors may do this at a time that
is after the fifth business day following notice to Cross Media, and after
giving a reasonable opportunity to Cross Media to make adjustments in the terms
and conditions of the merger agreement.

     INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

     In the merger agreement, Cross Media agreed to continue to indemnify
directors and officers of LifeMinders and its subsidiaries, for a period of
three years following the completion of the merger, to the extent and in
accordance with the provisions for indemnification and advancement of fees and
expenses contained in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of LifeMinders
in effect on August 20, 2001 to the extent arising out of any action or omission
occurring at any time before the completion of the merger and made in his or her
capacity as a director or officer of LifeMinders or its subsidiaries. This
indemnification obligation is in addition to any obligation Cross Media will
have under Sections 145 and 259 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

     For a period of six years following the completion of the merger, Cross
Media has agreed to maintain in effect, to the extent available, directors' and
officers' liability insurance covering directors and officers of LifeMinders and
its subsidiaries who were covered by LifeMinders' directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy on terms no less favorable to those covered as those
applicable under the policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance
maintained by LifeMinders on August 20, 2001.

     Each person seeking indemnification is subject to and must adhere to the
limitations, procedures and guidelines set forth in the merger agreement. To
review all of the limitations, procedures and guidelines related to the
provisions of indemnification and insurance coverage, you should read Section
5.5 of the merger agreement attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Annex A.

       the merger agreement, and Shortfall Adjustment, as defined in Section 2.4
       of the merger agreement, pursuant to the merger agreement will have been
       calculated based upon financial information provided to Cross Media which
       was true, correct and complete in all material respects; and to the
       extent the calculations included estimated amounts, the estimates will
       have been made in good faith based upon reasonable assumptions.

     To review all of the conditions contained in the merger agreement, you
should read Article VII of the amended and restated merger agreement, which is
attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

     CLOSING DATE AND EFFECTIVE TIME

     The closing of the merger will take place as soon as practicable after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to closing stated in the merger
agreement at the offices of legal counsel for Cross Media in New York City
unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Cross Media and
LifeMinders. Immediately following the closing of the merger, the parties will
file a certificate of merger with the State of Delaware. The merger will take
effect at the time this filing is made with the State of Delaware.

     TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     At any time before the closing of the merger, Cross Media and LifeMinders
may terminate the merger agreement by mutual consent in writing. In addition,
either Cross Media or LifeMinders may terminate the merger agreement for any of
the following reasons:

     - LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2001 have not
       been finally determined by November 30, 2001;

     - the merger has not been completed by December 31, 2001, or a later date
       agreed upon by the parties;

     - any of the required approvals of stockholders of Cross Media or
       LifeMinders have not been obtained at a duly held meeting, including any
       adjournments thereof; or

     - if a court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental entity shall
       have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, in any
       case having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
       prohibiting the merger, which order, decree, ruling or other action is
       final and nonappealable.

     In addition, the merger agreement may be terminated by Cross Media if:

     - LifeMinders breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of
       its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained
       in the merger agreement whereby the conditions to Cross Media
       consummating the merger would not be satisfied, which breach or failure
       to perform is not, or cannot be, cured within 20 calendar days after
       written notice thereof;

     - a condition to Cross Media consummating the merger cannot be satisfied
       prior to December 31, 2001, or a later date agreed upon by the parties;

     - LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2001 are less
       than $47.25 million; Cross Media's failure to give written notice to
       LifeMinders within 10 days after the Shortfall is determined will
       constitute a waiver of its right to terminate the merger agreement under
       this provision; or

     - the board of directors of LifeMinders or any committee of the board of
       directors of LifeMinders:

        - fails to include in the joint proxy statement/prospectus its
          recommendation without modification or qualification that the
          LifeMinders stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the
          transactions contemplated thereby;

        - withdraws or adversely modifies its recommendation to the LifeMinders
          stockholders that they adopt the merger agreement and approve the
          transactions contemplated thereby;

        - fails to reaffirm its recommendation upon Cross Media's request;

        - approves or recommends any Alternative Transaction, as described on
          page [  ];

        - fails, within 10 business days of the commencement of a tender or
          exchange offer, to recommend to the LifeMinders stockholders and, if
          applicable, holders of LifeMinders equity rights, as defined in the
          merger agreement, that they reject the tender or exchange offer; or

        - resolves to take any of the foregoing actions.

     Further, the merger agreement may be terminated by LifeMinders if:

     - Cross Media breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of
       its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained
       in the merger agreement whereby the conditions to LifeMinders
       consummating the merger would not be satisfied, which breach or failure
       to perform is not, or cannot be, cured within 20 calendar days after
       written notice thereof;

     - if a condition to LifeMinders consummating the merger cannot be satisfied
       prior to December 31, 2001, or a later date agreed upon by the parties;

     - if the board of directors of LifeMinders determines in good faith, after
       receipt of advice from outside counsel, that the failure to terminate the
       merger agreement would likely be inconsistent with LifeMinders' board of
       directors' fiduciary duties to LifeMinders stockholders under applicable
       law with respect to a Superior Proposal; or

     - the volume weighted average closing price for Cross Media common stock
       over any 10 consecutive trading days prior to the closing date is less
       than $1.0915 and LifeMinders notifies Cross Media

       within 10 calendar days after the date on which the volume weighted
       average closing price for Cross Media common stock over a 10 consecutive
       trading day period first falls below $1.0915; LifeMinders failure to give
       this notice will constitute a waiver of its right to terminate the merger
       agreement under this provision.

     TERMINATION FEES

     The merger agreement requires LifeMinders to pay to Cross Media a cash
termination fee of $2.8 million in the event the merger agreement is terminated
for any of the following reasons:

     - LifeMinders terminates the merger agreement because its board of
       directors determines in good faith, after receipt of advice from outside
       counsel, that the failure to terminate the merger agreement would likely
       be inconsistent with LifeMinders' board of directors' fiduciary duties to
       LifeMinders' stockholders under applicable law with respect to a Superior
       Proposal;

     - Cross Media terminates the merger agreement because the board of
       directors of LifeMinders or any committee of the board of directors of
       LifeMinders:

        - fails to include in the joint proxy statement/prospectus its
          recommendation without modification or qualification that the
          LifeMinders stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the
          transactions contemplated thereby;

        - withdraws or adversely modifies its recommendation to the LifeMinders
          stockholders that they adopt the merger agreement and approve the
          transactions contemplated thereby;

        - fails to reaffirm its recommendation upon Cross Media's request;

        - approves or recommends any Alternative Transaction;

        - fails, within 10 business days of the commencement of a tender or
          exchange offer, to recommend to the LifeMinders stockholders and, if
          applicable, holders of LifeMinders equity rights, as defined in the
          merger agreement, that they reject the tender or exchange offer; or

        - resolves to take any of the foregoing actions; or

        - if the merger agreement could not have been terminated by Cross Media
          as a result of LifeMinders board of directors failure to recommend
          (without modification or qualification), or withdrawal of its
          recommendation of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement to
          its stockholders, but the merger agreement is subsequently terminated
          by Cross Media or LifeMinders as the result of the failure to obtain
          LifeMinders stockholder approval, and prior to the LifeMinders
          stockholders meeting, another party proposes an Alternative
          Transaction, and within twelve months after the termination of the
          merger agreement, LifeMinders or its stockholders consummate an
          Alternative Transaction.

     In the event that there is a dispute as to whether the termination fee is
payable under the terms of the merger agreement, the prevailing party is
entitled to receive costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees, in
connection with any action relating to the dispute.

     EXPENSES

     Cross Media and LifeMinders will each pay its own costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the related transactions.
However, if the merger is not consummated, Cross Media and LifeMinders will
share equally the expenses incurred in connection with the printing of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and the related filing fees.

     PROCEDURES FOR LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS TO RECEIVE PAYMENT

     Cross Media and LifeMinders have jointly selected, [          ], to act as
the "exchange agent" under the merger agreement. Within 15 business days after
the merger is completed, the exchange agent

will issue to LifeMinders stockholders who have returned their completed
election forms together with LifeMinders stock certificates, guaranty of
delivery or proof of lost certificate, the cash and/or shares of Cross Media
common stock to which each stockholder is entitled. Within 15 business days
after the merger is completed, the exchange agent will send to LifeMinders
stockholders who did not timely send in their stock certificates (or guaranty of
delivery or affidavit of lost stock certificates) and effective election forms,
a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging their stock
certificates. Cross Media shall also make appropriate provisions with the
exchange agent to enable LifeMinders stockholders to obtain the letter of
transmittal and instructions for exchanging their stock certificates from, and
to deliver the certificates formerly representing shares of LifeMinders common
stock to, the exchange agent in person, commencing on or not later than 15
business days following the completion of the merger. Within 10 business days
after receiving a LifeMinders stockholder's stock certificate(s) together with a
completed letter of transmittal, the exchange agent will issue the Cross Media
common stock to which that stockholder is entitled.

     Upon the effectiveness of the merger, each outstanding LifeMinders stock
certificate will be deemed to evidence the right to receive the number of shares
of Cross Media common stock and/or the cash into which the shares of LifeMinders
common stock have been converted in accordance with the merger agreement. The
shares of Cross Media common stock and/or cash will not be paid to the record
holder of any LifeMinders common stock until the certificate therefor is sent to
the exchange agent. A LifeMinders stockholder whose certificate(s) have been
lost or destroyed may nevertheless receive shares of Cross Media common stock
and/or cash to which that LifeMinders stockholder is entitled, provided that the
LifeMinders stockholder first delivers to Cross Media or to the exchange agent
his or her election form indicating that his or her stock certificate(s) have
been lost, stolen or destroyed. In addition, the LifeMinders stockholder will
have to sign an affidavit that is included in the election form that provides,
among other things, that the LifeMinders stockholder agrees to indemnify Cross
Media and the exchange agent for any loss Cross Media may incur as a result of
the LifeMinders stockholder's lost or destroyed stock certificate(s). The
LifeMinders stockholder may also be required to provide an indemnity bond from
an insurance company protecting Cross Media and the exchange agent from any
damage which may result if someone presents the lost certificate for payment of
the merger consideration.

     BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT OF CROSS MEDIA UPON CONSUMMATION OF THE
MERGER

     When the merger is complete, Cross Media will continue to be managed by its
current directors and officers. In addition, Jonathan Bulkeley, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of LifeMinders, and Douglas A. Lindgren, a director of
LifeMinders, will be appointed as directors of Cross Media upon completion of
the merger for a term expiring at the annual meeting of Cross Media stockholders
to be held in 2002. The Cross Media board of directors will nominate Messrs.
Bulkeley and Lindgren for election as directors for one-year terms at the annual
meeting of Cross Media stockholders to be held in 2002. Mr. Bulkeley will serve
on the executive committee and the compensation committee of Cross Media's board
of directors so long as he is a member of the Cross Media board of directors.
Mr. Lindgren will serve as a member of the audit committee of Cross Media's
board of directors so long as he is a member of the Cross Media board. In
addition, if Mr. Bulkeley is no longer a Cross Media director, Mr. Lindgren will
serve as a member of the executive committee so long as he is a member of the
Cross Media board of directors.

     HIRING OF LIFEMINDERS' EMPLOYEES

     Cross Media has notified those LifeMinders employees whom it intends to
employ as of the completion of the merger. The merger is not conditioned upon
any LifeMinders' employees accepting employment with Cross Media.

     LISTING OF CROSS MEDIA COMMON STOCK ON THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE

     Cross Media will cause the shares of Cross Media common stock to be issued
in connection with the merger to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     Since before its initial public offering in 1999, LifeMinders has
considered or sought out potential acquirers or merger partners, considering
both opportunities to expand and grow the LifeMinders business through
acquisitions and attractive opportunities to be acquired. In June 1999,
LifeMinders engaged Thomas Weisel Partners to assist it in identifying and
evaluating potential merger and acquisition candidates. Although LifeMinders
contacted or engaged in discussions with a number of these potential partners,
none of these discussions resulted in a proposal to merge with or acquire
LifeMinders. The engagement of Thomas Weisel Partners terminated in June 2000,
with certain obligations on the part of LifeMinders regarding compensation
continuing for an additional ten months beyond that date.

     In January 2001, recognizing that the market for online advertising
revenues had changed significantly, the LifeMinders board of directors decided
to streamline its business to focus on the core direct marketing business.
LifeMinders reduced expenses significantly, and laid off approximately 24% of
its employees. During the first quarter of 2001, LifeMinders' revenue base
continued to deteriorate, and the LifeMinders board of directors determined that
its prospects for growth and profitability as a stand-alone company were not
strong. Although the LifeMinders board of directors had previously been open to
merger or acquisition proposals, at this time, its board directed LifeMinders'
management to solicit and evaluate possible business combinations, or a sale of
all or a portion of the assets of LifeMinders.

     In early May of this year, at a special meeting of the LifeMinders board of
directors, LifeMinders' management and Thomas Weisel Partners reported to the
LifeMinders' board of directors regarding activities related to a possible
merger, acquisition or sale of LifeMinders over the past several months. Thomas
Weisel Partners made a presentation to the LifeMinders board of directors about
its efforts to locate and evaluate potential acquirers and merger partners for
LifeMinders. Thomas Weisel Partners and outside legal counsel discussed with the
LifeMinders board of directors a number of possible strategies, including the
liquidation of LifeMinders. LifeMinders' management and LifeMinders' outside
advisors discussed with the board six specific merger and acquisition
opportunities that were being investigated. Over the next several weeks, at the
direction of the board of directors, LifeMinders' management continued to
evaluate these six merger and acquisition proposals, but ultimately was not able
to recommend that any of these proposals should be pursued further.

     At a board meeting held on June 4, 2001, Cross Media's board of directors
discussed an offer that had been made to merge Cross Media with MyPoints.com,
Inc. Cross Media's offer had been rejected by MyPoints the previous weekend in
favor of an offer from a subsidiary of United Airlines. Cross Media's board of
directors instructed Cross Media's management to identify other potential
acquisition candidates. Subsequently, Cross Media's management began
conversations with Robertson Stephens, who recommended consideration of
LifeMinders.

     Representatives of Robertson Stephens contacted LifeMinders on behalf of
Cross Media to propose Cross Media as a possible merger partner for LifeMinders.
Introductory telephone calls were held and preliminary information about the two
companies was exchanged. On June 7, 2001, representatives of LifeMinders and
Cross Media executed a mutual nondisclosure agreement.

     At the direction of the LifeMinders board of directors, LifeMinders'
management also continued to solicit other merger, acquisition and asset sale
proposals in an effort to negotiate the best possible transaction for
LifeMinders stockholders. In early June of this year, LifeMinders entered into a
letter of intent and term sheet with an individual representing an investment
group seeking to purchase substantially all of LifeMinders' operating assets.
The terms of this offer allowed LifeMinders to continue to solicit and negotiate
other offers to purchase it or its assets, but gave the offeror the exclusive
right to consummate the purchase under the terms offered in the letter of intent
until June 19, 2001.

     During the first few weeks of June, a number of meetings were held among
senior executives of Cross Media and LifeMinders, and their outside advisors.
Information was exchanged between the companies and due diligence meetings and
investigations continued. Cross Media presented LifeMinders with a proposed
letter of intent and preliminary terms of a proposed merger transaction.

     The LifeMinders board of directors met on June 18, 2001, to consider the
status of its efforts to negotiate an acceptable merger or acquisition proposal
or a sale of all or substantially all of its assets. The terms of the Cross
Media proposal were discussed in detail, including the proposed price, the
cash/stock election, the proposed board of directors of the combined company and
the terms of the non-solicitation covenants. The proposal by the investment fund
to purchase substantially all of the operating assets of LifeMinders also was
discussed. The LifeMinders board of directors considered and compared the Cross
Media proposal to the investment fund proposal, which was an all cash offer
subject to financing. The LifeMinders board of directors considered, among other
factors, the possible upside opportunities for LifeMinders stockholders in the
Cross Media stock proposal compared with the investment group's all cash offer.
Following a full discussion of both proposals, the LifeMinders board of
directors authorized management to pursue a definitive agreement with the
investment group subject to the investment group providing an assurance of
adequate financing. The LifeMinders board of directors also authorized
management to continue discussions with, and conduct a due diligence review of,
Cross Media in the event that the investment group did not obtain adequate
financing.

     The investment group continued to conduct its due diligence review of
LifeMinders and numerous discussions were held among employees and
representatives of LifeMinders and the investment group during this period.
However, the investment group was unable to give LifeMinders assurances that its
offer would be fully financed. Accordingly, LifeMinders did not enter into a
definitive agreement with the investment group by the June 19, 2001, date in the
letter of intent, and the investment group's exclusive right to consummate the
purchase of LifeMinders' assets under the terms of the letter of intent lapsed.

     In late June, Robertson Stephens, on behalf of Cross Media, delivered to
LifeMinders a revised draft letter of intent and term sheet. Negotiations
regarding the proposed letter of intent and term sheet continued between
representatives of Cross Media and LifeMinders. On June 21, 2001, Cross Media
and LifeMinders executed a letter of intent and term sheet. The letter of intent
provided, among other terms, that LifeMinders and Cross Media would in good
faith use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate and execute a definitive
agreement by July 18, 2001, and that LifeMinders could not solicit, facilitate
or negotiate other offers for LifeMinders or its assets until July 18, 2001 (or
an earlier date as mutually agreed by the parties). The letter of intent also
contemplated that a meeting would be held between certain LifeMinders' board
members and senior management of Cross Media on June 26, 2001. LifeMinders was
given the right following that meeting, in its sole discretion, to decide not to
proceed with the proposed transaction, provided it so notified Cross Media that
the letter of intent was terminated by noon on June 27, 2001.

     Pursuant to the letter of intent, on June 26, 2001, a meeting was held
among certain members of LifeMinders' senior management and board of directors,
and senior management of Cross Media. Cross Media presented its business plan to
the LifeMinders' board members, discussed the terms of proposed transaction and
the integration of the two companies and responded to questions posed by the
LifeMinders board members. About this time, LifeMinders also received an
unsolicited further proposal from the investment group that was seeking to
purchase substantially all of the operating assets of LifeMinders. In accordance
with the terms of its letter of intent with Cross Media, LifeMinders responded
to that group, advising it that it was subject to a non-solicitation agreement
and could not engage in any discussions with the investment group.

     On June 26, 2001, the LifeMinders board of directors held a special meeting
to consider the results of the board members' due diligence visit to Cross
Media. The LifeMinders board members reported on that meeting. After a full
discussion of the meeting and the proposed terms of a transaction with Cross
Media, the LifeMinders board of directors decided that additional information
would be required before the board could decide whether to terminate the letter
of intent. Management of LifeMinders also discussed with the LifeMinders board
of directors the revised proposal received from the investment group. The
LifeMinders board of directors discussed the proposed terms of the revised
proposal and concluded that the Cross Media proposal appeared to be more
attractive, from an economic point of view.

     On June 27, 2001, Cross Media and LifeMinders amended the letter of intent
to, among other things, extend the date by which the LifeMinders' board of
directors could terminate the letter of intent until 5:00 p.m. on June 29, 2001.
Due diligence meetings continued between LifeMinders and Cross Media and their
respective advisors.

     A special meeting of the LifeMinders board of directors was held on June
29, 2001 to, among other things, discuss the terms of a proposed transaction
with Cross Media and the results of its due diligence. After a full discussion
of the proposed transaction, the LifeMinders board of directors decided not to
terminate the letter of intent with Cross Media, but also decided that certain
remaining due diligence questions needed to be answered before the LifeMinders
board of directors would authorize signing a definitive agreement. The
LifeMinders board of directors also authorized the retention of Legg Mason Wood
Walker, Incorporated as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed
transaction.

     During this period, members of senior management of Cross Media and
LifeMinders, and their outside legal advisors, held numerous conference calls
and meetings to discuss the terms of the proposed merger of the two companies,
including the form of consideration. LifeMinders negotiated a revised
consideration in the transaction that provided LifeMinders stockholders with an
opportunity to obtain cash for all or a portion of their LifeMinders' shares,
and Cross Media agreed that LifeMinders could designate two individuals for
appointment to the Cross Media board of directors, including representation on
the compensation and audit committees. Several revised drafts of a proposed
merger agreement were exchanged, and further due diligence investigations were
conducted.

     On July 12 and July 13, 2001, the LifeMinders board of directors held two
more special meetings to review the status of the proposed transaction with
Cross Media. LifeMinders' management and outside counsel reviewed the principal
terms of the merger agreement, including, among other things, the structure of
the transaction as a direct merger between LifeMinders and Cross Media, the
cash/stock election, the exchange ratio, the representations and warranties of
the parties, indemnification of LifeMinders directors and officers, the
covenants under which LifeMinders and Cross Media would be required to operate
their businesses prior to the closing of the merger and conditions to closing of
the merger. They also discussed termination rights of the parties under the
merger agreement including a provision that would allow LifeMinders to consider
and respond to future unsolicited proposals if the LifeMinders board of
directors made a finding that it was required to do so to comply with its
fiduciary duties to its stockholders and a provision that would require
LifeMinders to pay to Cross Media a $2.8 million termination fee if the merger
agreement were to be terminated under certain circumstances. Legg Mason gave the
board its preliminary assessment of the merger consideration being offered to
the LifeMinders stockholders by Cross Media. The LifeMinders board of directors
authorized management to continue to negotiate with Cross Media towards a
definitive merger agreement.

     On July 17, 2001, at a meeting of Cross Media's board of directors held to
consider and vote upon the original proposed merger agreement and related
agreements, Robertson Stephens delivered to Cross Media's board of directors its
oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of July 17, 2001, and
based on the matters considered and the limitations on the review undertaken
described in the written opinion, the merger consideration, comprised of up to
$12.1 million in cash and the balance payable in shares of Cross Media common
stock valued at $1.9845 per share, was fair, from a financial point of view, to
Cross Media. Mr. Altbach and Mr. Kaufman discussed the status of the
negotiations with LifeMinders, the outstanding issues regarding the merger and
the comments and questions raised by the directors. Cross Media's board of
directors approved the transaction.

     Following the continued satisfactory progress toward resolution of
outstanding issues between LifeMinders and Cross Media, on July 17, 2001, the
LifeMinders board of directors met to review and approve the original terms of
the merger with Cross Media. LifeMinders' management and outside counsel updated
the LifeMinders board of directors on the results of the parties' further
negotiations and reviewed with the board of directors the terms of the merger
agreement. Management reported on due diligence matters. Legg Mason discussed
the financial performance of LifeMinders and Cross Media, and presented an
analysis of comparable public companies, an analysis of comparable merger and
acquisition transactions

and a liquidation analysis of LifeMinders. Legg Mason delivered its oral opinion
to the LifeMinders board of directors that, as of that date, and subject to a
number of assumptions, qualifications and limitations, the original merger
consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
LifeMinders common stock. Following these discussions, the LifeMinders board of
directors unanimously determined that, subject to satisfactory resolution of
certain remaining issues with Cross Media, the proposed merger was advisable,
fair to, and in the best interests of LifeMinders and its stockholders and
approved the terms of the original merger agreement and authorized its Chief
Executive Officer to execute, on behalf of LifeMinders, the original merger
agreement subject to any non-material changes. In a conference call between
representatives of LifeMinders and Cross Media following the board of directors
meeting, all remaining issues were resolved. On July 18, 2001, counsel to
LifeMinders and Cross Media completed negotiations on the remaining terms of the
original merger agreement.

     In the early evening on July 18, 2001, Cross Media and LifeMinders signed
the original merger agreement. The transaction was publicly announced on the
morning of July 19, 2001, and a conference call was held later that day to
discuss the material terms of the merger.

     During the period between July 18, 2001 and August 19, 2001,
representatives of Cross Media and LifeMinders conducted numerous meetings
regarding operational matters.

     On or about August 10, 2001, members of senior management of LifeMinders
and Cross Media began to discuss revising the terms of the merger agreement to
increase the total amount of cash available for payment to LifeMinders
stockholders in the merger from $12.1 million to $24 million, and increase the
stock exchange ratio from approximately 1.23 to 1.29 shares of Cross Media
common stock for each share of LifeMinders common stock exchanged for Cross
Media stock in the merger, while simultaneously decreasing the number of Cross
Media shares issuable in the merger by up to 4 million, reducing dilution by up
to approximately 13%. As part of these discussions, representatives of Cross
Media and LifeMinders determined that it would be mutually advantageous to
obtain voting agreements in support of the revised merger terms.

     On August 10 and August 13, 2001, the LifeMinders board of directors held
two special meetings to review the proposed revisions to the terms of the
merger. The LifeMinders board discussed with outside counsel its fiduciary
obligations to LifeMinders stockholders and its obligations under the merger
agreement with respect to potential third party proposals regarding a possible
merger or acquisition transaction involving LifeMinders. During the period
between August 10 and August 19, 2001, members of senior management of Cross
Media and LifeMinders and their outside legal counsel held numerous conference
calls and meetings to discuss the proposed revised terms of the amended and
restated merger agreement.

     On August 15, 2001, at a meeting of Cross Media's board of directors held
to consider and vote upon the revisions to the terms of the merger agreement and
related agreements, Robertson Stephens delivered to Cross Media's board of
directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of
August 15, 2001, and based on the matters considered and the limitations on the
review undertaken described in the written opinion attached as Annex C to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, the revised merger consideration, comprised of
up to $24 million in cash and 24.2 million shares of Cross Media common stock
(with per share amounts calculated under the treasury stock method), provided
that the number of shares of Cross Media common stock may be increased to the
extent that the stockholders of LifeMinders elect to receive less than the
maximum cash consideration, was fair, from a financial point of view, to Cross
Media. Mr. Altbach and Mr. Kaufman discussed the status of the negotiations with
LifeMinders, the outstanding issues regarding the merger and the comments and
questions raised by Cross Media's directors. Cross Media's board of directors
approved the terms of the amended and restated merger agreement at the August
15, 2001 meeting.

     On August 19, 2001, the LifeMinders board of directors met to review and
approve the proposed revised terms of the merger. LifeMinders' management and
outside counsel updated the LifeMinders board on the results of the parties'
further negotiations and reviewed with the board the terms of the amended and
restated merger agreement. Legg Mason discussed the financial performance of
LifeMinders

and Cross Media, and presented an analysis of comparable public companies, an
analysis of comparable merger and acquisition transactions and a liquidation
analysis of LifeMinders. Legg Mason delivered its oral opinion to the
LifeMinders board that, as of that date, and subject to a number of assumptions,
qualifications and limitations which are set forth in its written opinion the
revised merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of LifeMinders common stock. This oral opinion was later confirmed in
writing and a copy of the written opinion is attached to this joint proxy
statement/ prospectus as Annex D. Following these discussions, the LifeMinders
board of directors approved the terms of the amended and restated merger
agreement and authorized its Chief Executive Officer to execute, on behalf of
LifeMinders, the amended and restated merger agreement subject to any non-
material changes. In conference calls between representatives of LifeMinders and
Cross Media on August 20, 2001, all remaining issues were resolved. In the
evening of August 20, 2001, Cross Media and LifeMinders signed the amended and
restated merger agreement. The revised transaction was publicly announced on
August 21, 2001.

     Since the date of the original merger agreement, LifeMinders has received
correspondence from unrelated third parties regarding a possible merger or
acquisition transaction involving LifeMinders, or a proposal to acquire
substantially all of its assets. LifeMinders may receive other similar
communications before the Cross Media merger is consummated. The LifeMinders
board of directors intends to give appropriate consideration to such
communications, consistent with the directors' fiduciary obligations to all
LifeMinders stockholders and LifeMinders' obligations under the amended and
restated merger agreement.

     The boards of directors of both Cross Media and LifeMinders have approved
the amended and restated merger agreement and recommend that their respective
stockholders adopt the amended and restated merger agreement.

     CROSS MEDIA'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     Cross Media's board of directors has determined that the terms of the
merger agreement and the merger are in the best interests of Cross Media and its
stockholders. In arriving at its determination, the Cross Media board of
directors consulted with Cross Media's management, as well as its legal counsel,
accountants and financial advisors, and gave significant consideration to a
number of factors bearing on its decision. The following were the material
factors that were considered by the Cross Media board of directors:

     - Cross Media seeks to grow both internally and through the acquisition of
       complementary businesses. LifeMinders, which has an extensive consumer
       database and personalization capabilities, will complement Cross Media's
       proven marketing skills in both traditional and online direct marketing
       channels;

     - The belief that Cross Media will obtain access to LifeMinders' 20 million
       member database as a result of the merger, and that this access will
       enable it to reduce customer acquisition costs and increase margins by
       targeting offers to LifeMinders highly profiled members;

     - The belief that LifeMinders' strong balance sheet will significantly
       strengthen the financial position of Cross Media;

     - The belief that LifeMinders' significant net cash will provide funding to
       continue Cross Media's strategy of internal growth and growth through the
       acquisition of complementary businesses;

     - The belief that, while no assurance could be given, Cross Media could
       improve the operating results of LifeMinders;

     - The belief that the cost of the merger in financial terms represents a
       reasonable investment by Cross Media in furthering its business strategy;

     - The belief that, while no assurances can be given, it was likely that the
       merger would be completed and that the business and financial benefits
       contemplated in connection with the merger are likely to be achieved
       within a reasonable time frame;

     - The structure of the merger and the terms of the merger agreement,
       including the fact that the exchange ratio provides reasonable certainty
       as to the amount of cash to be paid and the number of shares of Cross
       Media common stock to be issued in the merger; and

     - The opinion of Robertson Stephens, Inc. to Cross Media's board of
       directors that, as of August 15, 2001, and based on and subject to the
       considerations set forth in the written opinion, the consideration
       offered in connection with the amended and restated merger agreement was
       fair, from a financial point of view, to Cross Media.

     Cross Media does not intend this discussion of the information and factors
considered by the Cross Media board of directors to be exhaustive, although this
discussion does include all material factors considered by the Cross Media board
of directors. In reaching its determination to approve and recommend the amended
and restated merger agreement to the Cross Media stockholders for adoption, the
Cross Media board of directors did not assign any relative or specific weights
to the factors considered, and individual directors of Cross Media might have
weighed factors differently.

     LIFEMINDERS' REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     At a meeting of LifeMinders' board of directors held on July 18, 2001, the
board of directors voted to enter into the original merger agreement with Cross
Media. At that time, the board of directors unanimously concluded that the
original merger agreement and the merger were advisable, fair to, and in the
best interests of LifeMinders and its stockholders, and voted to recommend to
LifeMinders stockholders that the merger agreement be adopted. On August 10,
2001, LifeMinders board of directors began to renegotiate the terms of the
original merger agreement because of changed market conditions. On August 19,
2001, LifeMinders board of directors approved the amended and restated merger
agreement and voted to recommend to the LifeMinders stockholders that the
amended and restated merger agreement be adopted. This decision was taken after
the board of directors consulted with LifeMinders' management, legal counsel and
financial advisors, and was based on the board of directors' belief that the
potential benefits of the merger, taken as a whole, made the possibility of the
success of the combined companies a more attractive option for LifeMinders
stockholders than LifeMinders continuing to operate as an independent business,
combining with another business, or liquidating and dissolving. These potential
benefits included:

     - The combination of LifeMinders' proprietary technology, expertise in
       online direct marketing, large membership base and substantial assets,
       including a significant cash balance after the merger, with Cross Media's
       established direct marketing operations would create a company with
       significantly better prospects for success than LifeMinders had as a
       stand-alone business;

     - The combined company's expected continuation of LifeMinders' primary
       business objective of becoming a leading online direct marketing company
       which would provide LifeMinders stockholders with a potential opportunity
       to participate in and benefit from the accomplishment of that objective;

     - The complementary nature of each company's product offering and the
       synergistic business that is expected to be created by combining the
       LifeMinders' proprietary member-targeted technology and databases
       containing member specific information with the well-developed direct
       marketing capabilities of Cross Media; and

     - The opportunity for LifeMinders stockholders to receive a favorable
       return on their investment in LifeMinders stock while allowing
       stockholders who wish to continue ownership interest or delay the
       taxation of gain on their stock to do so through electing to receive
       Cross Media common stock instead of cash.

     In evaluating the proposed merger with Cross Media, LifeMinders' board of
directors considered a number of factors, including the following:

     - Historical information concerning Cross Media's and LifeMinders'
       respective businesses, financial performance and condition, operations,
       technology and management, including reports for each company filed with
       the SEC;

     - LifeMinders' management's view of the financial condition, results of
       operations and businesses of LifeMinders and Cross Media before and after
       giving effect to the merger;

     - LifeMinders' management's assessment of the effect of the merger on the
       stockholders of LifeMinders;

     - Current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
       volatility and trading information;

     - The consideration LifeMinders stockholders would receive in the merger in
       light of other acquisition proposals and the value that could be
       distributed to LifeMinders stockholders in a liquidation;

     - The ownership of the combined company by LifeMinders stockholders;

     - The opinion of Legg Mason that, as of the date of its opinion and subject
       to the limitations and considerations described in the opinion, the
       consideration was fair to the holders of the outstanding shares of
       LifeMinders common stock, and the financial presentations made by Legg
       Mason to the board of directors of LifeMinders in connection with the
       delivery of its opinion;

     - The belief that the terms of the merger agreement are reasonable;

     - The impact of the merger on LifeMinders' customers and employees;

     - Reports from management, legal, and financial advisors as to the results
       of LifeMinders' due diligence investigation of Cross Media; and

     - The expectations that the merger would be treated as tax-free
       reorganization for federal income tax purposes for LifeMinders, Cross
       Media and LifeMinders stockholders (except for tax resulting from any
       cash received for shares and fractional shares by the holders of
       LifeMinders common stock).

     LifeMinders' board of directors also identified and considered a number of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger
including the following:

     - The risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized;

     - The risk that downward movement in the market price of Cross Media common
       stock would make the stock component of the consideration payable in
       connection with the merger less valuable;

     - The risk that the merger consideration would be reduced by up to $1.75
       million if LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2001
       are less than $48.9 million;

     - The risk that the merger may not be consummated;

     - The risk that Cross Media and LifeMinders would not be able to integrate
       their products, technologies and organizations;

     - The potential effect of the termination fee in deterring other potential
       acquirors from proposing an alternative transaction that might be more
       advantageous to LifeMinders stockholders; and

     - Other applicable risks that are described in this joint proxy
       statement/prospectus under "Risk Factors."

     The LifeMinders board of directors concluded, however, that on balance the
potential benefits of the merger to LifeMinders and its stockholders outweighed
the risks associated with the merger.

     The discussion of the information and factors considered by the LifeMinders
board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive. In view of the variety and
complexity of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the
merger, the LifeMinders board of directors did not find it practicable to, and
did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to, the specific factors
listed above that included discussions with LifeMinders' senior management and
its legal and financial advisers. Individual members of the LifeMinders board of
directors may have given different weight to different factors.

     There can be no assurance that the potential synergies, opportunities or
other benefits considered by the LifeMinders board of directors will be achieved
by completing the merger. See "Risk Factors" beginning on page [  ].

     The board of directors of LifeMinders unanimously recommends that
LifeMinders stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the amended and restated
merger agreement.

OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS

     OPINION OF ROBERTSON STEPHENS

     Under a letter agreement dated July 2, 2001, Cross Media engaged Robertson
Stephens to act as its financial advisor in connection with a possible
acquisition of, or business combination involving, LifeMinders, and to render an
opinion to Cross Media's board of directors as to the fairness of the
transaction, from a financial point of view, to Cross Media.

     On August 15, 2001, at a meeting of the Cross Media board held to consider
and vote upon the proposed amended and restated merger agreement and related
agreements, Robertson Stephens delivered to Cross Media's board of directors its
oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of August 15, 2001,
and based on the matters considered and the limitations on the review undertaken
described in the written opinion, the value of the merger consideration as of
the date thereof, comprised of up to $24 million in cash and 24.2 million shares
of Cross Media common stock, provided that the number of shares of Cross Media
common stock may be increased to the extent that the stockholders of LifeMinders
elect to receive reduced cash consideration, was fair, from a financial point of
view, to Cross Media. Robertson Stephens has consented to the use of its opinion
in this proxy statement and the full text of this opinion is reprinted as Annex
C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. No limitations were imposed by Cross
Media's board on Robertson Stephens with respect to the investigations made or
procedures followed by it in furnishing its opinion.

     You should consider the following when reading the discussion of the
opinion of Cross Media's financial advisor in this document:

     - We urge you to read carefully the entire opinion of Robertson Stephens,
       which is set forth in Annex C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus
       and is incorporated by reference.

     - The following description of the opinion of Robertson Stephens is
       qualified by reference to the full opinion located in Annex C to this
       joint proxy statement/prospectus. The full opinion sets forth, among
       other things, the assumptions made by Robertson Stephens, the matters it
       considered and the limitations on the review undertaken.

     - The Robertson Stephens opinion was prepared for the benefit and use of
       the Cross Media board in its consideration of the merger and does not
       constitute a recommendation to stockholders of Cross Media as to how they
       should vote at the special meeting or take any other action in connection
       with the merger.

     - The Robertson Stephens opinion was necessarily based upon market,
       economic and other conditions as in effect on, and information made
       available to Robertson Stephens as of, the date of the opinion. You
       should understand that subsequent developments may affect the conclusion
       expressed in the Robertson Stephens opinion and that Robertson Stephens
       disclaims any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any
       change in any matter affecting its opinion which may come or be brought
       to Robertson Stephens' attention after the date of its opinion.

     - The Robertson Stephens opinion was limited to the fairness, from a
       financial point of view and as of the date thereof, of the merger
       consideration to Cross Media.

     Opinion and Analysis of Robertson Stephens.  In connection with the
preparation of the Robertson Stephens opinion, Robertson Stephens:

     - reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other
       business and financial information of LifeMinders and Cross Media;

     - reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and
       operating data, including certain financial forecasts and other forward
       looking information, concerning Cross Media and LifeMinders;

     - held discussions with the managements of LifeMinders and Cross Media
       concerning the businesses, past and current operations, financial
       condition and future prospects of both LifeMinders and Cross Media,
       independently and combined;

     - reviewed the financial terms and conditions set forth in the draft of the
       Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger of August 13, 2001 and
       drafts of the Voting Agreements;

     - reviewed the stock price and trading history of LifeMinders common stock
       and Cross Media common stock;

     - compared the financial performance of LifeMinders and the prices and
       trading activity of LifeMinders common stock with that of certain other
       publicly traded companies comparable to LifeMinders;

     - compared the financial terms of the merger with the financial terms, to
       the extent publicly available, of other transactions that Robertson
       Stephens deemed relevant;

     - participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of
       LifeMinders and Cross Media and their legal advisors; and

     - made other studies and inquiries, and reviewed other data, as Robertson
       Stephens deemed relevant.

     In its review and analysis, and in arriving at its opinion, Robertson
Stephens assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial and other information provided to it, including information furnished
to it orally or otherwise discussed with it by the managements of LifeMinders
and Cross Media, or publicly available and neither attempted to verify, nor
assumed responsibility for verifying, any of this information. Robertson
Stephens relied upon the assurances of the respective managements of LifeMinders
and Cross Media that they were not aware of any facts that would make the
information inaccurate or misleading. Furthermore, Robertson Stephens did not
obtain or make, or assume any responsibility for obtaining or making, any
independent evaluation or appraisal of the properties, assets or liabilities,
contingent or otherwise, of LifeMinders, nor was it furnished with any
evaluation or appraisal. With respect to the financial forecasts and
projections, and the assumptions and bases therefor, for Cross Media and
LifeMinders that Robertson Stephens reviewed, Robertson Stephens assumed that
the forecasts and projections:

     - were reasonably prepared in good faith on the basis of reasonable
       assumptions;

     - reflect the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
       managements of Cross Media and LifeMinders, respectively; and

     - will be realized in the amounts and in the time periods currently
       estimated.

     Robertson Stephens assumed that the merger would be consummated upon the
terms set forth in the draft Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger
of August 13, 2001 without material alteration. In addition, Robertson Stephens
assumed that the historical financial statements of LifeMinders reviewed by it
were prepared and fairly presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied.

     Robertson Stephens expressed no opinion as to:

     - the value of any employee agreement or other arrangement entered into in
       connection with the proposed merger; or

     - any tax or other consequences that might result from the merger.

     Robertson Stephens' opinion does not address the relative merits of the
merger or any other business strategy that Cross Media's board of directors has
considered or may be considering, nor does it address the decision of Cross
Media's board of directors to proceed with the merger. Robertson Stephens'
opinion does not address any legal or accounting matters, as to which it
understands that Cross Media obtained such advice, as it deemed necessary, from
qualified professionals. Robertson Stephens relied as to all legal matters
relevant to rendering its opinion on the advice of its own counsel.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by
Robertson Stephens in connection with rendering its opinion. The summary of the
financial analyses is not a complete description of all of the analyses
performed by Robertson Stephens. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND BETTER THE FINANCIAL
ANALYSES PERFORMED BY ROBERTSON STEPHENS, THE TABLES MUST BE READ TOGETHER WITH
THE ACCOMPANYING TEXT. ROBERTSON STEPHENS' OPINION IS BASED ON THE TOTALITY OF
THE VARIOUS ANALYSES THAT IT PERFORMED, AND NO PARTICULAR PORTION OF THE
ANALYSIS HAS ANY MERIT STANDING ALONE.

     Comparable Company Analysis.  Using publicly available information,
Robertson Stephens analyzed, among other things, the trading multiples of
LifeMinders and the following publicly-traded companies in the Internet
advertising and marketing industry which it believed to be reasonably comparable
to LifeMinders:

     - ClickAction Inc.

     - Digital Impact, Inc.

     - DoubleClick Inc.

     - Engage, Inc.

     - L90, Inc.

     - ValueClick, Inc.

     Revenues.  As set forth in the following table, applying a range of total
capitalization multiples for these companies for calendar years 2000 and 2001 to
corresponding revenue data for LifeMinders resulted in the following range of
implied equity values. Robertson Stephens defined total capitalization as the
equity market capitalization plus funded debt and capital lease obligations less
cash and cash equivalents. If total capitalization was a negative value, then no
multiple was assigned.

                                                               IMPLIED LIFEMINDERS EQUITY VALUE
CALENDAR YEAR                                MULTIPLE RANGE            ($ IN MILLIONS)
- -------------                                --------------    --------------------------------

2000.......................................   0.3x - 0.7x            $65.2 - $86.7
2001.......................................   0.8x - 0.8x            $52.3 - $57.8
                                                                  Mean: $58.7 - $72.3

     Precedent Transaction Analysis.  Robertson Stephens analyzed the aggregate
value and implied transaction value multiples paid or proposed to be paid in
selected precedent transactions in the Internet advertising and marketing, and
related Internet services segments, including:

     - Mediaplex, Inc./ValueClick, Inc. -- July 2, 2001

     - MyPoints.com, Inc./United NewVentures -- June 4, 2001

     - MessageMedia, Inc./DoubleClick Inc. -- June 1 ,2001

     - Exactis.com (of 24/7 Media, Inc.)/Direct Marketing Technologies, Inc. (of
       Experian Information Solutions, Inc.) -- May 18, 2001

     - Uproar Inc./Vivendi Universal -- February 6, 2001

     - NetCreations, Inc./SEAT Pagine Gialle S.p.A. -- December 21, 2000

     Robertson Stephens compared, among other things, the aggregate value in
these transactions as a multiple of the latest 12 months' revenues and the
projected next 12 months' revenues. Applying these multiples to similar revenue
figures for LifeMinders resulted in the range of implied equity values listed
below. In addition, the 1-day and 1-month premium analyses resulted in the
following range of implied equity values.

                                              MULTIPLE OR     IMPLIED LIFEMINDERS EQUITY VALUE
                                             PREMIUM RANGE             (IN MILLIONS)
                                             -------------    --------------------------------

Latest twelve months revenue...............  0.3x - 1.0x            $59.7 - $84.6
Next twelve months revenue.................  0.4x - 1.2x            $52 - $ 57.9
                                                                 Mean: $55.8 - $71.2
1-day premium..............................   40% - 80%             $69.9 - $89.9
1-month premium............................   30% - 60%             $54.0 - $66.5
                                                                 Mean: $62.0 - $78.2

     Liquid Assets Analysis.  Robertson Stephens compared, among other things,
the liquid assets ratio, computed as the equity market capitalization divided by
cash and cash equivalents less funded debt and capital lease obligations, for
the selected publicly traded companies in the Internet advertising and marketing
industry listed above. As set forth in the following table, applying a range of
equity market capitalization to liquid assets ratios to the corresponding liquid
assets data for LifeMinders resulted in the following range of implied equity
values. In addition, Robertson Stephens compared the premium of equity
consideration paid or proposed to be paid in selected precedent transactions in
the Internet advertising and marketing, and related Internet services segments
as listed above to the projected liquid assets at estimated closing of the
target company for each transaction. As set forth in the following table,
applying a range of premiums to the corresponding liquid assets data for
LifeMinders resulted in the following range of implied equity values.

                                              MULTIPLE OR     IMPLIED LIFEMINDERS EQUITY VALUE
                                             PREMIUM RANGE             (IN MILLIONS)
                                             -------------    --------------------------------

Market capitalization/liquid assets........  1.1x - 2.0x            $53.9 - $78.4
Premium to target liquid assets............   10% - 60%             $53.9 - $78.4
                                                                 Mean: $53.9 - $78.4

     Other Factors.  No company, transaction or business used in the comparable
company analysis, the selected precedent transaction analysis or the liquid
assets analysis as a comparison is identical to LifeMinders or the proposed
merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing is not entirely
mathematical; rather it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors and
trends that could affect the acquisition, public trading and other values of the
comparable companies or the business segment, company or transactions to which
they are compared. In addition, while the foregoing summary describes the
analyses and factors that Robertson Stephens deemed material in its presentation
to Cross Media's board of directors, it is not a comprehensive description of
all analysis and factors considered by Robertson Stephens.

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process that involves
various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analysis and to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness
opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.
In arriving at its opinion, Robertson Stephens did not attribute any particular
weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made qualitative
judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor.
Accordingly, Robertson Stephens believes that its analyses must be considered as
a

whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors considered
by it, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying its opinion. Several
analytical methodologies were employed and no one method of analysis should be
regarded as critical to the overall conclusion reached by Robertson Stephens.
Each analytical technique has inherent strengths and weaknesses, and the nature
of the available information may further affect the value of particular
techniques. The conclusion reached by Robertson Stephens is based on all
analyses and factors taken as a whole and also on application of Robertson
Stephens' own experience and judgment. This conclusion may involve significant
elements of subjective judgment and qualitative analysis. Robertson Stephens
therefore gives no opinion as to the value or merit standing alone of any one or
more parts of the analysis it performed. In performing its analyses, Robertson
Stephens made numerous assumptions with respect to anticipated industry
performance, general business and other conditions and matters, and present
industry and transaction trends, many of which are beyond the control of Cross
Media or Robertson Stephens, and their likely impact on the future performance
of Cross Media. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or predicative of future results or values, which
may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by these
analyses. Accordingly, analyses relating to the value of businesses do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which these businesses
actually may be sold in the future, and these estimates are inherently subject
to uncertainty.

     Cross Media engaged Robertson Stephens under a letter agreement dated July
2, 2001. The agreement provides that, for its services, contingent upon closing
of the merger, Robertson Stephens is entitled to receive a transaction fee of
$1.5 million. If the merger is not completed and Cross Media receives a
termination fee from LifeMinders, Robertson Stephens will receive a fee of
$500,000, provided that this amount does not exceed 50% of any cash or other
compensation payable to Cross Media by LifeMinders after payment of Cross
Media's expenses incurred in connection with the merger. Cross Media has also
agreed to indemnify and hold harmless Robertson Stephens and its affiliates and
any other person, director, employee or agent of Robertson Stephens or any of
its affiliates, or any person controlling Robertson Stephens or its affiliates,
for certain losses, claims, damages, expenses and liabilities relating to or
arising out of services provided by Robertson Stephens as financial advisor to
Cross Media.

     The terms of the fee arrangement with Robertson Stephens, which Cross Media
and Robertson Stephens believe are customary in transactions of this nature,
were negotiated at arm's length between Cross Media and Robertson Stephens, and
the Cross Media board of directors was aware of these fee arrangements.
Robertson Stephens was retained based on Robertson Stephens' experience as a
financial advisor in connection with mergers and acquisitions and in securities
valuations generally, as well as Robertson Stephens' investment banking
relationship and familiarity with Cross Media.

     In the ordinary course of business, Robertson Stephens may actively trade
securities of Cross Media or LifeMinders for its own account and for the account
of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position
in the securities of either company. Robertson Stephens has served as a co-
manager for a follow-on public equity offering for LifeMinders, and received
customary fees for such services.

     Robertson Stephens is an internationally recognized investment banking
firm. As part of its investment banking business, Robertson Stephens is
frequently engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary
distributions of securities, private placements and other purposes.

     OPINION OF LEGG MASON WOOD WALKER, INCORPORATED

     The board of directors of LifeMinders engaged Legg Mason Wood Walker,
Incorporated, referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Legg
Mason, to act as its financial advisor and evaluate the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of LifeMinders common stock of the
merger consideration provided for in the merger. On July 17, 2001, at a meeting
of the board of directors of LifeMinders held to evaluate the merger, Legg Mason
rendered to the LifeMinders board of directors an

oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated July
18, 2001, the date of the original merger agreement, to the effect that, as of
that date and based on and subject to the matters described in its opinion, the
merger consideration provided for in the merger agreement was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of LifeMinders common stock. On August
19, 2001, at a meeting of the board of directors of LifeMinders held to evaluate
the revised terms of the merger, Legg Mason rendered to the LifeMinders board of
directors an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion, to the effect that, as of that date, and based on and subject
to the matters described in its opinion, the merger consideration provided for
in the amended and restated merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of LifeMinders common stock. As of that date, the merger
consideration, as set forth in the amended and restated merger agreement was
comprised of a maximum allocation of $24 million in cash consideration and 24.2
million shares of Cross Media common stock with a market value on that date of
$1.45 per share.

     The full text of Legg Mason's written opinion, dated August 19, 2001, to
the LifeMinders board of directors, which sets forth, among other things, the
procedures followed, assumptions made and matters considered, is attached as
Annex D and is incorporated into this document by reference. Holders of
LifeMinders common stock are urged to, and should, read this opinion carefully
and in its entirety. The following description of Legg Mason's opinion is only a
summary and is qualified in its entirety by the written opinion.

     Legg Mason directed its opinion to the board of directors of LifeMinders.
The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the stockholders of
LifeMinders as to how they should vote at the LifeMinders special meeting. The
opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
merger consideration as of the date of the opinion. It does not address the
relative merits of the merger or any alternatives to the merger. Further, it
does not address the business decision of the LifeMinders board of directors to
proceed with or consummate the merger.

     In connection with its opinion, Legg Mason, among other things:

     - reviewed publicly available financial statements and other business and
       financial information of LifeMinders and Cross Media, respectively;

     - reviewed internal financial statements and other financial and operating
       data, including liquidation analyses, financial forecasts and other
       forward-looking information, concerning LifeMinders prepared by the
       management of LifeMinders;

     - held discussions with the respective managements of LifeMinders and Cross
       Media concerning the businesses, past and current operations, financial
       condition and future prospects of both LifeMinders and Cross Media;

     - reviewed the financial terms and conditions set forth in a draft of the
       amended and restated merger agreement dated August 17, 2001;

     - reviewed the stock price and trading history of LifeMinders common stock
       and Cross Media common stock;

     - compared the financial performance of LifeMinders and the prices and
       trading activity of LifeMinders common stock with that of certain other
       comparable publicly traded companies and their securities;

     - reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of
       certain comparable acquisition transactions; and

     - performed other analyses and considered such other factors as Legg Mason
       deemed appropriate.

     In connection with its review, Legg Mason did not assume any responsibility
to verify independently the accuracy or completeness of the information supplied
or otherwise made available by LifeMinders for the purposes of its opinion,
including the liquidation analysis supplied by LifeMinders. Legg Mason further
relied upon the assurances of the management of LifeMinders that they were not
aware of any facts that

would make that information inaccurate or misleading. In addition, Legg Mason
assumed that the forecasts and projections provided to them by LifeMinders
represented the best currently available estimates and judgments of LifeMinders'
respective management as to the future financial conditions and results of
operations of LifeMinders and assumed that the forecasts and projections were
reasonably prepared based on the best currently available estimates and
judgments. Legg Mason assumed no responsibility for and expressed no view as to
the forecasts and projections or the assumptions on which they were based.

     Legg Mason's opinion was necessarily based upon economic, market,
financial, and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated as of the
date of its opinion; and Legg Mason assumed no responsibility to update or
revise its opinion based upon events or circumstances occurring after the date
of its opinion. Legg Mason was not requested to consider, and its opinion does
not in any manner address, the prices at which LifeMinders' or Cross Media's
common stock would trade following either the announcement or consummation of
the merger. Although Legg Mason evaluated the consideration in the merger from a
financial point of view, Legg Mason was not requested to, and did not, conduct a
process seeking third party indications of interest in the possible acquisition
of all or any part of LifeMinders. No other limitations were imposed by
LifeMinders' board of directors on Legg Mason with respect to the investigations
made or procedures followed in rendering its opinion.

     In preparing its opinion to the LifeMinders board of directors, Legg Mason
performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses. The following summary
of the material financial analyses performed by Legg Mason in connection with
providing its opinion to the LifeMinders board of directors is not a complete
description of the analyses underlying Legg Mason's opinion. The preparation of
a fairness opinion is a complex process involving various determinations as to
the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the
application of these methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a
fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. In arriving at its opinion, Legg Mason made qualitative judgments
as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor that it
considered. Accordingly, Legg Mason believes that its analyses must be
considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or
focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all
analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create
a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and
opinion.

     Comparable Company Analysis.  Legg Mason compared selected financial
information for LifeMinders with publicly available information for eight
companies in the Internet advertising and marketing industry, including Avenue
A, Inc., Be Free, Inc., ClickAction, Inc., CoolSavings.com, Inc., Digital
Impact, Inc., Engage, Inc., Netcentives, Inc., and ValueClick, Inc. Legg Mason
calculated the multiples of equity market capitalization and enterprise value,
which were defined as equity market capitalization plus debt less unrestricted
cash and cash equivalents, to revenues for the most recently reported twelve
month period, which will be referred to as twelve month revenue, and annualized
revenue for the most recent three month period, which will be referred to as
three month annualized revenue, each period ending March 31, 2001, for each of
LifeMinders and the selected eight companies.

     The following tables set forth the median multiples indicated by this
analysis for the selected eight companies; if enterprise value was a negative
value, then no multiple was assigned:

     Selected Comparable Transaction Analysis.  Based on publicly available
information, Legg Mason calculated the multiples of the transaction value and
transaction enterprise value (defined as the transaction value plus debt less
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) to the twelve month revenues and the
three month annualized revenues, each for the period ending prior to the
announced acquisition date, in the following seven selected comparable
transactions in the Internet advertising, marketing and related services
industry.

     Premium Paid Analysis.  Based on publicly available information, Legg Mason
calculated the median premiums implied by the offer price of the selected
comparable transactions over the closing price of the common stock of the
acquired company during selected periods prior to the announcement of the
applicable transaction. Legg Mason then reviewed the premium implied in the
LifeMinders merger, using a Cross Media common stock price as of each of July
19, 2001, the announcement date of the original merger agreement, and August 19,
2001, the date of its opinion.

     The following table sets forth the results of the analysis:

                                                                     IMPLIED PREMIUM IN THE

     No company or transaction used in the comparable company, comparable
transaction or premium paid analysis is identical to LifeMinders or Cross Media
or the merger. Although Legg Mason believes that certain of the companies
reviewed have similar operations to some of the operations of LifeMinders, none
of these companies have the same management, composition, size or combination of
businesses as LifeMinders. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the
foregoing is not mathematical; rather it involves complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of
the companies and other factors that could affect the public trading value of
the companies to which LifeMinders, Cross Media and the merger are being
compared.

     Asset Liquidation Analysis.  Based upon a liquidation analysis prepared by
LifeMinders' management, Legg Mason compared an estimate of the net proceeds
available in a liquidation of LifeMinders' assets to the merger consideration.
An asset liquidation analysis is most relevant when a company cannot be sold as
a going concern and is likely to be liquidated. In an asset liquidation
analysis, the liquidation value of a company is derived by estimating the value
of the company's assets and assuming their conversion into cash, then deducting
all of the liabilities of the company from the total cash that could be
received, and then adding (or deducting) the net operating profits (or losses)
incurred by the company through the liquidation process. Liquidation value can
be determined by assuming either an orderly liquidation or a more rapid, forced
liquidation of the business. Ordinarily, the latter approach results in a lower
value.

     In performing the analysis, Legg Mason relied upon estimates made by the
management of LifeMinders of the range of liquidation values for the assets of
LifeMinders, the range of total liabilities of LifeMinders and the range of net
operating expenses to be incurred by LifeMinders. LifeMinders' management
assumed an orderly liquidation of LifeMinders' assets. Further, LifeMinders'
management estimated operating and transaction expenses assuming a cessation of
business operations and a liquidation of assets could be concluded as of August
31, 2001. Legg Mason did not make an appraisal of the assets, and the estimated
values were not appraisals.

     The following table sets forth the range of net asset liquidation values
estimated by LifeMinders' management.

Estimated liquidation value of assets..................  $57.3 million  to   $59.9 million
Estimated liabilities and expenses.....................    5.4 million  to     4.5 million
                                                         -------------       -------------
Net liquidation value..................................   51.9 million  to    55.4 million

     As described above, Legg Mason's opinion and presentation were among the
many factors that the LifeMinders board of directors took into consideration in
making its determination to approve, and to recommend that the shareholders of
LifeMinders approve, the merger. Consequently, the Legg Mason analyses as
described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the
board of directors of LifeMinders with respect to the value of LifeMinders or of
whether LifeMinders' board of directors would have been willing to agree to a
different consideration. The merger consideration to be received by the holders
of LifeMinders common stock pursuant to the amended and restated merger
agreement and other terms of the amended and restated merger agreement were
determined through arm's-length negotiations between LifeMinders and Cross Media
and were approved by LifeMinders' board of directors.

     The board of directors of LifeMinders selected Legg Mason based on Legg
Mason's experience, reputation and expertise. Legg Mason is a nationally
recognized investment banking firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of
businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged
buyouts, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions
of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for
corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of its business, Legg Mason
may actively trade in the equity securities of LifeMinders and Cross Media for
its own account and the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any
time hold a long or short position in such securities.

     Pursuant to an engagement letter dated July 2, 2001, and amended as of
August 15, 2001, Legg Mason provided financial advisory services and two
financial opinions in connection with the merger, and LifeMinders agreed to pay
Legg Mason a fee of $325,000 in connection therewith. LifeMinders also has
agreed to reimburse Legg Mason for its expenses incurred in performing its
services. In addition, LifeMinders has agreed to indemnify Legg Mason and its
affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each
person, if any, controlling Legg Mason or any of its affiliates against certain
liabilities and expenses, including liabilities under the federal securities
laws related to or arising out of Legg Mason's engagement and any related
transactions.

NO APPRAISAL RIGHTS FOR CROSS MEDIA AND LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS

     Under Delaware law, holders of Cross Media and LifeMinders common stock are
not entitled to dissenters' rights or appraisal rights in connection with the
merger.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following are the material federal income tax consequences of the
merger to LifeMinders stockholders, assuming that the merger is effected as
described in the merger agreement and this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The
following discussion is based on currently existing provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, referred to as the Code, existing Treasury
Regulations thereunder and current administrative rulings and court decisions,
all of which are subject to change. Any change, which may or may not be
retroactive, could alter the tax consequences of the transaction to the
stockholders of LifeMinders.

     This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax considerations
that may be relevant to particular LifeMinders stockholders in light of their
particular circumstances, including (without limitation):

     - banks;

     - insurance companies;

     - tax-exempt organizations;

     - dealers in securities;

     - persons that hold their LifeMinders common stock as part of a straddle, a
       hedge against a currency risk or a constructive sale or conversion
       transaction;

     - persons who are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the
       Code; or

     - persons who acquired their LifeMinders stock in connection with a stock
       option or stock purchase plan or in some other compensatory transaction.

     This discussion assumes that LifeMinders stockholders hold their shares of
LifeMinders common stock as capital assets. In addition, the following
discussion does not address the tax consequences of the merger under foreign,
state or local tax laws. Furthermore, the discussion does not address the tax
consequences of transactions effected before, after or at the same time as the
merger, whether or not they are in connection with the merger, including,
without limitation, transactions in which LifeMinders stock is acquired or Cross
Media shares are disposed of.

     It is a condition to the closing under the merger agreement that Blank Rome
Comisky & McCauley LLP and Shaw Pittman LLP render tax opinions to Cross Media
and LifeMinders, respectively, that the merger will constitute a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. These tax opinions will be
based upon and subject to assumptions, limitations and qualifications, and will
be based upon the truth and accuracy of factual representations required to be
made by Cross Media and LifeMinders as of the time of the merger.

     Assuming the merger constitutes a reorganization under Section 368(a) of
the Code, the following federal income tax consequences would generally result
to LifeMinders stockholders:

     Merger Consideration Which Includes Only Cross Media Common Stock.  Subject
to the discussion below regarding fractional shares of Cross Media common stock,
each LifeMinders stockholder receiving only Cross Media common stock in the
merger will not recognize any gain or loss as a result of the receipt of Cross
Media common stock pursuant to the merger.

     Merger Consideration Which Includes Only Cash.  A LifeMinders stockholder
who receives only cash in the exchange and does not actually or constructively
own any Cross Media common stock after the

exchange will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference
between the cash received and the stockholder's tax basis in the LifeMinders
common stock exchanged in the merger.

     Merger Consideration Which Includes Both Cross Media Common Stock and Cash.
Subject to the discussion below regarding fractional shares of Cross Media
common stock, a LifeMinders stockholder receiving a combination of Cross Media
common stock and cash in exchange for LifeMinders common stock in the merger,
will recognize gain, but not loss, in an amount equal to the lesser of:

      (i) the excess, if any, of:

          (x) the sum of the fair market value (at the effective time of the
              merger) of the Cross Media common stock and the cash received,
              over;

          (y) each stockholder's tax basis in the shares of LifeMinders common
              stock surrendered in the merger; and

     (ii) the amount of cash received.

Such gain should generally constitute capital gain (subject to the potential
recharacterization as a dividend as discussed below) and should generally be
long-term capital gain if the LifeMinders common stock exchanged in the merger
has been held for more than one year prior to the merger.

     In general, whether a LifeMinders stockholder will be required to recognize
capital gain or dividend income will depend on the stockholder's particular
facts and circumstances and will be determined under Sections 356(a)(2) and 302
of the Code. Each LifeMinders stockholder who receives cash and stock in the
merger will be treated for tax purposes as if:

     - the stockholder (and other LifeMinders stockholders) had received only
       Cross Media common stock in the merger; and

     - immediately thereafter, as if Cross Media redeemed part of the
       hypothetically issued stock in exchange for the cash actually distributed
       to the stockholder in the merger.

The gain recognized by a LifeMinders stockholder on the exchange will be taxed
as capital gain if the hypothetical redemption from the stockholder:

     - is a "substantially disproportionate redemption" of stock with respect to
       the stockholder; or

     - is "not essentially equivalent to a dividend" with respect to the
       stockholder.

In making this determination, a LifeMinders stockholder will be considered to
own Cross Media common stock after the merger which is either directly or
constructively owned by the stockholder pursuant to applicable stock attribution
rules. These rules generally will treat a stockholder as constructively owning
Cross Media common stock owned by certain individuals and entities related to
the stockholder, as well as Cross Media common stock that the stockholder, or
the related individuals or entities, has the right to acquire upon the exercise
of options or conversion of the other equity instruments.

     The hypothetical redemption of a LifeMinders stockholder's Cross Media
common stock will be a "substantially disproportionate redemption," and
therefore, will not have the effect of a distribution of a dividend with respect
to a stockholder of LifeMinders, if the percentage of Cross Media common stock
actually and constructively owned by the stockholder immediately after the
hypothetical redemption is less than 80% of the percentage of Cross Media common
stock that would be actually and constructively owned by the stockholder
immediately before the hypothetical redemption.

     The hypothetical redemption of a LifeMinders common stockholder's Cross
Media common stock will not be "essentially equivalent to a dividend" if the
stockholder experiences a "meaningful reduction" in his or her proportionate
equity interest in Cross Media by reason of the hypothetical redemption.
Although there are not fixed rules for determining when a meaningful reduction
has occurred, the Internal Revenue Service has indicated in a published ruling
that a stockholder in a publicly-held corporation whose relative stock interest
in the corporation is minimal and who exercises no "control" over corporate
affairs generally is treated as having had a meaningful reduction in his or her
stock interest after a redemption transaction

if his or her percentage stock ownership in the corporation has been reduced to
any extent, taking into account the stockholder's actual and constructive
ownership before and after the redemption.

     If neither of the redemption tests set forth above are satisfied for a
LifeMinders stockholder, any gain recognized by the stockholder will be treated
as dividend income up to the stockholder's ratable share of the accumulated
earnings and profits of LifeMinders, and possibly Cross Media, at the effective
time of the merger. Any gain in excess of the stockholder's ratable share of the
earnings and profits will be treated as capital gain. Neither Cross Media nor
LifeMinders anticipates that it will have any accumulated earnings and profits
as of the effective time of the merger.

     Tax Basis and Holding Period.  A LifeMinders stockholder's aggregate tax
basis in the Cross Media common stock received in the merger (including any
fractional shares deemed received, as described below) will be equal to the
aggregate tax basis of the LifeMinders common stock surrendered in the exchange,

     - decreased by the amount of cash received; and

     - increased by the amount of gain recognized (including gain required to be
       treated as dividend income but not including gain recognized on receipt
       of cash in lieu of fractional shares).

LifeMinders stockholder's holding period of the Cross Media common stock
received will include the holding period of the LifeMinders common stock
surrendered in exchange therefor.

     Cash Payments Received in Lieu of Fractional Shares.  Cash payments
received by LifeMinders stockholders in lieu of a fractional share of Cross
Media common stock will be treated as if the fractional share had been issued in
the merger and then redeemed by Cross Media. A LifeMinders stockholder receiving
the cash in lieu of a fractional share will generally recognize capital gain or
loss upon the payment (subject to potential recharacterization as a dividend, as
discussed above), equal to the difference, if any, between the LifeMinders
stockholder's tax basis in the fractional share and the amount of cash received.

     Backup Withholding.  Certain noncorporate LifeMinders stockholders may be
subject to backup withholding at a rate of 30.5% on cash payments received in
the merger. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a LifeMinders
stockholder who (i) furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and
certifies that he or she is not subject to backup withholding on the substitute
Form W-9 included in the letter of transmittal, (ii) provides a certificate of
foreign status on an appropriate Form W-8, or (iii) is otherwise exempt from
backup withholding.

     No ruling from the Internal Revenue Service has been or will be requested
in connection with the merger. In addition, stockholders of LifeMinders should
be aware that the tax opinions discussed in this section are not binding upon
the Internal Revenue Service. Moreover, the Internal Revenue Service could adopt
a contrary position which could be sustained by a court.

     THE PRECEDING DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN UNITED
STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE
A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL TAX EFFECTS RELEVANT THERETO.
THUS, LIFEMINDERS STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO
THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING TAX RETURN
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF FOREIGN, FEDERAL, STATE,
LOCAL, AND OTHER APPLICABLE TAX LAWS AND THE EFFECT OF ANY PROPOSED CHANGES IN
THE TAX LAWS.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141,
"Business Combinations" and SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."
The new standards require that all business combinations initiated after June
30, 2001 must be accounted for under the purchase method. In addition, all
intangible assets acquired that are obtained through contractual or legal right,
or are capable of being separately sold, transferred, licensed, rented or
exchanged are to be recognized as an asset apart from goodwill. Goodwill and
intangibles with indefinite lives will no longer be subject to

amortization, but will be subject to at least an annual assessment for
impairment by applying a fair value based test.

     The merger will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
Accordingly, under generally accepted accounting principles, the acquired assets
and assumed liabilities of LifeMinders will be recorded on the books of the
combined companies at their fair values at the date the merger is completed. Any
excess of the value of the consideration paid by Cross Media at the date the
merger is completed over the fair value of the identifiable assets of
LifeMinders will be treated as excess of purchase price over the fair value of
net assets acquired (commonly known as goodwill). See "Selected Pro Forma
Combined Financial Information."

                  OTHER CROSS MEDIA SPECIAL MEETING PROPOSALS

AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF CROSS MEDIA'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

     At the special meeting, holders of shares of Cross Media common stock will
be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to amend and restate Cross Media's
current certificate of incorporation. The proposed amendment and restatement, in
the form attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus, amends
Cross Media's current certificate of incorporation by:

     - increasing the number of shares of common stock that Cross Media has
       authority to issue from 100,000,000 to 150,000,000 and consequently, to
       increase the total number of shares of all classes of stock that Cross
       Media has to issue from 110,000,000 to 160,000,000; and

     - clarifying the indemnification provisions.

     The first paragraph of Article THIRD of Cross Media's current certificate
of incorporation, before giving effect to the proposed amendment and
restatement, reads as follows:

     THIRD:  1. The authorized capital stock of the Corporation shall consist of
110,000,000 shares of which 100,000,000 shares shall be designated Common Stock,
par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), and 10,000,000 shares shall be
designated Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Preferred Stock").

     Pursuant to the proposed amendment and restatement, the first paragraph of
Article THIRD of the current certificate of incorporation would be replaced with
the following:

     THIRD:  1. The authorized capital stock of the Corporation shall consist of
160,000,000 shares of which 150,000,000 shares shall be designated Common Stock,
par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), and 10,000,000 shares shall be
designated Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Preferred Stock").

     The second paragraph of Article FIFTH of Cross Media's current certificate
of incorporation, before giving effect to the proposed amendment and
restatement, reads as follows:

     FIFTH:  2. The Corporation shall indemnify to the fullest extent permitted
by the GCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, any person made, or
threatened to be made a defendant or witness to any action, suit or proceeding
(whether civil or criminal or otherwise) by reason of the fact that such person,
or his or her testator or intestate, is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation
as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or enterprise. Nothing contained
herein shall affect any rights to indemnification to which any person may be
entitled by law. No amendment or repeal of this Article FIFTH shall adversely
effect any right to indemnification provided hereunder with respect to any act
or omission occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

     Pursuant to the proposed amendment and restatement, the second paragraph of
Article FIFTH of Cross Media's current certificate of incorporation would be
replaced with the following:

     FIFTH:  2. The Corporation shall indemnify to the fullest extent permitted
by the GCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, any person made, or
threatened to be made a defendant or witness to any action, suit or proceeding
(whether civil or criminal or otherwise) by reason of the fact that such person,
or his or her testator or intestate, is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation
as a director, officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
enterprise. Nothing contained herein shall affect any rights to indemnification
to which any person may be entitled by law or agreement. No amendment or repeal
of this Article FIFTH shall adversely effect any right to indemnification
provided hereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such
amendment or repeal.

     Section (a) of the third paragraph of Article FIFTH of Cross Media's
current certificate of incorporation, before giving effect to the proposed
amendment and restatement reads, as follows:

     FIFTH:  3. (a) the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on
                    behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer,
                    employee or agent of the Corporation, or is serving at the
                    request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee
                    or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
                    trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any
                    liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or
                    her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her
                    status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have
                    the power to indemnify against such liability under the
                    provisions of law; and

     Pursuant to the proposed amendment and restatement, section (a) of the
third paragraph of Article FIFTH of Cross Media's current certificate of
incorporation would be replaced with the following:

     FIFTH:  3. (a) the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on
                    behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer,
                    employee or agent of the Corporation, or is serving at the
                    request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee,
                    partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another
                    corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
                    benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability
                    asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in
                    any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as
                    such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
                    indemnify against such liability under the provisions of
                    law; and

     REASONS FOR THE INCREASE IN AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

     The amended and restated merger agreement requires that Cross Media
increase the number of authorized shares of Cross Media common stock in order to
insure that Cross Media has enough unissued shares to complete the merger.

     Additionally, the board of directors considers the increase in authorized
shares of common stock necessary in order to provide flexibility for potential
acquisitions and future capital requirements. Cross Media intends to seek to
continue to expand its operations which will require additional capital,
including acquisitions for which it may choose to issue equity securities as all
or a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition. Although Cross Media
continuously evaluates potential acquisition candidates, Cross Media does not,
at this time, have any plans, commitments or understandings with respect to any
acquisitions. Approval by the stockholders of the increase in authorized shares
of common stock at the special meeting will avoid the need to call and hold
additional special meetings for this purpose, thereby enabling Cross Media to
act quickly when potential acquisition transactions arise.

     Once authorized, the additional shares of Cross Media common stock may be
issued with approval of the board of directors but without further approval of
the stockholders unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law, rule
or regulation. Accordingly, this solicitation may be the only opportunity for
Cross Media stockholders to approve financings, acquisitions, benefit plans,
recapitalizations and other corporate transactions.

     This proposal could, under certain circumstances, have an anti-takeover
effect. For example, if Cross Media were the subject of a hostile takeover
attempt, it could try to impede the takeover by issuing shares of common stock,
thereby diluting the voting power of the other outstanding shares and increasing
the potential cost of the takeover. The Cross Media board of directors is not
aware of any attempt or plan to acquire control of Cross Media, including the
issuance of Cross Media common stock.

     REASONS FOR CLARIFICATION OF INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS

     The revisions to the indemnification provisions in Article Fifth of Cross
Media's current certificate of incorporation clarify that indemnification will
be provided to and insurance will be purchased and maintained on behalf of a
person who is or was serving at the request of Cross Media as a trustee, partner

or a fiduciary of a trust, employee benefit plan or partnership. Prior to this
proposed amendment and restatement, Cross Media's current certificate of
incorporation stated that Cross Media would indemnify and purchase and maintain
insurance for any person who is or was serving at the request of Cross Media as
a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or enterprise. Under Cross Media's
current certificate of incorporation, it is implied that indemnification and
insurance coverage would be provided to trustees, partners or fiduciaries as,
for example, a partnership has partners who serve in the same capacity as a
director does for a corporation. Accordingly, since Cross Media's current
certification of incorporation provides that Cross Media will indemnify and
purchase and maintain insurance for a director, officer, employee or agent of a
partnership, it is implied that this indemnification would cover partners of a
partnership.

     In addition, the revisions to the indemnification provisions clarify that
the indemnification provisions contained in Cross Media's certificate of
incorporation will not affect any indemnification rights to which a person may
be entitled to by agreement.

     THE CROSS MEDIA BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" ADOPTION OF
THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF CROSS MEDIA'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

     Adoption of this proposal is also a condition to the merger. Cross Media
may not have a sufficient number of shares of common stock authorized to issue
to LifeMinders stockholders in the merger when adding the number of shares of
Cross Media common stock to be issued in the merger and to be reserved for
issuance upon exercise of options to be issued in exchange for LifeMinders
options in the merger to the number of shares of Cross Media common stock
outstanding, the number of shares of Cross Media common stock may be issued in
accordance with the Series A agreement, as described on page [     ] and
reserved for issuance upon outstanding Cross Media options, warrants and other
equity rights. Accordingly, Cross Media stockholders must adopt the amendment
and restatement of Cross Media's current certificate of incorporation at the
special meeting in order for Cross Media to consummate the merger.

     The board of directors has approved the proposed amendment and restatement
and submits the amendment and restatement to the stockholders for adoption.

     If the amendment and restatement is adopted by the requisite number of
shares of Cross Media common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, the
amendment and restatement will become effective upon the filing of the amended
and restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of
Delaware, which is expected to occur shortly after stockholder approval.

     The board of directors believes that the increase in authorized shares of
common stock and the clarification of the indemnification provisions are in the
best interests of Cross Media and its stockholders and recommends that the
stockholders adopt the amendment and restatement of Cross Media's current
certificate of incorporation.

AMENDMENT TO CROSS MEDIA'S 1998 STOCK OPTION PLAN TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF
SHARES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE

     GENERAL

     The board of directors has approved an amendment, referred to as the plan
amendment, to the 1998 Stock Option Plan, referred to as the option plan, to
increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the
option plan from 8 million shares to 14 million shares. The option plan
amendment is being submitted to the stockholders for approval.

     The board of directors approved the plan amendment because substantially
all of the shares available for issuance under the option plan are subject to
outstanding options. In the past, Cross Media has granted an aggregate of
6,954,000 stock options to officers, directors, employees and consultants at
exercise prices ranging from $0.01 to $6.375 per share. The board of directors
believes that the ability to grant stock-based awards is important to the future
success of Cross Media. The grant of stock options can motivate

high levels of performance and provide an effective means of recognizing
employee contributions to the success of Cross Media. In addition, stock options
can be valuable in recruiting and retaining personnel and providing incentives
to its current employees. The increase in the number of shares available for
awards under the option plan will enable Cross Media to continue to realize the
benefits of granting stock-based compensation.

     The plan amendment is intended, in part, to increase the number of shares
available under the option plan to an amount sufficient to allow for the grant
of future options. See [ ].

     SUMMARY OF THE OPTION PLAN

     Purpose.  The purpose of the option plan is to provide incentives and
rewards to selected eligible directors, officers, employees and consultants of
Cross Media and its subsidiaries in order to assist Cross Media and its
subsidiaries in attracting, retaining and motivating those persons by providing
for or increasing the proprietary interests of those persons in Cross Media, and
by associating their interests in Cross Media with those of the Cross Media
stockholders.

     The board of directors approved the option plan in December 1998. The
stockholders approved the option plan by written consent in April 1999 and
approved certain amendments to the option plan at the 1999 annual meeting of
stockholders in September 1999, at the 2000 annual meeting of stockholders in
September 2000, and at the 2001 annual meeting of stockholders in June 2001.

     Administration.  The option plan is administered by the compensation
committee of Cross Media's board of directors, which is referred to as the
"administrator." Subject to the provisions of the option plan, the administrator
has full and final authority to:

     - select from among eligible directors, officers, employees and
       consultants, those persons to be granted options under the option plan;

     - determine the type, size and terms of individual options to be made to
       each person selected, including whether the option will be an incentive
       stock option or a nonqualified option;

     - determine the time when options will be granted and to establish
       objectives and conditions (including, without limitation, vesting and
       performance conditions), if any, for earning options;

     - amend the terms or conditions of any outstanding option, subject to
       applicable legal restrictions and to the consent of the other party to
       such option;

     - determine the duration and purpose of leaves of absences which may be
       granted to holders of options without constituting termination of their
       employment for purposes of their options;

     - authorize any person to execute, on behalf of Cross Media, any instrument
       required to carry out the purposes of the option plan; and

     - make any and all other determinations which the administrator determines
       to be necessary or advisable in the administration of the option plan.

     The administrator has full power and authority to administer and interpret
the option plan and to adopt, amend and revoke rules, regulations, agreements,
guidelines and instruments for the administration of the option plan and for the
conduct of its business as the administrator deems necessary or advisable. The
administrator's interpretation of the option plan, and all actions taken and
determinations made by the administrator pursuant to the powers vested in it
under the option plan, shall be conclusive and binding on all parties concerned,
including Cross Media, its stockholders, any optionee and any other employee of
Cross Media or however, its subsidiaries.

     Eligibility.  Options may be granted to persons selected by the
administrator in its discretion who are, at the time of grant, directors,
officers, employees or consultants of Cross Media, or any of its subsidiaries,
all referred to as a participant; provided, that, incentive stock options may be
granted only to individuals who are employees of Cross Media or its
subsidiaries.

     Options.  The option plan provides for the grant of stock options intended
to qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the
Code and stock options that are not intended to qualify as incentive stock
options within the meaning of the Code, referred to as non-qualified stock
options, collectively referred to as options. Each option is evidenced by an
"option agreement." The administrator, in its sole and absolute discretion,
determines all of the types, terms and conditions of each option granted under
the option plan. The provisions of separate option agreements need not be
identical, but each incentive stock option must be in compliance with each of
the following conditions:

     - The exercise period may not be more than 10 years from the date the
       incentive stock option is granted (five years in the case of any person
       who owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting
       power of all classes of stock of Cross Media).

     - The exercise price per share of each incentive stock option may not be
       less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the
       date on which the incentive stock option is granted (110% of the fair
       market value in the case of a 10% stockholder described in the previous
       paragraph).

     - An incentive stock option is not transferable, except by will or by the
       laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable during the lifetime
       of the person to whom the incentive stock option is granted only by such
       person.

     - If the optionee's employment with Cross Media terminates, the optionee
       must exercise the incentive stock option, to the extent it was
       exercisable at termination, within three months of termination.

     - The aggregate fair market value of shares of common stock with respect to
       which incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time by an
       "optionee" during any calendar year (determined on the grant date) under
       all plans of the company and its affiliates may not exceed $100,000; the
       options or portions thereof that exceed this limit will be treated as
       non-qualified stock options.

     Payment.  The exercise price shall be paid, to the extent permitted by
applicable law and regulations, in cash, with previously-owned common stock, by
reducing the number of shares of common stock otherwise issuable pursuant to the
award, according to a deferred payment or other arrangement, or in another form
of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the administrator.

     Maximum Number of Shares Available for Grant to any Person.  No person may
receive options representing more than 50% of the aggregate number of shares of
common stock that may be issued under the option plan. In addition, the
aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be subject to options
granted to any person in a calendar year may not exceed 2,000,000 shares.

     Transferability.  Options granted under the option plan are not
transferable by the participant except by will or by the laws of descent and
distribution.

     Changes in Capitalization.  Upon a change in capitalization of Cross Media,
a stock dividend or split, a consolidation or merger of Cross Media with another
person where Cross Media is the "surviving company," as defined in the option
plan, a combination of shares and certain other similar events, the option plan
provides for an adjustment in the number of shares of common stock available to
be issued under the option plan, the maximum number of shares with respect to
which options may be granted to a participant in a year, and the number and
exercise price-per-share of shares of common stock subject to options.

     Acceleration.  The administrator has the power to accelerate the time at
which an option may first be exercised or the time during which an option or any
part thereof will vest, notwithstanding the provisions in the option stating the
time at which it may first be exercised or the time during which it will vest.

     Amendment and Termination.  The board of directors may at any time amend
the option plan in whole or in part, provided that no such action may adversely
affect any rights or obligations with respect to any outstanding options.

     The option plan will terminate on the earlier of the date the board of
directors terminates the option plan or December 31, 2007. Termination of the
option plan will not terminate any outstanding options.

     Federal Income Tax Consequences for Stock Options.  The following is a
general discussion of the principal tax considerations for both incentive stock
options and non-qualified stock options and is based upon the tax laws and
regulations of the United States existing as of the date hereof, all of which
are subject to modification at any time. Various state laws may provide for tax
consequences that vary significantly from those described below. In addition,
tax consequences different from those described below may result in the event of
the exercise of an option after termination of the participant's employment by
reason of death.

     Incentive Stock Options.  In general, no income is recognized for federal
income tax purposes by an optionee at the time the option is granted or
exercised. The optionee will recognize capital gain or loss when the optionee
disposes of his or her common stock, with treatment as a long- or short-term
gain or loss being determined by the length of the holding period. This gain or
loss is generally measured by the difference between the exercise price of the
option and the amount received for the common stock at the time of the
disposition.

     However, if an optionee disposes of the common stock acquired upon exercise
of an incentive stock options within two years after grant of the option or
within one year after acquiring the common stock, the disposition will be
considered a "disqualifying disposition" and the treatment will be different. In
such a case, the difference between the exercise price of the stock and the fair
market value of the stock on the date of exercise will be treated as ordinary
income, and any amount realized upon disposition of the common stock in excess
of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise will be treated
as capital gain.

     If an optionee uses shares acquired upon the exercise of an incentive stock
option to exercise another incentive stock option, and the sale of the shares so
surrendered for cash on the date of surrender would be a disqualifying
disposition of such shares, the use of such shares to exercise an incentive
stock option also would constitute a disqualifying disposition.

     For purposes of calculating the "alternative minimum tax," the excess of
the fair market value of the stock at the exercise date over the exercise price
of the incentive stock option is included in computing that year's alternative
minimum taxable income, even though the exercise may not otherwise result in a
taxable event.

     Cross Media is not entitled to a deduction as a result of the grant or
exercise of an incentive stock option. If the optionee has compensation taxable
as ordinary income as a result of a disqualifying disposition, Cross Media shall
be entitled to a deduction in an amount equal to the compensation income
resulting from the disqualifying disposition in the taxable year of Cross Media
in which the disqualifying disposition occurs.

     Non-qualified Stock Options.  No income is recognized by a holder of a
non-qualified stock option at the time of grant. In general, when shares of
common stock are issued to a holder pursuant to exercise of a non-qualified
stock option, the holder will recognize ordinary income equal to the excess of
the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the exercise
price. The shares acquired by the optionee upon such exercise shall have a tax
basis equal to the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date. Upon
any subsequent sale of such shares, the optionee shall recognize a capital gain
(or loss) in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized on
the sale and such tax basis. Whether such gain or loss is characterized as long-
or short-term will depend on the optionee's holding period.

     Generally, in connection with the exercise of a non-qualified stock option,
Cross Media will be entitled to a deduction for federal income tax purposes in
the year and in the same amount as the optionee is considered to have realized
ordinary income.

     In general, the "million-dollar limit" under Section 162(m) of the Code
provides that, subject to certain exceptions, annual remuneration in excess of
$1 million that is paid to certain "covered employees" of a publicly-held
corporation (generally, the corporation's chief executive officer and its four
most highly compensated employees other than the chief executive officer) shall
not be deductible by the corporation. Grants of options under the option plan
made by a committee comprised solely of two or more outside directors and the
exercise price of which is equal to or greater than the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of grant are generally eligible for the exception
applicable to the $1 million limit for qualified "performance-based
compensation."

     REQUIRED VOTE

     The approval of the plan amendment requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of Cross Media common stock present or represented and
entitled to vote on this matter at the special meeting. An abstention will be
counted toward the tabulation of votes cast and will have the same effect as a
vote against the proposal. A broker non-vote, however, will not be treated as a
vote cast for or against approval of the proposal.

     Cross Media's board of directors has approved the plan amendment and
recommends adoption of the plan amendment by the stockholders.

                            BUSINESS OF CROSS MEDIA

GENERAL

     Cross Media is a direct marketing company that integrates sophisticated
marketing skills with new technologies for the sale of multi-magazine
subscription packages, discount buying club memberships and telecommunication
services. Through inbound and outbound teleservices programs at Media
Outsourcing, Inc., its principal operating business, Cross Media contacts and
retains critical data on more than 11 million consumers annually.

     Cross Media's principal office is located at 461 Fifth Avenue, 19th Floor,
New York, New York 10017 and its telephone number at that address is (212)
457-1200.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

     Cross Media's strategy is to integrate well established direct marketing
skills with a variety of new technologies, including e-mail marketing, web-based
systems and interactive voice response, ultimately resulting in a multi-faceted
marketing platform for the sale of products and services. Cross Media expects
that this strategy will enable it to contact consumers on a cost effective basis
through multiple communications channels, such as e-mail, telemarketing,
traditional advertising and interactive voice response. Cross Media plans to use
these consumer contacts to develop a dynamic consumer database and to integrate
all of these activities into a single new system. When completed, the new system
should enable Cross Media to target marketing campaigns to select sub-groups of
its total customer base and to measure the success of campaigns while factoring
in the different communications channels used in those campaigns.

BUSINESS

     Cross Media acts as a clearinghouse which has the direct authority on
behalf of magazine publishers to accept magazine subscription orders and to
place those orders with fulfillment houses designated by the publishers. Cross
Media retains approximately 21 independent telesales agencies, also known as
call centers, to generate sales of magazine subscriptions on its behalf. Two of
these call centers accounted for approximately 35% of Cross Media's magazine
subscription revenues in 2000. In December 2000, Cross Media established company
owned and operated call centers in Orlando, Florida and Peoria, Illinois. Each
month, generally using lists of names and telephone numbers provided by Cross
Media, the independent and company owned call centers contact between 900,000
and 1,000,000 potential customers.

     In the last quarter of 2000, Cross Media commenced an e-mail campaign in
conjunction with a third party to generate inbound telephone calls to many of
the call centers. As a result of the success of the e-mail campaign, Cross Media
expects that in future years it will utilize the Internet to generate a
substantial number of customer contacts for its call centers. Utilizing the
hardware and software platform obtained through the acquisition of WeFusion.com,
Inc., Cross Media is developing a sophisticated system to track and control lead
files, customer contact statistics, customer profiles and internet based
marketing campaigns.

     The call centers offer the customer a bundle of subscriptions for four to
five magazines having an average selling price of approximately $600 per bundle,
for an average subscription period of between one and four years. Generally,
Cross Media does not sell single magazine subscriptions, although it plans to
test several offers for smaller magazine bundles in 2001. Cross Media decides
whether to accept orders submitted by the call centers by calling each customer
to verify the details of the magazine subscription order and the customer's
credit card information. When this process is complete, Cross Media forwards
accepted orders to the magazine publisher's fulfillment center for processing
and pays the publisher an agreed upon amount for the order. Cross Media charges
the subscriber for the order by automatically debiting the subscriber's credit
card on a monthly basis, generally over a 12-month period.

     At the time Cross Media verifies a customer's order, it attempts to
generate additional revenue, and thereby to enhance the profitability of the
sale. This is done by offering the customer the opportunity to participate in
special promotions sponsored by magazine publishers to spur the sale of
subscriptions, as well as discount buying club memberships and
telecommunications services. Cross Media receives a special promotion commission
from the publishers based upon additional subscriptions sold to its customer
base.

     In the year ended December 31, 2000 and six months ended June 30, 2001,
Cross Media sold approximately 2.1 million and 1.0 million special promotion
subscriptions, resulting in revenue of $4.7 million and $2.7 million. The club
membership upsell offer involves a free trial membership in a discount buying
club sold by Cross Media on behalf of Memberworks, an unaffiliated third party.
In the year ended December 31, 2000 and six months ended June 30, 2001, the
upsell of memberships in Memberworks generated revenue to Cross Media of
approximately $3.3 million and $2.5 million. The telecommunications upsells
involve the offer of long distance telephone service or pre-paid long distance
phone cards provided by Talk.com and Direct One, respectively. In the year ended
December 31, 2000 and six months ended June 30, 2001, telecommunications upsells
generated revenue of approximately $0.3 million and $1.0 million. In the year
ended December 31, 2000 and six months ended June 30, 2001, special publisher
commissions and upsells represented 13.4% and 14.4% of total revenues.

COMPETITION

     While there are no limitations on who may sell magazines to the public, the
companies and individuals that sell magazines must forward the subscriptions to
the publisher through a clearinghouse which has been granted authority to do so
by the publisher and must pay a fee to the clearinghouse to clear the order.
Establishing a clearinghouse relationship is difficult due to magazine
publishers' reluctance to grant this authority to new companies. Media
Outsourcing has been granted authority to clear orders for approximately 250
major U.S. magazine publications. In addition to Cross Media, the industry
leaders in sales of magazine subscriptions are Synapse, USA Pubs and E News. Of
these, only USA Pubs utilizes a call center as its primary means of contacting
potential customers.

     Cross Media competes on the basis of the total value of the bundle of
magazines sold to the customer versus the cost of purchasing individual magazine
subscriptions as well as the convenience for the customer of dealing with a
single source for all of their magazine subscriptions.

REGULATION

     Telemarketing operations are subject to various state and federal
regulations. The Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 limits the
hours during which telemarketers may call consumers to between 8:00 AM and 9:00
PM, and prohibits the use of automated telephone dialing equipment to call
certain telephone numbers. The Federal Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and
Abuse Prevention Act of 1994, and the Federal Trade Commission regulations
promulgated thereunder, prohibit deceptive, unfair or abusive practices in
telemarketing sales. Both the Federal Trade Commission and state attorney
generals have authority to prevent telemarketing activities that constitute
unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Additionally, some states have enacted
laws and others are considering enacting laws targeted directly at telemarketing
practices. There can be no assurance that any laws, if enacted, will not
adversely affect Cross Media's current or future operations by adversely
affecting the operations and practices of the call centers owned by Cross Media
or the independent call centers with which Cross Media has relationships.
Compliance with regulations promulgated by these agencies is generally the
responsibility of the call center. As a result, the call centers owned by Cross
Media, as well as the independent call centers with which Cross Media has
relationships could be subject to a variety of enforcement actions for any
failure to comply with such regulations.

     Laws and regulations applicable to direct marketing, telemarketing,
Internet marketing and consumer protection are becoming more prevalent. Each of
the 50 states and the federal government has laws regulating telemarketing,
sweepstakes promotions, promotional incentives and advertising to consumers,

which vary from state to state. While Cross Media reviews its telemarketing
scripts and advertising copy to ensure that they comply with applicable laws,
there is no guarantee that federal or state authorities will not find that Cross
Media's marketing efforts do not comply with these laws. In addition, it is
likely that additional federal and/or state regulations regarding telemarketing,
sweepstakes, e-mail marketing and other marketing practices engaged in by Cross
Media will be enacted. If enacted, these regulations could have an adverse
effect on revenues and result in additional expenses to Cross Media.

     The Federal Trade Commission is currently in the process of reviewing the
provisions of the Telemarketing Sales Rule to determine if any changes to the
rule should be made. If the Federal Trade Commission determines that changes to
the rule are necessary, such changes could have a significant adverse effect on
Cross Media.

     In 1999, Congress enacted the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement
Act, which imposes various restrictions on the offering of sweepstakes through
the mail. Additional sweepstakes legislation has been enacted or is pending in
various states. This additional regulation could have an adverse impact on Cross
Media's marketing activities.

     Federal and state authorities have also been investigating various
companies' use of marketing practices, such as the use of personal information,
magazine subscription agents' sweepstakes practices and the marketing of
membership club services through the use of inbound and outbound telemarketing
campaigns. These investigations could result in additional rules, regulations or
industry standards, which could have an adverse impact on Cross Media's
marketing practices.

     Laws and regulations directly applicable to Internet communications,
commerce, marketing and data protection are becoming more prevalent. If any of
these laws hinders the growth in use of the Internet generally, or decreases the
acceptance of the Internet as a medium of communications, commerce and
marketing, the business and prospects may suffer materially. The United States
Congress has enacted Internet laws regarding children's privacy, copyrights and
taxation. Other laws and regulations may be adopted covering issues such as user
privacy, marketing activities, pricing, content, taxation and quality of
products and services. The governments of some states and foreign countries have
begun to regulate transactions and levy sales or other taxes relating to Cross
Media's activities and will likely continue to do so. The laws governing the
Internet remain largely unsettled, even in areas where legislation has been
enacted. It may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as
those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation apply to the
Internet and Internet advertising and marketing services. In addition, the
growth and development of the market for Internet commerce may prompt calls for
more stringent consumer protection laws, both in the United States and abroad,
that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the
Internet.

     Laws and regulations regulating the transmission of unsolicited e-mail
marketing messages are being considered by many jurisdictions. Legislation of
that type has recently been adopted by the States of California, Virginia and
Washington, and similar legislation is pending in the State of New York and in
Congress. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits some types of information
and content from being transmitted over the Internet. The prohibition's scope
and the liability associated with a Telecommunications Act violation are
currently unsettled. In addition, although substantial portions of the
Communications Decency Act were held to be unconstitutional, Cross Media cannot
be certain that similar legislation will not be enacted and upheld in the
future.

     There has been increasing public debate about the collection, distribution
and use of information about consumers. Although this debate has primarily
focused on information collected through the Internet, many of the issues apply
to data gathered through other media. Cross Media interacts with consumers
through various direct marketing efforts, both online and offline. As a
consequence of government regulation or evolving standards of consumer privacy
protection, it may be required to make changes to its marketing media and
platforms in ways that could diminish the effectiveness of marketing efforts,
which could harm business.

EMPLOYEES

     As of August 1, 2001, Cross Media had approximately 422 full-time and 31
part-time employees.

PROPERTIES

     Cross Media's principal office is located at 461 Fifth Avenue, 19th Floor,

        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
                      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF CROSS MEDIA

     The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the
consolidated financial statements of Cross Media and the accompanying "Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements" included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. This discussion summarizes the significant factors
affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity
and cash flows of Cross Media for the three month periods ended March 31, 2001
and 2000 and years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

INTRODUCTION

     Cross Media was incorporated in Delaware on May 9, 1997 under the name
Brack Industries Inc. Cross Media changed its name to Symposium Corporation in
December 1998 and changed its name to Cross Media Marketing Corporation in
December 2000.

     Cross Media's principal business strategy is to integrate well established
direct marketing skills with a variety of new technologies, including e-mail
marketing, web-based systems and interactive voice response, ultimately
resulting in a multi-faceted marketing platform for the sale of products and
services.

     Cross Media was inactive until December 1998. From December 1998 through
June 1999, Cross Media, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Publishers Advantage
Corporation, had minimal operations and was principally engaged in telemarketing
in the United States for magazine and periodical subscription renewals to
persons whose subscriptions had recently expired. Cross Media discontinued the
operations of Publishers Advantage of June 30, 1999.

     In November 1999, Cross Media formed Media Outsourcing, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary, to acquire the assets of Direct Sales International. On
January 28, 2000, Cross Media, through Media Outsourcing, acquired substantially
all the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Direct Sales International, a
magazine subscription agency based in Atlanta, Georgia, which sold new
subscriptions for magazines of major US publishers. Cross Media paid
approximately $27.6 million to acquire Direct Sales International, including
$25.0 million in cash, an agreement to loan $1.5 million to a company in which
Direct Sales International's former owner holds a majority interest and
approximately $1.1 million in closing costs and fees incurred in connection with
the acquisition. Cross Media also granted to the seller of Direct Sales
International the right, which has an intrinsic value of $1.2 million, to sell
up to 600,000 shares of Cross Media common stock back to Cross Media at a fixed
price which has been included in the calculation of purchase price in excess of
net assets acquired. Cross Media financed the cash portion of the purchase price
by borrowing $16.0 million under a credit facility provided by Coast Business
Credit, resulting in proceeds of $15.8 million, net of fees, and by using
proceeds totaling approximately $9.2 million from the issuance of its common
stock, warrants to purchase its common stock, convertible preferred stock and
convertible debt.

     On November 30, 2000, Cross Media acquired WeFusion.com, Inc., an
application service provider which has developed a database architecture that
will enable Cross Media to develop sophisticated customer profiles. Cross Media
paid approximately $2.5 million to acquire WeFusion, including $0.6 million in
cash and approximately $1.9 million of its common stock and warrants to purchase
its common stock.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2001 AND JUNE 30, 2000

     REVENUES

     During the six months ended June 30, 2001, revenues were $43.3 million, a
60% increase from revenues of $27.1 million for the six months ended June 30,
2000. Revenues increased as a result of higher sales of magazine contracts,
increased revenue from sales of memberships, higher publisher bonus revenues,
revenues from the sales of long distance telephone service and other revenues.
For the six months ended June 30, 2001, revenues were derived primarily from the
sales of magazines contracts at

Media Outsourcing totaling approximately $33.9 million, commission revenues from
sales of memberships in a third party discount-buying club of $2.5 million,
publisher bonus revenues of $2.7 million, commissions on sales of discount long
distance telephone service of $1.0 million and other revenues of approximately
$3.2 million.

     COMMISSION EXPENSE

     Commission expense increased 49% to $20.9 million during the six months
ended June 30, 2001 from $14.0 million in the same period of 2000 as a result of
higher sales.

     OTHER DIRECT COSTS

     For the six months ended June 30, 2001, Cross Media recorded $11.4 million
of other direct costs related to sales of magazine contracts and other revenues,
a $6.6 million increase from the $4.8 million of costs recorded in the six
months ended June 30, 2001. The increase consists largely of $3.0 million of
direct recurring payroll, rent and other costs related to the expansion of Cross
Media's operations.

     GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

     General and administrative expenses increased $2.5 million to $5.5 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2001 from $3.0 million for the same period in
2000. This increase primarily reflects an increase in administrative personnel
at Media Outsourcing, professional fees and operational expenses of Cross Media.

     CONSULTING EXPENSES

     Consulting expenses decreased by $1.8 million to $0.5 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2001 from $2.3 million for the six months ended June 30,
2000. Consulting expenses were significantly higher for the six months ended
June 30, 2000 due to the acquisition of Direct Sales International in calendar
year 2000.

     AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL

     During the six months ended June 30, 2001, Cross Media amortized $0.3
million of the $7.0 million of goodwill recorded in connection with the
acquisition of Direct Sales International on January 28, 2000 and $0.2 million
of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of WeFusion on November
30, 2000. During the six-month period June 30, 2000, Cross Media amortized $0.2
million relating to the acquisition of Direct Sales International.

     INTEREST EXPENSE

     Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2001 was $1.0 million, a
decrease of $1.9 million from $2.9 million for the six months ended June 30,
2000. The decrease is primarily related to the one time non-cash interest
expense of $1.9 million recorded in the six-month period ended June 30, 2000
representing the fair value of shares and warrants issued in connection with the
initial issuance and subsequent conversion of the Direct Sales International
acquisition bridge financing.

     INCOME TAXES

     For the six months ended June 30, 2001, Cross Media recorded a $0.7 million
tax provision based on an estimate of its effective tax rate projected for the
year ended December 31, 2001. Cross Media may adjust the assumptions of its
projected earnings used to calculate the tax rate. Cross Media has Federal and
state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $7.0 million available
to offset future taxable income, if any, through December 2020. Cross Media's
ability to use these net operating losses may be substantially limited because
of the "change of ownership" provisions under Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code and similar state provisions. As a result of these limitations,
some or all of Cross Media's net operating losses may expire before it can use
them. Cross Media has established a valuation allowance

to reserve for the deferred tax assets arising from the net operating losses and
other temporary differences, since Cross Media cannot be sure that it will
benefit from them in the future.

     PREFERRED DIVIDENDS

     For the six months ended June 30, 2001, Cross Media recorded $1.3 million
of dividends including $0.9 million of non-cash deemed dividends and
approximately $0.4 million of contractual dividends. On February 15, 2001, Cross
Media redeemed 22,992 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock. The
remaining 39,363 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock were converted
into 3,946,250 shares of common stock. In consideration of the agreement of the
holders to convert the Series C convertible preferred stock, Cross Media agreed
to issue to the holders a total of 666,400 additional shares of Cross Media
common stock, pro rata in accordance with the number of shares each holder
converted. The non-cash deemed dividend of $0.9 million represents the fair
value of the additional shares issued. For the six months ended June 30, 2000,
Cross Media recorded $31.9 million of dividends including $31.6 million of
non-cash deemed dividends in connection with the Series A-1, B and C preferred
stock Cross Media issued to complete the acquisition of Direct Sales
International.

     NET INCOME (LOSS) AND NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE

     During the six months ended June 30, 2001, net income applicable to common
stockholders was $1.6 million or basic earnings per share of $0.05 compared to a
net loss applicable to common stockholders of $32.3 million or $(1.58) per share
for the six months ended June 30, 2000.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 1999

     REVENUES

     Cross Media recorded revenues totaling $55.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000. These revenues were derived from the sale of magazine
contracts at Media Outsourcing totaling approximately $52.2 million and
commission revenues from sales of memberships in a third party discount-buying
club totaling approximately $3.3 million. There were no revenues in the
comparable period in 1999 as these revenues related to the operations of Direct
Sales International that were acquired on January 28, 2000. Cross Media records
its revenues from sales of magazine subscriptions net of cancellation and
collection reserves and payments to publishers for fulfillment costs. In the
third and fourth quarters of 2000, Cross Media increased the reserves on its 20
pay contracts (magazine subscriptions payable by the subscriber in 20 monthly
installments) resulting in a reduction of revenues of $1.1 million and $880,000,
respectively.

     COMMISSION EXPENSE

     Cross Media recognized approximately $30.8 million in commission expense
for the year ended December 31, 2000, reflecting payments made to brokers on
Media Outsourcing magazine sales. There were no commission expenses in the
comparable period in 1999 as such commission expenses related to the operations
of Direct Sales International that were acquired on January 28, 2000.

     OTHER DIRECT COSTS

     Cross Media recorded $10.6 million of other direct costs related to the
magazine sales at Media Outsourcing. Other direct costs consisted primarily of
wages of approximately $5.4 million, bank charges related to the processing of
payments received by credit cards of approximately $1.4 million and other costs
of approximately $3.8 million. There were no other direct costs for the
comparable period in 1999, as such other direct costs related to the operations
of Direct Sales International that were acquired on January 28, 2000.

     GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

     General and administrative expenses increased $6.1 million to $8.4 million
in 2000 from $2.3 million in 1999. This increase reflects salary expense of
approximately $2.5 million related to Media Outsourcing and approximately $1.3
million of increased cost related to increased staff at Cross Media. Cross Media
had approximately 233 full-time and 51 part-time employees as of December 31,
2000. The increase is also related to $2.1 million of other operating expenses
incurred at Media Outsourcing since the acquisition of the operations of Direct
Sales International, including accounting and legal expenses of $306,000, travel
and entertainment expenses of $166,000, rent of $162,000 and depreciation of
$84,000. Other operating expenses in 1999 consisted primarily of accounting and
legal expenses of approximately $462,000, travel and entertainment expenses of
approximately $211,000 and office expenses of approximately $195,000. Also
included in other operating expenses for 1999 are the net loss of $178,511
incurred on Cross Media's Publisher's Advantage operations that were closed in
June 1999 and a bad debt expense of $500,000 related to the 100% valuation
reserve recorded on a $500,000 loan made to AmeriNet in 1999.

     CONSULTING EXPENSES

     Consulting expenses decreased $2.5 million, or 37.9%, to $4.1 million in
2000 from $6.6 million in 1999. Included in consulting expenses for 2000 are
approximately $1.6 million of non-cash charges for investor and public relations
and strategic planning services reflecting the estimated fair value of warrants
and options granted to purchase 2,512,000 shares of Cross Media common stock
ranging between $1.00 and $4.00 per share with terms of between two and five
years. Included in consulting expenses for 1999 are approximately $3.3 million
of non-cash charges for investor relations and strategic planning services
reflecting the estimated fair value of five-year warrants granted to purchase
860,000 shares of Cross Media common stock ranging between $1.00 and $2.00 per
share. The fair value of these warrants was estimated using the Black-Scholes
option pricing formula. Additionally, approximately $1.1 million and $2.7
million of the consulting expenses incurred in 2000 and 1999, respectively,
reflects the fair value of 535,000 shares and 870,000 shares of Cross Media
common stock issued for professional services rendered in 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

     AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL

     During 2000, Cross Media recorded $0.5 million of goodwill amortization
primarily related to the $7.0 million of goodwill recorded in connection with
the January 28, 2000 acquisition of Direct Sales International. Goodwill related
to the acquisition of Direct Sales International is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over a ten-year period.

     In connection with the acquisition of WeFusion.com, Cross Media recorded
$1.9 million of goodwill, which is being amortized over a seven-year period and
will result in an increase in goodwill amortization of approximately $275,000
per year beginning in 2001.

     In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued of SFAS No.
141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets." The new standards require that all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001 must be accounted for under the purchase method. In
addition, all intangible assets acquired that are obtained through contractual
or legal right, or are capable of being separately sold, transferred, licensed,
rented or exchanged shall be recognized as an asset apart from goodwill.
Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives will no longer be subject to
amortization, but will be subject to at least an annual assessment for
impairment by applying a fair value based test.

     INTEREST EXPENSE

     During 2000, Cross Media recorded interest expense of $4.4 million,
primarily consisting of $2.4 million of non-cash interest related to the fair
value of shares and warrants issued in connection with the initial issuance and
subsequent conversions of the acquisition of Direct Sales International
financings and

approximately $1.9 million related to the amortization of deferred financing
fees and interest on the Coast facility.

     COSTS OF ACQUISITIONS NOT CONSUMMATED

     In August 2000, Cross Media entered into an agreement to acquire National
Syndications, Inc., a direct marketer of consumer products and a party to
service advertising contracts. In February 2001, Cross Media and National
Syndications terminated the agreement. As a result of this termination, in the
fourth quarter of 2000, Cross Media recorded a charge of $967,500, representing
the write-off of non-refundable deposits and professional fees incurred related
to the transaction.

     In February 2000, Cross Media announced its decision not to exercise its
options to purchase 50.1% of the outstanding common stock of AmeriNet or all of
the outstanding common stock of Hamilton Telecommunications, Ltd. As a result,
Cross Media recorded a charge of $621,716 during the fourth quarter of 1999,
representing the cost of legal and professional fees. This charge, which is
presented as the cost of acquisitions not consummated, consists principally of
professional and consulting fees, including $38,000 representing the fair value
of Cross Media common stock purchase warrants and $432,000 representing the fair
value of 225,000 shares of Cross Media common stock that were issued to various
consultants.

     OTHER INCOME

     Other income increased $317,000 to $347,000 in 2000 from $30,000 in 1999.
Included in other income for 2000 is approximately $245,000 of fees earned from
the sale of third-party long distance telephone service, interest income and
other fee income of approximately $102,000. Other income for 1999 represented
interest income earned on Cross Media's overnight investments.

     INCOME TAXES

     Cross Media recorded a $0.3 million provision for income taxes in 2000
reflecting a state tax liability resulting from the Media Outsourcing
operations. No provision was recorded for federal income taxes in 2000 or 1999,
as Cross Media had incurred net operating losses since inception.

     The utilization of net operating losses is subject to a substantial
limitation due to the change of ownership provisions under Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. This limitation may result
in the expiration of the net operating losses before their utilization. A 100%
valuation allowance has been established to reserve for the deferred tax assets
arising from the net operating losses and other temporary differences since
there is no assurance that their benefit will be realized in the future.

     PREFERRED DIVIDENDS

     Cross Media accounted for the issuances of its preferred stock in
accordance with EITF Issue No. 98-5, as amended by EITF Issue 00-27. Both Issues
are titled "Convertible Securities With Beneficial Conversion Features or
Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios." As a result of the issuance and
adoption of EITF 00-27 in November 2000, Cross Media has adjusted preferred
stock dividends recorded in prior fiscal 2000 quarters that were related to
effective beneficial conversion features. In accordance with EITF 00-27, Cross
Media recorded $39.6 million of dividends for 2000, including $38.7 million of
non-cash deemed dividends and contractual dividends of approximately $0.9
million in connection with the issuance of shares of Series A-1, B, and C
preferred stock to complete the acquisition of Direct Sales International on
January 28, 2000 and the issuance of shares of another Series A convertible
preferred stock, referred to as the Series A preferred stock, and additional
shares of Series C convertible preferred stock.

     Deemed dividends represent:

     - the accretion of the difference between the carrying value and the
       mandatory redemption amounts of preferred stock that resulted from
       allocating a portion of the proceeds to Cross Media common

       stock, Cross Media common stock purchase warrants, and the beneficial
       conversion features of the shares;

     - dividends received in connection with the conversion of the Series A-1
       preferred stock into Cross Media common stock on March 27, 2000; and

     - dividends received upon the extension of the redemption date and the
       adjustment of the default conversion price of the Series C convertible
       preferred stock.

     EXTRAORDINARY LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF ACQUISITION LIABILITY

     In connection with the acquisition of Direct Sales International, Cross
Media agreed to provide a $1.5 million credit facility to AmeriNet. In 2000,
Cross Media loaned AmeriNet an aggregate $300,000 pursuant to this credit
facility. In November 2000, Cross Media exchanged 1.0 million shares of its
common stock, with a fair value of $1.9 million, in full satisfaction of the
remaining obligation to AmeriNet and, accordingly, recognized in the fourth
quarter 2000, an extraordinary loss on the extinguishment of acquisition
liability of $767,500.

     NET LOSS AND NET LOSS PER SHARE

     The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $44.6 million, or
$1.84 per share, compared to a net loss of $9.5 million, or $0.80 per share, for
1999. The increase in the net loss to common stockholders reflects the impact of
the $39.6 million of preferred dividends recorded for the year ended December
31, 2000 and increased interest charges related to the acquisition financings,
partially offset by decreased consulting costs and Media Outsourcing's earnings
from January 28, 2000 through December 31, 2000.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     At June 30, 2001, Cross Media had cash on hand of $1.8 million. For the
three months ended June 30, 2001, Cross Media used $2.1 million in operations
and $1.5 million in investing activities and generated $3.1 million from
financing activities. Through the operations of Media Outsourcing, Cross Media
generates cash flow from the sale and collection of consumer receivables,
commissions earned from publishers in connection with originating paid
subscriptions for certain publications, and commissions earned on the sale of
third party discount buying club memberships. Media Outsourcing uses these funds
as well as funds available under its revolving credit facility to fund its
working capital needs.

     Under the Coast facility, Media Outsourcing is generally permitted to make
distributions to Cross Media of up to $400,000 per month, plus any amounts
necessary for Cross Media to satisfy tax obligations attributable to Media
Outsourcing's operations. Cross Media believes that the cash flow from
operations at Media Outsourcing, and the amount available for borrowing under
the revolving credit facility is currently sufficient to meet its day-to-day
operating requirements. However, Media Outsourcing's cash flow would not be
sufficient to complete any additional acquisitions in furtherance of Cross
Media's overall strategy. Consequently, Cross Media may be required to raise
additional financing to fund any future acquisitions.

     During the quarter ended March 31, 2000, Cross Media financed the cash
portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of Direct Sales International
by borrowing $16.0 million under a credit facility provided by Coast Business
Credit and by using proceeds totaling approximately $9.2 million from the
issuance of its common stock, warrants to purchase common stock, convertible
preferred stock and convertible debt. As of March 31, 2001, all of the
convertible debt issued in connection with the acquisition of Direct Sales
International had either been converted into common stock or paid and all of the
convertible preferred stock issued in connection with the acquisition of Direct
Sales of International had either been converted into common stock or redeemed.

     AMERINET COMMITMENT

     In February 2000, Cross Media decided not to exercise its option to acquire
50.1% of the outstanding stock of AmeriNet, Inc., but as a prerequisite to
consummating the acquisition of Direct Sales International, agreed to provide a
$1.5 million credit facility to AmeriNet in addition to a $500,000 loan made
during 1999. Richard Prochnow, the seller of Direct Sales International owns 50%
of the common stock of AmeriNet. Due to the uncertainty of AmeriNet's ability to
repay any of these loans, Cross Media treated its commitment to provide
additional funding to AmeriNet as an increase in the purchase price of Direct
Sales International. Under the original terms of the credit facility, Cross
Media was obligated to lend AmeriNet $100,000 per month for the ten months
beginning in March 2000 through December 2000 inclusive, and on or before July
28, 2000, to purchase for $500,000 a $500,000 principal amount note issued by
AmeriNet to RLP Holdings L.P., an affiliate of Mr. Prochnow. Cross Media loaned
AmeriNet an aggregate of $300,000 in connection with the credit facility. In
November 2000, Cross Media exchanged 1.0 million shares of its common stock,
with a fair value of $1.9 million, in full satisfaction of the remaining
obligation to AmeriNet of $1.2 million and accordingly, recognized in the fourth
quarter of 2000, an extraordinary loss on the extinguishment of acquisition
liability of $767,500.

     COAST BUSINESS CREDIT FINANCING FACILITY

     In connection with the acquisition of Direct Sales International, Media
Outsourcing and Cross Media entered into an agreement with Coast Business Credit
to provide a credit facility used to fund the acquisition of Direct Sales
International and working capital needs of Media Outsourcing. The Coast facility
is for a term of three years, and provides a maximum credit line of $20.0
million, subject to certain availability limitations. As a result of these
limitations, the amount available for borrowing under the Coast facility at the
time of the acquisition of Direct Sales International was $16.0 million, which
Media Outsourcing drew down in its entirety to finance the acquisition of Direct
Sales International. Interest on outstanding advances under the Coast facility
accrues at an annual rate equal to the higher of (a) the prime rate plus 200
basis points, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a
360 day year, and (b) 9.0%. The Coast facility requires Cross Media and Media
Outsourcing to comply with specified financial covenants.

     When the Coast facility was established, Cross Media issued to Coast a
five-year warrant to purchase its common stock. As of December 31, 2000, Coast
was entitled to purchase 443,884 shares of common stock under this warrant at an
exercise price of $2.39 per share. As a result of anti-dilution adjustments, the
number of shares Coast was entitled to purchase under the warrant as of June 30,
2001 increased to 484,669 and the exercise price of the warrant was reduced to
$2.19 per share. Cross Media recorded a non-cash interest charge of
approximately $20,491 for the six month period ended June 30, 2001 as a result
of these adjustments.

     Coast extended the facility to Cross Media, subject to the condition that
we raise additional equity capital of not less than $3 million by February 28,
2000, which was subsequently extended to March 31, 2000. On March 30, 2000, the
Coast facility was amended as follows:

     - the covenant requiring Cross Media to raise additional cash equity of
       $3.0 million was eliminated;

     - the parties reduced the consolidated net worth covenant to $9.0 million
       from $12.0 million at March 31, 2000; and

     - a new covenant was added requiring that Cross Media maintain excess
       borrowing availability of $750,000.

     As of June 30, 2001, the outstanding loan balance under the Coast facility
was approximately $14.6 million and the total amount available for borrowing was
$18.0 million. Therefore, Media Outsourcing was entitled to borrow an additional
$3.4 million under the Coast facility as of June 30, 2001.

     In May 2001, the Coast facility was amended to provide for, among other
things:

     - Coast's waiver of the requirement that Cross Media maintain a minimum
       tangible net worth through March 31, 2001;

     - Coast's waiver of any violation of the limitation on distributions by
       Media Outsourcing to Cross Media with respect to a $1,000,000
       distribution in February 2001 and agreement that commencing in May 2001,
       as long as Media Outsourcing has excess borrowing availability of at
       least $2.0 million under the facility, Media Outsourcing will be
       permitted to distribute a total of up to $400,000 per month to Cross
       Media (in addition to any amounts necessary for Cross Media to satisfy
       tax obligations attributable to Media Outsourcing's operations). Prior to
       the May 2001 amendment, Media Outsourcing was only entitled to distribute
       a total of $150,000 per month plus tax distributions; and

     - Cross Media's agreement to maintain a minimum ratio of senior debt to
       earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization of no
       greater than 1.5 to 1.

     Management expects to be fully in compliance with the provisions of this
agreement going forward.

     SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

     In June and August 2000, Cross Media issued and sold an aggregate of 50,625
shares of Series A convertible preferred stock to The Shaar Fund, Ltd., or
Shaar. The Series A convertible preferred stock is referred to as the Series A
preferred stock or Series A Shares, and is a different series from the Series A
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock referred to below as the Series A-1
preferred stock. The face amount of the Series A preferred stock is $100 per
share or a total of $5,062,500 for all of the outstanding Series A Shares. Cross
Media also issued to Shaar five year warrants to purchase 375,000 shares of
common stock at an initial exercise price of $1.485, subject to certain
anti-dilution and similar adjustments.

     Dividends are payable on the Series A Shares on July 1 and January 1 of
each year, at an annual rate of 10% of the face amount. Dividends are payable in
cash or, if the conditions described in the certificate of designations are
satisfied, in additional shares of Cross Media common stock valued at the
conversion price on the dividend payment date.

     Initially, Cross Media had the right to redeem all, but not less than all,
of the outstanding Series A Shares at a redemption price of 100% of face value
plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, provided that the average of the closing
ask prices of the common stock for the 20 trading days preceding the notice of
redemption were less than $5.00 per share. Cross Media has agreed with Shaar not
to exercise its right of redemption, except as described below.

     The Series A Shares are convertible at the option of Shaar into a number of
shares of Cross Media common stock determined by dividing the applicable
conversion price into the stated value of the Series A Shares. The conversion
price is currently the lower of either $1.9250 or 91% of the average of the
three lowest, non-consecutive closing bid prices for the common stock during the
10 trading days preceding the date of Shaar's notice to Cross Media of the
conversion, with a minimum conversion price of $1.50.

     The conversion price of the Series A Shares, and the exercise price of the
related warrants, are currently subject to downward adjustment to equal the
lowest price at which shares of Cross Media common stock or securities
convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of Cross Media
common stock, are issued while the Series A Shares remain outstanding, subject
to specified exceptions.

     On July 18, 2001, Cross Media entered into agreements with Shaar which
provide that the following will occur, simultaneously with and conditioned upon
the consummation of the merger:

     - Cross Media will redeem 25,312.5 Series A Shares for a cash payment of
       $2,531,250, or $100 per share, provided that Shaar may elect to convert
       these shares into shares of Cross Media common stock at a conversion
       price of $1.48 per share, in which event Shaar would receive 1,710,304
       shares

       of common stock; and Shaar will convert the remaining 25,312.2 Series A
       Shares, at a conversion price of $1.48 per share, into 1,710,304 shares
       of common stock.

     - In consideration of Shaar's agreement to convert at least half of the
       Series A Shares into Cross Media common stock, Cross Media will pay Shaar
       $968,750. Shaar may elect to receive this payment:

        - wholly in cash;

        - in cash and Cross Media common stock, based on a $1.48 price per
          share; or

        - wholly in Cross Media common stock, based on a $1.48 price per share.

     - All accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A Shares that are
       converted and redeemed will be paid through the issuance of additional
       shares of Cross Media common stock, based upon the $1.48 per share
       conversion price.

     - The warrants to purchase 375,000 shares of Cross Media common stock
       issued to Shaar in connection with its purchase of the Series A Shares
       will be amended to replace the existing anti-dilution provisions with
       standard broad-based weighted average anti-dilution provisions. Cross
       Media will issue to Shaar additional 5-year warrants to purchase 250,000
       shares of its common stock with an exercise price of $1.9845. These
       warrants will have the same anti-dilution provisions as the amended
       warrants referred to above.

     These agreements with Shaar also provide that, if the merger agreement is
terminated or the merger is not completed by June 18, 2002, Shaar must elect to:

     - exchange the Series A Shares for a new series of convertible preferred
       stock with a conversion price fixed at $1.48 per share, subject to
       broad-based weighted average anti-dilution protection; or

     - exchange the Series A Shares for a new series of convertible preferred
       stock with the same terms and provisions as the existing Series A Shares,
       except that, during the period beginning on the date of the exchange
       through the earlier of the six month anniversary of the date of the
       exchange and June 9, 2002, the minimum conversion price for the shares in
       the new series will be $1.50 per share, and Cross Media will not be
       permitted to redeem the shares in the new series.

     Cross Media's agreements with Shaar also provide that during the period
from July 18, 2001 through the earlier of the closing of the merger and the
exchange of new Series A Shares for a new series of preferred stock described
above, but in any event no later than July 18, 2002, the minimum conversion
price for the Series A Shares will be $1.50, unless an anti-dilution adjustment
reduces the conversion price to less than $1.50, in which event the $1.50
minimum would no longer apply, and Cross Media will not be permitted to redeem
the Series A Shares.

     SERIES A-1 MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

     On January 28, 2000, in a private placement, Cross Media sold 21,500 units,
each unit consisting of one share of Series A-1 preferred stock, with a face
value of $100, and 20 shares of Cross Media common stock, for gross proceeds of
$2.0 million. The Series A-1 preferred stock was initially convertible into
1,075,000 shares of Cross Media common stock at a conversion ratio of $2.00 per
share and was entitled to a 16% cumulative dividend. Since Series A-1 preferred
stock remained outstanding subsequent to February 27, 2000, Cross Media was
required to issue to the holders an aggregate of 16,125 shares of common stock
per day for each day that the Series A-1 convertible preferred stock remained
outstanding from February 28 through March 28, 2000 and 26,875 shares of common
stock per day for each day that the Series A-1 preferred stock remained
outstanding after March 28, 2000. The Series A-1 preferred stock was mandatorily
redeemable on or before March 28, 2000.

     On March 21, 2000, the holders of the Series A-1 preferred stock extended
the due date for the redemption of their shares from March 28, 2000 to April 12,
2000 in exchange for 275,000 shares of Cross Media common stock. On March 27,
2000, they agreed to convert their shares of Series A-1 preferred

stock into Cross Media common stock. In addition, the Series A-1 preferred
stockholders were issued 2,317,334 five-year common stock purchase warrants,
including 1,158,667 with an exercise price of $0.50 per share and 1,158,667 with
an exercise price of $1.00 per share. One of the Series A-1 preferred stock
holders was issued a warrant to purchase 300,000 shares of Cross Media common
stock at an exercise price of $2.25 per share as a fee in connection with the
March 27, 2000 agreement.

     On March 27, 2000, Cross Media issued an aggregate of 5,118,416 shares to
the former Series A-1 preferred stock holders in respect of Cross Media's
failure to redeem the Series A-1 shares during the period February 28 through
March 27, 2000, the extension of the redemption due date from March 28 to April
12, 2000 and the conversion of the Series A-1 shares into common stock. Cross
Media also issued to these holders warrants to purchase 2,317,334 shares of
common stock.

     SERIES B MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

     On January 28, 2000, in a private placement, Cross Media sold 15,350 units,
each unit consisting of one share of Series B preferred stock, with a face value
of $100, and warrants to purchase 25 shares of Cross Media common stock, for
gross proceeds of $1.5 million. The Series B preferred stock was originally
convertible into 767,500 shares of Cross Media common stock at a conversion
ratio of $2.00 per share and was entitled to a 10% cumulative dividend, payable
quarterly. The common stock purchase warrants were exercisable for three years
from the date of issuance and had an exercise price of $1.50 per share. The
Series B preferred stock was mandatorily redeemable on the earlier of July 26,
2000 or upon the consummation of an additional financing transaction resulting
in gross proceeds of at least $10 million to Cross Media.

     By letter agreement dated June 16, 2000, Cross Media offered to permit the
holders of Series B preferred stock to convert their shares of Series B
preferred stock into Cross Media common stock at an effective conversion ratio
of $0.50 or to redeem the Series B preferred stock at the then effective
redemption price, $100 per share plus accrued dividends. In addition, whether a
holder elected to convert shares of Series B preferred stock or to be redeemed,
Cross Media agreed to issue to the holders, ratably in accordance with their
respective percentage interests in the outstanding Series B preferred stock, an
aggregate of 122,800 three-year warrants to purchase Cross Media common stock at
an exercise price of $0.75 per share and 200,000 three-year warrants to purchase
Cross Media common stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share. Cross Media
also agreed to reduce the exercise price of the original warrants from $1.50 to
$0.75. In addition, Cross Media agreed to issue to placements agents who
received commissions consisting of three-year warrants to purchase a total of
58,163 shares of Cross Media common stock in connection with the original Series
B preferred stock financing a total of 17,820 three-year warrants to purchase

the exercise price of the warrants originally from $1.50 per share to $0.75 per
share.

     The holders of 3,000 shares elected to convert their Series B preferred
stock, and accrued dividends thereon, into an aggregate of 610,333 shares of
Cross Media common stock. Cross Media redeemed the remaining shares of Series B
preferred stock on June 29, 2000 for an aggregate redemption price of

     SERIES C MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

     On January 28, 2000, in a private placement, Cross Media sold 52,892 shares
of Series C convertible preferred stock resulting in proceeds of approximately
$5.0 million. The Series C convertible preferred stock was initially convertible
into shares of Cross Media common stock at a conversion ratio of $2.00 per share
and was entitled to a 10% cumulative dividend. In connection with the initial
issuance and sale of these shares Cross Media also issued 1,763,067 shares of
its common stock to the holders of the Series C convertible preferred stock and
reduced the exercise price of warrants to purchase 2,000,000 shares of common
stock previously issued to a holder of Series C convertible preferred stock from
$3.50 per share to $1.00 per share.

     The Series C convertible preferred stock was originally mandatorily
redeemable on the earlier of July 26, 2000 or upon the consummation of a
financing transaction resulting in gross proceeds of at least $10.0 million to
Cross Media. On April 24, 2000, the holders of the Series C convertible
preferred stock agreed to extend the mandatory redemption date of the Series C
convertible preferred stock from July 26, 2000 to December 26, 2000 in exchange
for 2,247,067 shares of Cross Media common stock and a reduction in the
effective conversion ratio from $2.00 per share to $1.00 per share. The value of
the shares of Cross Media common stock issued and change in the effective
conversion ratio were reflected during the second quarter of 2000 as an
additional deemed dividend in the amount of $8,560,417.

     On June 14, 2000, Cross Media sold an additional 7,500 shares of Series C
convertible preferred stock and 250,000 shares of common stock for a total price
of $750,000. Cross Media also agreed to reduce the exercise price of warrants to
purchase 2,000,000 shares of its common stock held by the purchaser of the
additional shares of Series C convertible preferred stock from $1.00 to $0.50
per share. Cross Media paid a fee in connection with the issuance of the
additional shares of Series C convertible preferred stock of 562.5 shares of
Series C convertible preferred stock, five-year warrants to purchase 100,000
shares of common stock at a price of $1.88 per share and 18,750 shares of Cross
Media common stock.

     On July 18, 2000, the holders of the Series C convertible preferred stock
agreed to waive the requirement that a failure to redeem the Series C
convertible preferred stock on or before December 26, 2000 would trigger a
reduction in the conversion ratio of the Series C convertible preferred stock to
$0.25 per share. In consideration for this waiver, Cross Media agreed to issue
to the holders a total of 1,523,750 shares of common stock, pro rata in
accordance with their percentage holdings of the Series C convertible preferred
stock and additional shares of Series C convertible preferred stock. Cross Media
also paid a fee in connection with the waiver by issuing an additional 1,500
shares of Series C convertible preferred stock and 50,000 shares of common
stock. The value of the shares Cross Media issued in order to obtain the waiver
was reflected during the third quarter of 2000 as an additional deemed dividend
in the amount of $3,026,028.

     On December 19, 2000, the holders of the Series C convertible preferred
stock and the additional shares of Series C convertible preferred stock agreed
to extend the mandatory redemption date of the Series C convertible preferred
stock from December 26, 2000 to January 26, 2001. On January 25, 2001, the
holders agreed to further extend the redemption date from January 26, 2001 to
February 15, 2001. On February 15, 2001, Cross Media redeemed 22,992 shares of
Series C convertible preferred stock for an aggregate redemption price of

of Cross Media common stock at an effective conversion ratio of $1.00 per share.
In consideration of the agreement of the holders to convert the Series C Shares
and New Series C convertible preferred stock, which would otherwise have been
mandatorily redeemable by Cross Media in full on February 15, 2001, Cross Media
agreed to issue to the holders 666,400 additional shares of its common stock,
pro rata in accordance with the number of shares they converted. The value of
the shares of common stock Cross Media issued was reflected in the first quarter
of 2001 as an additional deemed dividend in the amount of $899,640. Cross Media
also agreed to pay a fee of $100,000 to one of the Series C convertible
preferred stockholders in connection with its services relating to the
negotiation of these agreements. There is a note payable of $199,200 related to
the redemption of the Series C convertible preferred stock.

     Cross Media obtained a portion of the funds required to redeem the Series C
convertible preferred stock by selling 1,500,000 shares of its common stock, in
private placements, at a price of $1.00 per share.

ACQUISITION BRIDGE FINANCING

     COMMTEL SERVICES LTD. NOTE

     On January 20, 2000, Cross Media entered into a note agreement with Commtel
Services Ltd. for a 30-day bridge loan in the principal amount of $300,000. The
proceeds of this loan were used in connection with the financing of the
acquisition of Direct Sales International. The Commtel note accrued interest of
a rate of 10% per annum, with principal and interest due and payable on February
20, 2000. In

consideration of the loan, Cross Media issued 75,000 shares of its common stock
to Commtel. Cross Media failed to pay the Commtel note at maturity, as a result
of which:

     - the annual interest rate on the Commtel note increased to 18% on all
       outstanding principal and accrued interest; and

     - Cross Media was required to issue to Commtel an additional 50,000 shares
       of its common stock as of February 21, 2000 and an additional 2,500
       shares of its common stock for each subsequent day until the Commtel note
       was paid or converted, aggregating 77,500 shares on March 21, 2000.

     On March 21, 2000, Commtel converted the Commtel Note into approximately
614,048 shares of Cross Media common stock in satisfaction of all principal and
interest due. The proceeds received from the issuance of the Commtel note with
Cross Media common stock are being allocated to each component based on their
relative fair values on January 20, 2000, the date of issuance. The fair value
of Cross Media common stock on January 20, 2000 was $2.31 per share and resulted
in discounted carrying value to the Commtel note of $200,000 and an increase to
stockholders' equity of $100,000.

     As a result of the conversion of the Commtel note, during the first quarter
of 2000, Cross Media recorded additional interest expense of approximately $1.2
million including interest of 10% on the Commtel note, the fair market value of
additional common stock issued under the penalty provision of the Commtel note,
and the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion of the Commtel note into
614,048 shares of Cross Media common stock.

     FONTENELLE NOTE

     On January 25, 2000, Cross Media borrowed $500,000 from Fontenelle LLC,

     The proceeds of this loan were used primarily in connection with the
financing of the acquisition of Direct Sales International. Interest accrued on
the Fontenelle note at an annual rate of 10% and was due and payable along with
the outstanding principal at maturity. The Fontenelle note was convertible into
shares of Cross Media common stock at a conversion price of $2.00 per share.
Cross Media paid the Fontenelle note in full on March 24, 2000.

     D2 LOAN

     On January 25, 2000, Cross Media borrowed $300,000 from D2 Co. LLC, which

along with the outstanding principal at maturity. The outstanding principal
amount of the loan was convertible into 150,000 shares of Cross Media common
stock at a conversion price of $2.00 per share. If Cross Media did not pay the
loan by July 26, 2000, the conversion price would have been reduced to $0.50 per
share, representing 600,000 shares of Cross Media common stock. Cross Media paid
the loan in full on June 12, 2000.

NOTES PAYABLE

     MANAGEMENT GROUP NOTE

- ---------------
(1) In connection with the termination, effective as of January 28, 2000, of the
    consulting agreement among Cross Media, Executive Management Services and
    Rupert Galliers-Pratt, Cross Media granted Executive Management Services
    options to purchase 125,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of
    $2.50 per share, with an expiration date of August 3, 2005. By letter dated
    November 1, 1999, Mr. Galliers-Pratt resigned as Chief Executive Officer and
    Co-Chairman of the Board of Directors, effective January 28, 2000. In
    addition, Mr. Ledwick resigned as Chief Financial Officer effective April
    27, 2001.

(2) Each option has a maximum term of 10 years, subject to earlier termination
    in the event of the optionee's cessation of service with Cross Media. Each
    option provides for adjustments to the exercise price and corresponding
    proportional adjustments in the number of shares purchasable upon exercise
    in the event of any stock splits, reverse stock splits and the payment of
    dividends on the common stock of Cross Media. In the event of any capital
    reorganization, any reclassification of the common stock of Cross Media, or
    the consolidation or merger of Cross Media, each referred to as a
    reorganization, in which Cross Media is the continuing corporation, the
    option holder is entitled, upon exercise of the options, to purchase the
    number and kind of shares, interests or other property that the option
    holder would have been entitled to receive had the option holder exercised
    the options immediately prior to any reorganization. In the event of a
    dissolution or liquidation of Cross Media, or any reorganization in which
    Cross Media is not the continuing corporation, each option terminates;
    provided, however, that in the event of a reorganization in which Cross
    Media is not the continuing corporation, the continuing corporation may, but
    is not obligated to, tender to any optionee options to purchase shares of
    the continuing corporation and if the continuing corporation does not so
    tender options to purchase shares of the continuing corporation, all options
    granted become immediately exercisable notwithstanding any installment
    provision provided for under any option grant.

(3) The exercise price may be paid in cash or, in the sole discretion of the
    board of directors:

     - by delivery of other shares of Cross Media common stock (valued at fair
       market value on the exercise date);

     - through cashless exercise (by reducing the number of shares otherwise
       purchasable upon exercise);

     - through use of a note payable to the order of Cross Media in the amount
       of the purchase price due upon exercise, or through any other deferred
       payment arrangement approval by the board of directors; or

     - by use of any other legal consideration.

     EMPLOYMENT AND CONSULTING CONTRACTS

     In January 1999, Cross Media entered into an employment agreement with
Ronald Altbach. Under Mr. Altbach's 1999 employment agreement, Cross Media paid
Mr. Altbach $112,500, in consideration of services rendered as Chief Operating
Officer through June 30, 1999, and $175,000 in consideration of services
rendered as Chief Operating Officer from July 1 through December 31, 1999.
During each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 1999 and December 31, 2000,
Cross Media also paid Mr. Altbach a $2,000 monthly car allowance. In April 2001,
Cross Media entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Altbach, effective
May 1, 2001. Under Mr. Altbach's 2001 employment agreement, Mr. Altbach will be
entitled to a minimum annual base salary of $425,000 plus non-discretionary
quarterly bonuses, ranging from a minimum of $25,000 to a maximum of $75,000,
based, for fiscal year 2001, upon Cross Media's earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, results for the last three fiscal quarters of the
fiscal year and, for subsequent fiscal years, upon Cross Media achieving
quarterly performance goals set by the board of directors. Mr. Altbach will also
be entitled to an annual bonus of $50,000 for 2001 if Cross Media's consolidated
revenues are at least $100 million and an annual bonus for 2002 and 2003, in

amounts determined by the board of directors, based upon performance goals
established by the board of directors. Mr. Altbach receives a maximum monthly

1 subsequent to the effective date of the new Altbach employment agreement. The
term of Mr. Altbach's 2001 employment agreement continues through December 31,
2003. However, Cross Media may terminate Mr. Altbach's employment at any time,
with or without cause, provided that any termination without cause requires
Cross Media to continue to pay Mr. Altbach his base salary, benefits and
guaranteed bonuses through the end of the term and results in acceleration of
vesting of all unvested options granted to him. If Mr. Altbach's employment is
terminated by Cross Media following a change in control of Cross Media, he is
entitled to his base salary and bonus pro-rated through the date of termination,
a $200,000 severance payment and immediate vesting of all unvested options. Mr.
Altbach is also entitled to a $425,000 severance payment if Cross Media fails to
extend the term of Mr. Altbach's employment beyond December 31, 2003.

     In May 2000, Cross Media entered into an employment agreement with Richard
Kaufman, which agreement was amended, effective May 1, 2001. Under Mr. Kaufman's
employment agreement, Mr. Kaufman is entitled to a minimum annual base salary of
$330,000 plus non-discretionary quarterly bonuses, ranging from a minimum of
$25,000 to a maximum of $75,000, based, for fiscal year 2001, upon Cross Media's
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization results for the
last three fiscal quarters of the fiscal year and, for subsequent fiscal years,
upon Cross Media achieving quarterly performance goals set by the board of
directors. Mr. Kaufman will also be entitled to an annual bonus of $50,000 for
2001 if Cross Media's consolidated revenues are at least $100 million and an
annual bonus for 2002 and 2003, in amounts determined by the board of directors,
based upon performance goals established by the board of directors. Mr. Kaufman
receives a maximum monthly car allowance of $1,500, which amount will increase
by five percent on each May 1 subsequent to the effective date of the employment
agreement. The term of Mr. Kaufman's employment agreement continues through
December 31, 2003. However, Cross Media may terminate Mr. Kaufman's employment
at any time, with or without cause, provided that any termination without cause
requires Cross Media to continue to pay Mr. Kaufman his base salary, benefits
and guaranteed bonuses through the end of the term and results in acceleration
of vesting of all unvested options granted to him. If Mr. Kaufman's employment
is terminated by Cross Media following a change in control of Cross Media, he is
entitled to his base salary and bonus pro-rated through the date of termination,
a $200,000 severance payment and acceleration of vesting of all unvested
options. Mr. Kaufman is also entitled to a $330,000 severance payment if Cross
Media fails to extend the term of Mr. Kaufman's employment beyond December 31,
2003.

     care of Cross Media, 461 Fifth Avenue, 19th Floor, New York, NY 10017.

 (2) Unless otherwise indicated and subject to applicable community property
     laws, Cross Media believes that all persons named in the table have sole
     voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock
     beneficially owned by them. A person is deemed to be the beneficial owner
     of securities that may be acquired by that person within 60 days of August
     1, 2001 upon the exercise of options, warrants or convertible securities.
     Each beneficial owner's percentage of ownership is determined by assuming
     all options, warrants or convertible securities that are held by that
     person (but not held by any other person) and which are exercisable or
     convertible within 60 days of August 1, 2001 have been exercised or
     converted. Percent of Class (third column above) is based on 36,533,328
     shares of Cross Media common stock outstanding as of August 1, 2001
     (including 337,552 shares of Cross Media common stock that Cross Media was
     legally committed to issue as of that date but which had not yet been
     processed by Cross Media's transfer agent), as adjusted to give effect to
     the assumptions regarding conversion and exercise in the previous sentence.

                      CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS OF CROSS MEDIA

     During 2000, Cross Media paid Capital Research Ltd., a beneficial owner of
more than 5% of Cross Media common stock, approximately $128,000 in cash and
issued warrants to purchase 150,000 shares of common stock with a fair value of
approximately $116,000 for consulting services. Cross Media also paid Capital
Research approximately $44,000 in cash, issued 5,455 shares of Series C
convertible preferred stock, with a fair value of approximately $330,000, issued
1,039,672 shares of common stock, with a fair value of approximately $1.8
million, and issued warrants to purchase 417,334 shares of common stock with a
fair value of approximately $1.1 million for services provided in connection
with the initial issuance and subsequent agreements with the holders of Cross
Media's Series A-1 and Series C convertible preferred stock.

     During 1999 and 2000, Cross Media paid a total of $85,000 and $181,000,
respectively, to a consulting firm owned by Richard Kaufman, a Director of Cross
Media, and, as of May 2000, Cross Media's President and Chief Operating Officer,
for services rendered in connection with the financing relating to Cross Media's
acquisition of substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of Direct
Sales International. The 2000 payment consisted of a $125,000 success fee and
warrants to purchase 30,000 shares of common stock with a fair value of
approximately $56,000.

     During 2000, Cross Media paid approximately $575,000 to Richard Prochnow,
the seller of Direct Sales International, and a beneficial owner of more than 5%
of Cross Media common stock, for consulting fees and expenses, and paid
approximately $200,000 in property lease payments to a partnership of which Mr.
Prochnow is a partner.

     On January 28, 2000, Cross Media acquired substantially all of the assets
and certain liabilities of Direct Sales International for approximately $27.6
million, including:

     - $25.0 million in cash paid to the seller;

     - an agreement to loan $1.5 million to AmeriNet, Inc., referred to as
       AmeriNet, a company in which Mr. Prochnow holds a majority interest; and

     - approximately $1.1 million in closing costs and fees.

     In connection with the acquisition of Direct Sales International, in June
1999, Cross Media issued 2,500,000 shares of common stock to Mr. Prochnow for a
$2,500,000 principal amount promissory note bearing interest at a rate of 7.75%
per annum payable on the earlier of December 31, 2000 and the closing date. On
January 28, 2000, Cross Media and Mr. Prochnow agreed to extend the maturity
date of the promissory note to January 14, 2003 (except that the promissory note
is mandatorily prepayable out of one-third of the net proceeds of any sale of
Mr. Prochnow's common stock) and to rescind the requirement to pay interest on
outstanding amounts not yet due. Instead, the amended promissory note provides
for interest at 10% per annum, commencing on the date of any payment default.
Cross Media also granted Mr. Prochnow the right to sell up to 600,000 shares of
common stock to Cross Media at $3.00 per share between January 15, 2001 and
March 15, 2001, agreed to register 1,000,000 of the 2,500,000 shares by May 28,
2000 and released its lien on the 600,000 shares.

     In February 2000, Cross Media decided not to exercise an option it held to
acquire 50.1% of the outstanding stock of AmeriNet, but as a prerequisite to
consummating the acquisition of Direct Sales International agreed to provide a
$1.5 million credit facility to AmeriNet in addition to a $500,000 loan made
during 1999. Mr. Prochnow owns 50% of the common stock of AmeriNet. Due to the
uncertainty of AmeriNet's ability to repay any of the loans, Cross Media treated
its commitment to provide additional

funding to AmeriNet as an increase in the purchase price of Direct Sales
International. Under the original terms of the AmeriNet credit facility,
referred to as the loan agreement, Cross Media was obligated:

     - to lend AmeriNet $100,000 per month for the 10 months from March through
       December 2000; and

     - on or before July 28, 2000, to purchase for $500,000 a $500,000 principal
       amount note, bearing interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per
       annum, referred to as the RLP note, issued by AmeriNet to RLP Holdings
       L.P., referred to as RLP, an affiliate of Mr. Prochnow.

Cross Media loaned AmeriNet an aggregate of $300,000 under the loan agreement.

     As of November 1, 2000, RLP sold the RLP Note to Cross Media in
consideration for the issuance by Cross Media to RLP of 1,000,000 shares of
Cross Media common stock. Cross Media, Mr. Prochnow and AmeriNet also agreed to
terminate Cross Media's obligation to make any further loans to AmeriNet under
the loan agreement. Cross Media also agreed to:

     - file a registration statement with the SEC as soon as reasonably
       practicable covering the 2,500,000 shares owned by Mr. Prochnow and the
       1,000,000 shares owned by RLP, subject to the agreement of Mr. Prochnow
       and RLP, for a period of one year from the effective date of the
       registration statement, not to sell any more shares, in the aggregate,
       than Mr. Prochnow would be entitled to sell during that period in
       compliance with Rule 144(e)(1) under the Securities Act of 1933, as
       amended; and

     - extend the exercise period of Mr. Prochnow's right to sell up to 600,000
       shares of Cross Media at $3.00 per share from March 15, 2001 until the
       180th day following the effective date of the registration statement.

     On January 28, 2000, in connection with the acquisition of the assets of
Direct Sales International, Lancer Offshore, Inc., referred to as Lancer,
purchased 1,900,000 shares of common stock, 20,000 shares of Cross Media's
Series A convertible preferred stock, par value $0.001, referred to as the
Series A-1 preferred stock, constituting all of the issued and outstanding
Series A-1 preferred stock, and, as described below, 45,000 shares of its Series
C convertible preferred stock, par value $0.001, referred to as the Series C
convertible preferred stock, for aggregate consideration of $6,500,000.

     The Series A-1 preferred stock was initially redeemable at an aggregate
redemption price of $100 per share, together with accrued dividends at a rate of
16% per annum. Since Series A-1 preferred stock remained outstanding subsequent
to February 27, 2000, Cross Media was required to issue to Lancer and Capital
Research, as the holders of the Series A-1 preferred stock, an aggregate of
16,125 shares of Cross Media common stock per day for each day that the Series
A-1 preferred stock remained outstanding from February 28 through March 28, 2000
and 26,875 shares of Cross Media common stock per day for each day that the
Series A-1 preferred stock remained outstanding after March 28, 2000. On March
21, 2000, Lancer and Capital Research agreed to extend the mandatory redemption
date of the Series A-1 preferred stock from March 28 to April 12, 2000 in
consideration of the issuance to them of an aggregate of 275,000 shares of Cross
Media common stock.

     If the Series A-1 preferred stock were not redeemed by the mandatory
redemption date, Cross Media would have been required to issue, monthly in
advance, five-year warrants to purchase 215,000 shares of Cross Media common
stock at an exercise price of $.10 per share, for each 30-day period the Series
A-1 preferred stock remained outstanding from and after the mandatory redemption
date and the conversion price at which the Series A-1 preferred stock were
convertible into shares of Cross Media common stock would have decreased from
$2.00 to $0.10.

     On March 27, 2000, Cross Media issued to Lancer and Capital Research, in
full satisfaction of their rights as holders of the Series A-1 preferred stock:

     - an aggregate of 5,118,416 shares of Cross Media common stock, (of which
       Lancer received 4,556,666 shares and Capital Research received 561,750
       shares);

     - warrants to purchase 1,158,667 shares of Cross Media common stock at an
       exercise price of $0.50 per share (of which Lancer received warrants to
       purchase 1,000,000 shares and Capital Research received warrants to
       purchase 158,667 shares); and

     - warrants to purchase 1,158,667 shares of Cross Media common stock at an
       exercise price of $1.00 per share (of which Lancer received warrants to
       purchase 1,000,000 shares and Capital Research received warrants to
       purchase 158,667 shares).

     On January 28, 2000, also in connection with the acquisition of Direct
Sales International, Cross Media issued 52,892 Series C convertible preferred
stock and 1,763,067 shares of Cross Media common stock resulting in net proceeds
to Cross Media totaling approximately $5.0 million. Lancer purchased 45,000 of
the Series C convertible preferred stock and 1,500,000 shares of Cross Media
common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $4.5 million. In connection with
this purchase, Cross Media also reduced the exercise price of 2,000,000 warrants
previously issued to Lancer and an affiliate of Lauer from $3.50 per share to
$1.00 per share. On June 14, 2000, Cross Media issued and sold an additional
7,500 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock, par value $.001, and
250,000 shares of Cross Media common stock to Lancer for an aggregate purchase
price of $750,000. In connection with this issuance and sale, Cross Media agreed
to reduce the exercise price of warrants to purchase 2,000,000 shares of Cross
Media common stock held by Lancer and an affiliate from $1.00 to $0.50 per
share.

     Cross Media and the holders of the Series C convertible preferred stock,
including Lancer and Capital Research, Ltd., referred to as Capital Research,
entered into agreements in April, July and December 2000 and January 2001
pursuant to which the holders of the Series C convertible preferred stock agreed
to waive certain defaults and other rights granted to them in the certificate of
designations covering the Series C convertible preferred stock. These holders
received consideration for the waivers, in the form of shares of common stock,
warrants and other rights, ratably in accordance with the respective pro rata
ownership interests in the Series C Shares.

     Pursuant to an agreement among Cross Media and the holders of the Series C
convertible preferred stock, on February 15, 2001, Cross Media redeemed an
aggregate of 22,992 Series C convertible preferred stock, 16,665 of which were
owned by Lancer and 5,454.5 were owned by Capital Research, for an aggregate
redemption price of $2,299,200 plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the
redemption date of $122,300, of which Lancer received a total of $1,738,417.81
and Capital Research received a total of $230,739.68; the holders converted all
of the remaining Series C convertible preferred stock into 3,946,250 shares of
Cross Media common stock, of which Lancer received 3,583,500 shares and Capital
Research received 362,750 shares; and, in consideration of the agreement of the
holders to convert the Series C convertible preferred stock, which would
otherwise have been mandatorily redeemable by Cross Media in full on February
15, 2001, Cross Media issued to the holders, pro rata in accordance with the
number of Series C convertible preferred stock converted by each of them, an
aggregate of 666,400 additional shares of Cross Media common stock, of which
Lancer received 605,500 shares and Capital Research received 60,900 shares.

     Cross Media believes, based on its review of its stock ledger and
information provided to it by its transfer agent, that, as of March 1999, when
it made its initial acquisition of securities of Cross Media, Lancer
beneficially owned approximately 16.5% of Cross Media common stock and Michael
Lauer, in his capacity as a general partner of Lancer Partners, which also
acquired beneficial ownership of approximately 16.5% of Cross Media common stock
in March 1999, and investment manager of Lancer indirectly beneficially owned
approximately 33% of Cross Media common stock. As of July 31, 2001, Lancer
beneficially owned approximately 49% of Cross Media common stock and Mr. Lauer
indirectly beneficially owned approximately 55% of Cross Media common stock.

     In June and August 2000, Cross Media issued and sold an aggregate of 50,625
shares of Series A convertible preferred stock to The Shaar Fund, Ltd., or
Shaar. The Series A preferred stock is referred to as the Series A convertible
preferred stock or Series A Shares, and is a different series from the Series A
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock referred to as the Series A-1 preferred
stock. The face amount of the Series A preferred stock is $100 per share or a
total of $5,062,500 for all of the outstanding Series A

Shares. Cross Media also issued to Shaar five-year warrants to purchase 375,000
shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of $1.485, subject to
certain anti-dilution and similar adjustments.

     Initially, Cross Media had the right, to redeem all, but not less than all,
of the outstanding Series A Shares at a redemption price of 100% of face value
plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, provided that the average of the closing
ask prices of the common stock of Cross Media for the 20 trading days preceding
the notice of redemption were less than $5.00 per share. Cross media has agreed
with Shaar that it will not exercise its right of redemption, except as
described below.

     The conversion price is currently equal to the lower of $1.9250 and 91% of
the average of the three lowest, non-consecutive closing bid prices for the
common stock of Cross Media during the 10 trading days preceding the date of
Shaar's notice to Cross Media of the conversion, with a minimum conversion price
of $1.50.

     The conversion price of the Series A Shares, and the exercise price of the
related warrants, were subject to downward adjustment to equal the lowest price
at which shares of Cross Media common stock or securities convertible into, or
exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of Cross Media common stock, are issued
while the Series A Shares remain outstanding, subject to specified exceptions.

     By letter agreement dated December 28, 2000, Shaar agreed not to convert
the Series A Shares prior to June 9, 2001 if, on the date of the proposed
conversion, the then-current market price of Cross Media common stock is less
than $1.50 per share and Cross Media agreed not to redeem the Series A Shares.

     On July 18, 2001, Cross Media entered into agreements with Shaar which
provide that the following will occur, simultaneously with and conditioned upon
the consummation of the merger:

     - Cross Media will redeem 25,312.5 Series A Shares for a cash payment of
       $2,531,250, or $100 per share, provided that Shaar may elect to convert
       these shares into shares of Cross Media common stock at a conversion
       price of $1.48 per share, in which event Shaar would receive 1,710,304
       shares of Cross Media common stock; and Shaar will convert the remaining
       25,312.2 Series A Shares, at a conversion price of $1.48 per share, into
       1,710,304 shares of common stock.

     - In consideration of Shaar's agreement to convert at least half of the
       Series A Shares into Cross Media common stock, Cross Media, will pay
       Shaar $968,750. Shaar may elect to receive this payment:

        - wholly in cash;

        - in cash and Cross Media common stock, based on a $1.48 price per
          share; or

        - wholly in Cross Media common stock.

     - All accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A Shares that are
       converted and redeemed will be paid through the issuance of additional
       shares of Cross Media common stock, based upon the $1.48 per share
       conversion price.

     - The warrants to purchase 375,000 shares of Cross Media common stock
       issued to Shaar in connection with its purchase of the Series A Shares
       will be amended to replace the existing anti-dilution provisions with
       standard broad-based weighted average anti-dilution provisions. Cross
       Media will issue to Shaar additional 5-year warrants to purchase 250,000
       shares of its common stock with an exercise price of $1.9845. These
       warrants will have the same anti-dilution provisions as the amended
       warrants referred to above.

     These agreements with Shaar also provide that, if the merger agreement is
terminated or the merger is not completed by June 18, 2002, Shaar must elect to
do one of the following:

     - Exchange the Series A Shares for a new series of convertible preferred
       stock with a conversion price fixed at $1.48 per share, subject to
       broad-based weighted average anti-dilution protection. Cross Media would
       be required to redeem these shares at their stated value, $100 per share,
       plus accrued and unpaid dividends on June 9, 2004, but would have no
       right to redeem the shares at any

       time prior to June 9, 2004. The new series would contain substantially
       the same provisions with respect to dividends, voting rights, protective
       provisions, liquidation preference and seniority as the existing Series A
       Shares. If Shaar elects this alternative, Shaar's existing warrants to
       purchase 375,000 shares of Cross Media common stock will be amended to
       provide for standard broad-based weighted average anti-dilution
       provisions, but Cross Media will not issue additional warrants to the
       holder; or

     - Exchange the Series A Shares for a new series of convertible preferred
       stock with the same terms and provisions as the existing Series A Shares,
       except that, during the period beginning on the date of the exchange
       through the earlier of the six month anniversary of the date of the
       exchange and June 9, 2002, the minimum conversion price for the shares in
       the new series will be $1.50 per share, and Cross Media will not be
       permitted to redeem the shares in the new series.

     Cross Media's agreements with Shaar also provide that during the period
from July 18, 2001 through the earlier of the closing of the merger and the
exchange of new Series A Shares for a new series of preferred stock described
above but in any event no later than July 18, 2002, the minimum conversion price
for the Series A Shares will be $1.50, unless an anti-dilution adjustment
reduces the conversion price to less than $1.50, in which event the $1.50
minimum would no longer apply, and Cross Media will not be permitted to redeem
the Series A Shares.

     Media Outsourcing, a subsidiary of Cross Media, entered into a five-year
services agreement with TBC Telemarketing Inc., effective July 1, 2001 under
which TBC is providing two senior consultants to train, manage and supervise one
or more telemarketing centers selected by Media Outsourcing. As compensation for
its services, TBC receives a base monthly retainer of $35,000, subject to an
increase of 50% of the base retainer for each additional consultant TBC provides
at Media Outsourcing's request, and a mark-up of all call center fees. TBC is
also eligible to receive monthly bonuses based on the number of qualified orders
received by the call centers supervised by TBC. Media Outsourcing must pay TBC a
termination fee of $200,000 if it terminates the services agreement, unless
termination is for cause. Dan Berman, Senior Vice President -- Operations of
Cross Media, is Chairman of the Board of TBC.

     Upon the commencement of Dan Berman's employment with Media Outsourcing,
Media Outsourcing loaned TBC $200,000. Interest on the loan is payable monthly,
at an annual rate of 7%. The loan will be repaid by applying 20% of any monthly
bonus payments payable under the services agreement, beginning in the seventh
month and, upon termination of the services agreement, any remaining principal
and interest on the loan becomes due and payable.

     LifeMinders' email offerings are characterized by the following:

     Targeted, relevant content.  LifeMinders' technology matches content and
advertisements to individual member interests at a detailed level. Each piece of
information and each advertising placement may be targeted to a separate
variable in the database, providing a personalized experience for members and a
rich environment for advertisers.

     Enhanced user efficiency.  LifeMinders' personalized, content-rich emails
on specific interests enable members to efficiently access information on the
web. LifeMinders delivers each message in a brief, user-friendly email format,
either text or HTML, that it determines is most appropriate for each member's
mail client. The targeted messages contain embedded links that go directly to
full-text articles and helpful information on the internet. These links
supplement the content within the messages and provide easily accessible
information to our members.

     Member trust and confidence.  LifeMinders is certified by TRUSTe, a
leading, independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build Internet
users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the principles of
disclosure and informed consent. As a result, members are able to exercise a
significant amount of control over their experiences. LifeMinders' service also
allows members to modify their profiles or subscription information or
unsubscribe at any time by clicking through a link in the email messages or by
accessing their account information on LifeMinders' website.

     Detailed reporting and data mining technology.  LifeMinders' capabilities
include sophisticated data mining techniques and timely reporting technology to
evaluate the results of advertising partners' marketing campaigns. This
information can be easily accessed in a timely reporting environment, allowing
LifeMinders to quickly adjust its programs to improve the member experience or
advertiser performance.

OUTSOURCING UNIT

     LifeMinders' outsourcing unit, launched in late 2000, enabled other
companies to deliver targeted marketing messages to their own customers via
email, thereby creating opportunities to enhance

communication with their customers, increase revenue opportunities and heighten
loyalty for their brands. The outsourcing unit ceased its operations subsequent
to June 30, 2001 in connection with the scaling back of LifeMinders' business
operations.

SALES AND MARKETING

     LifeMinders historically utilized online and offline media for member
acquisition. These marketing efforts consisted primarily of advertising
campaigns and strategic partnerships with a variety of Web sites including large
portals, networks, affiliate sites and smaller vertical sites. LifeMinders sold
its advertising inventory and outsourcing services through a direct sales
organization dedicated to developing and maintaining close relationships with
advertisers and advertising agencies nationwide. LifeMinders substantially
reduced its member acquisition efforts and sales of advertising inventory and
outsourcing services in May 2001 in connection with the scaling back of its
business operations.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

     In the year ended December 31, 2000, LifeMinders spent approximately $7.8
million on research and development efforts on new or improved technologies
designed to enhance the performance of its services. Research and development
costs included the salaries, stock-based compensation and related expenses for
the engineering department, as well as costs for contracted services and
co-location facilities and depreciation on equipment. LifeMinders substantially
reduced its research and development efforts in May 2001 in connection with the
scaling back of its business operations.

TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE

     LifeMinders' consumer product offerings are supported by three core
technology components:

     - Email creation and management software;

     - Member targeting and behavior tracking system; and

     - Data warehouse.

EMAIL CREATION AND MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

     LifeMinders' email creation and management software has four components:
content entry, targeting, personalization and formatting. The content entry
component allows an editorial staff to input, revise and test email content
items. The content entry software is a web-based application. The targeting
component allows email content items to be sent to members based on explicit
data that members have provided, including important dates and special interests
as well as implicit data based on demographic and psychographic groups defined
by the editorial staff. The personalization component allows the editorial staff
to enhance content by personalizing it for each individual member.

     The formatting component allows the editorial staff to compose each email
content item in a single, rich text format, which will automatically adjust to
one of three formats in order to provide optimum presentation of the content.
Members with HTML email, supported by most current email services and email
clients, will receive a quality presentation of content because it includes
images as well as text. Members using America Online or plain text email receive
a version of content that is more textual in presentation, but is designed to be
attractive and easy to read.

MEMBER TARGETING AND BEHAVIOR TRACKING SYSTEM

     This system allows category managers to improve and adjust email content
over time to reflect the needs and interests of LifeMinders' members. Category
managers can personalize the subject lines, content titles and physical displays
of email messages.

     LifeMinders content targeting and behavior tracking system uses standard
Internet data transmission protocols, combined with proprietary application
software, to measure a wide range of possible member

behaviors in emails. These behaviors may include: opening an HTML email message,
clicking through to content links or clicking through to advertisements and
online coupons. This system has been built to be scalable, to allow new
categories to be brought online without additional programming. In addition,
this system is based on member profile data that allows categories and
subcategories to be changed to reflect member preferences and lifestyles.

     Tracking individual member activity in emails allows LifeMinders' category
managers to measure the effectiveness and interest level of members in the
editorial content. At the same time, the tracking systems support the
measurement of the effectiveness and efficiency of advertising and promotional
campaigns on behalf of LifeMinders' advertising partners.

DATA WAREHOUSE

     The advanced data warehouse is a scalable decision support system that
currently contains over 900 gigabytes of historical data. The data is refreshed
daily and accessed through SAS, SQL, and other sophisticated analysis tools.
Individual member behavior and preferences are tracked in emails at the click
and email level.

     LifeMinders' technology incorporates a variety of security techniques
designed to protect confidential member data. LifeMinders limits member
activity, data transmission and Internet access to its proprietary information
to the individual member and to authorized company representatives. It monitors
and protects all outside access to its resources and data and all suspicious
activity is logged and analyzed by qualified staff. LifeMinders' data center is
hosted at a major third-party Internet data center operation, which is
constantly monitored and provides both physical and logistical security. These
facilities provide redundant network connections and redundant connections to
power grids and diesel generators to help ensure continuous operations. In
addition, the facilities provide physical security, around-the-clock operations
support and monitoring, and network diagnostic support as needed.

     LifeMinders' technology platform uses industry standard technologies to
maximize reliability. The company attempts to ensure hardware reliability by a
combination of redundancy at the component level and hot spares for groups of
components. LifeMinders attempts to ensure software and data reliability through
a variety of processes and quality assurance procedures. It has incorporated
standard procedures, including daily database backups, off site storage of
critical archives and incremental backup of ongoing database modifications into
its standard operating discipline. Additional reliability is provided by fault
tolerant and redundant platform architecture, which utilizes clustering
technology designed to ensure that access to LifeMinders' system is not
interrupted by any single machine failure.

     Overall, LifeMinders' technology placement is designed to be scalable,
secure and reliable.

CORPORATE HISTORY

     OVERVIEW

     LifeMinders was incorporated in Maryland on August 9, 1996 under the name
of MinderSoft, Inc. In January 1999, LifeMinders changed its name to
LifeMinders.com, Inc. and reincorporated in Delaware on July 2, 1999. In June
2000, by way of merger, LifeMinders changed its name to LifeMinders, Inc. From
1996 to 1998, LifeMinders entered into arrangements with national retailers to
distribute its reminder products in software form on disk. In late 1998,
LifeMinders shifted its focus to the Internet. LifeMinders completed its initial
public offering of common stock on November 19, 1999, raising approximately $62
million. On February 8, 2000, LifeMinders completed a follow-on public offering
of common stock, raising approximately $86 million.

     Late in the fourth quarter of 2000, LifeMinders initiated significant
expense reductions that included reducing its workforce by 24% during the first
quarter of 2001, closing its wireless segment and decreasing sales and marketing
and general and administrative costs. On May 10, 2001, LifeMinders announced a
scaling back of its business operations and reduction in workforce to a team of
approximately 30 to 35 employees to maintain its email products while it
continued to evaluate strategic alternatives. Since the

May 2001 announcement, LifeMinders has successfully scaled back its business
operations and has reduced its workforce to approximately 30 employees.

COMPETITION

     LifeMinders faces intense competition from all forms of advertising and
direct marketing businesses, both online and offline. LifeMinders' scaled back
operations will make it more difficult to maintain its market position, should
the merger not be completed. LifeMinders' competitors include online portals and
community Web sites such as AOL, Yahoo!, and CNET Networks, Inc. and networks
such as DoubleClick. In addition, other companies offer competitive email direct
marketing services, including coolsavings.com, MyPoints.com, NetCreations,
YesMail.com and Digital Impact.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

     LifeMinders' ability to compete depends substantially on its internally
developed technologies and trademarks, which it protects through a combination
of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, service marks and trademarks. LifeMinders
has one registered patent. LifeMinders has historically entered into
confidentiality or license agreements with its employees, consultants and
corporate and strategic partners and generally seeks to control access to and
distribution of its documentation and other proprietary information. LifeMinders
has pursued the registration of its trade and service marks in the United States
and internationally. LifeMinders has registered trademarks for "MinderSoft,"
"HomeMinder," "EntertainmentMinder, "GrowthMinder," "CarcareMinder,"
"PersonalMinder" and "backslashSanity" in the United States and has filed 20
pending trademark applications in the United States. Effective trademark,
service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in
every country in which LifeMinders' services are distributed or made available
through the Internet, and policing unauthorized use of proprietary information
is difficult.

CURRENT AND POTENTIAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION

     Laws and regulations directly applicable to Internet-based communications,
commerce and advertising are becoming increasingly prevalent. In addition to
laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally, the nature of
LifeMinders' business may subject it to specialized regulation. Accordingly, in
addition to the areas discussed below, LifeMinders may be subject to existing
laws and regulations relating to issues such as defamation, advertising,
sweepstakes, promotions, content regulation, and intellectual property ownership
and infringement.

USER PRIVACY ISSUES

     The Federal Trade Commission adopted regulations effective April 21, 2000,
regarding the collection and use of personal identifying information obtained
from minors when accessing Web sites. These regulations also include enforcement
and redress provisions. LifeMinders has implemented programs designed to comply
with these regulations. LifeMinders does not believe that compliance with these
regulations will result in significant costs.

     The European Union, or EU, has adopted a directive that imposes
restrictions on the collection and use of personal data. Under the directive, EU
citizens are guaranteed rights to access their data, to know where the data
originated, to have inaccurate data corrected, to take recourse in the event of
unlawful processing and to withhold permission to use their data for direct
marketing. In addition, the directive restricts entities from transmitting
personal information to countries that do not maintain an adequate level of
privacy protection. The directive does not, however, define what standards of
privacy are adequate. The directive could, among other things, affect U.S.
companies that collect information over the Internet from individuals in EU
member countries, and may impose restrictions that are more stringent than
current Internet privacy standards in the United States. The U.S. Department of
Commerce, or DOC, has negotiated a "safe harbor" with the EU. Under the safe
harbor, U.S. companies that follow, and certify that they follow, certain
principles with respect to personal data may collect this personal information

without violating the directive. The EU approved the safe harbor in July 2000,
and in November 2000, the DOC made available the initial list of companies
certifying compliance with the safe harbor. Although the safe harbor includes
enforcement provisions, the practical effect of enforcement has not been
realized. As a result, the directive and the safe harbor may adversely affect
the activities of entities like LifeMinders that engage in data collection from
users in EU member countries.

INTERNET TAXATION

     A number of legislative proposals are currently pending at the federal,
state and local level, and in certain foreign governments, that would impose
additional taxes on the sale of goods and services over the Internet, and
certain states already have taken measures to tax Internet-related activities.
Although Congress recently placed a temporary moratorium on state and local
taxes on Internet access or on discriminatory taxes on e-commerce, existing
state or local laws were expressly excepted from this moratorium. Further, once
this moratorium is lifted, one or more federal and/or state taxes may be imposed
upon Internet commerce. Currently, states are considering adoption of simplified
sales and use tax laws as a step to encourage Congress to authorize state sales
and use taxation of interstate commerce. This legislation, or other attempts at
regulating commerce over the Internet, may substantially impede the growth of
commerce on the Internet and, therefore, adversely affect LifeMinders' ability
to derive financial benefit from online advertising and related activities.

JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES

     Although LifeMinders' email transmissions over the Internet originate
primarily in Virginia, due to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible
that the governments of other states, the federal government and governments of
foreign countries might attempt to regulate LifeMinders' transmissions or
prosecute LifeMinders for purported violations of their laws. These laws may be
modified, or new laws enacted, in the future. Any of the foregoing developments
could harm LifeMinders' business, results of operations and financial condition.
In addition, as LifeMinders' service is available over the Internet in multiple
states and foreign countries, these jurisdictions may claim that the company is
required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each of these
states or foreign countries. Failure to qualify as a foreign corporation in a
jurisdiction where required to do so could subject LifeMinders to penalties and
could result in the inability to enforce its contracts in these jurisdictions.

EMPLOYEES

     As of July 31, 2001, LifeMinders employed 30 individuals. All employees are
full time.

PROPERTIES

     LifeMinders held a ten-year prime lease, expiring in January 2011, on
132,000 square feet of office space at one location in Herndon, Virginia. In
June 2001, LifeMinders entered into an agreement terminating that lease
effective August 31, 2001. The lease termination agreement will be amended in
August 2001. Under this amendment, LifeMinders may continue to occupy
approximately 6,940 square feet of office space on a month-to-month basis until
the lease is terminated upon two months' notice from LifeMinders or the
landlord. LifeMinders also leases additional office space totaling 24,500 square
feet under four agreements expiring at various dates through August 2004. As of
July 31, 2001, LifeMinders had sublet portions of this office space to unrelated
third parties. LifeMinders believes that it has adequate space to meet its needs
for the near future.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     As of August 14, 2001, LifeMinders was not a party to any material
litigation. From time to time, LifeMinders becomes aware of potential legal
claims. As of August 14, 2001, LifeMinders was not aware of any potential legal
claims that it believes would have a material effect on its operations,
financial condition or cash flows.

          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                    AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF LIFEMINDERS

     The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited and
unaudited consolidated financial statements of LifeMinders, appearing elsewhere
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The following discussion contains
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. LifeMinders'
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these
forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those
discussed below and in the section entitled "Risk Factors" of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

INTRODUCTION

     LifeMinders is an online direct marketing company that sends personalized
email messages to a permission-based membership comprised of more than 20
million members. LifeMinders sends to its members personalized email messages,
or newsletters, in lifestyle-based interest categories, garnered from member
information obtained during the registration process as well as from behavioral
information through member interaction with its emails. LifeMinders' email
messages contain helpful reminders and tips directed toward its members'
interests and hobbies and personal events like birthdays and anniversaries.

     LifeMinders was incorporated in Maryland on August 9, 1996 under the name
of MinderSoft, Inc. In January 1999, LifeMinders changed its name to
LifeMinders.com, Inc. and reincorporated in Delaware on July 2, 1999. In June
2000, by way of merger, LifeMinders changed its name to LifeMinders, Inc. A
comprehensive discussion of LifeMinders' corporate history can be found
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus under the caption "Business
of LifeMinders."

     In December 2000, in a continued effort to reduce costs and reach
profitability, LifeMinders made the decision not to pursue and develop its
wireless operations. In conjunction with this decision, the company recorded an
impairment charge of $49,020,000 in the fourth quarter of 2000, of which
$5,969,000 was included as a component of cost of sales. Also in the fourth
quarter of 2000, LifeMinders decided not to pursue and develop the operations of
its consolidated subsidiary Please RSVP, resulting in an impairment charge of
$2,653,000. Additionally, an evaluation of LifeMinders' carrying value in its
investments in non-marketable equity securities in the fourth quarter of 2000
indicated that a permanent loss in value of the investments existed. As a
result, LifeMinders recorded a charge of $2,313,000 for a permanent decline in
value of certain non-marketable equity securities.

     In May 2001, LifeMinders announced that it was scaling back its business
operations while it evaluated strategic alternatives. Since May, LifeMinders has
maintained selected email products.

     During the six months ended June 30, 2001, LifeMinders undertook a
restructuring plan to reduce costs and focus its efforts on reducing operating
losses, while evaluating strategic alternatives. Accordingly, LifeMinders
recorded restructuring charges of $14.2 million during the period. In the six
months ended June 30, 2001, LifeMinders terminated approximately 85% of its
total workforce as of December 31, 2000. Of the total restructuring charges,
approximately $9.3 million related to the early termination of LifeMinders'
multi-year lease for its headquarters, approximately $3.8 million related to
employee and contract termination benefits and approximately $1.2 million
related to early termination of various vendor service agreements. Approximately
$1.0 million of this charge was prepaid in December 2000, $7.6 million was
recorded as restricted cash as of December 31, 2000, and approximately $3.5
million was paid in the six months ended June 30, 2001. LifeMinders expects to
pay the remainder during 2001.

     In addition, based on the value of the proposed merger consideration,
during the six months ended June 30, 2001, LifeMinders determined the carrying
value of its long-lived assets at June 30, 2001 exceeded their net realizable
value. LifeMinders calculated and recorded an impairment charge related to
certain long-lived assets of $18.0 million, of which $2.5 million was recorded
in cost of revenue, in the six months ended June 30, 2001.

COMPARABILITY OF RESULTS

     RESTRUCTURING CHARGE

     During the six months ended June 30, 2001, LifeMinders undertook a
restructuring plan to reduce costs and focus its efforts on reducing operating
losses while evaluating strategic alternatives. Accordingly, LifeMinders
recorded restructuring charges of $14.2 million during the six months ended June
30, 2001. During the six months ended June 30, 2001, LifeMinders terminated
approximately 85% of its workforce as of December 31, 2000. In addition,
LifeMinders negotiated separation and termination agreements with the remaining
employees. Of the total restructuring charges for the six months ended June 30,
2001, $9.3 million related to early termination of LifeMinders' multi-year lease
for its headquarters, $3.8 million related to employee and contract termination
benefits, and approximately $1.2 million related to early termination of various
vendor service agreements. Approximately $1.0 million of this charge was
recorded as prepaid expenses as of December 2000 and approximately $7.6 million
was recorded as restricted cash as of December 31, 2000, and approximately $3.5
million was paid in the six months ended June 30, 2001. LifeMinders expects to
pay the remainder during 2001.

     BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

     During 2000, LifeMinders completed four acquisitions that, in the
aggregate, had a significant effect on its results of operations and financial
condition. However, during December 2000, LifeMinders evaluated the operating
performance and expected results of operations of these acquisitions and decided
not to pursue and develop certain technology and products acquired in these
business combinations. As a result, of a total impairment charge of $53,986,000
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000, $51,673,000 related to businesses
acquired during 2000.

     PleaseRSVP.  On March 14, 2000, LifeMinders acquired PleaseRSVP.com, Inc.,
an online invitation website, in a purchase business combination for a purchase
price of approximately $3,538,000, consisting of $500,000 in cash, 40,000 shares
of LifeMinders common stock valued at $3,008,000, and $30,000 in acquisition
costs. LifeMinders allocated the entire purchase price to goodwill, which was
amortized over three years. In December 2000, however, LifeMinders decided not
to pursue the development and expansion of the operations of PleaseRSVP. See
"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" below.

     WITI.  On March 29, 2000, LifeMinders acquired WITI Corporation, a web and
wireless weather forecasting company, in a purchase business combination for
approximately $29,403,000, consisting of $3,500,000 in cash, 345,796 shares of
LifeMinders common stock valued at $23,004,000, the assumption of options that
are exercisable to acquire 38,266 shares of LifeMinders common stock with a fair
value of $2,488,000, the assumption of $224,000 in liabilities and $187,000 in
acquisition costs. The acquisition was intended to combine WITI's advanced
weather products with LifeMinders' subscriber base and provide LifeMinders with
a platform to offer high-resolution weather forecasting and alerts to
LifeMinders' wireless customers, as well as a daily weather product to
LifeMinders' existing members. In connection with the acquisition, LifeMinders
assumed a consulting contract that provided $1,539,000 in revenue for 2000. The
consulting contract was completed in October 2000. In December 2000, however,
LifeMinders decided not to pursue the development and expansion of its wireless
operations, which resulted in the write-down of the assets acquired in this
transaction. See "Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" below.

     SmartRay.  On August 31, 2000, LifeMinders acquired smartRay Network, Inc.,
a web and wireless alerting company, in a purchase business combination for
approximately $32,632,000, consisting of $2,318,000 in cash, 1,252,198 shares of
LifeMinders common stock valued at $22,493,000, the assumption of options that
are exercisable to acquire a total of 251,447 shares of LifeMinders common stock
with a fair value of $6,860,000, the assumption of $527,000 in liabilities and
$434,000 in acquisition costs. The acquisition was intended to enhance
LifeMinders' wireless message delivery capabilities to provide intelligent
content and commerce messages to LifeMinders' wireless subscriber base. The
smartRay technology was expected to complement the technology previously
acquired from WITI by employing an alert-based, wireless platform that
LifeMinders expected to be able to support its wireless subscriber base. In
December 2000, however, LifeMinders decided not to pursue the development and
expansion its

wireless operations, which resulted in the write-down of the assets acquired in
this transaction. See "Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" below.

     eCoupons.  On December 4, 2000, LifeMinders acquired eCoupons, Inc., an
electronic couponing service, in a purchase business combination for
approximately $4,911,000, consisting of 612,529 shares of LifeMinders common
stock valued at $2,641,000, the assumption of options that are exercisable to
acquire 110,239 shares of LifeMinders common stock with a fair value of
$459,000, the assumption of restricted stock convertible to 114,748 shares of
LifeMinders common stock valued at $495,000, the assumption of $916,000 in
liabilities and $400,000 in acquisition costs. As a result of the acquisition,
LifeMinders expects to be able to enhance its ability to provide locally
relevant electronic coupons to LifeMinders' subscriber base. The results of
operations of eCoupons are included in LifeMinders' results of operations for
the period subsequent to the date of acquisition.

     IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

     Wireless Segment.  As part of the development of LifeMinders' wireless
business strategy, LifeMinders acquired WITI and smartRay in the first and third
quarters of 2000, respectively. In December 2000, LifeMinders evaluated the
wireless segment's historical operating performance and expected results of
operations. Due to changes in market conditions and a change in LifeMinders'
assessment of the wireless segment's ability to generate revenues and profits
and in a continued effort to reduce costs and reach profitability, LifeMinders
decided not to pursue the development and expansion of its wireless operations
and to renew its focus on LifeMinders' core advertising business. In conjunction
with this decision, LifeMinders recorded an impairment charge of $49,020,000 in
the fourth quarter of 2000, of which $5,969,000 is included as a component of
cost of sales. The major components of the impairment charge related to the
wireless segment are as follows (in thousands):

Fixed assets................................................  $   617
Technology..................................................    5,969
Assembled workforce.........................................      578

                                                              =======

     Long-lived Assets.  Prior to June 30, 2001, LifeMinders began negotiations
to merge with Cross Media. On July 18, 2001, LifeMinders and Cross Media entered
into a merger agreement, which was amended and restated on August 20, 2001. In
the proposed merger, Cross Media will pay a total of $24 million in cash and
issue approximately 22.3 million shares of its common stock, subject to
adjustment in certain circumstances, for all of the outstanding equity interests
in LifeMinders. Based on the value of the proposed merger transaction,
LifeMinders determined that the carrying value of the long-lived assets as of
June 30, 2001 exceeded their carrying value. LifeMinders calculated and recorded
an impairment charge of $18,023,000, of which $2,497,000 is recorded in cost of
revenue. The major components of the impairment charge are as follows (in
thousands):

Property and equipment......................................  $14,079
Identifiable intangible assets..............................    3,259
Investments in unconsolidated entities......................      685

                                                              $18,023
                                                              =======

     INVESTMENT IN PLEASERSVP

     In the fourth quarter of 2000, LifeMinders decided not to pursue the
development and expansion of the operations of its consolidated subsidiary
PleaseRSVP, resulting in an impairment charge of $2,653,000 primarily related to
the write-off of goodwill associated with this business acquisition completed in
the first

quarter of 2000. LifeMinders' decision not to pursue the development and
expansion of the PleaseRSVP operations was based on LifeMinders' evaluation of
PleaseRSVP's historical operating performance and expected future operating
results. The fair value of the impaired assets was determined based on a
discounted cash flow analysis.

     NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

     LifeMinders periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments in
non-marketable equity securities to determine if a loss in value of the
investments, which would be considered a permanent decline, should be
recognized. During the fourth quarter of 2000, based on LifeMinders' evaluation
of the operating losses of its investees, changes in market conditions and other
relevant factors, LifeMinders recorded a charge of $2,313,000 for a permanent
decline in value of certain non-marketable equity securities.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     SEGMENT INFORMATION

     Prior to the third quarter of 2000, LifeMinders operated in one segment:
Internet and related services. Beginning in the third quarter of 2000,
LifeMinders began evaluating its operations by strategic business unit:
consumer, outsourcing and wireless. In December 2000, however, LifeMinders made
the decision not to pursue and develop its wireless segment. This decision was
based on changes in market conditions and a determination that LifeMinders could
not generate positive cash flows from the wireless segment in the foreseeable
future. Fourth quarter results for 2000 include an impairment charge of
$53,986,000, of which $49,020,000 is related to the write-off of long-lived
assets, including goodwill, related to the acquisition of wireless technologies
which occurred in the first and third quarters of 2000.

     For financial reporting purposes, LifeMinders has two revenue streams:
delivery of advertisements within emails to its members and delivery of opt-in
names to LifeMinders' registration partners. The segment operating loss is
revenue less direct and allocable expenses.

     Segment identifiable assets are those that are directly used in or
identified to segment operations. Financial information by segment for the year
ended December 31, 2000 is as follows (in thousands):

     REVENUE

     LifeMinders recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, terms are fixed or determinable, services are performed or products are
delivered, and collection is probable. Since the beginning of calendar year
1999, LifeMinders has generated revenue primarily through advertising services

and its opt-in product. LifeMinders' advertising revenue is subject to the
effects of cyclicality and may be subject to seasonality. If purchasing patterns
or timing of purchasing by advertisers were to change, LifeMinders' operations
and quarter-to-quarter comparisons could be materially affected.

     ADVERTISING

     Advertising arrangements consist primarily of advertisements that are
displayed within LifeMinders' emails. Generally, advertisers pay LifeMinders and
LifeMinders' recognizes revenue on a per email basis, based on the number of
emails delivered to LifeMinders' members in which the advertisements are
displayed. From time to time, LifeMinders may guarantee a minimum number of
emails to be delivered containing an advertisement directed at a specific member
group. Under these contracts, LifeMinders is not required to forfeit fees
received for emails previously delivered and LifeMinders has historically
fulfilled the guaranteed minimum number of emails; therefore, revenue is
recognized as emails are delivered. LifeMinders may also guarantee a minimum
number of sales orders for the advertiser based on the emails delivered. Under
these contracts LifeMinders defers all revenue until notification is received
from the advertiser that the minimum number of sales orders have been achieved
by the advertiser. In addition, LifeMinders may provide advertisers the
opportunity for the exclusive right to sponsor advertisements within a specific
email category for a specified period of time for a fixed fee. Under these
contracts LifeMinders recognizes revenue ratably during the period the
advertisement is displayed in LifeMinders' emails since there is no obligation
to provide a minimum number of emails for that individual advertiser during the
specific period. LifeMinders' advertising contracts generally have average terms
ranging from one to six months.

     Periodically, LifeMinders enters into barter/reciprocal transactions, where
LifeMinders exchanges advertising space within LifeMinders' emails for
reciprocal advertising space or traffic on other Web sites. Revenue from barter
transactions is recognized in accordance with APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for
Nonmonetary Transactions (APB No. 29), and EITF Issue No. 99-17, Accounting for
Advertising Barter Transactions, during the period in which the advertisements
are displayed in LifeMinders' emails. In the absence of sufficient evidence of
fair value, the acquired assets are recorded at the book value of the
surrendered assets. No gain or loss is recorded from barter transactions as the
revenue recognized equals the advertising costs incurred. For the six months
ended June 30, 2001 and 2000, and for the years ended December 31, 1999 and
1998, LifeMinders did not enter into any barter arrangements. For the year ended
December 31, 2000, LifeMinders entered into several barter arrangements for
which no revenue or expense was recognized as sufficient evidence of fair value
was indeterminable and LifeMinders' carrying cost of the surrendered assets was
insignificant.

     OPT-IN

     Revenue is recognized as affirmative member responses to advertisers'
newsletters and other promotions offered during LifeMinders' registration
program are delivered to LifeMinders' opt-in partners. LifeMinders derives
opt-in revenue through fees that LifeMinders' opt-in advertising partners pay
for member registrations. LifeMinders records revenue net of estimated duplicate
member responses to its opt-in partners' newsletters and other promotions.
Duplicate member responses are names, generally in the form of email addresses,
that LifeMinders provides to opt-in advertising partners for which LifeMinders'
members have previously registered either through LifeMinders' sign up process
or with LifeMinders' opt-in advertising partners directly. Historically, opt-in
partners have immediately notified LifeMinders of duplicate member responses
upon receipt of member registration information, which is transmitted to opt-in
partners twice a week. LifeMinders issues credits upon notification of duplicate
member responses and, therefore, LifeMinders has not experienced significant
differences between the actual and estimated amounts of duplicate member
responses. Opt-in partners pay a fixed rate per registration and, upon delivery
of the registrations, LifeMinders has no further obligation under the
agreements. LifeMinders does not currently anticipate any significant change in
the nature of the fees LifeMinders charges its opt-in partners or in its
customer base and believes its historical experience with its opt-in product is
predictive of future estimates. For the six months ended June 30, 2001, no
reserve was necessary as LifeMinders

recorded revenue net of actual duplicate member responses. For the six months
ended June 30, 2000, revenue was recorded net of $1,269,000 for estimated
duplicate member responses to LifeMinders' opt-in partners' newsletters and
other promotions. For the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, revenue was
recorded net of $913,000 and $618,000, respectively, for estimated duplicate
member responses to LifeMinders' opt-in partners' newsletters and other
promotions.

     Cash received from customers in advance is recorded as deferred revenue.
Advertising and opt-in revenue is recognized as emails and affirmative member
responses, respectively, are delivered.

     CONSULTING REVENUE

     Consulting revenue consists of revenue earned under a contract, assumed in
connection with LifeMinders' acquisition of WITI Corporation, relating to
services for the development of weather related content. Under this contract,
which was completed in October 2000, LifeMinders provided consulting services
for customization and modification of its customer's current software systems.
Revenue was recognized under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting,
based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs. The
percentage-of-completion method was deemed the most appropriate method of
revenue recognition for this contract as LifeMinders was generally entitled to
payment for work performed to date even though it may not have coincided with a
specific billing milestone. The billing milestones were considered to be interim
billing points for the purposes of providing funding to LifeMinders for its
efforts and not true output measures of its progress to completion.
Additionally, the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs has a direct
relationship to the performance of services specified in the arrangement due to
the types of costs that were incurred. Costs incurred relating to performance of
the services specified in the arrangement consisted primarily of costs for
consulting services and payroll relating to individuals performing the software
modification and customization procedures. The consultant and payroll costs
incurred directly coincided with the input of effort into the modification and
customization process. Direct material costs on this project were insignificant.
Project-related overhead costs included within the calculation of the percentage
complete were consistent with industry practice and there were no significant
up-front costs charged to the contract. Cash received in advance of services to
be provided was recorded as deferred revenue and recognized upon the completion
of the related services.

EXPENSES

     COST OF REVENUE

     Cost of revenue consists of salaries, stock-based compensation, employee
benefits and related expenses of LifeMinders' member experience personnel, fees
paid to freelance writers of LifeMinders' content and depreciation of and
co-location costs associated with the computer equipment necessary to run
LifeMinders' operations.

     SALES AND MARKETING

     Sales and marketing expenses include advertising and promotional expenses,
salaries, sales commissions, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, travel
and related expenses of LifeMinders' direct sales force, marketing, and sales
support functions. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2000, LifeMinders' primary
focus was to increase revenue through rapid growth in LifeMinders' member base
and brand awareness. As a result, LifeMinders' largest expense related to
banner-type advertising campaigns on portals and websites. Beginning in the
fourth quarter of 2000, LifeMinders redirected its advertising efforts and
budget toward obtaining highly engaged members through performance-based
advertising campaigns. LifeMinders therefore expects to significantly reduce its
member acquisition costs in 2001. Marketing costs associated with increasing its
member base are expensed in the period incurred. In August 2000, LifeMinders
entered into an agreement for future distribution services valued at $3,500,000,
of which LifeMinders paid $2,500,000. Subsequent to December 31, 2000, the
contract was terminated and LifeMinders is no longer obligated to pay the
remaining $1,000,000 of the original contract amount.

     RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

     Research and development costs include expenses for the development of new
or improved technologies designed to enhance the performance of LifeMinders'
offerings, including the salaries, stock-based compensation and related expenses
for its engineering department, as well as costs for contracted services and
co-location facilities and depreciation on equipment. In 2000, LifeMinders
incurred significant costs associated with the development and expansion of its
systems infrastructure to support its rapid member growth. LifeMinders does not
expect the same level of development in 2001. As such, LifeMinders expects
research and development costs to decrease in 2001.

     GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

     General and administrative expenses include salaries, stock-based
compensation and employee benefits for LifeMinders' executive, finance, legal
and human resources personnel. In addition, general and administrative expenses
include fees for professional services and occupancy costs. General and
administrative expenses are expected to decrease in absolute dollars, in part
due to LifeMinders' scaling back of operations and the associated reductions in
workforce and related expenses in the first quarter of 2001. See
"-- Introduction" and "-- Comparability of Results" above for additional
information about LifeMinders' recent business operations.

     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

     In connection with the grant of stock options to employees during the year
ended December 31, 1999, deferred compensation of $5,702,000 was recorded as a
reduction to stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation represented the
difference between the estimated fair value of LifeMinders common stock and the
exercise price of these options at the date of grant prior to its initial public
offering. Additionally, in accordance with FIN 44 effective July 1, 2000,
$2,624,000 and $622,000 of deferred compensation was recognized upon the
assumption of outstanding options that are exercisable to acquire LifeMinders
common stock associated with the acquisitions of smartRay Networks and eCoupons,
respectively. Deferred compensation is amortized over the vesting periods of the
applicable options. For the six months ended June 30, 2001, LifeMinders reduced
deferred compensation by $3,154,000 for unvested forfeited stock options.

     For the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000, $12,000 and $29,000 of
amortization of deferred compensation, respectively, was included in cost of
sales, $207,000 and $341,000, respectively, was included in sales and marketing
expense, $361,000 and $150,000, respectively, was included in research and
development expense, and $93,000 and $193,000, respectively, was included in
general and administrative expense. In 2000 and 1999, $58,000 and $0 of
amortization of deferred compensation, respectively, was included in cost of
revenue, $585,000 and $232,000, respectively, was included in sales and
marketing expense, $668,000 and $139,000, respectively, was included in research
and development expense, and $418,000 and $254,000, respectively, was included
in general and administrative expense.

     INFLATION

     LifeMinders does not currently anticipate that inflation will have a
material impact on its cash flows, results of operations or financial position.

PERIOD TO PERIOD COMPARISONS

     SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2001 COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2000

     Revenue.  Revenue was $7,347,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2001,
which represents a decrease of 71% when compared with the corresponding period
in 2000. Advertising revenue was $6,933,000 for the six months ended June 30,
2001, which represents a decrease of 66% when compared with the corresponding
period in 2000. The decrease in advertising revenue is due to the scaling back
of LifeMinders' business operations and the continuing significant deterioration
of the online advertising

market. Opt-in revenue was $414,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2001,
which represents a decrease of 92%, when compared with the corresponding period
in 2000. Opt-in revenue is largely derived as new members register for our
service. In connection with the scaling back of its business operations,
LifeMinders has significantly reduced advertising expenditures and, as a result,
has experienced a decline in new member registrations. The decline in opt-in
revenue is directly attributable to reduced new member registrations.

     Cost of revenue.  Cost of revenue was $6,836,000, or 93% of total revenue,
for the six months ended June 30, 2001. Cost of revenue for the six months ended
June 30, 2001 included an impairment charge of $2,497,000, or 34% of revenues
related to the impairment of certain long-lived assets. Cost of revenue
excluding the impairment charge was $4,339,000, or 59% of total revenue, for the
six months ended June 30, 2001. Cost of revenue was $2,295,000, or 9% of total
revenue, for the six months ended June 30, 2000. LifeMinders' cost of revenue,
excluding impairment charges for the six months ended June 30, 2001, primarily
consisted of expenses related to the production of LifeMinders' email content by
its editorial and production staff, maintenance of existing member profiles and
housing fees associated with and depreciation of the computer systems necessary
to operate its service. The increase in cost of revenue for the six months ended
June 30, 2001 as compared to the comparable period in 2000, was $2,044,000. Of
this increase, 122% was attributable to increased costs associated with housing
fees and depreciation costs of additional computer equipment which was acquired
principally in the third and fourth quarters of 2000 to support LifeMinders'
then rapidly growing membership base. These increases were partially offset by a
19% decrease associated with the discontinuance of LifeMinders' wireless
business in December 2000. Remaining offsetting decreases are principally
comprised of reductions in work force associated with the termination of
editorial and production staff responsible for the production of the company's
email content.

     Sales and marketing.  Sales and marketing expenses were $11,356,000, or
155% of total revenue, for the six months ended June 30, 2001. Sales and
marketing expenses were $44,401,000, or 173%, for the six months ended June 30,
2000. Of the $33,045,000 decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2001 as
compared to the comparable period in 2000, 92% resulted from a reduction in
advertising costs paid to acquire new members through the purchase of banner
advertisements and similar services on the Web. The remaining decrease was due
to a reduction in expenses resulting from cost cutting efforts.

     Research and development.  Research and development expenses were
$2,607,000, or 35% of total revenue, for the six months ended June 30, 2001.
Research and development expenses were $3,277,000, or 13% of total revenue, for
the six months ended June 30, 2000. The $670,000 decrease for the six months
ended June 30, 2001 as compared to the comparable period in 2000, was due to the
downsizing of the technical staff and associated cost savings.

     General and administrative.  General and administrative expenses were
$7,097,000, or 97% of total revenue, for the six months ended June 30, 2001.
General and administrative expenses were $6,916,000, or 27% of total revenue,
for the six months ended June 30, 2000. The $122,000 increase in general and
administrative expense for the six months ended June 30, 2001, as compared to
the comparable period in 2000, reflects the fact that cost cutting efforts on a
number of general and administrative expense fronts as well as a significant
sales volume-related decrease in doubtful accounts nearly offset certain expense
increases, most notably an increase in occupancy expense associated with the new
headquarters facility.

     Depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation and amortization expenses were
$2,222,000, or 30% of total revenue, for the six months ended June 30, 2001.
Depreciation and amortization expenses were $750,000, or 3% of total revenues,
for the comparable period in 2000. Of the $1,472,000 increase for the six months
ended June 30, 2001 as compared to the comparable period in 2000, 65% resulted
from an increase in the depreciation of computers and software acquired to
support LifeMinders' actual and anticipated membership growth. An additional 21%
resulted from an increase in intangibles amortization associated with corporate
acquisitions. The remaining 14% resulted from a combination of various
depreciation and amortization increasing and decreasing items, with the largest
of these being increased depreciation associated with furniture for the new
headquarters facility.

     Impairment Charge.  Prior to June 30, 2001, LifeMinders began negotiations
to merge with Cross Media. In late May of 2001, representatives of Cross Media
contacted LifeMinders to discuss a possible merger. On June 21, 2001,
LifeMinders executed a letter of intent and term sheet with Cross Media for the
merger transaction, which was subsequently modified as of June 27, 2001. On July
18, 2001, LifeMinders entered into a merger agreement with Cross Media and, on
July 19, 2001, LifeMinders publicly announced its intention to merge with Cross
Media. The merger agreement was amended and restated on August 20, 2001. Under
the terms of the amended and restated merger agreement, Cross Media will pay a
total of up to $24 million in cash and issue approximately 22.3 million shares
of its common stock in the merger, assuming that no LifeMinders stock options
are exercised prior to the date on which the merger is completed and that
LifeMinders stockholders elect to receive the maximum cash consideration, and
subject to adjustment under certain circumstances, for all of LifeMinders'
outstanding equity interests. Based on the value of the proposed merger
transaction, LifeMinders determined the carrying value of its long-lived assets
as of June 30, 2001, exceeded their fair value. LifeMinders calculated and
recorded an impairment charge of $18,023,000, of which $2,497,000 is recorded in
cost of revenue.

     Restructuring Charge.  In May 2001, LifeMinders announced that it was
significantly scaling back its business operations and reducing its work force
while it evaluated strategic alternatives. This decision was based on the
continued decline of revenue from online advertising historically and for the
foreseeable future. In addition, opportunities for online advertising revenue
will decline since LifeMinders is producing and delivering a substantially lower
number of emails and does not expect to develop any new email products at this
time. Since May 2001, LifeMinders has maintained selected email products. During
the six months ended June 30, 2001, LifeMinders undertook a restructuring plan
to reduce costs and focus its efforts on reducing operating losses while
evaluating strategic alternatives. Accordingly, restructuring charges totaling
$14,248,000 were recorded during the period. During the six months ended June
30, 2001, LifeMinders terminated approximately 85% of its workforce as of
December 31, 2000. In addition, LifeMinders negotiated separation and
termination agreements with its remaining employees. Of the total restructuring
charges, approximately $3,824,000 related to employee and contract termination
benefits, $9,263,000 related to the early termination of the multi-year lease
for LifeMinders' headquarters, and approximately $1,161,000 related to early
termination of various vendor service agreements. Approximately $1,042,000 of
this charge was recorded as prepaid expenses in December 2000, $7,600,000 was
recorded as restricted cash as of December 31, 2000, and approximately
$3,526,000 was paid in the six months ended June 30, 2001. LifeMinders expects
to pay the remainder during 2001.

     Interest income, net.  Interest income was $1,625,000, or 22% of total
revenue, for the six months ended June 30, 2001. For the comparable periods in
2000, interest income was $2,979,000, or 12% of total revenue. This decrease
from year 2000 to 2001 for the comparable six-month period was due primarily to
a lower average funds balance available for investment in short-term investments
and lower prevailing interest rates. Interest expense, primarily on notes and
leases used to finance equipment purchases, for the six months ended June 30,
2001, was $122,000. Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2000, was
$262,000. The decrease in interest expense from year 2000 to 2001 reflects the
fact that loans and lease balances were being paid down, with no additional
borrowing occurring during the six months ended June 30, 2001.

     Income taxes.  No income tax provision or benefit has been recorded for any
of the periods presented since LifeMinders has not generated taxable income to
date. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management
believes it is more likely than not that LifeMinders will not have sufficient
taxable income in the years over which the majority of temporary differences
will reverse to realize the deferred tax assets. As a result, LifeMinders
recorded a full valuation allowance in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements as of June 30, 2001.

     YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999

     Revenue.  Revenue increased 285% from $14,019,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1999 to $53,926,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000.
Advertising revenue increased $36,368,000, opt-in revenue increased $2,000,000
and consulting revenue increased $1,539,000. The increase in advertising and
opt-in revenue was due to significant expansion and sale of advertising
resulting from a 209% increase in LifeMinders' membership base. Consulting
revenue resulted from a contract assumed in the WITI acquisition in the first
quarter 2000. Performance under this contract was substantially complete as of
December 31, 2000 and the contract will not be renewed.

     Cost of Revenue.  Total cost of revenue was $12,842,000 and $966,000, or
24% and 7% of total revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2000 included an
impairment charge of $5,969,000, or 11% of total revenue, related to the write
off of WITI and smartRay technologies acquired. Cost of revenue excluding the
impairment charge was $6,873,000 and $966,000, or 13% and 6% of total revenue,
for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Of the $5,907,000
increase in cost of revenue from the prior year, 45% is due to the housing and
depreciation of additional computer equipment required for LifeMinders'
operations resulting from its rapid growth in membership, 16% is associated with
an increase in the personnel in LifeMinders' Member Experience department, which
is responsible for identifying, composing and editing the content delivered in
its emails, 10% is due to the consulting revenue acquired in the WITI
acquisition and 22% is attributable to the amortization of the WITI and smartRay
technologies acquired.

     Sales and Marketing.  Sales and marketing expense was $70,897,000 and
$38,648,000, or 131% and 276% of total revenue, for the years ended December 31,
2000 and 1999, respectively. Of the $32,249,000 increase in sales and marketing
expenses from the prior year, 64% is associated with an expansion in
LifeMinders' efforts to acquire new members through the purchase of banner
advertisements and similar services on the web, 20% is due to an increase in its
sales and marketing staff, and 11% related to an increase in housing fees and
depreciation associated with computer systems used to analyze customer metrics.

     Research and Development.  Research and development expense was $7,758,000
and $1,963,000, or 14% and 14% of total revenue, for the years ended December
31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Of the $5,795,000 increase in research and
development expenses from the prior year, 67% is attributable to expansion of
technical personnel and related recruiting fees and 21% relates to professional
fees incurred to further develop and enhance LifeMinders' service. Additionally,
9% of the increase is due to research and development associated with
LifeMinders' PleaseRSVP operations.

     General and Administrative.  General and administrative expense was
$17,274,000 and $4,396,000, or 32% and 31% of total revenue, for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Of the $12,878,000 increase in general
and administrative expenses from the prior year, 45% is the result of
LifeMinders' rapid growth and expansion, requiring additional office space,
insurance, personnel and related fringe benefit expenses, relocation and
recruiting; 2% is attributable to the outsourcing of the processing of bounty
payments related to an advertising campaign; and 12% is directly related to
increases in professional fees as a result of becoming a public company.
Additionally, 26% is due to an increase in bad debt expense directly
attributable to the downturn in economic conditions, which has impacted
LifeMinders' customers' ability to pay.

     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.  In December 2000, in a continued effort
to reduce costs and reach profitability, LifeMinders made the decision not to
pursue and develop its wireless operations. In conjunction with this decision,
LifeMinders recorded an impairment charge of $49,020,000 in the fourth quarter
of 2000, of which $5,969,000 is included as a component of cost of sales. Also
in the fourth quarter of 2000, LifeMinders decided not to pursue and develop the
operations of its consolidated subsidiary Please RSVP, resulting in an
impairment charge of $2,653,000. Additionally, an evaluation of LifeMinders'
carrying value in its investments in non-marketable equity securities in the
fourth quarter of 2000 indicated that a permanent loss in value of the
investments existed. As a result, LifeMinders recorded a charge of $2,313,000
for a permanent decline in value of certain non-marketable equity securities.

     Depreciation and Amortization.  Depreciation and amortization expense was
$2,829,000 and $185,000, or 5% and 1% of total revenue, for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Of the $2,644,000 increase in
depreciation and amortization expenses from the prior year, 54% relates to the
depreciation of new leasehold improvements, furniture, computer equipment and
software and 46% is related to amortization of certain intangibles associated
with business acquisitions.

     Amortization of Goodwill.  As part of the smartRay, WITI and
PleaseRSVP.com, Inc. acquisitions, LifeMinders recorded goodwill totaling
$51,216,000. Goodwill was amortized over three-year periods, which resulted in
charges totaling $9,571,000, or 18% of revenue, for the year ended December 31,
2000. In December 2000, however, LifeMinders decided not to pursue the
development and expansion of its wireless segment or the PleaseRSVP operations.
As a result, LifeMinders wrote off the goodwill associated with these
acquisitions. See "Impairment of Long-Lived Assets," above.

     Interest Income, net.  Interest income was $6,253,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2000, partially offset by $474,000 of interest expense. Interest
income was $560,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999, partially offset by
$31,000 of interest expense. The increase from the prior year is due to an
increase in funds available for investment in short term investments. The
majority of the increase in funds was attributable to the $147,614,000 in net
proceeds from LifeMinders' initial public offering in November 1999 and
follow-on offering in February 2000. The increase in interest expense was due to
the financing of equipment purchased during the first half of 2000 under notes
payable or capital lease arrangements. Interest income, net in future periods
may fluctuate as a result of the average cash, investments and future debt
balances we maintain as well as changes in the yields of LifeMinders'
investments.

     Loss From Unconsolidated Entities.  Loss from unconsolidated entities
consists of losses attributable to an investment in an Internet-related business
acquired on March 15, 2000 and accounted for on the equity basis as LifeMinders'
exercised significant influence over the investee's operations. Before selling
the investment in June 2000, LifeMinders recorded losses totaling $25,000.

     Income Taxes.  No income tax provision or benefit has been recorded for any
of the periods presented since LifeMinders has not generated taxable income to
date. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
LifeMinders' management believes it is more likely than not that it will not
have sufficient taxable income in the years over which the majority of temporary
differences will reverse to realize the deferred tax assets. As a result,
LifeMinders recorded a full valuation allowance in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements as of December 31, 2000 and 1999.

     Accretion on Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock.  Accretion
on mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock decreased from $1,155,000
for the year ended December 31, 1999 to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2000.
The preferred stock dividends and direct issuance costs on Series A, Series B
and Series C preferred stock resulted in the accretion. During the year ended
December 31, 1999, shares of Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D and Series E
preferred stock were outstanding until they were converted into common shares
concurrent with LifeMinders' initial public offering in November 1999. No shares
of preferred stock were outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2000.

     YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998

     Revenue.  Revenue increased 24,495% from $57,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1998 to $14,019,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999.
Advertising revenue increased $9,389,000 as a result of LifeMinders' decision to
revise its strategy from entering into arrangements with national retailers as
distributors of its software-based product to an online direct marketing company
that provides personalized content and advertisements via email. As a new source
of revenue in 1999, opt-in revenue added $4,573,000 to revenue.

     Cost of Revenue.  Cost of revenue was $966,000 and $60,000, or 7% and 105%
of total revenue, for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
In 1999, LifeMinders changed the product from a software-based minder to an
Internet-based direct marketing offering. The $906,000 increase in cost of
revenue from 1998 to 1999 reflects a 50% increase in costs associated with
LifeMinders' member experience personnel, who are responsible for identifying,
composing and editing the content delivered in emails, and 39% increase in costs
associated with the depreciation of the computer systems necessary to operate
LifeMinders' service.

     Sales and Marketing.  Sales and marketing expense was $38,648,000 and
$869,000, or 276% and 1525% of total revenue, for the years ended December 31,
1999 and 1998, respectively. Of the $37,779,000 increase in sales and marketing
expenses from 1998 to 1999, 75% resulted from a major expansion in LifeMinders'
efforts to acquire new members through the purchase of banner advertisements on
the Web and in print and 8% relates to an increase in its sales and marketing
staff and commissions related to the increase in revenue.

     Research and Development.  Research and development expense was $1,963,000
and $374,000, or 14% and 656% of total revenue, for the years ended December 31,
1999 and 1998, respectively. Of the $1,589,000 increase from 1998 to 1999, 48%
was attributable to the expansion of technical personnel and related recruiting
fees, 32% relates to the outsourcing of certain internal-use software costs in
the pre-development stage and 8% relates to supplies used by LifeMinders'
technical personnel.

     General and Administrative.  General and administrative expense was
$4,396,000 and $718,000, or 31% and 1260% of total revenue, for the years ended
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Of the $3,678,000 increase from 1998
to 1999, 54% relates to LifeMinders' rapid growth and expansion, requiring
additional personnel and related fringe benefit expenses, rent and legal
services. Additionally, 11% is due to an increase in bad debt expense.

     Depreciation and Amortization.  Depreciation and amortization expense was
$185,000 and $8,000, or 1% and 14% of total revenue, for the years ended
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The increase of $177,000 from 1998 to
1999 resulted from purchases of furniture and computer equipment for additional
personnel.

     Interest Income, net.  Interest income, net was $529,000 and $25,000 for
the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The increase of
$504,000 from 1998 to 1999 is due to an increase in funds available for
investment in short term investments. The majority of the increase in funds was
attributable to the $61,715,000 in net proceeds from LifeMinders' initial public
offering in November 1999. Interest expense for the years ended December 31,
1999 and 1998 was $31,000 and $0, respectively.

     Income Taxes.  No income tax provision or benefit has been recorded for any
of the periods presented since LifeMinders has not generated taxable income to
date. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
LifeMinders' management believes it is more likely than not that LifeMinders
will not have sufficient taxable income in the years over which the majority of
temporary differences will reverse to realize the deferred tax assets. As a
result, LifeMinders has recorded a full valuation allowance in the accompanying
financial statements as of December 31, 1999 and 1998.

     Accretion on Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock.  Accretion
on mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock increased 636% from
$157,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998 to $1,155,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1999. The preferred stock carrying value for cumulative dividends
and a portion of direct issuance costs on Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D
and Series E preferred stock resulted in the increase. During the year ended
December 31, 1998, only shares of Series A and Series B preferred stock were
outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 1999, shares of Series A, Series
B, Series C, Series D and Series E preferred stock were all outstanding for a
portion of the year. All shares of Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D and
Series E preferred stock were converted into common stock concurrent with
LifeMinders' initial public offering in November 1999.

     QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following table sets forth unaudited quarterly consolidated statement
of operations data for the quarters ended March 31, and June 30, 2001, and the
four quarters for each of 2000 and 1999. LifeMinders derived this data from
unaudited consolidated financial statements, and in the opinion of LifeMinders'
management, they include all adjustments, which consist only of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial results for the periods.
The results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the
results of operations for any future period.

SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY FLUCTUATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS

     LifeMinders believes that its revenue may be subject to seasonal
fluctuations as a result of general patterns of retail advertising and marketing
and consumer purchasing. In addition, expenditures by advertisers and marketers
tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and consumer buying
patterns. Due to these and other factors, LifeMinders believes that
quarter-to-quarter comparisons of its operating results may not be meaningful
and you should not rely upon them as an indication of LifeMinders' future
performance.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Prior to LifeMinders' initial public offering in November 1999, LifeMinders
funded its operations primarily through the private placement of preferred
equity securities. LifeMinders' initial public offering raised $61,715,000 in
net proceeds. In February 2000, LifeMinders completed a follow-on offering that
raised $85,899,000 in net proceeds. As of June 30, 2001, LifeMinders had
$54,791,000 of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. Outstanding
equipment financing, comprising capital leases, totaled $1,069,000 at June 30,
2001. All notes payable balances were retired during the second quarter of 2001.
The outstanding capital lease obligations were repaid subsequent to June 30,
2001 out of existing cash and cash equivalents. LifeMinders negotiated an early
termination of its headquarters office lease during the second quarter of 2001
for $9,263,000. Of this amount, $7,600,000 was drawn and paid from a letter of
credit secured by restricted cash of $7,600,000. The balance of the settlement
was paid from cash and cash equivalents.

     Net cash used in operating activities was $14,802,000 for the six months
ended June 30, 2001. Cash used in operating activities for the six months ended
June 30, 2001 resulted primarily from net losses, which were partially offset by
noncash items and collections of accounts receivable.

     Net cash used in operating activities was $1,510,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1998, $35,505,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999 and
$40,731,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. Cash used in operating
activities for the year ended December 31, 1998 was primarily the result of net
losses, which were partially offset by increases in deferred revenue. Cash used
in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 1999 resulted from net
losses and increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses, which were
partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Cash
used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2000 principally
resulted from net losses adjusted for non-cash items, including impairment of
long-lived assets, an increase in trade receivables and reductions in accounts
payable and accrued expenses. In August 2000, LifeMinders entered into an
agreement for future distribution services valued at $3,500,000 of which
LifeMinders paid $2,500,000. Subsequent to December 31, 2000, the contract was
terminated and LifeMinders is no longer obligated to pay the remaining
$1,000,000 of the original contract amount.

     Net cash used in financing activities was $1,249,000 for the six months
ended June 30, 2001. Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended
June 30, 2001 resulted from repayments of notes payable and capital lease
obligations totaling $1,752,000. These repayments were partially offset by cash
receipts of $493,000 from the exercise of stock options and $10,000 in receipts
from an employee stock purchase plan.

     Net cash used in investing activities was $50,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1998, $6,210,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999 and
$58,430,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. Cash used in investing
activities for the year ended December 31, 1998 was related to purchases of
property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended
December 31, 1999 was related to the purchases of property and equipment and the
purchases of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities for the
year ended December 31, 2000 was related to business acquisitions, investments
in unconsolidated entities, purchases of marketable securities net of proceeds
from maturities, cash deposits collateralizing letters of credit, and purchases
of property and equipment. The increase in the year ended December 31, 1999 is
attributable to the purchase of computer equipment needed to maintain
LifeMinders' database and deliver targeted emails to its rapidly growing member
base. The increase from

1999 to 2000 is attributable to additional purchases of computer equipment to
service its continuing member growth, purchases of marketable securities,
business acquisitions and investments in unconsolidated entities, and cash
deposits collateralizing letters of credit.

     Net cash provided by investing activities was $27,071,000 for the six
months ended June 30, 2001. Cash provided by investing activities for the six
months ended June 30, 2001 was related to maturities of marketable securities,
redemption of restricted cash associated with the drawing of a letter of credit
securing LifeMinders' office lease and repayment of a note receivable.

     Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,000,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1998, $97,007,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999 and
$86,408,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. Cash provided by financing
activities for the year ended December 31,1998 resulted almost entirely from the
sale of preferred stock. Cash provided by financing activities for the year
ended December 31, 1999 resulted from the sale of preferred stock and the sale
of common stock in LifeMinders' initial public offering in November 1999. Cash
provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000 resulted
primarily from LifeMinders' follow-on offering in February 2000. Concurrent with
the initial public offering, all series of preferred stock were converted into
1.25 shares of LifeMinders common stock. As of December 31, 2000, there were
4,434,437 options outstanding with a weighted-average exercise price of $16.05.
This may result in substantial dilution in the future.

     During 2000 and prior, LifeMinders' focus was on growing its member base
and enhancing the infrastructure associated with a rapidly expanding membership,
resulting in significant advertising expenditures and costs associated with the
development of internal software systems and the hardware to support and service
its member database. LifeMinders does not currently plan to continue the same
level of activity in 2001. Given LifeMinders' announced scaling back of
operations and intention to merge with Cross Media, LifeMinders does not
anticipate that it will continue to experience significant capital expenditures
nor does it expect significant growth in its operating expenses for 2001. As of
June 30, 2001, LifeMinders had terminated approximately 85% of its total
workforce as of December 31, 2000.

     In addition, LifeMinders negotiated separation and termination agreements
with its remaining employees. These reductions will have a significant impact on
future results of operations because approximately 17% of LifeMinders' total
expenses in 2000, including costs of sales but excluding impairment of
long-lived assets, related to salaries and related benefits, including
stock-based compensation.

     On July 18, 2001, LifeMinders entered into a merger agreement with Cross
Media and, on July 19, 2001, LifeMinders announced its intention to merge with
Cross Media. The merger agreement was amended and restated on August 20, 2001.
Under the terms of the amended and restated merger agreement, Cross Media will
pay a total of up to $24 million in cash and issue approximately 22.3 million
shares of its common stock in the merger, assuming that no LifeMinders stock
options are exercised prior to the date on which the merger is completed and
that LifeMinders stockholders elect to receive the maximum cash consideration,
and subject to adjustment under certain circumstances, for all of LifeMinders'
outstanding equity interests. If the merger is not consummated for any reason,
LifeMinders may continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of companies and
investments in businesses, which may require the use of cash. In addition,
LifeMinders will have incurred substantial costs associated with the Cross Media
merger, which will be payable regardless of whether the merger is consummated.
In certain circumstances, LifeMinders is obligated to pay Cross Media a fee of
$2.8 million if the merger is terminated, which would further reduce its cash
balances. If LifeMinders is unable to consummate the proposed Cross Media
merger, and its board of directors does not determine that another sale or
merger transaction would be in the best interests of its stockholders, the board
of directors may determine the best alternative is to discontinue operations,
sell the company's remaining noncash assets and, after repayment of all
obligations, distribute the net proceeds to the LifeMinders stockholders. In the
event of a liquidation, the amount and timing of any distributions to
stockholders cannot be currently determined. LifeMinders believes that its
existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash
needs for working capital, investment or acquisition related expenditures,
capital expenditures and any costs

associated with the scaling back of its operations for the foreseeable future.
The consummation of the merger transaction with Cross Media is subject to a
number of conditions precedent, including the receipt of the approval of both
the LifeMinders and Cross Media stockholders, and many of these conditions are
beyond the company's control. LifeMinders cannot assure you that it will be able
to satisfy all of these conditions. Further, the proposed merger with Cross
Media may be terminated under certain circumstances. Accordingly, LifeMinders
cannot assure you that it will be able to consummate the proposed merger with
Cross Media or an alternative merger or acquisition transaction.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) approved
Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, "Business
Combinations" and No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141
addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations. All
business combinations in the scope of this Statement will be accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting. The provisions of SFAS No. 141 apply to all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, and business combinations
accounted for by the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is July
1, 2001, or later. SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Under this Statement, goodwill
will no longer be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually
at the reporting unit level. Goodwill will be tested for impairment on an
interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would
more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below is carrying
value. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization will be reviewed for
impairment in accordance with SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." The provisions
of SFAS No. 142 are required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2001.

LIFEMINDERS DIRECTORS TO BE APPOINTED TO CROSS MEDIA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AFTER
THE MERGER

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, Messrs. Bulkeley and Lindgren,

Mr. Bulkeley was the Chief Executive Officer of barnesandnoble.com. From July

Bulkeley an option to purchase 62,500 shares of LifeMinders common stock at a
purchase price of $3.86 per share.

                    DESCRIPTION OF CROSS MEDIA CAPITAL STOCK

     Cross Media is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.001 per share. As of [               ], 2001, [          ] shares of Cross
Media common stock and 50,625 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock
were outstanding. If the proposed amendment to Cross Media's amended and
restated certificate of incorporation, as described on pages [  ] through [  ],
is approved, Cross Media will be authorized to issue 150,000,000 shares of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $0.001 per share.

COMMON STOCK

     On [               ], 2001, a total of [          ] shares of common stock
of Cross Media were outstanding. The holders of common stock are entitled to one
vote for each share so held and are entitled to notice of any stockholders
meeting and to vote upon any matters as provided in our bylaws or as may be
provided by law. Except for and subject to those rights expressly granted to
holders of preferred stock, and except as may be provided by the laws of the
State of Delaware, the holders of common stock have all other rights of
stockholders, including without limitation:

     - the right to receive dividends, when, as and if declared by Cross Media's
       board of directors; and

     - in the event of any distribution of assets upon a liquidation or
       otherwise, the right to receive all the assets and funds of Cross Media
       remaining after the payment to the holders of the preferred stock of the
       specific amounts to which they are entitled.

PREFERRED STOCK

     The board of directors has the authority, without further action by the
stockholders, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more
series and to designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of
each series. Because Cross Media's board of directors has the power to establish
preferences and rights of each class or series of preferred stock, it may afford
the stockholders of any series or class of preferred stock preferences, powers
and rights, voting or otherwise, senior to the rights of holders of shares of
Cross Media common stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock could have
the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of Cross
Media.

     Cross Media currently has one series of preferred stock authorized, issued
and outstanding, the Series A preferred stock. Cross Media has entered into an
agreement with the holder of the Series A Shares which provides that all of the
Series A Shares will be redeemed and/or converted into Cross Media common stock
simultaneously with and conditioned upon the consummation of the merger or the
terms of the Series A Shares will be amended if the merger is not completed as
described on [  ]. Cross Media has no current plans to issue any additional
shares of preferred stock.

     SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

     There are currently 50,625 shares of preferred stock outstanding. The face
amount of the Series A preferred stock is $100 per share or a total of
$5,062,500 for all of the outstanding Series A preferred stock.

     Dividends.  Dividends are payable on the Series A preferred stock on July 1
and January 1 of each year at an annual rate of 10% of the face amount.
Dividends are payable in cash or, if the conditions described in the certificate
of designations are satisfied, in additional shares of common stock valued at
the conversion price on the dividend payment date.

     Liquidation.  In the event of Cross Media's liquidation, the shares of
Series A preferred stock are entitled to receive a liquidation preference before
any amounts are paid to holders of Cross Media common stock. The liquidation
preference equals the stated value plus any accrued and unpaid dividends.

     Redemption.  Subject to the agreements discussed below, Cross Media has the
right to redeem all, but not less than all, of the outstanding Series A
preferred stock at a redemption price of 100% of face value plus any accrued and
unpaid dividends, provided that the average of the closing ask prices of the
common stock of Cross Media for the 20 trading days preceding Cross Media's
notice of redemption is less than $5.00 per share.

     Conversion.  The Series A preferred stock are convertible at the option of
the holder into a number of shares of Cross Media common stock determined by
dividing the applicable conversion price into the stated value of the Series A
preferred stock. The conversion price is currently equal to the lower of $1.9250
and 91% of the average of the three lowest, non-consecutive closing bid prices
for the common stock of Cross Media during the 10 trading days preceding the
date of the holder's notice to Cross Media of the conversion, with an exercise
price of $1.50.

     The conversion price of the Series A preferred stock is currently subject
to downward adjustment to equal the lowest price at which shares of Cross Media
common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for,
shares of Cross Media common stock, are issued while the Series A preferred
stock remain outstanding, subject to certain exceptions. These exceptions
include the issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion or exercise of
outstanding options, warrants or convertible securities, the grant of options
under Cross Media's stock option plans and the issuance of common stock upon
exercise of those options. The conversion price of the Series A preferred stock
is also subject to other anti-dilution protections.

     The terms of the Series A preferred stock, as amended, provide that the
shares are not convertible if and to the extent that the issuance of shares of
Cross Media common stock to the holder upon conversion would result in the
holder being deemed to be the "beneficial owner" of 10% of more of the then
outstanding shares of Cross Media common stock. This limitation would not
prevent a holder from converting its Series A preferred stock into 9.9% of Cross
Media's then outstanding common stock, subsequently selling shares of Cross
Media's common stock, and then converting additional Series A convertible
preferred stock. Thus, the total number of shares of common stock potentially
issuable to the selling stockholder upon the conversion of the Series A
preferred stock and exercise of the related warrants, in the aggregate, may
equal or exceed 10% of Cross Media's outstanding common stock.

     Voting Rights.  The shares of Series A preferred stock have no right to
vote, except as otherwise provided by law or with respect to certain matters
specified in the certificate of designations. These include changing the rights,
preference or privileges of the Series A preferred stock, creation of a new
class or series of stock having equal or preferential rights to the Series A
Shares upon a liquidation, increasing the number of authorized Series A
preferred stock or changing the rights, preferences or privileges of any other
class of stock in a manner that adversely affects the Series A preferred stock.
However, the holders of Series A preferred stock are entitled to receive prior
notification of a meeting of the stockholders, including copies of any
information sent to the stockholders. If the holders of Series A preferred stock
are entitled by law to vote on any matter as a class, the affirmative vote of a
majority of the Series A preferred stock is required to approve the matter. To
the extent that the holders of Series A preferred stock are entitled by law to
vote together with the holders of common stock, each holder of Series A
preferred stock is entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of shares
of common stock into which that holder's Series A preferred stock are then
convertible.

     AGREEMENT TO AMEND THE SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

     On July 18, 2001, Cross Media entered into agreements with Shaar which
provide that the following will occur, simultaneously with and conditioned upon
the consummation of the merger:

     - Cross Media will redeem 25,312.5 Series A Shares for a cash payment of
       $2,531,250, or $100 per share, provided that Shaar may elect to convert
       these shares into shares of Cross Media common stock at a conversion
       price of $1.48 per share, in which event Shaar would receive 1,710,304
       shares of common stock; and Shaar will convert the remaining 25,312.2
       Series A Shares, at a conversion price of $1.48 per share, into 1,710,304
       shares of common stock.

     - In consideration of Shaar's agreement to convert at least half of the
       Series A Shares into Cross Media common stock, Cross Media will pay Shaar
       $968,750. Shaar may elect to receive this payment:

         - wholly in cash;

         - in cash and Cross Media common stock, based on a $1.48 price per
           share; or

         - wholly in Cross Media common stock.

     - All accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A Shares that are
       converted and redeemed will be paid through the issuance of additional
       shares of Cross Media common stock, based upon the $1.48 per share
       conversion price.

     - The warrants to purchase 375,000 shares of Cross Media common stock
       issued to Shaar in connection with its purchase of the Series A Shares
       will be amended to replace the existing anti-dilution provisions with
       standard broad-based weighted average anti-dilution provisions. Cross
       Media will issue to Shaar additional five-year warrants to purchase
       250,000 shares of its common stock with an exercise price of $1.9845.
       These warrants will have the same anti-dilution provisions as the amended
       warrants referred to above.

     These agreements with Shaar also provide that, if the merger agreement is
terminated or the merger is not completed by June 18, 2002, Shaar must elect to
do one of the following:

     - Exchange the Series A Shares for a new series of convertible preferred
       stock with a conversion price fixed at $1.48 per share, subject to
       broad-based weighted average anti-dilution protection. Cross Media would
       be required to redeem these shares at their stated value, $100 per share,
       plus accrued and unpaid dividends on June 9, 2004, but would have no
       right to redeem the shares at any time prior to June 9, 2004. The new
       series would contain substantially the same provisions with respect to
       dividends, voting rights, protective provisions, liquidation preference
       and seniority as the existing Series A Shares. If Shaar elects this
       alternative, Shaar's existing warrants to purchase 375,000 shares of
       Cross Media common stock will be amended to provide for standard
       broad-based weighted average anti-dilution provisions, but Cross Media
       will not issue additional warrants to the holder; or

     - Exchange the Series A Shares for a new series of convertible preferred
       stock with the same terms and provisions as the existing Series A Shares,
       except that, during the period beginning on the date of the exchange
       through the earlier of the six month anniversary of the date of the
       exchange and June 9, 2002, the minimum conversion price for the shares in
       the new series will be $1.50 per share, and Cross Media will not be
       permitted to redeem the shares in the new series.

     Cross Media's agreements with Shaar also provide that during the period
from July 18, 2001 through the earlier of the closing of the merger and the
exchange of new Series A Shares for a new series of preferred stock described
above, but in any event no later than July 18, 2002, the minimum conversion
price for the Series A Shares will be $1.50, unless an anti-dilution adjustment
reduces the conversion price to less than $1.50, in which event the $1.50
minimum would no longer apply, and Cross Media will not be permitted to redeem
the Series A Shares.

REGISTRAR AND TRANSFER AGENT

     Cross Media's registrar and transfer agent is Computershare Trust Company
Inc.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS

     Cross Media is a Delaware corporation and is subject to Section 203 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law, referred to as DGCL. Section 203 restricts an
"interested stockholder" from engaging in

a business combination with Cross Media for three years following the time that
person became an interested stockholder unless:

     - the board of directors approved either the business combination or the
       transaction in which the stockholder became an interested stockholder
       prior to the date the interested stockholder attained this status;

     - upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder
       becoming an interested stockholder, the stockholder owned at least 85% of
       the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the
       transaction commenced, excluding shares owned by persons who are
       directors and also officers and certain employee stock option plans; or

     - at or subsequent to the time the business combination is approved by the
       board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of
       stockholders by the holders of at least 66 2/3% of Cross Media's
       outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.

     A "business combination" includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other
transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An
"interested stockholder" is a person who, together with affiliates and
associates, owns, or within three years prior to the determination of interested
stockholder status, did own, 15% or more of a corporation's voting stock.

     In addition, in accordance with Section 161 of the DGCL, the board of
directors of Cross Media can, without stockholder approval, issue shares of
capital stock, which may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a
change of control of Cross Media. Other than pursuant to the merger, Cross Media
has no plan or arrangement for the issuance of any shares of capital stock other
than in the ordinary course or pursuant to the 1998 Cross Media Stock Option
Plan.

     Provisions of Cross Media's certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be
deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, deter or prevent a merger,
tender offer, proxy contest or other takeover attempt. The following discussion
is a general summary of these provisions which might be determined to have a
potential "anti-takeover" effect. Reference should be made in each case to Cross
Media's certificate of incorporation and bylaws. See "Where You Can Find More
Information" for information regarding how to obtain a copy of these documents.

     Cross Media's certificate of incorporation authorizes the Cross Media board
of directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with terms,
rights, preferences and designations as the board of directors may determine and
without any vote of the stockholders, unless otherwise required by law.

     Cross Media's bylaws fix the number of directors at one or more as
determined by resolution of the board of directors. The board of directors of
Cross Media is currently comprised of five directors, and there are two
vacancies on the board of directors. After the merger, the number of directors
on Cross Media's board of directors will be seven.

     Stockholders are not entitled to cumulate their votes in connection with
the election of directors. As a result, a person or group controlling the
majority of shares of Cross Media common stock can elect all of the directors.
Following the merger, assuming no exercise or conversion of options, warrants or
other equity rights and if approximately 82% of LifeMinders common stock is
converted into Cross Media common stock, the board of directors of Cross Media
will own 1,070,291 shares of Cross Media common stock representing approximately
1.6% of the issued and outstanding Cross Media common stock which may allow it
to control actions taken by stockholders, including the election of directors.
See "Principal Stockholders of Cross Media" and "Risk Factors."

     Cross Media's bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may only
be called by the Chairman of the Board.

     Cross Media's certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions
permitted under the DGCL relating to the liability of directors. These
provisions eliminate the directors' liability for monetary damages for a breach
of fiduciary duty to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. Cross Media's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws also contain provisions which provide
for the indemnification of its directors and officers to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL.

                    DESCRIPTION OF LIFEMINDERS CAPITAL STOCK

GENERAL

     LifeMinders' authorized capital stock consists of 60,000,000 shares of
common stock, $0.01 par value, and 9,665,240 shares of preferred stock, $0.01
par value. The following is a summary of material terms of the common stock and
the preferred stock. The summary is subject to, and qualified in its entirety
by, LifeMinders restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and by the
provisions of applicable law.

COMMON STOCK

     As of August 1, 2001, there were 26,625,463 shares of LifeMinders common
stock outstanding that were held of record by 391 stockholders. The holders of
LifeMinders common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be
voted upon by the stockholders. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to
any outstanding preferred stock, the holders of common stock are entitled to
receive ratably the dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by
the board of directors out of funds legally available for this purpose. In the
event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of LifeMinders, the holders
of common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after
payment of liabilities, subject to any remaining prior distribution rights of
preferred stock. The LifeMinders common stock has no cumulative voting,
preemptive or conversion or other subscription rights. There are no redemption
or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. All outstanding
shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable.

PREFERRED STOCK

     The LifeMinders' board of directors has the authority to issue up to
9,665,240 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions of those shares, including dividend
rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption,
redemption prices, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting
any series or the designation of the series, without further vote or action by
the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of
delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of LifeMinders without
further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other
rights of the holders of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock with
voting and conversion rights may adversely affect the voting power of the
holders of common stock, including the loss of voting control to others. As of
August 1, 2001, no shares of LifeMinders' preferred stock were issued or
outstanding and LifeMinders has no plans to issue any of the preferred stock.

ANTI-TAKEOVER EFFECTS OF PROVISIONS OF THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, BYLAWS
AND DELAWARE LAW

     RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS

     LifeMinders has a classified board of directors, divided into three
staggered classes. One class of directors is elected at each annual meeting of
the stockholders. The bylaws provide that stockholders may call a special
meeting of stockholders only upon a written request of stockholders owning at
least 25% of the capital stock. These provisions of the restated certificate of
incorporation and bylaws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and
could delay or prevent a change in control of LifeMinders. These provisions are
intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the
composition of the board of directors and in the policies formulated by the
board of directors and to discourage certain types of transactions that may
involve an actual or threatened change of control of LifeMinders. These
provisions are designed to reduce LifeMinders' vulnerability to an unsolicited
acquisition proposal. These provisions also are intended to discourage certain
tactics that may be used in proxy fights. However, these provisions could have
the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for the company's
shares and, as a consequence, they also may inhibit fluctuations in the market
price of its shares that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts.
These provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in LifeMinders'
management.

 DELAWARE LAW

     LifeMinders is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions. Section 203 prohibits a publicly
held Delaware corporation from engaging in a "business combination" with an
"interested stockholder" for a period of three years following the time the
person became an interested stockholder, unless:

     - the board of directors approved either the business combination or the
       transaction in which the stockholder became an interested stockholder
       prior to the date the interested stockholder attained this status;

     - upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder
       becoming an interested stockholder, the stockholder owned at least 85% of
       the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the
       transaction commenced, excluding shares owned by persons who are
       directors and also officers and certain employee stock option plans; or

     - at or subsequent to the time the business combination is approved by the
       board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of
       stockholders by the holders of at least 66 2/3% of LifeMinders'
       outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.

     A "business combination" includes a merger, asset or stock sale, issuance
of voting stock and certain other transactions. An "interested stockholder" is a
person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years
prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, did own, 15% or
more of a corporation's voting stock.

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

     LifeMinders has granted certain holders of its outstanding common stock
registration rights. Pursuant to these rights, LifeMinders has filed two
registration statements on Form S-3 under the Securities Act covering,
respectively, 1,252,198 and 639,713 shares of common stock of LifeMinders. As of
August 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission had not declared these
registration statements effective.

TRANSFER AGENT AND REGISTRAR

     The Transfer Agent and Registrar for LifeMinders common stock is American
Stock Transfer & Trust Company.

                       COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHTS

     Cross Media and LifeMinders are both organized under the laws of the State
of Delaware. Any differences, therefore, in the rights of holders of Cross Media
capital stock and LifeMinders capital stock arise primarily from differences in
their respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws. After the merger is
completed, the rights of LifeMinders stockholders who become Cross Media
stockholders will be governed by Cross Media's certificate of incorporation and
bylaws and the DGCL.

     The following is a summary of the material differences between Cross Media
stockholders' rights and LifeMinders stockholders' rights. This summary is
qualified in its entirety by references to applicable provisions of the DGCL,
Cross Media's certificate of incorporation and bylaws and LifeMinders'
certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

CAPITAL

     CROSS MEDIA.  Cross Media has the authority to issue 110,000,000 shares of
capital stock consisting of 100,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value
of $.001 per share and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of
$.001 per share. If the proposed amendment and restatement to Cross Media's
certificate of incorporation, as described on pages [  ] through [  ], is
approved, Cross Media will be authorized to issue 150,000,000 shares of common
stock, par value $.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value $.001 per share.

     LIFEMINDERS.  LifeMinders has the authority to issue 69,665,240 shares of
capital stock, consisting of 60,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value
of $.01 per share and 9,665,240 shares of preferred stock with a par value of
$.01 per share, of which (i) 1,000,000 shares are designated Series A
convertible preferred stock with a par value of $.01 per share, (ii) 1,000,000
shares are designated Series B convertible preferred stock with a par value of
$.01 per share, (iii) 2,620,373 are designated Series C convertible preferred
stock with a par value of $.01 per share, (iv) 2,252,874 shares are designated
Series D convertible preferred stock with a par value of $.01 per share and (v)
2,791,993 shares are designated Series E convertible preferred stock with a par
value $.01 per share. No shares of LifeMinders preferred stock are outstanding.

PREFERRED STOCK

     CROSS MEDIA.  Cross Media's certificate of incorporation authorizes the
board of directors to issue from time to time preferred stock in one or more
classes or series, each of which class or series shall have the distinctive
designation or title as is fixed by the board of directors. Prior to the
issuance of any class or series of preferred stock, Cross Media's board of
directors will fix the voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and
preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and
qualifications, limitations or restrictions relating to the class or series of
preferred stock.

     Cross Media currently has one series of preferred stock authorized, issued
and outstanding, the Series A preferred stock. Cross Media has entered into an
agreement with the holder of the Series A Shares which provides that all of the
Series A Shares will be redeemed and/or converted into Cross Media common stock
simultaneously with and conditioned upon the consummation of the merger or the
terms of the Series A Shares will be amended if the merger is not completed as
described on page [  ]. Cross Media has no current plans to issue any additional
shares of preferred stock.

     LIFEMINDERS.  LifeMinders' certificate of incorporation authorizes the
board of directors to provide for the issuance of the shares of preferred stock
in series, and by filing a certificate to establish from time to time the number
of shares to be included in each series and the qualifications, limitations or
restrictions thereof. The authority of the board of directors includes, but is
not limited to the following:

     - The number of shares constituting that series and the distinctive
       designation of that series;

     - The dividend rate, if any on the shares of that series, whether dividends
       shall be cumulative, and, if so, from which date or dates, and the
       relative rights of priority, if any, of payment of dividends on shares of
       that series;

     - Whether that series shall have voting rights, in addition to the voting
       rights provided by law, and, if so, the terms of the voting rights;

     - Whether that series shall have conversion obligations or privileges, and,
       if so, the terms and conditions of the conversion, including provision
       for adjustment of the conversion rate in such events as the board of
       directors shall determine;

     - Whether or not the shares of that series shall be redeemable, and, if so,
       the terms and conditions of the redemption, including the date or dates
       upon or after which they shall be redeemable, and the amount per share
       payable in case of redemption, which amount may vary under different
       conditions and at different redemption dates;

     - Whether that series shall have a sinking fund for the redemption or
       purchases of shares of that series, and, if so, the terms and amount of
       the sinking fund;

     - The rights of the shares of that series in the event of voluntary or
       involuntary liquidation dissolution or winding up of the corporation, and
       the relative rights of priority, if any, of payment of shares of that
       series; and

     - Any other relative rights, preferences and limitations of that series.

STOCKHOLDER VOTING

     LIFEMINDERS.  LifeMinders' certificate of incorporation provides that each
holder of shares of common stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of
common stock held on all matters as to which holders of common stock shall be
entitled to vote. In addition to the rights provided by law, each share of
preferred stock shall entitle the holder to a number of votes as shall equal the
number of shares of common stock into which the share of preferred stock is
convertible. The holders of preferred stock shall be entitled to vote on all
matters as to which holders of common stock shall be entitled to vote, in the
same manner and with the same effect as the holders of common stock, voting
together with the holders of common stock as one class.

CUMULATIVE VOTING

     CROSS MEDIA.  Neither Cross Media's certificate of incorporation nor its
bylaws provide for cumulative voting.

     LIFEMINDERS.  LifeMinders' bylaws provide that each share of stock may be
voted for as many individuals as there are directors to be elected and for whose
election the share is entitled to be voted.

MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

     CROSS MEDIA.  Cross Media's bylaws provide that an annual meeting of the
stockholders for the election of directors shall be held on a date and at a time
as may be designated, from time to time, by resolution of the board of
directors. Cross Media's bylaws also provide that special meetings of the
stockholders for the purpose of any action which the stockholders are permitted
to take under the DGCL may be called at any time by the chairman of the board.

     LIFEMINDERS.  LifeMinders' bylaws provide that an annual meeting of the
stockholders shall be held as may be fixed from time to time by the board of
directors. LifeMinders' bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may
be called by the chairman of the board, the president, the board of directors or
by the secretary upon a request in writing by the stockholders entitled to cast
at least 25% of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting.

PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

     Neither Cross Media stockholders nor LifeMinders stockholders have a
preemptive right to acquire or subscribe to any or all additional issues of
stock.

SIZE AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     CROSS MEDIA.  Cross Media's bylaws provide that the board of directors
shall consist of one or more members, the number thereof to be determined from
time to time by resolution of the board of directors. Currently, the board of
directors is composed of five directors and there are two vacancies.

     LIFEMINDERS.  LifeMinders' bylaws provide that the number of directors
shall not be less than seven; provided, however, that this number may be
increased and thereafter decreased or increased from time to time by a vote of a
majority of the board of directors. The number of directors shall not exceed 11.
Currently, the board of directors is composed of six directors.

     The directors are divided into three classes with the term of office of the
first class to expire in the first year, the second class to expire in the

or without cause by the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at
an election of the directors.

                                 LEGAL MATTERS

     The validity of the shares of Cross Media common stock offered hereby will
be passed upon for Cross Media by Blank Rome Comisky & McCauley LLP. Certain
legal matters will be passed upon for LifeMinders by Shaw Pittman LLP, a limited

                                    EXPERTS

     The consolidated financial statements of Cross Media, as of December 31,
2000 and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2000
included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/ prospectus, have been audited
by Grant Thornton LLP, independent certified public accountants, whose report
thereon appears therein, given upon the authority of said firm as experts in
accounting and auditing.

     The consolidated financial statements of LifeMinders as of December 31,
2000 and 1999 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2000 included in this joint proxy statement/ prospectus, have been so included
in reliance on the report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent
accountants, given upon the authority of said firm as experts in auditing and
accounting.

          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information
is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated
financial statements and related notes of Cross Media and LifeMinders included
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma
information is presented for illustration purposes only in accordance with the
assumptions set forth below. This information is not necessarily indicative of
the operating results or of the financial position that would have occurred if
the merger had been consummated and the Series A Shares had been redeemed and
converted as of the dates or for the periods indicated, nor is it necessarily
indicative of the future operating results or financial position of the combined
company. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information does
not reflect any adjustments to conform accounting practices, except for certain
reclassifications, or to reflect any cost savings or other synergies anticipated
as a result of the merger.

     The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
reflect adjustments to the historical consolidated balance sheets and statements
of operations of Cross Media and LifeMinders to give effect to the merger under
the purchase method of accounting and the redemption and conversion by Cross
Media of all of its outstanding Series A Shares simultaneously with and
conditioned upon the consummation of the merger, as discussed in detail below.
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet of Cross Media and
LifeMinders as of June 30, 2001 combines Cross Media's balance sheet at June 30,
2001 with LifeMinders' balance sheet at June 30, 2001, and gives pro forma
effect to the merger and conversion and redemption of the Series A Shares at
that date. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations
for the six months ended June 30, 2001, and for the year ended December 31,
2000, combine the historical results of operations of Cross Media and
LifeMinders for the periods presented and assume that the merger and the
conversion and redemption of the Series A Shares had occurred at the beginning
of the periods presented.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2000, and as of and for the six months ended June 30,
2001, include adjustments to give effect to the conversion and redemption by
Cross Media of its outstanding 50,625 Series A Shares. Cross Media will also
issue 407,320 shares of common stock to the holder in settlement of accrued
dividends. Under the terms of the agreement with the holder of the Series A
Shares, the redemption and conversion of the Series A Shares will occur
simultaneously with and is conditioned upon the consummation of the merger. The
pro forma balance sheet also includes adjustments to account for dividends
associated with the conversion and redemption of the Series A Shares by Cross
Media as additional purchase price, because under the amended and restated
merger agreement Cross Media must redeem or convert all of the outstanding
50,625 Series A Shares in order to consummate the merger with LifeMinders.

     (d) The following table provides a preliminary analysis of (1) the
aggregate purchase price of LifeMinders, and (2) the allocation of excess of the
purchase price over the adjusted book value of the net assets acquired to the
fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This preliminary
analysis is based on certain assumptions that Cross Media believes are
reasonable including the assumption that the aggregate merger consideration that
Cross Media will pay to the LifeMinders stockholders will consist of the maximum
cash consideration of $24 million and approximately 22.3 million shares of Cross
Media common stock. The fair market value of the common stock included in the
pro forma determination of the purchase price was determined by using the
average closing price of Cross Media common stock during the several days
preceding August 20, 2001, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
("EITF"), Issue 99-12 "Determination of the Measurement Date for the Market
Price of Acquirer Securities Issued in a Purchase Business Combination."

     The determination of the purchase price by Cross Media in accordance with
EITF 99-12 is not necessarily indicative of and could differ significantly from
the value of the merger consideration to be issued to the LifeMinders
stockholders.

    expense resulting from the write-down of certain LifeMinders' assets to
    their estimated fair market values.

(d) Includes $7.1 million of sales and marketing costs reclassified to direct

Board of Directors
  Cross Media Marketing Corporation and Subsidiaries

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cross Media
Marketing Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatements. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Cross Media
Marketing Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                           DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999

NOTE A -- ORGANIZATION

     The Company was incorporated in Delaware on May 9, 1997 under the name
Brack Industries Inc. The Company changed its name to Symposium Corporation in
December 1998 and changed its name to Cross Media Marketing Corporation in
December 2000. The Company's principal business strategy is to integrate well
established direct marketing skills with a variety of new technologies,
including e-mail marketing, web-based systems and interactive voice response,
ultimately resulting in a multi-faceted marketing platform for the sale of
products and services.

     The Company was inactive until December 1998. From December 1998 through
June 1999, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Publishers Advantage
Corporation ("PAC"), had minimal operations and was principally engaged in
telemarketing in the United States for magazine and periodical subscription
renewals to persons whose subscriptions had recently expired. The Company
discontinued the operations of PAC as of June 30, 1999. In November 1999, the
Company formed Media Outsourcing, Inc. ("MOS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary, to
acquire the assets of Direct Sales International, LP. The Company completed this
acquisition in January 2000 (see Note C).

NOTE B -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

     Cash and Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash
equivalents at December 31, 2000 consists of an overnight repurchase agreement
of approximately $1.8 million and deposits in a money market fund of
approximately $495,000.

     Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which range
from three to seven years.

     Goodwill Amortization: Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price
over the fair market value of net assets acquired in a business combination.
Goodwill is amortized as an expense on a straight-line basis over a period from
seven to ten years. The carrying value of goodwill is analyzed quarterly by the
Company, based upon the expected revenue and profitability levels of the
acquired enterprise, to determine whether the value and future benefit may
indicate a decline in value. If the Company determines that there has been a
decline in value of the acquired enterprise, the Company writes down the value
of the goodwill to the revised fair value.

     Deferred Financing Costs: Deferred financing costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the related credit facility (see Note F),
which is three years.

     Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation: The Company has elected to follow
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees" ("APB No. 25"). Under APB No. 25, when the exercise price of an
employee stock option granted by the Company is equal to or greater than the
market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation
expense is recognized.

     Net Loss Per Share: Net loss per share is presented under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share" ("SFAS No. 128").
In accordance with SFAS No. 128, basic and diluted net loss per share has been
computed using the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
during the period. Potentially dilutive securities, consisting of 16,558,000 and
                                       F-8

                       CROSS MEDIA MARKETING CORPORATION

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

2,803,000 outstanding options and warrants for the years ended December 31, 2000
and 1999, respectively, have been excluded from the computation, as their effect
is anti-dilutive. If the Company had reported net income, diluted earnings per
share would have included the shares used in the computation of net loss per
share plus common equivalent shares related to 16,558,000 and 2,803,000
outstanding options and warrants for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

     Revenues: Revenues derived from originating magazine subscriptions are
recognized by the Company when the Company receives the first installment
payment for subscriptions purchased. The customer can cancel the subscription
within ten days of the order. Amounts collected from customers prior to the
expiration of the cancellation period are recorded as deferred revenues.
Revenues also include commissions earned from publishers in connection with
originating paid subscriptions for certain publications. Commissions are also
earned from outside parties for securing memberships in a discount-buying club
and sales of long-distance telephone services. Commissions are recognized when
the related subscriptions or memberships are obtained. Revenues are reflected
net of cancellation, collection reserves, and payments made to publishers for
fulfillment costs. Cancellation reserves are based upon the Company's historical
cancellation experience.

     The Company is in the direct marketing business which it considers its sole
business segment.

     Commission Expense:  Commission expense is recognized when the Company
receives the first installment payment for subscriptions purchased. Amounts paid
to brokers prior to the expiration of the ten-day cancellation period are
recorded as deferred expenses.

     Reclassification: Certain amounts in the December 31, 1999 financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the December 31, 2000
classifications.

     Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements: The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as
well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The recorded values of cash, accounts
receivable, and accrued liabilities reflected in the financial statements
approximates their fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments.
Borrowings under the line of credit approximate fair value as such line is
subject to a variable interest rate that reflects adjustments in the market
rates of interest. The recorded value of the stock note receivable approximates
fair value.

     Concentration of Credit Risk: The Company's financial instruments that are
exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents and trade accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash
equivalents with high quality credit institutions. At times, such investments
may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit.
The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is
not exposed to any significant credit risks. Financial instruments which
potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist
principally of trade accounts receivable as the Company does not require
collateral or other securities to support customer receivables. The Company
sells primarily to individuals throughout the United States. However, credit
risk concentration is mitigated, due to the significant number of customers with
relatively small balances and the geographical dispersion of the Company's
customer base.

NOTE C -- ACQUISITION OF ASSETS OF DIRECT SALES INTERNATIONAL, LP ("DSI
ACQUISITION")

     On January 28, 2000, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary MOS,
acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of
Direct Sales International, LP ("DSI"), a Georgia

limited partnership, for approximately $27.6 million, including closing costs of
approximately $1.1 million and an agreement to provide approximately $1.5
million of funding to AmeriNet, Inc. ("AmeriNet"), a company 50.1% owned by the
seller of DSI. Such acquisition liability was settled during the fourth quarter
of 2000 (see Note D). The Company also granted to the seller of DSI the right,
which has an intrinsic value of $1.2 million, to sell up to 600,000 shares of
Common Stock back to the Company at a fixed price. Contemporaneously with the
acquisition, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with the seller of
DSI that terminates on December 31, 2002, and an amended secured promissory note
of $2.5 million (see Note K). The transaction was accounted for as a purchase
business combination.

     The DSI Acquisition was financed with borrowings of $16.0 million ($15.8
million of proceeds, net of fees) under a revolving credit facility entered into
contemporaneously with consummating the DSI Acquisition and with proceeds
received from sales of Common Stock, Common Stock purchase warrants, Series A, B
and C mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock and the acquisition
bridge loans described below.

     The following table provides an analysis of the purchase price of the DSI
Acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the book value of the net
assets acquired has been allocated to goodwill calculated as follows:

will enable the Company to develop sophisticated customer profiles. The Company
paid approximately $2.5 million to acquire WeFusion, including $600,000 in cash
and approximately $1.9 million in Common Stock and warrants. The fair value of
net assets acquired amounted to approximately $500,000, resulting in goodwill of
approximately $2.0 million. Prior to the acquisition, WeFusion had no revenues.

NOTE F -- REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

     On January 28, 2000, the Company and MOS entered into a three-year
revolving credit facility, as amended, with a bank providing for borrowings of
up to $20 million subject to certain availability limitations stipulated in the
agreement (the "Coast Facility"). All borrowings under this facility are
repayable with interest at the prime rate plus 2% per annum but not less than
9%. The Company and MOS are also required to maintain certain minimum earnings
ratios and levels of net worth as defined in the agreement and MOS is restricted
from making distributions to the Company in excess of $1.8 million annually plus
any amounts necessary for tax obligations attributable to its operations. All of
MOS's assets (approximately $41.0 million as of December 31, 2000) are pledged
as collateral for this obligation. As of December 31, 2000, MOS had an
outstanding balance on the Coast Facility of approximately $11.2 million
compared to total availability of $17.9 million resulting in $6.7 million of
funds available to MOS at December 31, 2000.

     In connection with the execution and delivery of the Coast Facility, the
Company initially granted Coast 300,000 five-year Common Stock purchase warrants
at an exercise price of $3.53 per share (110% of the closing price of the Common
Stock on the closing date). As a result of the anti-dilution provisions, the
exercise price was reduced to $2.39 per share and the number of shares issuable
upon exercise of the warrants was increased to 443,884 as of December 31, 2000.
Accordingly, the Company recorded a non-cash interest charge of approximately
$260,000 as of December 31, 2000.

     MOS incurred fees and expenses in connection with the Coast Facility of
approximately $1.1 million, which includes amounts paid to a related party (see
Note R), are being amortized over three years.

NOTE H -- CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

  Series A Convertible Preferred Stock ("New Series A Shares")

     On June 9, 2000, the Company issued 30,375 shares of New Series A Shares
and a five-year warrant to purchase 225,000 shares of Common Stock at an initial
exercise price of $1.4850 (subject to certain anti-dilution and similar
adjustments). The aggregate purchase price for the New Series A Shares and the
warrant was $2,250,000. The Company also granted the purchaser of the New Series
A Shares an option, exercisable in the purchaser's sole discretion during the
sixty day period following June 9, 2000, to purchase up to an additional
$2,025,000 face amount of New Series A Shares and a warrant to purchase an
additional 150,000 shares of Common Stock for the same purchase price. The
purchaser exercised its option, and the Company issued and sold to the purchaser
an additional 20,250 New Series A Shares and the additional warrant on August 1,
2000 for an aggregate purchase price of $1,500,000. The face amount and
liquidation value of the New Series A Shares is $5,062,500.

     Dividends accrue on the New Series A Shares at an annual rate of 10% of the
face amount, payable semi-annually in cash and/or Common Stock at the Company's
option under certain conditions. The New Series A Shares are redeemable, at the
option of the Company under certain conditions, at a redemption price of 100% of
face value plus any accrued and unpaid dividends.

     The New Series A Shares are convertible at a conversion price equal to the
lesser of: (i) $1.93 (110% of the closing bid price of the Common Stock on the
date of the issuance, subject to adjustments); or (ii) 91% of the average of the
three lowest, non-consecutive closing bid prices for the Common Stock in the ten
trading days preceding the date of the holder's conversion notice to the Company
(the "Conversion Notice"). The conversion price and the exercise price of the
warrants are subject to downward adjustment to equal the lowest price at which
shares of the Common Stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or
exercisable for, shares of Common Stock are issued while the New Series A Shares
and warrants remain outstanding (if such price is lower than the then effective
conversion or exercise price), subject to certain exceptions. These exceptions
include: (i) the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion or exercise
of outstanding options, warrants or convertible securities in accordance with
the terms of such options, warrants or convertible securities as in effect upon
the initial issuance date of the New Series A Shares (but subject to certain
anti-dilution adjustments); and (ii) certain issuances of securities to, or
adjustments in the exercise or conversion price of outstanding options, warrants
or convertible securities held by, the holders of the Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock and Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, to the extent the
number of additional shares of Common Stock resulting from such issuances and
adjustments do not exceed 5,000,000 shares.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     By letter agreement dated December 28, 2000 the holder of all the
outstanding New Series A Shares agreed not to convert the New Series A Shares
prior to June 9, 2001 if, on the date of such proposed conversion, the
then-current market price of the Company's Common Stock is less than $1.50 per
share (the "Conversion Floor"). On and after June 9, 2001 there will be no
Conversion Floor. The Company also agreed that it would not redeem the New
Series A Shares prior to June 9, 2001. The conversion provisions of the New
Series A Shares and warrants create a substantial risk of dilution to the
holders of the Company's Common Stock.

     The holder further agreed that the payment of semi-annual dividends on the
New Series A Shares for calendar year 2000 will be extended until March 28,
2001.

     On June 14, 2000, the Company issued 7,500 shares of Series C Preferred

consideration of the agreement of the holders to convert the Series C Shares and
New Series C Shares (which would otherwise have been mandatorily redeemable by
the Company in full on February 15, 2001), the Company agreed to issue to the
holders, pro rata in accordance with the number of shares converted by each of

NOTE J -- PREFERRED STOCK ACCOUNTING

     The Company accounted for the issuances of its preferred stock as described
in Note I in accordance with EITF Issue No. 98-5, as amended by EITF Issue No.
00-27. Both Issues are titled "Convertible Securities With Beneficial Conversion
Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios". As a result of the
issuance and adoption of EITF 00-27 in November 2000, the Company has adjusted
preferred stock dividends recorded in prior 2000 quarters that were related to
effective beneficial conversion features resulting in approximately $1.8 million
of additional dividends recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000.

     The following table summarizes (i) the allocation of the proceeds from the
issuances of preferred stock with Common Stock and Common Stock purchase
warrants, (ii) the preferred stock dividends and reduction in retained earnings
resulting from the beneficial conversion feature and (iii) the incremental
preferred stock dividends and reduction in retained earnings that would result
from contractual changes in conversion prices in the event of a default:

     All of the preferred shares, except for the New Series A Shares, were
issued with effective beneficial conversion features representing the difference
between the market value of the Company's Common Stock and the initial effective
conversion ratio on the date of issuance, based upon the amount of proceeds
allocated to the preferred shares. Since the preferred shares were immediately
convertible into Common Stock, the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion
feature has been recognized as deemed dividends on the date of issuance.

     Deemed dividends accreted/conversion represents (i) normal accretion of the
difference between the carrying value of the preferred stock and its mandatory
redemption value; (ii) additional deemed dividends resulting from reductions in
conversion prices relating to effective beneficial conversion features; (iii)
Common Stock and warrants issued to holders in exchange for extending mandatory
redemption dates of certain of the preferred stock and (iv) Common Stock issued
on the conversion of the preferred stock. The Common Stock and warrants issued
or repriced in connection with extensions and conversions described in (ii) and
(iii) were accounted for at their fair market values on their respective dates
of issuance.

NOTE K -- NOTE RECEIVABLE FOR COMMON STOCK

     In June 1999, the Company issued 2.5 million shares of its Common Stock to
the seller of DSI for $1.00 per share in exchange for a note receivable with
interest at 7.75% per annum. In January 2000, the note was amended, at which
time the seller paid $2,500 of the principal and the due date for the remaining
balance was extended to January 2003 (except that if the holder sells any
portion of the stock, a portion of the proceeds from such sale must be applied
toward repaying the note). In addition, the requirement to pay interest was
rescinded. The stock note receivable is presented in the stockholders' equity
section of the balance sheet. The seller has pledged 1.9 million shares as
collateral for the note. The seller has the right to sell up to 600,000 shares
back to the Company for $3.00 per share from January 2001 to the date that is
180 days following the effective date of a registration statement covering the
shares.

NOTE L -- ACQUISITION BRIDGE LOANS

  Commtel Services LTD Note

     On January 20, 2000, the Company entered into a note agreement with Commtel
Services, Ltd. for a 30-day bridge loan in the principal amount of $300,000 that
was due, with interest at 10% per annum, on February 20, 2000. The proceeds of
the loan were used to acquire DSI. The Company issued 75,000 shares of its
Common Stock to Commtel as consideration for the loan.

                       CROSS MEDIA MARKETING CORPORATION

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     The proceeds received from the issuance of the note with Common Stock were
allocated to each component based on their relative fair values on January 20,
2000 (the date of issuance). The fair value of the Common Stock on January 20,
2000 was $2.31 and resulted in discounted carrying value to the note of $200,000
and an increase to stockholders' equity of $100,000.

     The Company defaulted on its obligation to repay the note on its due date
and, as a result, the interest rate increased to 18% per annum and the Company
was required to immediately issue 50,000 additional shares of its Common Stock
to Commtel.

     On March 21, 2000, Commtel agreed to convert the note into 614,048 shares
of Common Stock (representing a $.50 per share conversion ratio) in settlement
of the $300,000 principal balance plus accrued interest of approximately $7,000.
In addition, the Company was also required to issue an additional 77,500 shares
of Common Stock to Commtel pursuant to the default provisions of the note under
which Commtel was entitled to 2,500 additional shares of Common Stock for each
day the note remained in default. As a result of the above, Commtel received an
aggregate of 816,548 shares Common Stock.

     As a result of the conversion, the Company recorded additional interest
expense of approximately $1.2 million, including (i) contractual interest of
10%; (ii) the fair market value of additional shares of Common Stock issued in
exchange for the holders agreement to convert; (iii) the additional shares
issued under the penalty provision; (iv) and the intrinsic value of the
beneficial conversion of the note into 614,048 shares of Common Stock.

full, with interest of approximately $11,000, in June 2000.

NOTE M -- NOTES PAYABLE

2000. In connection with the execution and delivery of the term loan agreement,
the Company issued 100,000 five-year Common Stock purchase warrants, with an
estimated fair value of $103,000, at an exercise price of $1.50 per share. On
July 31, 2000, the Company paid $100,000 of the outstanding principal of the
loan plus accrued interest and agreed with the holder to extend the maturity of
the remaining principal balance to December 31, 2000 in consideration of the
issuance to such holder of 80,000 five-year Common Stock purchase warrants, with
an estimated fair value of $133,600, at an exercise price of $2.00 per share.

pricing model. The Company repaid the remaining balance of the loan, with
interest of approximately $11,000, in December 2000.

NOTE N -- COSTS OF ACQUISITIONS NOT CONSUMMATED

     In August 2000, the Company entered into an agreement (the "Agreement"), to
acquire National Syndications, Inc. ("NSI"), a direct marketer of consumer
products and a party to service advertising contracts. In February 2001, the
Company and NSI terminated the Agreement. As a result of such termination, in
the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a charge of $967,500,
representing the write-off of non-refundable deposits and professional fees
incurred related to the NSI transaction.

     In February 2000, the Company announced its decision not to exercise its
options to purchase 50.1% of the outstanding Common Stock of AmeriNet and all of
the outstanding Common Stock of Hamilton Telecommunications, Ltd. ("Hamilton").
As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $621,716 during the fourth quarter
of 1999 representing the cost of legal and professional fees. The charge, which
is presented as the cost of acquisitions not consummated, principally consists
of legal and professional fees, including $38,000 for the fair value of Common
Stock purchase warrants and $432,000 for 225,000 shares of Common Stock that
were issued to various consultants.

     In connection with the AmeriNet agreement, the Company made a $500,000 loan
to AmeriNet, which bears interest at 8%. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the
entire amount of the note was reserved due to its uncertainty of collection.

NOTE O -- EXTRAORDINARY LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF ACQUISITION LIABILITY

     As part of the DSI Acquisition, the Company agreed to provide a $1.5
million credit facility to AmeriNet (see Note C). During 2000, the Company
loaned an aggregate $300,000 in connection with the credit facility. In November
2000, the Company exchanged 1.0 million shares of its Common Stock, with a fair
value of $1.9 million, in full satisfaction of the remaining obligation to
AmeriNet and accordingly, recognized in the fourth quarter 2000, an
extraordinary loss on the extinguishment of acquisition liability of $767,500.

NOTE P -- DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS

     In 1999, deferred acquisition costs of $514,317 principally represent legal
and consulting fees incurred in connection with the Company's acquisition of the
assets and business of DSI and include $272,000 for the fair value of warrants
issued to consultants in exchange for services. These costs were added to the
acquisition purchase price in determining the total cost to be allocated to the
net assets acquired (see Note C).

     As of December 31, 2000, the Company has Federal and state net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $7.0 million that will be available to
offset future taxable income, if any, through December 2020. The utilization of
net operating losses is subject to a substantial limitation due to the "change
of ownership" provisions under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and
similar state provisions. Such limitation may result in the expiration of the
net operating losses before their utilization. A 100% valuation allowance has
been established to reserve for the deferred tax assets arising from the net
operating losses and other temporary differences due to the uncertainty that
their benefit will be realized in the future.

     The following is a reconciliation of the normal expected statutory Federal
income tax rate to the effective rate reported in the financial statements.

NOTE T -- STOCK OPTIONS

     In December 1998, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of a stock
option plan (the "Plan"). The Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee to
administer the Plan and to grant to eligible directors, officers, employees and
consultants of the Company, non-qualified and "incentive stock options" within
the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Plan, as
amended, provides for the reservation and availability of up to 6,500,000 shares
of Common Stock of the Company, subject to future stock splits, stock dividends,
reorganizations and similar events. The exercise price of incentive stock
options may not be less than the fair market value of a share of the Common
Stock at the date of grant. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to set
the exercise price of non-qualified stock options that are not incentive stock
options. The Plan limits the number of shares with respect to which options may
be granted in a year to any one optionee to 2,000,000 shares.

     The Company has adopted the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS
No. 123"). SFAS No. 123 establishes financial accounting and reporting standards
for stock-based employee compensation plans. SFAS No. 123 applies the intrinsic
value method prescribed under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and
related interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans and
therefore has not recognized compensation expense for stock options issued to
employees and Directors, since the exercise prices of those awards are equal to
the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant.

     If the Company had elected to recognize compensation expense based upon the
fair value at the grant date, consistent with the methodology prescribed by SFAS
No. 123, pro forma net loss and net loss per share to Common Stockholders for
the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 would have increased to the following
pro-forma amounts:

     The 1999 shares sold for cash include 28,500 shares issued pursuant to the
exercise of Common Stock purchase warrants.

     As of December 31, 2000, there were 29,604,519 issued and outstanding
shares of Common Stock. If the holders of all outstanding options and Common
Stock purchase warrants as of December 31, 2000 exercised those options and
warrants, and the holders of all outstanding convertible securities as of that
date converted them into Common Stock, the Company would be required to issue
approximately 27.1 million additional shares of Common Stock, based on current
exercise and conversion prices.

NOTE V -- CONSULTING EXPENSES

     The Company recorded consulting expenses totaling $4.1 million and $6.6
million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Included in the charges for 2000 are
approximately $1.6 million of non-cash charges reflecting the estimated fair
value of warrants and options granted to purchase 2,512,000 shares of Common
Stock at a range of between $1.00 to $4.00 per share with terms of between two
and five years. Included in the charges for 1999 are approximately $3.3 million
of non-cash charges reflecting the estimated fair value of five-year warrants
granted to purchase 860,000 shares of Common Stock at a range of between $1.00
to $2.00 per share. The fair value of such warrants was estimated using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. Additionally, approximately $1.1 million and
$2.7 million of the consulting costs incurred in 2000 and 1999, respectively,
reflects the fair value of 535,000 shares and 870,000 shares of the Company's
Common Stock issued for professional services rendered in 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

the Company redeemed an aggregate of 22,992 Series C Shares and New Series C
Shares for an aggregate redemption price of $2,299,200 plus accrued and unpaid
dividends of $122,300. The holders converted all of the remaining Series C
Shares and New Series C Shares into 3,946,250 shares of Common Stock (at an
effective conversion ratio of $1.00 per share). In consideration of the
agreement of the holders to convert the Series C Shares and New Series C Shares
(which would otherwise have been mandatorily redeemable by the Company in full
on February 15, 2001), the Company agreed to issue to the holders, pro rata in
accordance with the number of shares converted by each of them, an aggregate of
666,400 additional shares of Common Stock. The Company will record a $900,000
non-cash dividend in the first quarter of 2001 reflecting the fair value of the
666,300 additional shares issued. The Company agreed to pay one of the holders
of the Series C Preferred a fee of $100,000 in connection with its services
relating to the negotiation of these agreements.

     The redemption of the Series C Shares and New Series C Shares was funded in
part through the issuance and sale through February 2001 in private placements
of an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of $1.00 per
share.

and subsequently changed our name to Cross Media Marketing Corporation in
December 2000. Our principal business strategy is to integrate well established
direct marketing skills with a variety of new technologies, including e-mail
marketing, web-based systems and interactive voice response, ultimately
resulting in a multi-faceted marketing platform for the sale of products and
services.

     In November 1999, we formed Media Outsourcing, Inc. ("MOS"), a wholly-owned
subsidiary, to acquire the assets of Direct Sales International, LP. We
completed this acquisition in January 2000 (see Note C).

NOTE B -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Basis of Presentation: The accompanying unaudited financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America for interim financial information and the instructions
to Form 10-QSB and do not include all the information and footnotes required by
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for
complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
consisting of normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for a fair
presentation of the results for the interim period have been included. Operating
results for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2001 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended
December 31, 2001. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements
and the information included under the heading "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes for the
year ended December 31, 2000 as filed with our Form 10-KSB/A.

     Revenues: Revenues derived from originating magazine subscriptions are
recognized by us when we receive the first installment payment for subscriptions
purchased. The customer can cancel the subscription within ten days of the
order. Amounts collected from customers prior to the expiration of the
cancellation period are recorded as deferred revenues. Magazine subscription
revenues are recorded net of cancellation, collection reserves, and payments
made to publishers for fulfillment costs. Such cancellation and collection
reserves are based upon our historical cancellation and collection experience.

     Revenues also include commissions earned from publishers in connection with
originating paid subscriptions for certain publications. Commissions are also
earned from outside parties for securing memberships in a discount-buying club
and sales of long-distance telephone services. Commission income is recognized
when the related subscriptions or memberships are obtained. In the year ended
December 31, 2000, two independent call centers accounted for approximately 35%
of our magazine subscription revenues. These call centers could terminate their
relationships with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business.

     Commission Expense: Commission expense is recognized by us when we receive
the first installment payment for subscriptions purchased. Amounts paid to
brokers prior to the expiration of the cancellation period are recorded as
deferred expenses.

     Reclassification: Certain amounts in the 2000 financial statements have
been reclassified to conform to the 2001 classifications, and certain other
amounts have been combined and reclassified.

      NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     Use of estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements: The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

NOTE C -- ACQUISITION OF DIRECT SALES INTERNATIONAL, LP ("DSI ACQUISITION")

     On January 28, 2000, through our wholly-owned subsidiary MOS, we acquired
substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Direct Sales
International, LP ("DSI"), a Georgia limited partnership, for approximately
$27.6 million, including closing costs of approximately $1.1 million and an
agreement to provide approximately $1.5 million of funding to AmeriNet, Inc.
("AmeriNet"). The transaction was accounted for as a purchase business
combination. We also granted to Richard Prochnow, the seller of DSI
("Prochnow"), and to RLP Holdings, L.P. the right, which has an intrinsic value
of $1.2 million, to sell up to 600,000 shares of our Common Stock back to us at
a fixed price.

     On May 10, 2001, we entered into an agreement with Prochnow and RLP
Holdings, L.P. pursuant to which Mr. Prochnow exercised the right we granted to
him on January 28, 2000 to sell 600,000 shares of common stock to us for $3.00
per share. We paid the $1.8 million purchase price to Mr. Prochnow by reducing
the outstanding principal balance on a note issued by Mr. Prochnow to us from
$2.5 million to $0.7 million. This note was originally secured by a pledge of
1.9 million shares of common stock. We also agreed with Mr. Prochnow to release
1.4 million shares from the pledge, leaving 532,000 shares to secure remaining
principal amount of the note.

     The acquisition was financed by borrowing $16 million ($15.8 million of
proceeds, net of fees) under a revolving credit facility entered into
contemporaneous with consummating the acquisition and the remainder was funded
with proceeds received from sales of common stock and common stock purchase
warrants, Series A, B and C convertible preferred stock and certain acquisition
bridge loans that the company repaid during the year ended December 31, 2000.

     The following table provides an analysis of the purchase price of the DSI
acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the book value of the net
assets acquired, which has been allocated to goodwill, is as follows:

Cash consideration paid to the seller.......................  $25,000,000

     Goodwill is currently being amortized on a straight-line basis over a
ten-year period. Subsequent to June 30, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board approved Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business
Combinations" and No. 142 "Goodwill and other Intangible Assets". We will
evaluate goodwill amortization under these standards. See Note J for an
explanation of the effect on our financial statements going forward.

NOTE D -- REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

     On January 28, 2000, we and MOS entered into a three-year revolving credit
facility (as amended, the "Coast Facility") with Coast Business Credit ("Coast")
providing for borrowings of up to $20.0 million subject to certain availability
limitations stipulated in the agreement. All borrowings under this facility are
repayable with interest at the prime rate plus 2% per annum but not less than
9%. Cross Media Marketing and MOS are also required to maintain certain minimum
earnings ratios and levels of net worth as defined in the agreement and MOS was
restricted from making distributions to Cross Media Marketing in excess of $1.8
million annually plus any amounts necessary for tax obligations attributable to
MOS's operations. All of MOS's assets are pledged as collateral for this
obligation. As of June 30, 2001 MOS had an outstanding balance on the Coast
Facility of approximately $14.6 million compared to total availability of $18.0
million resulting in $3.4 million of funds available to MOS at June 30, 2001.

     In connection with the execution and delivery of the Coast Facility, the
Company initially granted Coast 300,000 five-year common stock purchase warrants
at an exercise price of $3.53 per share (110% of the closing price of the common
stock on the closing date). As a result of the anti-dilution provisions, the
exercise price has been reduced to $2.19 per share and the number of shares has
been increased to 484,669 as of June 30, 2001. Accordingly, we recorded a
non-cash interest charge of approximately $14,647 and $20,491, respectively,
during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2001. Our non-cash
interest charge in connection with the anti-dilution adjustments was
approximately $280,000 as of June 30, 2001.

     MOS incurred fees and expenses in connection with this facility of
approximately $1.1 million, which are being amortized over three years.

     In May 2001, we agreed with Coast to amend the Coast Facility as follows:
(i) Coast waived the requirement that we maintain a minimum Tangible Net Worth
through March 31, 2001; (ii) Coast waived any violation of the limitation on
distributions by MOS to Cross Media Marketing with respect to a $1.0 million
distribution in February 2001; (iii) we agreed to maintain a minimum Senior Debt
to EBITDA ratio of no greater than 1.5 to 1.0; and (iv) we agreed to maintain
other covenants. Management expects to be fully in compliance with the
provisions of this agreement going forward.

NOTE E -- CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

     Series A Convertible Preferred Stock ("New Series A Shares")

     On June 9, 2000, we issued 30,375 shares of New Series A Shares and a
five-year warrant to purchase 225,000 shares of Common Stock at an initial
exercise price of $1.4850 (subject to certain anti-

                                       F-31

               CROSS MEDIA MARKETING CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

      NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

dilution and similar adjustments). The aggregate purchase price for the New
Series A Shares and the warrant was $2.25 million. We also granted the purchaser
of the New Series A Shares an option, exercisable in the purchaser's sole
discretion during the sixty day period following June 9, 2000, to purchase up to
an additional $2,025,000 face amount of New Series A Shares and a warrant to
purchase an additional 150,000 shares of Common Stock for the same purchase
price. The purchaser exercised its option, and we issued and sold to the
purchaser an additional 20,250 New Series A Shares and the additional warrant on
August 1, 2000 for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 million. The face amount
and liquidation value of the New Series A Shares is $5,062,500.

     Dividends accrue on the New Series A Shares at an annual rate of 10% of the
face amount, payable semi-annually in cash and/or Common Stock at our option
under certain conditions. We have reserved 407,320 shares of common stock in
payment of dividends accrued on the New Series A Shares as of June 30, 2001.
Such shares are issuable to the holder of the Series A Shares at any time, upon
request. The New Series A Shares are redeemable, at our option under certain
conditions, at a redemption price of 100% of face value plus any accrued and
unpaid dividends.

     The New Series A Shares are convertible at a conversion price equal to the
lesser of: (i) $1.93 (110% of the closing bid price of the Common Stock on the
date of the issuance, subject to adjustments); or (ii) 91% of the average of the
three lowest, non-consecutive closing bid prices for the Common Stock in the ten
trading days preceding the date of the holder's conversion notice to us (the
"Conversion Notice"). The conversion price and the exercise price of the
warrants are subject to downward adjustment to equal the lowest price at which
shares of the Common Stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or
exercisable for, shares of Common Stock are issued while the New Series A Shares
and warrants remain outstanding (if such price is lower than the then effective
conversion or exercise price), subject to certain exceptions. These exceptions
include: (i) the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion or exercise
of presently outstanding options, warrants or convertible securities in
accordance with the terms of such options, warrants or convertible securities as
in effect upon the initial issuance date of the New Series A Shares (but subject
to certain anti-dilution adjustments).

     By letter agreement dated December 28, 2000, the holder of all the
outstanding New Series A Shares agreed not to convert the New Series A Shares
prior to June 9, 2001 if, on the date of such proposed conversion, the
then-current market price of our Common Stock is less than $1.50 per share (the
"Conversion Floor"). On and after June 9, 2001 there will be no Conversion
Floor. The holders agreed that they would not redeem the New Series A Shares
prior to June 9, 2001. The conversion provisions of the New Series A Shares and
warrants create a substantial risk of dilution to the holders of our Common
Stock.

     On July 18, 2001, we entered into agreements with the holder of all 50,625
of the outstanding shares of our New Series Shares. See Note K for further
description of this agreement.

NOTE F -- MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK

     Series C Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series C
Preferred")

     On January 28, 2000, in a private placement, we issued 52,892 Series C
Preferred shares resulting in proceeds to us totaling approximately $5.0
million. The Series C Preferred was initially convertible into shares of Common
Stock at a conversion ratio of $2.00 per share and was entitled to a 10%
cumulative dividend. In connection with the initial issuance and sale of the
Series C Preferred in January 2000 (the "Series C Shares"), we also issued
1,763,067 shares of Common Stock to the holders of the Series C Shares and
reduced the exercise price of the 2,000,000 Common Stock purchase warrants
previously issued to a holder of Series C Shares and an affiliate of such holder
from $3.50 per share to $1.00 per share.

               CROSS MEDIA MARKETING CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

      NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     The Series C Shares were originally mandatorily redeemable on the earlier
of July 26, 2000 or upon the consummation of a financing transaction resulting
in gross proceeds of at least $10.0 million. On April 24, 2000, the holders of
the Series C Shares agreed to extend the mandatory redemption date of the Series
C Shares from July 26, 2000 to December 26, 2000 (the "Mandatory Redemption
Date") in exchange for 2,247,067 shares of our Common Stock and a reduction in
the effective conversion ratio from $2.00 per share to $1.00 per share. The
value of the shares of Common Stock issued and change in the effective
conversion ratio was reflected during the second quarter of 2000 as an
additional deemed dividend in the amount of $8,560,417.

     On June 14, 2000, we issued an additional 7,500 shares of Series C
Preferred (the "New Series C Shares") and 250,000 shares of Common Stock,
resulting in proceeds of $750,000. We also agreed to reduce the exercise price
of 2,000,000 Common Stock purchase warrants held by the purchaser of the New
Series C Shares and an affiliate of such purchaser from $1.00 to $0.50 per
share. We also paid a fee in connection with the issuance of the New Series C
Shares of 562.5 shares of Series C Preferred, five-year warrants to purchase
100,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of $1.88 per share and 18,750 shares
of Common Stock.

     On July 18, 2000, the holders of the Series C Shares and the New Series C
Shares agreed to waive the requirement that our failure to redeem the Series C
Preferred on or before the Mandatory Redemption Date would trigger a reduction
in the conversion ratio of the Series C Preferred from $1.00 to $0.25 per share.
In consideration for this waiver, we agreed to issue to such holders an
aggregate of 1,523,750 shares of Common Stock, pro rata in accordance with their
percentage holdings of the Series C Shares and New Series C Shares, and to issue
as a fee in connection with such waiver, an additional 1,500 shares of Series C
Preferred and 50,000 shares of Common Stock. The value of the shares was
reflected during the third quarter of 2000 as an additional deemed dividend in
the amount of $3,026,028.

     On December 19, 2000, the holders of the Series C Shares and the New Series
C Shares agreed to extend the Mandatory Redemption Date of the Series C
Preferred from December 26, 2000 to January 26, 2001. On January 25, 2001, the
holders agreed to further extend the redemption date from January 26, 2001 to
February 15, 2001. On February 15, 2001, we redeemed an aggregate of 22,992
Series C Shares and New Series C Shares for an aggregate redemption price of
$2,299,200 plus accrued and unpaid dividends of $122,300. The holders converted
all of the remaining Series C Shares and New Series C Shares into 3,946,250
shares of Common Stock (at an effective conversion ratio of $1.00 per share). In
consideration of the agreement of the holders to convert the Series C Shares and
New Series C Shares (which would otherwise have been mandatorily redeemable by
us in full on February 15, 2001), we agreed to issue to the holders, pro rata in
accordance with the number of shares converted by each of them, an aggregate of
666,400 additional shares of Common Stock. The value of the shares of Common
Stock issued was reflected in the first quarter of 2001 as an additional deemed
dividend in the amount of $899,640. We agreed to pay a fee of $100,000 to one of
the Series C holders in connection with their services relating to the
negotiation of these agreements. There is a note payable of $199,200 related to
the redemption of the preferred stock.

     The redemption of the Series C Shares and the New Series C Shares was
funded in part through the issuance and sale by us, in private placements, of an
aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of $1.00 per share.

NOTE G -- NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE

     Net income (loss) per share is presented under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 128 ("SFAS No. 128"), "Earnings Per Share." In
accordance with SFAS No. 128, basic and diluted net loss per share has been
computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period.

NOTE H -- INCOME TAXES

     We have Federal and State net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$7.0 million available to offset future taxable income, if any, through December
2020. The utilization of the net operating losses is subject to a substantial
limitation due to the "change of ownership" provisions under Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code and similar State provisions. Such limitation may result
in the expiration of the net operating losses before their utilization. A
valuation allowance has been established to reserve for the deferred tax assets
arising from the net operating losses and other temporary differences since
there is no assurance that their benefit will be realized in the future. For the
three months and six months ended June 30, 2001 we recorded a $0.5 million and
$0.7 million tax provision based on an estimate of our effective income tax rate
projected for the year ending December 31, 2001.

NOTE I -- COMMON STOCK

     At June 30, 2001, we were authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of Common
Stock, $.001 par value and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.001 par
value. As of June 30, 2001 there were 36,726,007 shares of Common Stock and
50,625 New Series A Shares issued and outstanding. If the holders of all
outstanding options and Common Stock purchase warrants and the holders of the
New Series A Shares converted them into Common Stock as of June 30, 2001, we
would be required to issue approximately 22,778,671 additional shares of Common
Stock.

     During the six months ended June 30, 2001, we received proceeds of
$2,438,000 from the sale of 2,437,552 shares of our common stock.

NOTE J -- EFFECT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board approved the
issuance of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business
Combinations" and No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". The new
standards require that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001
must be accounted for under the purchase method. In addition, all intangible
assets acquired that are obtained through contractual or legal right, or are
capable of being separately sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged
shall be recognized as an asset apart from goodwill. Goodwill and intangibles
with indefinite lives will no longer be subject to amortization, but will be
subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value
based test.

     We will continue to amortize goodwill existing at June 30, 2001 under its
current method until December 31, 2001. Thereafter, annual and quarterly
goodwill amortization of approximately $1.0 million and $0.3 million,
respectively, will no longer be recognized. The Company will perform a
transitional fair value based impairment test at March 31, 2002 and if the fair
value is less than the recorded value at January 1, 2002, we will record an
impairment loss in the March 31, 2002 quarter as a cumulative effect of a change
in accounting principle.

NOTE K -- SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     On July 19, 2001, we executed a definitive agreement to acquire
LifeMinders, Inc., an online direct marketer. The merger, is subject to the
approval of both companies' stockholders. We will pay a total combined cash and
stock consideration of $68.1 million for all outstanding equity interests in
LifeMinders, including stock options, subject to a reduction of $1.75 million if
and to the extent that LifeMinders' net cash and cash equivalents are less than
$50 million at August 31, 2001.

     On July 18, 2001, we entered into agreements with the holder of all 50,625
outstanding shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. These agreements
provide that the following will occur simultaneously with, and conditional upon,
the consummation of the LifeMinders acquisition: (i) we will

redeem 25,312.5 Series A Shares for a cash payment of $2,531,250 or $100 per
share, provided that the holder may elect to convert these shares into shares of
our common stock at a conversion price of $1.48 per share prior to the closing
of the LifeMinders' acquisition, in which event the holder would receive
1,710,304 shares of common stock and would convert the remaining 25,312.2 Series
A Shares at a conversion price of $1.48 per share, or 1,710,304 shares of common
stock; (ii) in consideration of the agreement to convert at least half of the
Series A Shares, we will make a payment to the holder in the amount of $968,750
in either (a) cash, (b) cash and common stock, or (c) wholly in common stock;
and (iii) we will issue warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of our common stock
with an exercise price of $1.9845, which will replace the 375,000 warrants
issued in connection with the Series A Shares and which will have the same
anti-dilution provisions. If the definitive merger agreement with LifeMinders is
terminated or if the acquisition of LifeMinders is not completed by June 18,
2002, the holder may elect to exchange the Series A Shares for a new series of
convertible preferred stock with a conversion price of $1.48 per share, subject
to certain provisions, or to exchange the Series A Shares for a new series of
convertible preferred stock with the same terms and provisions as the existing
Series A Shares, except for revisions.

     On August 20, 2001, we entered into an amended and restated merger
agreement with LifeMinders. Under the amended and restated merger agreement, the
merger consideration will be comprised of up to $24 million in cash and
approximately 22.3 million shares of our common stock (based on certain
assumptions and subject to certain adjustments). If LifeMinders stockholders do
not elect to receive the maximum cash consideration, then the number of shares
of our common stock that we will issue in the merger will increase by an amount
equal to $24 million less the amount of the total cash consideration paid in the
merger divided by $1.9845. The value of the merger consideration will depend on
the market price of our common stock on the date on which the merger is
completed.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of LifeMinders, Inc.:

     In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of operations, of changes in stockholders'
equity (deficit) and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of LifeMinders, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

1. NATURE OF BUSINESS

     LifeMinders, Inc. (the Company) is an online direct marketing company that
provides personalized content and advertisements via email to a community of
members. Email messages contain reminders and tips that are designed to enable
the Company's members to better organize and manage their lives. Proprietary
member information and targeting capabilities provide advertising partners the
opportunity to more effectively reach their target audiences.

     The Company's outsourcing business unit was launched late in the second
quarter of 2000. The outsourcing product enables other companies to deliver
targeted marketing messages to their own customers via email, thereby enhancing
communication with their customers, driving increased revenue opportunities and
heightening loyalty for their brands.

     The Company was incorporated in Maryland on August 9, 1996 (Date of
Inception) under the name of MinderSoft, Inc. In January 1999, the Company
changed its name to LifeMinders.com, Inc. and reincorporated in Delaware in July
1999. In June 2000, the Company changed its name to LifeMinders, Inc.

     During 1998, the Company entered into arrangements with national retailers
to distribute reminder products in software form on disk. In late 1998, the
Company revised its strategy to become an online direct marketing company that
provides personalized content and advertisements via email to a loyal community
of members. Given this significant shift in strategy in late 1998, the
historical financial condition and results of operations prior to 1999 do not
necessarily reflect the Company's business as it is currently being conducted.

     On October 21, 1999, the Board of Directors approved a 5 for 4 common stock
split in connection with the filing of an initial public offering. The
conversion ratio of the mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock was
adjusted from a 1 for 1 conversion ratio to a 5 for 4 conversion ratio in
connection with the stock split. The consolidated financial statements of the
Company, including all share and per share data, have been retroactively
restated to reflect the 5 for 4 common stock split for all periods presented.

     On November 19, 1999, the Company completed its initial public offering
issuing 4,830,000 shares of common stock at an initial public offering price of
$14.00 and raised net proceeds of $61,715,000. On February 8, 2000, the Company
completed its follow-on public offering of 2,767,500 shares of common stock at a
price of $33.00 per share and raised net proceeds of $85,899,000.

     In December 2000, in a continued effort to reduce costs and reach
profitability, the Company made the decision not to pursue and develop its
wireless operations. In conjunction with this decision, the Company recorded an
impairment charge of $49,020,000 in the fourth quarter of 2000, of which
$5,969,000 is included as a component of cost of sales. Also in the fourth
quarter of 2000, the Company decided not to pursue and develop the operations of
its consolidated subsidiary PleaseRSVP, resulting in an impairment charge of
$2,653,000. Additionally, an evaluation of the Company's carrying value in its
investments in non-marketable equity securities in the fourth quarter of 2000
indicated that a permanent loss in value of the investments existed. As a
result, the Company recorded a charge of $2,313,000 for a permanent decline in
value of certain non-marketable equity securities.

     The Company believes that existing cash, cash equivalents and available
credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for working
capital, member acquisition expenses, investment or acquisition related
expenditures and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     The significant accounting policies followed by the Company in the
preparation of these consolidated financial statements are as follows:

  Basis of Presentation

     The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Investments in which the Company
exercises significant influence, but does not exercise unilateral operating and
financial control are accounted for using the equity method. If the Company does
not have the ability to exercise significant influence over an investee, the
investment is accounted for using the cost method. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

  Use of Estimates

     The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reported period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Highly liquid investments having original maturities of 90 days or less at
the date of acquisition are classified as cash equivalents. The carrying value
of cash equivalents approximate their fair value.

  Marketable Securities

     Marketable securities include investments in commercial paper and U.S.
government securities for which the original maturity dates exceed three months.
All marketable securities mature within one year from the balance sheet date.
Marketable securities are classified as held-to-maturity and are accounted for
at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. No marketable securities were
sold prior to maturity.

  Accounts Receivable, Net

     The Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a
periodic review of aged customer balances as well as general economic conditions
impacting the Company's customers.

  Property and Equipment

     Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
generally three to five years. When property and equipment are retired or
otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed
from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in operations.

  Internal-use Software and Website Development Costs

     Internal use software and web site development costs are capitalized in
accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) No. 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs
of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use," and Emerging
Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-02, "Accounting for Web Site Development
Costs." Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage,
which consist primarily of outside services and consultants, are capitalized and
amortized over the estimated useful life

                                       F-44

                               LIFEMINDERS, INC.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

of the asset. All other costs are expensed as incurred. For the year ended
December 31, 2000, costs qualifying for capitalization total $1,465,000 net of
amortization of $235,000. No costs qualified for capitalization in 1999 and
1998. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, generally three years.

  Intangible Assets

     The cost of business acquisitions accounted for using the purchase method
is allocated first to identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated
fair values. The excess of cost over identifiable assets and liabilities is
recorded as goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets related to the acquisition
of assembled workforces are amortized on a straight-line basis over one year,
the approximate length of employment contracts. Goodwill, technology, patents
and other identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis
over three years. The carrying amounts of intangible assets and goodwill are
reviewed if facts or changes in circumstances suggest that they may be impaired.
If this review indicates that the carrying amounts of intangible assets and
goodwill will not be recoverable, as determined based on estimated undiscounted
future cash flows of the acquired assets, the carrying amounts of the intangible
assets and goodwill are reduced accordingly based on the difference between the
carrying value and fair market value. Fair market value is determined using
discounted cash flows or other methods. During 2000, the Company recorded an
impairment of certain intangible assets (see Note 3).

  Revenue Recognition

     The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, terms are fixed or determinable, services are performed or products are
delivered, and collection is probable. During 1998, the Company's revenue was
generated from distribution agreements for software-based products. Revenue from
these agreements was recognized as the services were performed.

     During 2000 and 1999, revenue was generated primarily by delivery of
advertisements within emails to the Company's members and delivery of names to
its opt-in partners.

     During 2000, the Company adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 with no
material impact.

  Advertising

     Advertising arrangements consist primarily of advertisements that are
displayed within the Company's emails. Generally, advertisers pay the Company
and the Company recognizes revenue on a per email basis, based on the number of
emails delivered to the Company's members in which the advertisements are
displayed. From time to time, the Company may guarantee a minimum number of
emails to be delivered containing an advertisement directed at a specific member
group. Under these contracts, the Company is not required to forfeit fees
received for emails previously delivered and the Company has historically
fulfilled the guaranteed minimum number of emails; therefore, revenue is
recognized as emails are delivered. The Company may also guarantee a minimum
number of sales orders for the advertiser based on the emails delivered. Under
these contracts the Company defers all revenue until notification is received
from the advertiser that the minimum number of sales orders have been achieved
by the advertiser. In addition, the Company may provide advertisers the
opportunity for the exclusive right to sponsor advertisements within a specific
email category for a specified period of time for a fixed fee. Under these
contracts the Company recognizes revenue ratably during the period the
advertisement is displayed in the Company's emails since there is no obligation
to provide a minimum number of emails for that individual advertiser during the
specific period. The Company's advertising contracts generally have average
terms ranging from one to six months.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     Periodically, the Company enters into barter/reciprocal transactions, where
it exchanges advertising space within its emails for reciprocal advertising
space or traffic on other Web sites. Revenue from barter transactions is
recognized in accordance with APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions (APB No. 29), and EITF Issue No. 99-17, Accounting for Advertising
Barter Transactions, during the period in which the advertisements are displayed
in the Company's emails. In the absence of sufficient evidence of fair value,
the acquired assets are recorded at the book value of the surrendered assets. No
gain or loss is recorded from barter transactions as the revenue recognized
equals the advertising costs incurred. For the years ended December 31, 1999 and
1998, the Company did not enter into any barter arrangements. For the year ended
December 31, 2000, the Company entered into several barter arrangements for
which no revenue or expense was recognized as sufficient evidence of fair value
was indeterminable and the Company's carrying cost of the surrendered assets was
insignificant.

  Opt-in

     Revenue is recognized as affirmative member responses to advertisers'
newsletters and other promotions offered during the Company's sign up process
are delivered to the Company's opt-in partners. The Company derives opt-in
revenue through fees that its opt-in advertising partners pay for member
registrations. The Company records revenue net of estimated duplicate member
responses to its opt-in partners' newsletters and other promotions. Duplicate
member responses are names, generally in the form of email addresses, that the
Company provides to opt-in advertising partners for which the Company's members
have previously registered either through the Company's sign up process or with
the Company's opt-in advertising partners directly. Historically, opt-in
partners have immediately notified the Company of duplicate member responses
upon receipt of member registration information, which is transmitted to opt-in
partners twice a week. The Company issues credits upon notification of duplicate
member responses and, therefore, has not experienced significant differences
between the actual and estimated amounts of duplicate member responses. Opt-in
partners pay a fixed rate per registration and, upon delivery of the
registrations, the Company has no further obligation under the agreements. The
Company does not currently anticipate any significant change in the nature of
the fees it charges its opt-in partners or in its customer base and believes its
historical experience with its opt-in product is predictive of future estimates.
For the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, revenue was recorded net of
$913,000 and $618,000, respectively, for estimated duplicate member responses to
the Company's opt-in partners' newsletters and other promotions.

     Cash received from customers in advance is recorded as deferred revenue.
Advertising and opt-in revenue is recognized as emails and affirmative member
responses, respectively, are delivered.

  Consulting Revenue

     Consulting revenue consists of revenue earned under a contract relating to
services for the development of weather related content. Under this contract,
which was completed in 2000, the Company provided consulting services for
customization and modification of our customer's current software systems.
Revenue was recognized under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting,
based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs. The
percentage-of-completion method is deemed the most appropriate method of revenue
recognition as the Company is generally entitled to payment for work performed
to date even though it may not coincide with a specific billing milestone. The
billing milestones are considered to be interim billing points for the purposes
of providing funding to the Company for its efforts and not true output measures
of the Company's progress to completion. Additionally, the ratio of costs
incurred to total estimated costs has a direct relationship to the performance
of services specified in the arrangement due to the types of costs that are
incurred. Costs incurred relating to performance of the services specified in
the arrangement consist primarily of costs for consulting services and payroll
relating to individuals performing the software modification and customization
procedures. The consultant and

                               LIFEMINDERS, INC.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

payroll costs incurred directly coincide with the input of effort into the
modification and customization process. Direct material costs on this project
were insignificant. Project-related overhead costs included within the
calculation of the percentage complete are consistent with industry practice and
there are no significant up-front costs charged to the contract. Cash received
in advance of services to be provided was recorded as deferred revenue and
recognized upon the completion of the related services.

  Concentration of Credit Risk

     Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration
of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and
accounts receivable.

     The Company's cash and cash equivalents are maintained at five U.S.
financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of
insurance provided on such deposits. The majority of the Company's cash
equivalents are invested in short-term commercial paper.

     Approximately 88% of the revenue for the year ended December 31, 1998 were
concentrated with one customer. No one customer exceeded 10% of the Company's
revenue or accounts receivable at December 31, 2000 and 1999 and for the years
then ended.

  Advertising Costs

     Advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expense as the
contractual terms of the advertising contracts are fulfilled. Cash paid in
advance of advertising services received is recorded as prepaid expenses that
are amortized as services are received. Advertising costs for the years ended
December 31, 1998 were insignificant. Advertising costs for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999 were $49,491,000 and $33,906,000, respectively. At
December 31, 2000 and 1999, $1,917,000 and $6,312,000, respectively, of prepaid
advertising expense is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets.

  Research and Development Costs

     Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include
expenses for the development of new or improved technologies designed to enhance
the performance of our service, including the salaries, stock-based compensation
and related expenses for our engineering department, as well as costs for
contracted services and co-location facilities and depreciation on equipment.

  Income Taxes

     The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method,
which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company provides a
valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not
that such assets will not be realized.

  Stock-Based Compensation

     The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and related Interpretations, in
accounting for its employee and non-employee directors stock options and
complies with the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."
Accordingly, the Company measures compensation expense for its employee
stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method and provides pro-forma
disclosures of net loss as if the fair value method had been applied in
measuring compensation expense. Under the intrinsic value method of accounting
for stock-based
                                       F-47

                               LIFEMINDERS, INC.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

compensation, when the exercise price of options granted to employees is less
than the estimated fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant,
deferred compensation is recognized and is amortized to compensation expense
over the applicable vesting period.

     The Company measures compensation expense for its non-employee stock-based
compensation awards in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and EITF 96-18, "Accounting
for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or
in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services." The fair value of the options
and warrants issued is used to measure the transaction when it is more reliable
than the fair value of the services received. The fair value is measured on the
date that the commitment for performance by the counterparty has been reached or
the counterparty's performance is complete. The fair value of the equity
instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and additional paid-in
capital. No options or warrants have been issued to non-employees during the
years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998.

     The Company follows FASB Interpretation No. 44 (FIN 44), "Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation -- an Interpretation of APB
Opinion No. 25," to account for exchanges of stock options and awards in
purchase business combinations. Accordingly, the fair value of vested stock
options and awards issued in exchange for vested stock options and awards of the
acquiree is included as part of the purchase price. The fair value of unvested
options or awards issued in exchange for unvested options and awards of the
acquiree are accounted for as part of the purchase price, and an amount equal to
the portion of the intrinsic value of the unvested options or award related to
future vesting is allocated to deferred compensation and recognized over the
remaining vesting period.

  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

     The Company evaluates the carrying amounts of long-lived assets when facts
or changes in circumstances suggest that they may be impaired. If this review
indicates that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets will not be
recoverable, as determined based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows of
the acquired assets, the Company will measure the amount of such impairment
based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate
commensurate with the risks involved or other methods. During 2000, the Company
recorded an impairment of certain long-lived assets (see Note 3).

  Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Common Share

     Basic net loss per common share is based on the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during each year. Diluted net loss per common
share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during each year, adjusted for the effect of common stock
equivalents arising from the assumed exercise of stock options, if dilutive.
Common stock equivalents have been excluded from the net loss per share
calculation because their effect would be anti-dilutive.

  Certain Risks and Uncertainties

     The Company is subject to all the risks inherent in an early stage business
in the technology industry. The risks include, but are not limited to, limited
operating history, successful integration of acquired businesses, dependence on
the Internet and related security risks and the changing nature of the Internet
industry.

  Segment Reporting

     The Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 replaces the "industry segment"
approach with the "management" approach to reporting financial information about
an enterprise's segments. The management approach designates

                               LIFEMINDERS, INC.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

the internal organization that is used by management for allocating resources
and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.
SFAS No. 131 also requires disclosures about products and services, geographic
areas, and major customers.

  Comprehensive Income

     During the years presented, the Company has not had any significant
transactions that are required to be reported in comprehensive income.

  Reclassifications

     Certain reclassifications have been made to conform prior years' financial
statements to the current presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on
reported earnings.

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements

     In June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 137,
which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," which will be effective for the Company's
fiscal year 2001. This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards
requiring that every derivative instrument, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts, be recorded in the balance sheet as
either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. The statement also
requires that changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized in earnings
unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. In June 2000, FASB issued
SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities -- An Amendment of FAS 133," further amending SFAS No. 133. The
Company has not entered into derivative contracts and does not have plans to
enter into such contracts, accordingly the adoption of SFAS Nos. 133, 137 and
138 is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial
statements.

3. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

  Wireless Segment

     As part of the development of the Company's wireless business strategy, the
Company acquired WITI and smartRay in the first and third quarters of 2000,
respectively. In December 2000, in a continued effort to reduce costs and reach
profitability, the Company made the decision not to pursue and develop its
wireless operations. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company
determined the future undiscounted cash flows of these assets exceeded the
carrying value as of December 31, 2000, and recorded an impairment charge of
approximately $49,020,000 based on the discounted cash flows to be generated
from these assets. Of this impairment charge, approximately $5,969,000 has been
included as a component of cost of sales.

     In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company evaluated the wireless segment's
historical operating performance and expected results of operations. Due to
changes in market conditions and a change in the Company's assessment of the
wireless segment's ability to generate revenues and profits, the decision was
made not to pursue and develop the Company's wireless operations and renew the
Companies' focus on its core advertising business. The estimated fair values of
wireless segment assets were determined based on a discounted cash flow
analysis.

  PleaseRSVP Acquisition

     In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company decided not to pursue and
develop the operations of its consolidated subsidiary PleaseRSVP, resulting in
an impairment charge of $2,653,000 primarily related to the write-off of
goodwill associated with a business acquisition completed in the first quarter
of 2000. The Company's decision not to pursue and develop this investment was
based on the evaluation of PleaseRSVP's historical operating performance and
expected future operating results. The fair value of the impaired assets was
determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Prior to abandonment,
PleaseRSVP revenues and expenses were reported as part of the advertising
segment.

  Non-marketable Equity Securities

     The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments in
non-marketable equity securities to determine if a loss in value of the
investments, which would be considered a permanent decline, should be
recognized. During the fourth quarter of 2000, based on the Company's evaluation
of the operating losses of its investees, changes in market conditions and other
relevant factors, the Company recorded a charge of $2,313,000 for a permanent
decline in value of certain non-marketable equity securities.

4. MARKETABLE SECURITIES

6. BORROWINGS

  Line of Credit

     On August 19, 1999, the Company amended an existing $1,000,000 line of
credit to be increased to $1,350,000, which included $1,000,000 for working
capital expenditures, $250,000 for a business credit line, and a $100,000 letter
of credit for leased office space. The interest rate on the line was the bank's
prime rate plus 1.0% per annum (9.50% at December 31, 1999). The line of credit
was collateralized by substantially all the Company's assets, including
intangible assets and future proceeds from the sale of such assets. On November
19, 1999, the Company increased the line of credit to $4,000,000, which included
$3,650,000 for working capital expenditures, $250,000 for a business credit line
and a $100,000 letter of credit. The amended line expired on November 17, 2000
and was not renewed. No borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit as
of December 31, 2000 and 1999.

  Notes Payable

     On March 3, 1999, the Company entered into a $200,000 promissory note for
the purpose of equipment and software purchases and working capital. The Company
could draw on the note through November 10, 1999. Interest during the draw
period was due monthly beginning December 10, 1999 at an annual interest rate of
9.5%. On November 10, 1999, the outstanding principal balance of the borrowings
during the draw period was converted to a term note bearing interest at 10.5%
and payable in 24 equal monthly principal payments, which commenced on December
10, 1999. All remaining principal and accrued but unpaid interest is due upon
maturity on November 9, 2001. The promissory note is collateralized under the
same terms of the line of credit discussed earlier and includes financial and
other covenants, including a requirement to maintain a minimum monthly quick
ratio of 1.25 to 1. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, $74,000 and $155,000,
respectively, was outstanding under this agreement. Interest expense incurred on
the term note was $13,000 and $12,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000 and
1999, respectively.

     On November 19, 1999, the Company entered into a $2,000,000 promissory note
for the purpose of equipment and software purchases and general working capital.
The Company could draw from the note through August 19, 2000 (draw period).
Interest during the draw period was due monthly beginning December 19, 1999 at
an annual interest rate of the bank's prime rate plus 0.5%. On August 20, 2000,
the outstanding principal balance was rolled into a term loan bearing interest
at 10% and payable monthly in 24 equal principal payments beginning September
19, 2000. All remaining principal and accrued but unpaid interest is due on
maturity of August 19, 2002. The promissory note is collateralized by the
Company's accounts with the bank including checking, savings, or other accounts
and future accounts. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, $1,180,000 and $0,
respectively, was outstanding under the note. Interest

expense incurred on the term note was $133,000 and $0 for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     In connection with the acquisition of WITI, the Company assumed debt
incurred by WITI of approximately $573,000. Under the terms of the debt,
interest was paid on a quarterly basis at an annual rate of 9% until such time
as the principal was repaid. The Company repaid the note in full, with accrued
interest thereon, during 2000 for a total of $609,000 and subsequently retired
the debt.

7. MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
(DEFICIT)

  Common Stock

     In June 1998, the Company repurchased 62,500 shares of common stock at
$0.01 per share from the founders of the Company. These treasury shares were
re-issued as result of one non-employee exercising a stock option granted during
1997 in the Series A mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock
issuance. The total exercise price was $1.00.

     On November 19, 1999, the Company sold 4,830,000 shares of common stock at
an initial offering price of $14.00 and raised net proceeds of $61,715,000.

     On February 8, 2000, the Company completed its follow-on public offering of
2,767,500 shares of common stock at a price of $33.00 per share and raised net
proceeds of $85,899,000.

  Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock

     As of December 31, 1998, the Company had authorized two classes of
mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock: Series A and Series B. The
Company issued 1,000,000 shares of Series A mandatorily redeemable convertible
preferred stock on November 12, 1997 for $1.00 per share. In conjunction with
this preferred stock sale, the Company issued warrants to purchase 1,000,000
shares of Series B mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock at $1.00
per share with an estimated fair value of $51 determined using the American
Black-Scholes Model. On June 17, 1998, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of
Series B preferred stock at $1.00 per share for total proceeds of $1,000,000
resulting from the exercise of the Series B preferred stock warrants granted in
1997.

     On January 29, 1999, the Company issued 2,620,373 shares of Series C
convertible preferred stock at an approximate price of $1.53 per share and total
proceeds of $4,000,000.

     On May 28, 1999, the Company Amended and Restated its Articles of
Incorporation to authorize 2,252,874 shares of Series D mandatorily redeemable
convertible preferred stock and issued 2,252,874 shares of Series D convertible
preferred stock at an approximate price of $4.71 per share and total proceeds of
$10,600,000.

     On September 22, 1999, the Company amended and restated its Articles of
Incorporation to authorize 2,791,993 shares of Series E mandatorily redeemable
convertible preferred stock. On September 23, 1999, the Company issued 2,791,993
shares of Series E mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock at an
approximate price of $8.09 per share for total proceeds of approximately
$22,600,000.

     All series of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock had the
same redemption date and rights. The redemption price was equal to the original
issuance price, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends. For the years ended
December 31, 1999 and 1998, the preferred stock carrying value was accreted to
increase the carrying value for cumulative dividends and a portion of direct
issuance costs. All series of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock
had cumulative preferred dividends of $0.08 per share annually.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     On November 19, 1999, concurrent with the Company's initial public
offering, the Company converted all outstanding shares of Series A, B, C, D and
E preferred stock into its common stock. At December 31, 1998 the conversion
ratio was 1 to 1. During 1999, the conversion ratio was adjusted to 5 for 4,
giving effect to the October 21, 1999 common stock split.

  Stock Option Plans for Employees and Non-employees

     During 1998, the Company adopted the 1998 Stock Option Plan (the 1998
Plan), under which incentive stock options and non-statutory stock options may
be granted to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. The 1998 Plan
is administered by a committee appointed by the Board of Directors. The options
are not transferable and are subject to various restrictions outlined in the
1998 Plan. The committee determines the number of options granted to employees,
directors, or consultants, the vesting period and the exercise price. The
exercise price for stock options granted shall not be less than the fair value
per share of common stock on the date of such grant for incentive stock options
and not less than 85% of the fair value per share of common stock on the date of
such grant for non-statutory stock options.

     The Board of Directors had originally reserved 776,250 shares of common
stock to grant options under the 1998 Plan. Options granted under the 1998 Plan
vest over a four-year period and expire ten years after the grant date. In the
January 29, 1999 and May 28, 1999 Amendments to the Articles of Incorporation,
the number of common stock shares reserved under the 1998 Plan was increased to
1,420,070 and 2,045,070 shares, respectively. The reserved shares were further
increased by 875,000 shares effective September 22, 1999 resulting in a total of
2,920,070 shares of common stock available and reserved for issuance under the
1998 Plan.

     On May 4, 2000, the Company adopted the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2000
Plan), under which incentive stock options and non-statutory stock options may
be granted to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. The 2000 Plan
is administered by a committee appointed by the Board of Directors. The options
are not transferable and are subject to various restrictions outlined in the
2000 Plan. The committee determines the number of options granted to employees,
directors, or consultants, the vesting period and the exercise price. The
exercise price for stock options granted shall not be less than the fair value
per share of common stock on the date of such grant for incentive stock options
and not less than 85% of the fair value per share of common stock on the date of
such grant for non-statutory stock options. The 4,600,000 shares of common stock
initially authorized for issuance under the 2000 Plan consist of 1) the number
of shares available for issuance under the preceding 1998 Plan, including the
shares subject to outstanding options, and 2) an additional increase of
1,700,000 shares. The number of shares of common stock available under the 2000
Plan shall automatically increase on the 1st day of January each calendar year
during the term of the 2000 Plan, beginning with calendar year 2001, by an
amount equal to 4% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on
the last trading day in December of the immediately preceding calendar year, but
in no event shall such annual increase exceed 1,500,000 shares.

     During July 2000, the Company adopted the Supplemental Stock Incentive Plan
(the Supplemental Plan), under which incentive stock options and non-statutory
options may be granted to employees. The Supplemental Plan is administered by a
committee appointed by the Board of Directors. The options are not transferable
and are subject to various restrictions outlined in the Supplemental Plan. The
committee determines the number of options granted to employees, the vesting
period and the exercise price. The exercise price for stock options granted
shall not be less than the fair value per share of common stock on the date of
such grant for incentive stock options and not less than 85% of the fair value
per share of common stock on the date of such grant for non-statutory stock
options. At December 31, 2000 the Company had reserved 750,000 common shares for
issuance under the Supplemental Plan.

  Assumed Stock Plans

     As a result of the Company's acquisition of WITI in March 2000, the Company
assumed the outstanding options under the WITI Stock Option Plan (the WITI Plan)
and recorded $2,488,000 as part of purchase price related thereto. The WITI Plan
provides for grants of either incentive or non-statutory stock options to
eligible employees and consultants. The term of each option was not to exceed a
period of ten years from the grant date and each option generally vested over
two to five years. At December 31, 2000, the Company had reserved 20,210 common
shares for issuance under the WITI Plan. No additional grants will be made under
the WITI Plan.

     As a result of the Company's acquisition of smartRay in August 2000, the
Company assumed the outstanding options under the smartRay Stock Option and
Restricted Stock Purchase Plan (the smartRay Plan) and recorded $2,624,000 as an
addition to deferred compensation and $4,236,000 as part of purchase price
related thereto. The smartRay Plan provides for grants of either incentive or
non-statutory stock options to eligible employees, directors and consultants.
Stock purchase rights could also have been granted under the smartRay Plan.
Incentive stock options could only have been granted to employees. The term of
each option was not to exceed a period of five years from the grant date and
each option generally vests over three years. Certain option agreements
contained provisions for accelerated vesting based on performance or change in
control of smartRay. At December 31, 2000, the Company had reserved 189,373
common shares for issuance under the smartRay Plan. No additional grants will be
made under the smartRay Plan.

     As a result of the Company's acquisition of eCoupons in December 2000, the
Company assumed the outstanding options under the eCoupons Stock Option Plan
(the eCoupons Plan) and recorded $622,000 as an addition to deferred
compensation and $332,000 as part of the purchase price related thereto. The
eCoupons Plan provides for grants of either incentive or non-statutory stock
options to eligible employees and consultants. The term of each option was not
to exceed a period of 10 years from the grant date and each option generally
vested over 4 years. At December 31, 2000, the Company had reserved 110,241
common shares for issuance under the eCoupons Plan. No additional grants will be
made under the eCoupons Plan.

  Employee Stock Purchase Plan

     In May 2000, the Company adopted the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
ESPP). The ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase common shares through
payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation in any year. The price of
common shares purchased under the ESPP will be 85% of the lower of the fair
market value of the Company's commons shares on the first or last day of each
offering period. A total of 250,000 shares are available for grant under the
ESPP; 15,019 common shares were issued under the ESPP through December 31, 2000.

     Management estimated that the exercise price of stock options granted prior
to December 31, 1998 have been either equal to or in excess of the estimated
fair value of the underlying common stock and therefore no compensation expense
was recognized. During 1999 and prior to the Initial Public Offering, the
Company has estimated the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date
of grant was, in some instances, in excess of the exercise price for the options
granted during the year ended December 31, 1999. As a result, the Company
recorded deferred compensation of $5,702,000 for the year ended December 31,
1999. This amount was recorded as a reduction to stockholders' equity (deficit)
and is being amortized as a charge to operations over the vesting period of the
stock options. During 2000, the Company recorded additional deferred
compensation of $3,246,000 related to options assumed in business combinations
and reduced deferred compensation by $1,689,000 for unvested, forfeited stock
options. For the years ended December 31, 1999 and 2000, the Company recognized
$625,000 and $1,730,000 of employee stock compensation expense related to these
options.

     Pro forma information regarding net loss per share is required by SFAS No.
123 for awards granted as if the Company had accounted for its stock-based
awards to employees under the fair value method of SFAS No. 123. The fair value
of the Company's stock-based awards to employees was estimated as of the

date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes
option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
In addition, the Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective
assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's
stock-based awards to employees have characteristics significantly different
from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its stock-based awards to employees. The fair value
of the Company's stock-based awards to employees was estimated assuming no
expected dividends and the following weighted-average assumptions:

     A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management
believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not have sufficient
taxable income in the years over which the majority of temporary differences
will reverse to realize the deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company has
recorded a full valuation allowance in the accompanying financial statements as
of December 31, 2000 and 1999.

applying the statutory Federal income tax rate for the years ended December 31,

9. LEASES

     The Company has lease agreements for office space in Herndon, Virginia,
with initial terms ranging from one to ten years. Annual lease payments of
$3,714,000 escalate annually by approximately 3%. At December 31, 2000, the
Company maintained two letters of credit totaling $7,700,000 in connection with
two of the lease agreements. Both letters of credit are fully collateralized by
cash, which is recorded as Restricted Cash in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. In November 2000, the Company sublet certain office space
to an unrelated party under a four-year lease agreement. Rent expense was
$511,000 (net of sublease income of $122,000), $178,000 and $38,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

14. INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

     On March 15, 2000, the Company acquired a 12% interest in an Internet-
related astrology business for $1,489,000 in cash. The Company accounted for
this investment using the equity method since the Company could exercise
significant influence over the operations of the investee as it had an option to
purchase the remaining 88% of the investee on or before July 15, 2000. On June
29, 2000, the Company sold its investment to an unrelated third party in
exchange for a note receivable in the amount of $1,450,000 included in prepaid
expenses and other current assets on the accompanying balance sheet.

     On March 24, 2000, the Company acquired a 9% interest in an
Internet-related shopping comparison business for $2,270,000 in cash. The
Company accounts for this investment using the cost method since it cannot
exercise any influence over the operations of the investee. The cost of the
investment is reduced by cash received from the investee related to advertising
services provided by the Company. To date, the Company has received $1,647,000
in cash from the investee. The Company wrote off the remaining balance of
$623,000 during the fourth quarter of 2000 (see Note 3).

     On June 27, 2000, the Company acquired a 5% interest in an electronic
messaging company for $2,000,000 in cash. The Company accounts for this
investment using the cost method since it cannot exercise any influence over the
operations of the investee. The Company recorded an impairment charge of
$1,690,000 during the fourth quarter of 2000, reducing the investment to its
estimated fair value of $310,000 (see Note 3).

15. SEGMENT INFORMATION

     Prior to the third quarter of 2000, the Company operated in one segment:
Internet and related services. Beginning in the third quarter of 2000,
management began evaluating the Company by strategic business unit. The Company
determined that it operates within three business units: business to consumer
marketing, wireless marketing and business to business marketing. The reportable
segments derive revenue either from the sale of advertising within emails to our
members or the delivery of names to the Company's opt-in partners. The segment
operating loss is revenue less direct and allocable expenses. Segment
identifiable assets are those that are directly used in or identified to segment
operations.

     In a continued focus to reach profitability in the near term, the Company
made the decision not to pursue and develop its wireless segment. This decision
was based on changes in market conditions and a determination that the Company
could generate positive cash flows from the wireless segment in the foreseeable
future. Fourth quarter results for 2000 include an impairment charge of
$53,986,000, of which $49,020,000 is related to the write-off of long-lived
assets, including goodwill, related to the acquisition of wireless technologies
which occurred in the first and third quarters of 2000.

16. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     In the first quarter of 2001, the Company terminated 50 employees, or
approximately 24% of its total workforce as of December 31, 2000, and recorded a
one-time charge of approximately $1.1 million, which also included severance for
Stephen R. Chapin, Jr. who stepped down as Chairman and CEO of the Company. The
Company expects to pay all severance for all of these terminated employees
during 2001.

1.  NATURE OF BUSINESS

     LifeMinders is an online direct marketing company that sends personalized
email messages to a permission-based membership comprised of more than 20
million members. LifeMinders sends to its members personalized email messages,
or newsletters, in lifestyle-based interest categories, garnered from member
information obtained during the registration process as well as from behavioral
information through member interaction within its emails. LifeMinders' email
messages contain helpful reminders and tips directed toward its members'
interests and hobbies and personal events like birthdays and anniversaries.

     The Company was incorporated in Maryland on August 9, 1996 (Date of
Inception) under the name of MinderSoft, Inc. In January 1999, the Company
changed its name to LifeMinders.com, Inc. and reincorporated in Delaware in July
1999. In June 2000, the Company changed its name to LifeMinders, Inc.

     The Company believes that existing cash and cash equivalents will be
sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for working capital, investment or
acquisition related expenditures, capital expenditures and any costs associated
with the scaling back of its operations for the foreseeable future.

     In May 2001, the Company announced it was significantly scaling back its
business operations and reducing its work force while it evaluated strategic
alternatives. This decision was based on the continued decline of revenue from
online advertising historically and for the foreseeable future. In addition,
opportunities for online advertising revenue will decline since the Company is
producing and delivering a substantially lower number of emails and does not
expect to develop any new email products at this time. Since May, the Company
has maintained selected email products. During the six months ended June 30,
2001, the Company undertook a restructuring plan to reduce costs and focus its
efforts on reducing operating losses while evaluating strategic alternatives.
Accordingly, restructuring charges totaling $14,248,000 were recorded during the
period. During the six months ended June 30, 2001, the Company terminated
approximately 85% of its workforce as of December 31, 2000. In addition, the
Company negotiated separation and termination agreements with the remaining
employees. Of the total restructuring charges, approximately $3,824,000 related
to employee and contract termination benefits, $9,263,000 related to the early
termination of the Company's multi-year lease for its headquarters, and
approximately $1,161,000 related to early termination of various vendor service
agreements. Approximately $1,042,000 of this charge was recorded as prepaid
expenses and other current assets, $7,600,000 was recorded as restricted cash as
of December 31, 2000, and approximately $3,526,000 was paid in the six months
ended June 30, 2001. The Company expects to pay the remainder during 2001.

     Prior to June 30, 2001, the Company began negotiations to merge with Cross
Media Marketing Corporation (Cross Media). In late May of 2001, representatives
of Cross Media contacted the Company to discuss a possible merger. On June 21,
2001, Cross Media and the Company executed a letter of intent and term sheet for
the merger transaction, which was subsequently modified as of June 27, 2001. On
July 18, 2001, the Company and Cross Media entered into a merger agreement and,
on July 19, 2001, the Company publicly announced its intention to merge with
Cross Media. Cross Media is a direct marketing company that integrates
sophisticated marketing skills with new technologies for the sale of multi-
magazine subscription packages, discount buying club memberships and
telecommunications services. The merger agreement was amended and restated on
August 20, 2001. Under the terms of the amended and restated merger agreement,
Cross Media will pay a total of up to $24 million in cash and issue
approximately 22.3 million shares of its common stock in the merger, assuming
that no LifeMinders stock options are exercised prior to the date on which the
merger is completed and that LifeMinders stockholders elect to receive the
maximum cash consideration, and subject to adjustment under certain
circumstances, for all of LifeMinders' outstanding equity interests. Based on
the value of the revised

merger consideration, the Company determined that the carrying value of its
long-lived assets as of June 30, 2001, exceeded their fair value. The Company
calculated and recorded an impairment charge of $18,023,000, of which $2,497,000
is recorded in cost of revenue. (See Note 4.)

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  Basis of Presentation

     The interim consolidated financial statements included herein have been
prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the opinion of management,
consolidated financial statements included in this report reflect all normal
recurring adjustments that the Company considers necessary for the fair
presentation of the results of operations for the interim periods covered, and
of the financial position of the Company at the date of the interim consolidated
balance sheet. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in
the annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have
been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. However, the
Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to understand the information
presented. The operating results for interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of the operating results for the entire year. These consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's Form
10-K/A annual report for the year ended December 31, 2000.

  Use of Estimates

     The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual
results could differ from these estimates.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Highly liquid investments having original maturities of 90 days or less at
the date of acquisition are classified as cash equivalents. The carrying values
of cash equivalents approximate their fair value.

  Marketable Securities

     Marketable securities include investments in commercial paper and U.S.
government securities for which the original maturity dates exceed 90 days. All
marketable securities mature within one year from the balance sheet date.
Marketable securities are classified as held-to-maturity and are accounted for
at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. No marketable securities were
sold prior to maturity.

  Accounts Receivable, Net

     The Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a
periodic review of aged customer balances as well as general economic conditions
impacting the Company's customers.

  Property and Equipment

     Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
generally three to five years. When property and equipment are retired or
otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed
from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in operations. The
carrying amounts of long-lived assets

                                       F-68

                                  (UNAUDITED)

are reviewed if facts or changes in circumstances suggest that they may be
impaired. If this review indicates that the carrying amounts of long-lived
assets will not be recoverable, the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets
are reduced accordingly based on the difference between the carrying value and
estimated fair value. Fair value is estimated using discounted cash flows or
other methods. During the three months ended June 30, 2001, the Company recorded
an impairment of its long-lived assets (see Note 4).

  Internal-use Software and Website Development Costs

     Internal use software and web site development costs are capitalized in
accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) No. 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs
of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use", and Emerging
Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-02, "Accounting for Web Site Development
Costs". Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage,
which consist primarily of outside services and consultants, are capitalized and
amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset. All other costs are
expensed as incurred. No costs qualified for capitalization for the six months
ended June 30, 2001 and 2000. Amortization is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three years.

  Intangible Assets

     The cost of business acquisitions accounted for using the purchase method
is allocated first to identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated
fair values. The excess of cost over identifiable assets and liabilities is
recorded as goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, generally one
to four years. The carrying amounts of intangible assets and goodwill are
reviewed if facts or changes in circumstances suggest that they may be impaired.
If this review indicates the carrying amounts of intangible assets and goodwill
will not be recoverable, as determined based on estimated undiscounted future
cash flows of the acquired assets, the carrying amounts of the intangible assets
and goodwill are reduced accordingly based on the difference between the
carrying value and estimated fair value. Fair value is estimated using
discounted cash flow or other methods. During the three months ended June 30,
2001, the Company recorded an impairment of its intangible assets (see Note 4).

  Restricted Cash

     Restricted cash consisted of amounts held as collateral to secure a letter
of credit required in lieu of a deposit for a new office lease. During the
quarter, the Company terminated the multi-year lease for its headquarters prior
to its contractual termination date, which resulted in a reduction in Restricted
Cash of $7,600,000 (see Note 3) and the immediate recognition of expense related
to the lease termination.

  Revenue Recognition

     The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, terms are fixed or determinable, services are performed or products are
delivered, and collection is probable. Revenue was generated primarily by
delivery of advertisements within emails to the Company's members and delivery
of names to its opt-in partners.

  Advertising

     Advertising arrangements consist primarily of advertisements that are
displayed within the Company's emails. Generally, advertisers pay the Company
and the Company recognizes revenue on a per email basis, based on the number of
emails delivered to the Company's members in which the advertisements are
                                       F-69

                               LIFEMINDERS, INC.

displayed. From time to time, the Company may guarantee a minimum number of
emails to be delivered containing an advertisement directed at a specific member
group. Under these contracts, the Company is not required to forfeit fees
received for emails previously delivered and the Company has historically
fulfilled the guaranteed minimum number of emails; therefore, revenue is
recognized as emails are delivered. The Company may also guarantee a minimum
number of sales orders for the advertiser based on the emails delivered. Under
these contracts the Company defers all revenue until notification is received
from the advertiser that the minimum number of sales orders have been achieved
by the advertiser. In addition, the Company may provide advertisers the
opportunity for the exclusive right to sponsor advertisements within a specific
email category for a specified period of time for a fixed fee. Under these
contracts the Company recognizes revenue ratably during the period the
advertisement is displayed in the Company's emails since there is no obligation
to provide a minimum number of emails for that individual advertiser during the
specific period. The Company's advertising contracts generally have average
terms ranging from one to six months.

     Periodically, the Company enters into barter/reciprocal transactions, where
it exchanges advertising space within its emails for reciprocal advertising
space or traffic on other Web sites. Revenue from barter transactions is
recognized in accordance with APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions (APB No. 29), and EITF Issue No. 99-17, Accounting for Advertising
Barter Transactions, during the period in which the advertisements are displayed
in the Company's emails. In the absence of sufficient evidence of fair value,
the acquired assets are recorded at the book value of the surrendered assets. No
gain or loss is recorded from barter transactions as the revenue recognized
equals the advertising costs incurred. The Company did not enter into any barter
transactions during the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000.

  Opt-in

     Revenue is recognized as affirmative member responses to advertisers'
newsletters and other promotions offered during the Company's sign up process
are delivered to the Company's opt-in partners. The Company derives opt-in
revenue through fees that its opt-in advertising partners pay for member
registrations. The Company records revenue net of estimated duplicate member
responses to its opt-in partners' newsletters and other promotions. Duplicate
member responses are names, generally in the form of email addresses, that the
Company provides to opt-in advertising partners for which the Company's members
have previously registered either through the Company's sign up process or with
the Company's opt-in advertising partners directly. Historically, opt-in
partners have immediately notified the Company of duplicate member responses
upon receipt of member registration information, which is transmitted to opt-in
partners twice a week. The Company issues credits upon notification of duplicate
member responses and, therefore, has not experienced significant differences
between the actual and estimated amounts of duplicate member responses. Opt-in
partners pay a fixed rate per registration and, upon delivery of the
registrations, the Company has no further obligation under the agreements. The
Company does not currently anticipate any significant change in the nature of
the fees it charges its opt-in partners or in its customer base and believes its
historical experience with its opt-in product is predictive of future estimates.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2000, revenue was recorded net of
$639,000 and $1,269,000, respectively, for estimated duplicate member responses
to the Company's opt-in partners' newsletters and other promotions. For the
three and six months ended June 30, 2001, no allowance was necessary as the
Company recorded revenue net of actual duplicate member responses.

     Cash received from customers in advance is recorded as deferred revenue.
Advertising and opt-in revenue is recognized as emails and affirmative member
responses, respectively, are delivered.

  Concentration of Credit Risk

     Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration
of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and
accounts receivable. The Company's cash and cash equivalents are maintained at
six U.S. financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount
of insurance provided on such deposits. The majority of the Company's cash
equivalents are invested in short-term commercial paper. No one customer
exceeded 10% of the Company's revenue and accounts receivable at June 30, 2001
and for the three months then ended.

  Advertising Costs

     Advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expense as the
contractual terms of the advertising contracts are fulfilled. Cash paid in
advance of advertising services received is recorded as prepaid expenses that
are amortized as services are received. Advertising costs for the three months
ended June 30, 2001 and 2000 were $0 and $15,313,000, respectively. Advertising
costs for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000 were $2,793,000 and
$33,115,000, respectively. At June 30, 2001 and 2000, $0 and $889,000,
respectively, of prepaid advertising expense is included in prepaid expenses and
other current assets. In conjunction with the Company's restructuring plan (see
Note 3), the Company terminated an agreement for future distribution services in
the first quarter of 2001 and, as a result, $1,042,000 of prepaid expenses was
written off and included in the restructuring charge in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2001.

  Research and Development Costs

     Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include
expenses for the development of new or improved technologies designed to enhance
the performance of our service, including the salaries, stock-based compensation
and related expenses for our engineering department, as well as costs for
contracted services and co-location facilities and depreciation on equipment.

  Income Taxes

     The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method,
which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company provides a
valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not
that such assets will not be realized.

  Stock-Based Compensation

     The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," and related Interpretations, in
accounting for its employee and non-employee directors stock options and
complies with the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."
Accordingly, the Company measures compensation expense for its employee
stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method and provides pro-forma
disclosures of net loss as if the fair value method had been applied in
measuring compensation expense. Under the intrinsic value method of accounting
for stock-based compensation, when the exercise price of options granted to
employees is less than the estimated fair value of the underlying stock on the
date of grant, deferred compensation is recognized and is amortized to
compensation expense over the applicable vesting period.

                               LIFEMINDERS, INC.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
                                  (UNAUDITED)

     The Company measures compensation expense for its non-employee stock-based
compensation awards in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and EITF 96-18, "Accounting
for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or
in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services." The estimated fair value of the
options and warrants issued is used to measure the transaction when it is more
reliable than the fair value of the services received. The estimated fair value
is measured on the date the commitment for performance by the counterparty has
been reached or the counterparty's performance is complete. The estimated fair
value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and
additional paid-in capital. A total of 100,000 options were granted to a
non-employee during the three months ended June 30, 2001. No options or warrants
were issued to non-employees during the three months ended June 30, 2000.

     The Company follows FASB Interpretation No. 44 (FIN 44), "Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation -- an Interpretation of APB
Opinion No. 25," effective July 1, 2000, to account for exchanges of stock
options and awards in purchase business combinations. Accordingly, the fair
value of vested stock options and awards issued in exchange for vested stock
options and awards of the acquiree is included as part of the purchase price.
The fair value of unvested options or awards issued in exchange for unvested
options and awards of the acquiree is accounted for as part of the purchase
price, and an amount equal to the portion of the intrinsic value of the unvested
options or awards related to future vesting is allocated to deferred
compensation and recognized over the remaining vesting period. During the three
and six months ended June 30, 2001, the Company reduced deferred compensation by
$1,105,000 and $3,154,000, respectively, for unvested, forfeited stock options.

  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

     The Company evaluates the carrying amounts of long-lived assets when facts
or changes in circumstances suggest they may be impaired. If this review
indicates the carrying amounts of long-lived assets will not be recoverable, as
determined based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the acquired
assets, the Company will measure the amount of such impairment based on the
present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate
with the risks involved or other methods. On July 18, 2001, the Company and
Cross Media entered into a merger agreement and, on July 19, 2001, the Company
publicly announced its intention to merge with Cross Media. The merger agreement
was amended and restated on August 20, 2001. Under the terms of the amended and
restated merger agreement, Cross Media will pay a total of up to $24 million in
cash and issue approximately 22.3 million shares of its common stock in the
merger, assuming that no LifeMinders stock options are exercised prior to the
date on which the merger is completed and that LifeMinders stockholders elect to
receive the maximum cash consideration, and subject to adjustment under certain
circumstances, for all of LifeMinders' outstanding equity interests. Based on
the revised merger consideration, the Company determined the carrying value of
its long-lived assets as of June 30, 2001, exceeded their fair value. The
Company performed an impairment analysis and recorded an impairment charge of
$18,023,000, of which $2,497,000 is recorded in cost of revenue (see Note 4).

  Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Common Share

     Basic net loss per common share is based on the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during each year. Diluted net loss per common
share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during each year, adjusted for the effect of common stock
equivalents arising from the assumed exercise of stock options, if dilutive.
Common stock equivalents have been excluded from the net loss per share
calculation because their effect would be antidilutive.

  Certain Risks and Uncertainties

     The Company is subject to all the risks inherent in an early stage business
in the technology industry. The risks include, but are not limited to, limited
operating history, successful integration of acquired businesses, dependence on
the Internet and related security risks and the changing nature of the Internet
industry.

  Segment Reporting

     The Company adopted SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information." SFAS No. 131 replaces the "industry
segment" approach with the "management" approach to reporting financial
information about an enterprise's segments. The management approach designates
the internal organization that is used by management for allocating resources
and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.
SFAS No. 131 also requires disclosures about products and services, geographic
areas, and major customers.

  Comprehensive Income

     During the periods presented, the Company has not had any significant
transactions that are required to be reported in comprehensive income.

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements

     In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) approved
Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, "Business
Combinations" and No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141
addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations. All
business combinations in the scope of this Statement will be accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting. The provisions of SFAS No. 141 apply to all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, and business combinations
accounted for by the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is July
1, 2001, or later. SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Under this Statement, goodwill
will no longer be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually
at the reporting unit level. Goodwill will be tested for impairment on an
interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would
more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its
carrying value. Intangible assets which remain subject to amortization will be
reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of."
The provisions of SFAS No. 142 are required to be applied starting with fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2001.

3.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGE

     During the three and six months ended June 30, 2001, the Company undertook
a restructuring plan to reduce costs and focus its efforts on reducing operating
losses while evaluating strategic alternatives. Accordingly, restructuring
charges totaling $11,703,000 and $14,248,000, respectively, were recorded during
the three and six months ended June 30, 2001. During the six months ended June
30, 2001, the Company terminated approximately 85% of its workforce as of
December 31, 2000. In addition, the Company negotiated separation and
termination agreements with the remaining employees. Of the total restructuring
charges for the three and six months ended June 30, 2001, $2,404,000 and
$3,824,000, respectively, related to employee and contract termination benefits,
$9,263,000 related to the early termination of the Company's multi-year lease
for its headquarters, and $37,000 and $1,161,000, respectively, related to early
termination of various vendor service agreements. Approximately $1,042,000 of
this charge was recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets, and
$7,600,000 was recorded as restricted cash as of
                                       F-73

                               LIFEMINDERS, INC.

December 31, 2000, and approximately $3,526,000 was paid in the six months ended
June 30, 2001. LifeMinders expects to pay the remainder during 2001.

4.  IMPAIRMENT CHARGE

     Prior to June 30, 2001, the Company began negotiations to merge with Cross
Media. In late May of 2001, representatives of Cross Media contacted the Company
to discuss a possible merger. On June 21, 2001, Cross Media and the Company
executed a letter of intent and term sheet for the merger transaction, which was
subsequently modified as of June 27, 2001. On July 18, 2001, the Company and
Cross Media entered into a merger agreement and, on July 19, 2001, the Company
publicly announced its intention to merge with Cross Media. The merger agreement
was amended and restated on August 20, 2001. Under the terms of the amended and
restated merger agreement, Cross Media will pay a total of up to $24 million in
cash and issue approximately 22.3 million shares of its common stock in the
merger, assuming that no LifeMinders stock options are exercised prior to the
date on which the merger is consummated and that LifeMinders stockholders elect
to receive the maximum cash consideration, and subject to adjustment under
certain circumstances, for all of LifeMinders' outstanding equity interest.
Based on the revised merger consideration, the Company determined that the
carrying value of its long-lived assets as of June 30, 2001, exceeded their fair
value. The Company calculated and recorded an impairment charge of $18,023,000,
of which $2,497,000 is recorded in cost of revenue. The major components of the
impairment charge are as follows (in thousands):

Property and equipment......................................  $14,079

7.  SEGMENT INFORMATION

     Through June 30, 2001, the Company operated within two business units:
business to consumer marketing and business-to-business marketing (outsourcing).
The reportable segments derive revenue from the sale of advertising within each
unit's corresponding medium. The segment operating loss is revenue less direct
and allocable expenses. Segment identifiable assets are those that are directly
used in or identified to segment operations.

     For financial reporting purposes, we have two revenue streams: delivery of
advertisements within emails to our members and delivery of opt-in names to our
registration partners.

     Financial information by segment for the three months ended June 30, 2001
is as follows:

                                         CONSUMER    OUTSOURCING    CORPORATE     TOTAL

     Prior to the third quarter of 2000, the Company operated in one segment:
the Internet and related services. Subsequent to June 30, 2001, the Company
ceased operations of its outsourcing unit.

     Financial information by segment for the six month period ended June 30,
2001 is as follows (in thousands):

                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     This AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"),
dated August 20, 2001 ("the date hereof"), is entered into by and between Cross
Media Marketing Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("XMM") and LifeMinders,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("LifeMinders").

     Whereas, the respective Boards of Directors of XMM and LifeMinders have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective stockholders
that XMM and LifeMinders enter into a business combination under which
LifeMinders will merge with and into XMM pursuant to the Merger (as defined in
Section 1.1 hereof) and XMM and LifeMinders desire to enter into the transaction
contemplated hereby, and, in connection therewith, to make certain
representations, warranties and agreements to and with each other;

     Whereas, the Board of Directors of each of XMM and LifeMinders has
determined that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are
consistent with, and in furtherance of, its business strategies and goals and
each has approved the Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth herein;

     Whereas, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall constitute a tax-free reorganization under Section 368 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code");

     Whereas, for accounting purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall be
accounted for as a purchase under United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP"); and

     Whereas, XMM and LifeMinders entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
dated July 18, 2001 (the "Original Merger Agreement") and have now determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective stockholders to amend and
restate the Original Merger Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
Parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

     Section 1.1. The Merger.

     At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof) and subject to and
upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), LifeMinders will be merged with and into XMM (the
"Merger"), whereby the separate corporate existence of LifeMinders shall cease
and XMM shall continue as the surviving corporation. XMM, as the surviving
corporation after the Merger, is herein sometimes referred to as the "Surviving
Corporation" and LifeMinders, as the non-surviving corporation after the Merger,
is herein sometimes referred to as the "Merged Corporation." LifeMinders and XMM
are herein referred to collectively as the "Parties" and each individually as a
"Party."

     Section 1.2. Effective Time.

     As promptly as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII hereof and the consummation of the Closing
referred to in Section 6.3 hereof, the Parties shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware with respect to the Merger, in such form as required by, and
executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the time of
such filing being the "Effective Time").

     Section 1.3. Effect of the Merger.

     At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all

                                       A-1

the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of LifeMinders and XMM
shall continue with, or vest in, as the case may be, XMM, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of LifeMinders and XMM shall continue to be, or become,
as the case may be, the debts, liabilities and duties of XMM.

     Section 1.4. Subsequent Actions.

     If at any time after the Effective Time XMM shall consider or be advised
that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or
things are necessary or desirable to continue in, vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in XMM its right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, properties, privileges, franchises or assets of either of its
constituent corporations acquired or to be acquired by XMM as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the
officers and directors of XMM shall be directed and authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of either of such constituent corporations,
all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other
actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties,
privileges, franchises or assets in XMM or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement.

     Section 1.5. Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers
of XMM.

     Unless otherwise agreed by LifeMinders and XMM before the Effective Time,
at the Effective Time:

     (a) the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of XMM shall be,
subject to the XMM Stockholder Approval, as set forth in Exhibit 1.5(a), until
thereafter amended as provided by law and such Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation;

     (b) the Amended and Restated Bylaws of XMM shall be the Amended and
Restated Bylaws of XMM as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
until thereafter amended as provided by law and the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation and such Amended and Restated Bylaws; and

     (c) subject to Section 6.8, the directors and officers of XMM immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall continue to serve in their respective offices
of XMM from and after the Effective Time, in each case until their successors
are elected or appointed and qualified or until their resignation or removal.

                                   ARTICLE II

    EFFECT ON STOCK OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION AND THE MERGED CORPORATION

     Section 2.1. Conversion of Securities.

     The manner and basis of converting the shares of common stock of the Merged
Corporation at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of either Party or the holder of any of such securities,
shall be as hereinafter set forth in this Article II.

     Section 2.2. Conversion of Shares.

     Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of LifeMinders
("LifeMinders Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time (excluding those cancelled pursuant to Section 2.3) and all
rights in respect thereof, shall at the Effective Time, without any action on
the part of any holder thereof, be converted into (i) the right to receive cash
and/or shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of XMM ("XMM Common
Stock") in accordance with Section 2.4 hereof and (ii) a cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, in accordance with Section 2.8 hereof (collectively,
the "Merger Consideration"); provided, however, that dividends and other
distributions of any kind payable to holders of record of XMM Common Stock shall
not be paid by XMM in respect of any unsurrendered certificates representing
shares of LifeMinders Common Stock (each, an "Old Certificate") until such Old
Certificates shall have been surrendered as provided herein. Upon the subsequent
surrender and exchange of such Old Certificates, the holder thereof shall be
paid, without interest, the amount of any dividend or other distribution which
became payable on or after the Effective

                                       A-2

Time to holders of record on or after the Effective Time of shares of XMM Common
Stock, if the payment date was prior to or on the date of surrender and
exchange; if the payment date is subsequent to such surrender and exchange,
payment shall be made on such payment date. No interest will be paid or will
accrue on any cash payable on the surrender of any Old Certificate.

     Section 2.3. Cancellation of Treasury Shares and XMM-Owned Shares.

     At the Effective Time, each share of LifeMinders Common Stock held in the
treasury of LifeMinders or owned by XMM immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and retired and no shares of stock or other securities of XMM
shall be issuable, and no payment or other consideration shall be made, with
respect thereto.

     Section 2.4. Election of Consideration.

     (a) Subject to the allocation and election procedures and requirements set
forth in this Section 2.4 and Sections 2.5 and 2.10 below, each holder of record
(as of the Election Deadline) of shares of LifeMinders Common Stock will be
entitled to elect to receive with respect to all of such holder's shares (the
"Shares"): (i) cash (the "Cash Election"); or (ii) cash (the "Cash Portion") for
a percentage of the Shares equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is 24 and
the denominator of which is 72, and shares of XMM Common Stock (the "Stock
Portion") for a percentage of the Shares equal to a fraction, the numerator of
which is 48 and the denominator of which is 72 (the "Cash/Stock Election"); or
(iii) shares of XMM Common Stock, and no cash, (the "Stock Election"). All
elections shall be made on a form designed for that purpose by XMM with the
reasonable approval of LifeMinders (the "Election Form") in accordance with the
procedures specified in Section 2.5.

     (b) Any such holder of LifeMinders Common Stock who fails to submit an
Election Form within the time period specified, or whose Election Form is not
effective as specified in Section 2.5, will be deemed for all purposes of this
Agreement to have made the Stock Election.

     (c) Each share (or a fraction thereof) of LifeMinders Common Stock covered
by the Cash Portion of a Cash/Stock Election will be exchanged for the Per Share
Cash Consideration (as defined below) and each share (or a fraction thereof) of
LifeMinders Common Stock covered by the Stock Portion of a Cash/Stock Election
will be exchanged for the Per Share Stock Consideration (as defined below)
(subject to the provisions in Section 2.8 below).

     (d) Each share of LifeMinders Common Stock held by a holder of LifeMinders
Common Stock who either (i) makes a Stock Election (or who is deemed to have
made a Stock Election) or (ii) was not a stockholder of record with respect to
such share of LifeMinders Common Stock as of the Election Deadline, will be
exchanged for the Per Share Stock Consideration (subject to the provisions of
Section 2.8 below).

     (e) Subject to clause (f) below, each share of LifeMinders Common Stock
held by a holder of LifeMinders Common Stock who makes a Cash Election will be
exchanged for the Per Share Cash Consideration;

     (f) If the Available Cash Amount (as defined below) divided by the
aggregate number of shares of LifeMinders Common Stock covered by Cash Elections
(the "Cash Election Shares") is less than the Per Share Cash Consideration, then
all shares of LifeMinders Common Stock covered by Cash Elections shall be
converted into the right to receive shares of XMM Common Stock and cash in the
following manner:

     each such share shall be converted into the right to receive (i) an amount
     in cash, without interest, equal to the Available Cash Amount divided by
     the total number of Cash Election Shares, and (ii) shares (or a fractional
     share) of XMM Common Stock equal to the quotient of (x) the difference
     between the Per Share Cash Consideration and the cash per share such holder
     received pursuant to Section 2.4(f)(i) above, divided by (y) $1.9845.

                                       A-3

     For purposes hereof and Exhibit 2.4B:

     "Aggregate Merger Consideration" equals Seventy Two Million Dollars
($72,000,000) minus the Shortfall Adjustment (defined below), if any.

     "Available Cash Amount" shall be equal to (i) the Total Cash Component
minus (ii) the aggregate amount of the Cash Portions paid pursuant to all
Cash/Stock Elections.

     "LifeMinders' Net Cash and Cash Equivalents" shall be calculated as set
forth on Exhibit 2.4A hereto.

     "Per Share Cash Consideration" shall be calculated as set forth in Exhibit
2.4B and rounded to the fourth decimal place.

     "Per Share Stock Consideration" shall mean the number of shares of XMM
Common Stock equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration divided by $1.9845,
rounded to the fourth decimal point.

     "Shortfall" shall mean the amount, if any, by which LifeMinders' Net Cash
and Cash Equivalents at August 31, 2001 is less than Forty Nine Million Dollars
($49,000,000).

     "Shortfall Adjustment" is an amount equal to the Shortfall; provided,
however, that (i) the "Shortfall Adjustment" shall be deemed to be zero (0) if
LifeMinders' Net Cash and Cash Equivalents at August 31, 2001 are at least Forty
Eight Million Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($48,900,000) and (ii) in no event
shall the "Shortfall Adjustment" be greater than One Million Seven Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($1,750,000).

     "Total Cash Component" shall mean Twenty Four Million Dollars ($24,000,000)
plus one-third of the cash received by LifeMinders as a result of the exercise
of LifeMinders Options between July 18, 2001 and the Effective Time, minus the
product of (x) the Shortfall Adjustment, if any, times (y) a fraction, the
numerator of which is 24 and the denominator of which is 72.

     Section 2.5. Election Procedures.

     (a) The Election Form shall be distributed to each LifeMinders stockholder
of record as of the Record Date and shall specify the Election Deadline (as
defined in Section 9.4 below). The Parties shall use their reasonable efforts to
cause the Election Forms and the Joint Proxy Statement to be delivered or
otherwise made available to purchasers of LifeMinders Common Stock after the
Record Date.

     (b) Elections shall be made by LifeMinders stockholders by mailing or
otherwise delivering to the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 9.4 herein) a
completed Election Form. To be effective, an Election Form must be properly
completed, signed and submitted to the Exchange Agent accompanied by the Old
Certificates as to which the election is being made (or accompanied by a
Guaranty of Delivery (as defined in Section 9.4 below) of such Certificates, or
by appropriate evidence that such Certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed accompanied by such security or indemnity as shall be reasonably
requested by LifeMinders or XMM). An Election Form and accompanying Old
Certificates, Guaranty of Delivery or evidence of lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates (accompanied by any requested security or indemnity) must be
received by the Exchange Agent by the Election Deadline. An election may be
changed or revoked but only by written notice received by the Exchange Agent
prior to the Election Deadline including, in the case of a change, a properly
completed revised Election Form.

     (c) XMM, or the Exchange Agent if so designated by XMM, shall determine in
the reasonable exercise of discretion, whether the Election Forms have been
properly completed, signed and submitted (and are therefore effective) or
changed or revoked and may disregard immaterial defects in Election Forms. XMM
or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, will notify the applicable stockholder of
any defect in an Election Form by regular mail or such other method of notice
which can reasonably be expected to be at least as prompt.

     (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the
provisions hereof and any Old Certificates and Guarantys of Delivery have been
transmitted to the Exchange Agent pursuant to the

                                       A-4

provisions hereof, XMM and LifeMinders shall cause the Exchange Agent to
promptly return such Old Certificates and Guarantys of Delivery to the Person
submitting the same.

     Section 2.6. Mechanics of Payment of Consideration.

     (a) Within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, XMM shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent sufficient certificates representing XMM Common
Stock and sufficient cash to enable the Exchange Agent to distribute the Merger
Consideration as determined pursuant to this Agreement. As soon as practicable
but not later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall distribute, to all LifeMinders stockholders who have
properly submitted by the Election Deadline Election Forms that are effective
and accompanied by their Old Certificates, Guarantys of Delivery or proper
evidence with respect to lost, stolen or destroyed certificates (accompanied by
any requested security or indemnity), the portion of the Merger Consideration to
which each such stockholder is entitled.

     (b) As soon as practicable but not later than fifteen (15) Business Days
after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall send the Stockholder
Materials to each LifeMinders stockholder who failed on or before the Election
Deadline, to submit an Election Form, or whose Election Form was not effective.
All Stockholder Materials shall be sent by first class United States mail to
such LifeMinders stockholders at the addresses set forth on the official
stockholder records of LifeMinders. XMM shall also make appropriate provisions
with the Exchange Agent to enable LifeMinders stockholders to obtain the
Stockholder Materials from, and to deliver the Old Certificates, Guarantys of
Delivery or evidence with respect to lost, stolen or destroyed certificates
(accompanied by any requested security or indemnity) to, the Exchange Agent in
person, commencing on or not later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the
Effective Time. Upon receipt of the appropriate Stockholder Materials, together
with the Old Certificates, Guarantys of Delivery or evidence with respect to
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates (accompanied by any requested security or
indemnity) the Exchange Agent shall take prompt action to process such
Stockholder Materials (including the prompt return of any defective submissions
with instructions as to those actions which may be necessary to remedy any
defects) and to mail to such former LifeMinders stockholders the portion of the
Merger Consideration to which each such stockholder is entitled, but in no event
later than ten (10) Business Days after receiving properly completed Stockholder
Materials from such stockholders.

     (c) Any holder whose Old Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed
may nevertheless obtain the portion of the Merger Consideration into which the
shares of LifeMinders Common Stock represented by such Old Certificates have
been converted pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, provided such
holder delivers to XMM or the Exchange Agent a statement certifying such loss,
theft or destruction and providing for indemnity reasonably satisfactory to XMM
and the Exchange Agent indemnifying XMM and the Exchange Agent against any loss
or expense any of them may incur as a result of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Old Certificates being thereafter surrendered to the Exchange Agent. Until so
surrendered, each Old Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented
shares of LifeMinders Common Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective
Time, for all purposes, to evidence the right to receive the portion of the
Merger Consideration into which such shares of LifeMinders Common Stock shall
have been so converted.

     (d) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash deposited with it pursuant to
Section 2.6(a) hereof, as directed by XMM, on a daily basis. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to XMM.

     (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration held by the Exchange Agent
which has not been delivered to the LifeMinders stockholders pursuant to this
Article II within six months after the Effective Time shall promptly be paid or
delivered, as appropriate, to XMM, and thereafter holders of Old Certificates
who have not theretofore complied with the exchange procedures set forth in and
contemplated by this Article II shall thereafter look only to XMM (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) only as general creditors thereof
for their claim for cash or shares of XMM Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions (with a record date after the Effective Time) with respect to the
shares of XMM Common Stock to which they are entitled. Notwithstanding the
foregoing

                                       A-5

provisions of this Section 2.6, none of the Exchange Agent, XMM or LifeMinders
shall be liable to a holder of an Old Certificate for cash, XMM Common Stock,
any dividends or distributions thereon or any cash payment for fractional shares
as contemplated by Section 2.8, delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law or to a transferee
pursuant to Section 2.7 hereof.

     Section 2.7. Transfer Books.

     The stock transfer books of LifeMinders shall be closed at the Effective
Time and no transfer of any shares of LifeMinders Common Stock will thereafter
be recorded on any of such stock transfer books. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of LifeMinders Common Stock prior to the Effective Time that is not
registered in the stock transfer records of LifeMinders at the Effective Time, a
certificate or certificates representing the number of whole shares of XMM
Common Stock into which such shares of LifeMinders Common Stock shall have been
converted shall be issued to the transferee together with a cash payment in lieu
of fractional shares, if any, in accordance with Section 2.8 hereof, if the Old
Certificate therefor is surrendered as provided in Section 2.5 hereof,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence of payment of any applicable stock transfer or other tax.

     Section 2.8. No Fractional Share Certificates.

     No scrip or fractional share certificates for shares of XMM Common Stock
shall be issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of a share or shares of
LifeMinders Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fractional share of XMM Common
Stock on the Effective Time shall receive from XMM an amount of cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Per Share Cash Consideration by (ii)
the fraction of a share of XMM Common Stock to which the holder would otherwise
be entitled. No such holder of Old Certificates shall be entitled to dividends
or other rights in respect of any such fractional interest in XMM Common Stock.
Payment for such fractional interest shall be made, without interest, net of any
required withholding upon surrender of the Old Certificates.

     Section 2.9. Options to Purchase LifeMinders Common Stock.

     (a) As of the Effective Time, XMM shall assume all of the stock options of
LifeMinders, whether or not vested or immediately exercisable, outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the LifeMinders Option Plans (as
defined in Section 3.3(a) below) (the "LifeMinders Options"). Each LifeMinders
Option, whether or not exercisable at the Effective Time, shall be assumed by
XMM in such a manner that it shall be exercisable upon the same terms and
conditions as under the LifeMinders Option Plan pursuant to which it was granted
and the applicable option agreement issued thereunder (except to the extent that
such vesting terms, conditions and restrictions may be altered in accordance
with their terms as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby); provided
that (i) each such option thereafter shall be exercisable for a number of shares
of XMM Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the Per
Share Stock Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of LifeMinders
Common Stock subject to such option, and (ii) the option price per share of XMM
Common Stock thereafter shall equal the option price per share of LifeMinders
Common Stock subject to such option in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time divided by the Per Share Stock Consideration (the "XMM Exchange Options");
provided that if the foregoing results in an aggregate exercise price that
requires the payment of a fraction of a cent at the time of exercise of XMM
Exchange Options for one or more shares of XMM Common Stock (with the exercise
price considered in the aggregate for all such Options being exercised), then
the aggregate exercise price for such shares shall be further adjusted upwards
to the nearest whole cent.

     (b) (Intentionally Omitted).

     (c) Exhibit 2.9B sets forth a list of holders of LifeMinders Options whose
Options will become fully exercisable at the Effective Time as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby; upon such exercise, such holders shall receive
XMM Common Stock as set forth in Section 2.9(a) above.

                                       A-6

     (d) The adjustments provided in this Section 2.9 with respect to any
options which are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the
Code) shall be effected in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.

     (e) On or prior to the Effective Time, XMM shall obtain the approval of its
Board of Directors in accordance with Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act of the
exchange of securities as contemplated by this Agreement consistent with the SEC
no action letter issued to Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom dated January 12,
1999.

     (f) LifeMinders shall amend the LifeMinders Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the "LifeMinders Purchase Plan") so that as of the Effective Time: (i) the
LifeMinders Purchase Plan shall provide that no additional purchase rights shall
be issued under it; and (ii) each purchase right granted under the LifeMinders
Purchase Plan shall terminate, if it has not previously terminated by its terms.
As of the Effective Time, each then-outstanding purchase right granted under the
LifeMinders Purchase Plan shall be terminated.

     Section 2.10. Certain Adjustments.

     If between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares
of LifeMinders Common Stock or of XMM Common Stock shall be changed into a
different number of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
split-up, combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend payable in stock or
other securities shall be declared thereon with a record date within such
period, the Per Share Stock Consideration and the Per Share Cash Consideration,
as applicable, shall be adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of
LifeMinders Common Stock and XMM Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such reclassification, recapitalization,
split-up, combination, exchange or dividend.

                                  ARTICLE III

                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF LIFEMINDERS

     Except as (i) expressly disclosed in the LifeMinders SEC Reports (including
all exhibits referred to therein) (provided however the LifeMinders SEC Reports
shall not qualify the representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.1,
3.3, 3.5, 3.7, 3.8, 3.11 and 3.17(h)) or (ii) set forth in the disclosure
schedule delivered by LifeMinders to XMM with the Original Merger Agreement, as
amended on the date hereof by Attachment A hereto (the "LifeMinders Disclosure
Schedule") (each section of which qualifies the correspondingly-numbered
representation and warranty, as specified therein), LifeMinders hereby
represents and warrants to XMM as follows:

authority, franchise, license, certificate or permit to own, operate or lease
its properties and carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is
duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing,
in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, operated or
leased or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary,
except for such failure which, when taken together with all other such failures,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
LifeMinders or its Subsidiaries.

                                       A-7

     Section 3.2. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

     LifeMinders has heretofore furnished, or otherwise made available, to XMM a
complete and correct copy of the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws,

will not result in, or otherwise require any changes, alterations or
modifications to the terms of any LifeMinders Equity Rights, or permit any
Person who exercises a LifeMinders Equity Rights after the Effective Time to
receive anything other than XMM Common Stock upon such exercise.

     (b) All shares of LifeMinders Common Stock which are outstanding as of the
date hereof are duly authorized and validly issued, and are fully paid and
nonassessable, and are not subject to, and were not issued in violation of, any

any character (contingent or otherwise) to purchase or otherwise acquire any
shares of the capital stock of LifeMinders or any LifeMinders Equity Rights from
LifeMinders or any of LifeMinders' Subsidiaries at any time, or upon the

     (a) LifeMinders has timely filed all forms, reports and documents required
to be filed by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") since
November 19, 1999, and has heretofore delivered or made available to XMM, in the
form filed with the SEC, together with any amendments thereto, its (i) Annual
Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1999 and 2000, (ii)

Reports"). The LifeMinders SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the 1933 Act or the Exchange Act (as defined in Section 9.4
hereof), as the case may be, and the rules and regulations promulgated under
each of such respective acts. The LifeMinders SEC Reports (including all
exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein)
did not, at the time they were filed (or, if amended or superseded by filing
prior to the date hereof, then on the date of such filing), contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

     (b) All financial statements, including all related notes and schedules,
contained in each of the LifeMinders SEC Reports (or incorporated by reference
therein) fairly present the consolidated financial position and stockholders'
equity of LifeMinders and its Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof
and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of LifeMinders and its
Subsidiaries for the periods indicated therein in accordance with GAAP applied
on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated (except for changes in
accounting principles disclosed in the notes thereto) and subject, in the case
of interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments.

     Section 3.7. Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

     Since December 31, 2000, and except as expressly permitted by this
Agreement, LifeMinders and its Subsidiaries have not incurred any liability
required by GAAP to be disclosed on a consolidated balance sheet of LifeMinders
and its Subsidiaries or the footnotes thereto, except in the ordinary course of
their businesses consistent with their past practices, and there has not been
any change, or any event involving a prospective change, in the business assets,
liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of LifeMinders or any
of its Subsidiaries which has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a Material
Adverse Effect on LifeMinders, and LifeMinders and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their respective businesses in the ordinary course consistent with
their past practices.

LifeMinders Disclosure Schedule also sets forth a list of all orders or decrees
(of any Governmental Entity) to which LifeMinders or any of its Subsidiaries or

against LifeMinders or any of its Subsidiaries, or any properties or rights of
LifeMinders or any of its Subsidiaries, by or before any Governmental Entity
except for those that are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on LifeMinders or prevent or materially
delay the ability of LifeMinders to consummate the Merger.

                                       A-10

     Section 3.9. Permits; No Violation of Law.

     The businesses of LifeMinders and its Subsidiaries are not being conducted
in violation of any statute, law, ordinance, regulation, judgment, order or
decree of any Governmental Entity (including any stock exchange or other
self-regulatory body) ("Legal Requirements"), or in violation of any permits,
franchises, licenses, authorizations, certificates, variances, exemptions,
orders, registrations or consents that are granted by any Governmental Entity
(including any stock exchange or other self-regulatory body) ("Permits"), except
for violations none of which, individually or in the aggregate, may reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on LifeMinders. No investigation
or review by any Governmental Entity (including any stock exchange or other
self-regulatory body) with respect to LifeMinders or its Subsidiaries in
relation to any alleged violation of law or regulation is pending or, to
LifeMinders' knowledge, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity (including
any stock exchange or other self-regulatory body) indicated an intention to
conduct the same, except for such investigations which, if they resulted in
adverse findings, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on LifeMinders. Neither LifeMinders nor
any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease and desist or other order,
judgment, injunction or decree issued by, or is a party to any written
agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party
to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order
or directive by, or has adopted any board resolutions at the request of, any
Governmental Entity that materially restricts the conduct of its business or
which may reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
LifeMinders, nor has LifeMinders or any of its Subsidiaries been advised that
any Governmental Entity is considering issuing or requesting any of the
foregoing.

     Section 3.10. Joint Proxy Statement.

     None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of
LifeMinders or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the registration statement (the "Registration Statement") to be filed with the
SEC by XMM in connection with the issuance of the shares of XMM Common Stock as
a result of the Merger (the "Merger Shares") will, at the time the Registration
Statement becomes effective under the 1933 Act, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. None of the information supplied or
to be supplied by or on behalf of LifeMinders or its Subsidiaries for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus, in
definitive form, relating to the meetings of LifeMinders and XMM stockholders to
be held in connection with the Merger, or in the related proxy and notice of
meeting, or soliciting material used in connection therewith (referred to herein
collectively as the "Joint Proxy Statement") will, on the dates mailed to
stockholders and at the times of the LifeMinders stockholders' meeting and the
XMM stockholders' meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement (except for
information relating solely to XMM or its Subsidiaries) will comply as to form
in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder.

     Section 3.11. Employee Matters; ERISA.

     (a) Except where the failure to be true would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on LifeMinders, (i) each LifeMinders
Plan has been operated and administered in accordance with applicable law,
including but not limited to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and the Code, (ii) each LifeMinders Plan intended to

(iii) except as required by COBRA, no LifeMinders Plan provides death or medical
benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current or former employees
of LifeMinders or of any trade or business, whether or not incorporated, which
together with LifeMinders would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning
of Section 4001 of ERISA (a "LifeMinders ERISA Affiliate"), beyond their
retirement or other termination

                                       A-11

of service, (iv) no liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by
LifeMinders or any LifeMinders ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in
full, and no condition exists that presents a material risk to LifeMinders or
any LifeMinders ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability (other than PBGC
premiums), (v) all contributions or other amounts due from LifeMinders or any
LifeMinders ERISA Affiliate with respect to each LifeMinders Plan have been paid
in full, (vi) neither LifeMinders nor any LifeMinders ERISA Affiliate has

Subsidiaries could reasonably be expected to be subject to either a civil
penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed
pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code, (vii) to the best knowledge of
LifeMinders there are no pending, threatened or anticipated claims (other than
