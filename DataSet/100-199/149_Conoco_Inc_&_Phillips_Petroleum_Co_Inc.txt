       PRELIMINARY DRAFT DATED DECEMBER 7, 2001 -- SUBJECT TO COMPLETION

[LOGO OF CONOCO TO COME]                              [LOGO OF PHILLIPS TO COME]

     To the stockholders of Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company:

                     PROPOSED MERGER OF CONOCO AND PHILLIPS

     The Boards of Directors of Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company each
have unanimously approved a combination of the two companies to form
ConocoPhillips. ConocoPhillips will be the third largest integrated energy
company in the United States based on market capitalization, oil and gas
reserves and production. It will be the fifth largest refiner and the sixth
largest non-governmentally owned energy company worldwide based on oil and gas
reserves.

     Upon completion of the merger, Conoco stockholders will receive 0.4677 of a
share of ConocoPhillips common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for each share
of Conoco common stock and Phillips stockholders will receive one share of
ConocoPhillips common stock for each share of Phillips common stock. As a
result, former Conoco stockholders will hold approximately 43.4%, and former
Phillips stockholders will hold approximately 56.6%, of the outstanding shares
of ConocoPhillips common stock. We expect that ConocoPhillips common stock will
be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "COP."

     Conoco and Phillips each will hold a special meeting of stockholders to
consider and vote on this proposal. Whether or not you plan to attend your
company's special meeting, please take the time to submit a proxy by following
the instructions on your proxy card.

     The places, dates and times of the special meetings are as follows:

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:  WHEN AND WHERE ARE THE SPECIAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS?

A:  The special meeting of Conoco stockholders will take place on [date], 2002,
    at [address]. The special meeting of Phillips stockholders will take place
    on [date], 2002, at the Adams Building, 4th Street and Keeler Avenue,
    Bartlesville, Oklahoma.

Q:  WHAT STOCKHOLDER APPROVALS ARE REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE MERGER?

A:  For both Conoco and Phillips, the affirmative vote of a majority of the
    shares outstanding and entitled to vote as of the respective record dates is
    required to adopt the merger agreement.

     As of the Conoco record date, Conoco directors and officers held and were
     entitled to vote less than [     ]% of the Conoco common stock outstanding.

     As of the Phillips record date, Phillips directors and officers held and
     were entitled to vote less than [     ]% of the Phillips common stock
     outstanding.

Q:  WHY ARE CONOCO AND PHILLIPS GOING TO MERGE?

A:  We believe that the merger will provide substantial strategic and financial
    benefits to Conoco and Phillips and their stockholders, including:

   - expanded scope and scale to succeed as a major integrated oil company in
     the changing marketplace,

   - strategic fit and compatibility,

   - strong financial position, and

   - cost savings.

   To review the reasons for the merger in greater detail, see pages [     ]
through [     ].

Q:  WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE MERGER?

A:  Prior to entering into the merger agreement, Conoco and Phillips formed
    CorvettePorsche Corp. which will be renamed "ConocoPhillips" upon the
    completion of the merger and which we refer to as "New Parent." New Parent,
    in turn, formed two merger subsidiaries, Corvette Merger Corp. and Porsche
    Merger Corp. Corvette Merger Corp. will merge with and into Conoco and
    Porsche Merger Corp. will merge with and into Phillips. As a result:

   - Conoco and Phillips will become wholly owned subsidiaries of New Parent,
     and

   - former Conoco stockholders will hold approximately 43.4%, and former
     Phillips stockholders will hold approximately 56.6%, of the outstanding
     shares of New Parent common stock.

Q:  WHAT WILL BE THE NAME OF THE COMBINED COMPANY AFTER THE MERGER?

A:  After the completion of the merger, the name of the new public company will
    be "ConocoPhillips."

Q:  WHAT WILL I RECEIVE FOR MY SHARES?

A:  A Conoco stockholder will receive 0.4677 of a share of New Parent common
    stock for each share of Conoco common stock that the stockholder owns, with
    cash instead of any fractional shares of New Parent common stock.

    A Phillips stockholder will receive one share of New Parent common stock for
    each share of Phillips common stock that the stockholder owns.

    Example:  If a Conoco stockholder currently owns 100 shares of Conoco common
    stock, after the merger, the stockholder will be entitled to receive 46
    shares of New Parent common stock and an amount in cash equal to the value
    of 0.77 of a share of New Parent common stock, based on the closing price
    per share of New Parent common stock on the first trading day following the
    date on which the merger is completed.

    Example:  If a Phillips stockholder currently owns 100 shares of Phillips
    common stock, after the merger, the stockholder will be entitled to receive
    100 shares of New Parent common stock.

Q:  WHAT HAPPENS TO MY FUTURE DIVIDENDS?

A:  Pursuant to the merger agreement, Conoco and Phillips each are prohibited
    from making any changes to their dividend policies prior to the completion
    of the merger without the consent of the other. We expect that, after the
    completion of the merger, New Parent will adopt a competitive dividend
    policy.

Q:  WHAT ARE MY U.S. FEDERAL TAX CONSEQUENCES AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER?

A:  We have structured the transaction so that it is anticipated that the merger
    of Corvette Merger Corp. with and into Conoco and the merger of Porsche
    Merger Corp. with and into Phillips each will be a reorganization for U.S.
    federal income tax purposes and/or that the mergers, taken together, will
    constitute an exchange described in Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code
    of 1986, as amended. Conoco and Phillips will not be obligated to complete
    the merger unless they receive legal opinions to this effect. If each of the
    merger of Corvette Merger Corp. with and into Conoco and the merger of
    Porsche Merger Corp. with and into Phillips is a reorganization for U.S.
    federal income tax purposes and/or the mergers, taken together, constitute
    an exchange described in Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code, Conoco
    stockholders and Phillips stockholders will not recognize gain or loss for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes in the transaction (except with respect to
    any cash received instead of fractional shares of New Parent common stock).
    You are strongly urged to consult with a tax advisor to determine the
    particular U.S. federal, state or local or foreign income or other tax
    consequences as of the merger to you.

Q:  WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A:  After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this
    document, please complete and sign your proxy card and return it in the
    enclosed postage-paid envelope as soon as possible so that your shares may
    be represented at your special meeting. You also may submit your proxy by
    telephone or over the Internet by following the instructions on your proxy
    card.

    If you sign, date and send your proxy and do not indicate how you want to
    vote, your proxy will be voted for the approval of the proposal.

Q:  WHAT DO I DO IF I WANT TO CHANGE MY VOTE?

A:  Send a later-dated, signed proxy card to your company's Secretary prior to
    the date of your special meeting or attend your company's special meeting in
    person and vote. You also may revoke your proxy by sending a notice of
    revocation to your company's Secretary at the address under "Summary -- The
    Companies" on page [  ]. You may also change or revoke your proxy by
    telephone or over the Internet, regardless of the procedure used to deliver
    your previous proxy.

Q:  IF MY BROKER HOLDS MY SHARES IN "STREET NAME," WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
    SHARES?

A:  If you do not provide your broker with instructions on how to vote your
    street name shares, your broker will not be permitted to vote them on the
    merger proposal. You should, therefore, be sure to provide your broker with
    instructions on how to vote your shares. Stockholders should check the
    voting form provided by their brokers to see if they offer telephone or
    Internet voting.

    If you do not give voting instructions to your broker, your votes will not
    be counted as voting for the merger unless you appear and vote in person at
    your special meeting. If your broker holds your shares and you attend the
    special meeting, please bring a letter from your broker identifying you as
    the beneficial owner of the shares and authorizing you to vote.

Q:  WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I ABSTAIN FROM VOTING OR FAIL TO VOTE?

A:  An abstention or failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote against
    the merger.

Q:  WHO ELSE MUST APPROVE THE MERGER?

A:  Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976, as amended, Conoco and Phillips may
    not complete the merger until they have furnished certain information and
    materials to the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and
    the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the applicable waiting period has
    expired or been terminated.

    Completion of the merger is also subject to approval under the competition
    laws of the European Union, Canada and those other regulatory authorities
    where the failure to obtain those approvals would have a material adverse
    effect on New Parent after completion of the merger.

    We have made or intend to make the relevant filings as soon as practicable.
    See "The Merger -- Regulatory Matters" on page [  ].

Q:  WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE MERGER?

A:  We expect to complete the merger in the second half of 2002.

Q:  SHOULD I SEND IN MY SHARE CERTIFICATES NOW?

A:  No. After the merger is completed, we will send Conoco stockholders written
    instructions for exchanging their share certificates. The share certificates
    of Phillips stockholders immediately prior to the completion of the merger
    will be deemed to represent New Parent common stock following the merger.
    Phillips stockholders, however, may elect to exchange their Phillips share
    certificates for New Parent share certificates at their option.

Q:  DO I HAVE APPRAISAL RIGHTS?

A:  No. Neither the Conoco stockholders nor the Phillips stockholders will have
    appraisal rights under Delaware law as a result of the merger.

Q:  WHO CAN HELP ANSWER MY QUESTIONS?

A:  If you have any questions about the merger or if you need additional copies
    of this document or the enclosed proxy card, you should contact:

TO REVIEW THE BACKGROUND AND REASONS FOR THE MERGER IN GREATER DETAIL, SEE PAGES
[ ] THROUGH [ ].

FAIRNESS OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS

     CONOCO (PAGE [  ]).  In deciding to approve the merger, the Conoco Board of
Directors considered the oral opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated
delivered on November 18, 2001, and subsequently confirmed in writing, and the
written opinion of Salomon Smith Barney Inc. dated November 18, 2001, that, as
of the date of each opinion and subject to and based on the considerations in
each opinion, the exchange ratio of 0.4677 shares of New Parent common stock for
each share of Conoco common stock in the merger is fair from a financial point
of view to the holders of Conoco common stock. In its analysis of the fairness
of the Conoco exchange ratio, each of Morgan Stanley and Salomon Smith Barney
took into account, among other considerations set forth in its opinion, the
exchange ratio of one share of New Parent common stock for each share of
Phillips common stock in the merger. The written opinions of Morgan Stanley and
Salomon Smith Barney are attached as Annexes D and E, respectively, to this
document. WE ENCOURAGE CONOCO STOCKHOLDERS TO READ EACH OF THESE OPINIONS
CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY.

     PHILLIPS (PAGE [  ]).  In deciding to approve the merger, the Phillips
Board of Directors considered the oral opinions of Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated,
each delivered on November 17, 2001 and each subsequently confirmed in writing
on November 18, 2001, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of
the date of each opinion, to the holders of Phillips common stock of the
exchange ratio of one share of New Parent common stock for each share of
Phillips common stock relative to the exchange ratio of 0.4677 of a share of New
Parent common stock for each share of Conoco common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement. The written opinions of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch are
attached as Annexes F, G and H,

respectively, to this document. WE ENCOURAGE PHILLIPS STOCKHOLDERS TO READ EACH
OF THESE OPINIONS CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY.

INTERESTS OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT IN THE MERGER

     CONOCO (PAGE [  ]).  Conoco stockholders should note that some Conoco
directors and officers have interests in the merger that are different in
certain respects from the interests of other Conoco stockholders. As provided in
the merger agreement, upon the completion of the merger, eight Conoco designees
(including Archie W. Dunham, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Conoco) and
eight Phillips designees will become members of the New Parent Board of
Directors. The merger agreement also provides that Mr. Dunham will become
Chairman of New Parent. Conoco, New Parent and Mr. Dunham have entered into an
employment agreement that will become effective upon completion of the merger.

     PHILLIPS (PAGE [  ]).  Phillips stockholders should note that some Phillips
directors and officers have interests in the merger that are different in
certain respects from the interests of other Phillips stockholders. As provided
in the merger agreement, upon the completion of the merger, eight Phillips
designees (including J. J. Mulva, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Phillips) and eight Conoco designees will become members of the New Parent Board
of Directors. The merger agreement also provides that Mr. Mulva will become
Chief Executive Officer and President of New Parent. Phillips, New Parent and
Mr. Mulva have entered into an employment agreement that will become effective
upon completion of the merger.

CONDITIONS TO THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER (PAGE [ ])

     Each of Conoco's and Phillips' obligation to complete the merger is subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including the
following:

     - the merger agreement is adopted by the majority of the outstanding Conoco
       shares and the majority of the outstanding Phillips shares entitled to
       vote on the adoption of the merger agreement,

     - no legal prohibition on consummation of the merger is in effect,

     - the applicable waiting period under U.S. antitrust laws has expired or
       been terminated,

     - approvals have been obtained from the relevant foreign antitrust
       entities,

     - the shares of New Parent common stock have been approved for listing on
       the New York Stock Exchange,

     - our respective representations and warranties in the merger agreement are
       true and correct, to the extent set forth in the merger agreement,

     - we have complied with our respective covenants and agreements in the
       merger agreement, to the extent set forth in the merger agreement, and

     - we each receive an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that for U.S.
       federal income tax purposes the merger of Corvette Merger Corp. with and
       into Conoco, in the case of the opinion received by Conoco, and the
       merger of Porsche Merger Corp. with and into Phillips, in the case of the
       opinion received by Phillips, will constitute a reorganization and/or the
       mergers, taken together, will constitute an exchange described in Section
       351 of the Internal Revenue Code.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (PAGE [  ])

     Conoco and Phillips can jointly agree to terminate the merger agreement at
any time. Either company may also terminate the merger agreement if:

     - the merger is not completed on or before May 18, 2003, so long as the
       failure to complete the merger before that date is not the result of the
       failure by the terminating company to fulfill any of its obligations
       under the merger agreement,

     - government actions do not permit the completion of the merger, so long as
       the terminating company has used its reasonable best efforts to obtain
       all necessary governmental approvals and lift any injunctions,

     - either Conoco stockholders or Phillips stockholders fail to adopt the
       merger agreement at a duly held special meeting of those stockholders,

     - the other company's board of directors fails to recommend that its
       stockholders adopt the merger agreement, or changes its recommendation,
       or fails to call its special meeting of stockholders,

     - the other company breaches or fails to perform any of its
       representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
       the merger agreement and the breach or failure cannot be cured on or
       before May 18, 2003, or

     - prior to the receipt of the approval of its stockholders, it terminates
       the merger agreement in connection with a superior proposal as provided
       in the merger agreement.

TERMINATION FEES (PAGE [  ])

     Conoco and Phillips have each agreed to pay a termination fee of $550
million to the other company if the merger agreement is terminated in the
circumstances described on pages [  ] through [  ].

"NO SOLICITATION" COVENANT (PAGE [  ])

     The merger agreement contains detailed provisions prohibiting Conoco and
Phillips from seeking an alternative transaction. The no solicitation covenant
generally prohibits Conoco and Phillips, as well as their officers, directors,
subsidiaries, employees, agents and representatives, from taking any action to
solicit an acquisition proposal as described on page [  ]. The merger agreement
does not, however, prohibit either Conoco or Phillips or its respective Board of

              SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL DATA

     The following selected unaudited pro forma combined financial data has been
derived from and should be read together with the unaudited pro forma combined
financial statements and related notes on pages [  ] through [  ]. This
information is based on the historical consolidated balance sheets and related
adjusted historical consolidated statements of income of Conoco and Phillips,
and gives effect to the merger using the purchase method of accounting for
business combinations. Conoco's historical income statements have been adjusted
for the pro forma impact of the acquisition of Gulf Canada Resources Limited
effective July 1, 2001, and Phillips' historical income statements have been
adjusted to reflect the pro forma impact of the acquisition of Tosco Corporation
on September 14, 2001. In addition, Phillips' historical income statement for
2000 has been adjusted to reflect the pro forma impact of the acquisition of
ARCO's Alaska businesses and the formation of the Duke Energy Field Services and
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company joint ventures during 2000.

     The companies may have performed differently had they always been combined.
You should not rely on the selected unaudited pro forma combined financial data
as being indicative of the historical results that would have been achieved had
the companies always been combined or the future results that New Parent will
experience after the merger.

     Set forth below are net income, cash dividends and book value per common
share amounts for Conoco and Phillips on a historical basis, Conoco and Phillips
on a pro forma combined basis per Phillips common share, and Conoco and Phillips
on a pro forma combined basis per Conoco-equivalent common share.

     The pro forma combined data were derived by combining the adjusted
historical consolidated financial information of Conoco and Phillips using the
purchase method of accounting for business combinations as described under
"Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information." Conoco's historical income
statements have been adjusted for the pro forma impact of the acquisition of
Gulf Canada effective July 1, 2001, and Phillips' historical income statements
have been adjusted to reflect the pro forma impact of the acquisition of Tosco
on September 14, 2001. In addition, Phillips' historical income statement for
2000 has been adjusted to reflect the pro forma impact of the acquisition of
ARCO's Alaska businesses and the formation of the Duke Energy Field Services and
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company joint ventures during 2000.

     The Conoco-equivalent common share pro forma information shows the effect
of the merger from the perspective of an owner of Conoco common stock. The
information was computed by multiplying the New Parent pro forma information by
the exchange ratio of 0.4677.

     You should read the information below together with our historical
financial statements and related notes contained in the annual reports and other
information that we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
that we have incorporated by reference in this document. See "Where You Can Find

                      RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE MERGER

     In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference
in this document (including the matters addressed in "Cautionary Statement
Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" on page [  ]), Conoco stockholders and
Phillips stockholders should consider carefully the matters described below in
determining whether to vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.

THE VALUE OF THE SHARES OF NEW PARENT COMMON STOCK THAT YOU RECEIVE UPON THE
COMPLETION OF THE MERGER MAY BE LESS THAN THE VALUE OF YOUR SHARES OF CONOCO
COMMON STOCK OR PHILLIPS COMMON STOCK AS OF THE DATE OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT OR
ON THE DATES OF THE SPECIAL MEETINGS.

     Upon completion of the merger, all shares of Conoco common stock and
Phillips common stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of New
Parent common stock. The ratios at which the shares will be converted are fixed,
and there will be no adjustment for changes in the market price of either Conoco
common stock or Phillips common stock. Neither company is permitted to walk away
from the merger or resolicit the vote of its stockholders solely because of
changes in the market price of either company's common stock.

     There may be a significant amount of time between the dates when the Conoco
stockholders and Phillips stockholders vote on the merger agreement at their
special meetings and the date when the merger is completed. As a result, the
relative or absolute prices of shares of Conoco common stock and Phillips common
stock may vary significantly between the dates of the merger agreement, this
document, the special meetings and the completion of the merger. These
variations may be caused by, among other factors, changes in the businesses,
operations, results and prospects of our companies, market expectations of the
likelihood that the merger will be completed and the timing of its completion,
the prospects for our post-merger operations, the effect of any conditions or
restrictions imposed on or proposed with respect to the combined company by
regulators, and general market and economic conditions.

     In addition, it is impossible to predict accurately the market price of the
New Parent common stock to be received by Conoco stockholders and Phillips
stockholders after the completion of the merger. Accordingly, the prices of
Conoco common stock and Phillips common stock on the dates of the special
meetings may not be indicative of their prices immediately prior to the
completion of the merger or the price of New Parent common stock after the
merger is completed.

THE INTEGRATION OF CONOCO AND PHILLIPS FOLLOWING THE MERGER WILL PRESENT
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THAT MAY RESULT IN THE COMBINED COMPANY NOT OPERATING AS
EFFECTIVELY AS EXPECTED OR IN A FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THE ANTICIPATED POTENTIAL
BENEFITS OF THE MERGER.

     Conoco and Phillips will face significant challenges in consolidating
functions, integrating their organizations, procedures and operations in a
timely and efficient manner and retaining key Conoco and Phillips personnel. The
integration of Conoco and Phillips will be complex and time-consuming, and the
managements of Conoco and Phillips will have to dedicate substantial effort to
it. These efforts could divert management's focus and resources from other
strategic opportunities and from operational matters during the integration
process.

THE MERGER IS SUBJECT TO THE RECEIPT OF CONSENTS AND APPROVALS FROM GOVERNMENT
ENTITIES THAT COULD DELAY COMPLETION OF THE MERGER OR IMPOSE CONDITIONS THAT
COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMBINED COMPANY OR CAUSE
ABANDONMENT OF THE MERGER.

     Completion of the merger is conditioned upon the expiration or termination
of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, which we refer to as the HSR Act, and the
receipt of consents, orders, approvals or clearances, as required, under the
antitrust laws of the European Commission, Canada and those other regulatory
authorities where the failure to obtain those approvals would have a material
adverse effect on New Parent after completion of the merger. A substantial delay
in obtaining satisfactory approvals or the imposition of unfavorable terms

or conditions in the approvals could have an adverse effect on the business,
financial condition or results of operations of Conoco or Phillips, or may cause
the abandonment of the merger.

ESTIMATES OF COST SAVINGS AND COST SAVING COMPONENTS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN,
AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE ACCURACY OF THESE ESTIMATES.

     The cost savings estimates are based on a number of assumptions, including
that the combined company will be able to implement necessary cost saving
programs such as headcount reductions, consolidation of geographically proximate
facilities and elimination of duplicative administrative programs within a
defined period. In addition, the cost savings estimates assume that the combined
company will be able to realize merger efficiencies such as procurement
economies resulting from the increased size of the combined company.

           CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus, including information incorporated
by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus (see "Where You Can Find
More Information" on page [  ]), contains certain forward-looking statements
with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, plans,
objectives, future performance and businesses of each of Conoco, Phillips and
New Parent, as well as certain information relating to the merger, including,
without limitation:

     - statements relating to the synergies and accretion to reported earnings
       estimated to result from the merger;

     - statements relating to revenue, income and operations of the combined
       company after the merger; and

     - statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words "believes,"
       "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "plans," "projects" or
       similar expressions.

     The managements of Conoco and Phillips believe that these forward-looking
statements are reasonable; however, you should not place undue reliance on these
statements, as they are based on our managements' current expectations and
beliefs and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the
forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause
actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking
statements:

     - the risk factors described under "Risk Factors Relating to the Merger;"

     - changes in the businesses, operations, results and prospects of our
       companies;

     - worldwide crude oil or natural gas prices, which are outside the control
       of Conoco and Phillips, may be lower than expected;

PURPOSE OF CONOCO SPECIAL MEETING

     At the Conoco special meeting, we are asking holders of record of Conoco
common stock to consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the merger agreement by
and among Conoco, Phillips, New Parent, Corvette Merger Corp. and Porsche Merger
Corp. See "The Merger" and "The Merger Agreement."

     The Conoco Board of Directors has unanimously determined that the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are
advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of Conoco stockholders and has
approved the merger agreement.

     THE CONOCO BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT CONOCO
STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

CONOCO RECORD DATE; SHARES ENTITLED TO VOTE; QUORUM

     Only holders of record of Conoco common stock at the close of business on
[  ], the Conoco record date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the
Conoco special meeting. On the Conoco record date approximately [  ] shares of
Conoco common stock were issued and outstanding and held by approximately [  ]
holders of record. A quorum will be present at the Conoco special meeting if the
holders of a majority of the shares of Conoco common stock outstanding and
entitled to vote on the Conoco record date are present, in person or by proxy.
If a quorum is not present at the Conoco special meeting, we expect that the
Conoco special meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies. Holders
of record of Conoco common stock on the Conoco record date are entitled to one
vote per share at the Conoco special meeting on the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement.

VOTE REQUIRED

     The adoption of the merger agreement by Conoco stockholders requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares outstanding and
entitled to vote at the Conoco special meeting as of the Conoco record date,
either in person or by proxy, voting as a single class.

VOTING BY CONOCO DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

     At the close of business on the Conoco record date, Conoco directors and
executive officers owned and were entitled to vote less than [  ]% of the Conoco
common stock outstanding on that date. Each Conoco director and executive
officer has indicated his or her present intention to vote, or cause to be
voted, the Conoco common stock owned by him or her for the adoption of the
merger agreement.

VOTING OF PROXIES

     All shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for
the Conoco special meeting will be voted at the Conoco special meeting in the
manner specified by the stockholders giving those proxies. Properly executed
proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted for the adoption
of the merger agreement.

     In addition to manually executing and returning a proxy by mail, Conoco
stockholders may submit a proxy by telephone or over the Internet. If submitting
a proxy by telephone or over the Internet, the stockholder should dial the
toll-free number or access the Internet address, in each case, as indicated on

the stockholder's proxy card. The stockholder will then be prompted to enter the
control number printed on his or her proxy card and to follow the subsequent
instructions.

     Conoco common stock represented at the Conoco special meeting but not
voting, including Conoco common stock for which proxies have been received but
for which holders of shares have abstained, will be treated as present at the
Conoco special meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a
quorum for the transaction of all business.

     Only shares affirmatively voted for the adoption of the merger agreement,
including properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions,
will be counted as favorable votes for the proposal. AN ABSTENTION OR FAILURE TO
VOTE WILL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS A VOTE AGAINST THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER
AGREEMENT. Also, under New York Stock Exchange rules, brokers that hold shares
of Conoco common stock in street name for customers that are the beneficial
owners of those shares may not give a proxy to vote those shares without
specific instructions from those customers. If a Conoco stockholder owns shares
through a broker and attends the Conoco special meeting, the stockholder should
bring a letter from that stockholder's broker identifying that stockholder as
the beneficial owner of the shares and authorizing the stockholder to vote.

     The persons named as proxies by a Conoco stockholder may vote for one or
more adjournments of the Conoco special meeting, including adjournments to
permit further solicitations of proxies. No proxy voted against the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement will be voted in favor of any adjournment.

     Conoco does not expect that any matter other than the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement will be brought before the Conoco special meeting. If, however,
other matters are properly presented at the Conoco special meeting, the persons
named as proxies will vote in accordance with the recommendation of the Conoco
Board of Directors.

REVOCABILITY OF PROXIES

     Submitting a proxy on the enclosed form, by telephone or over the Internet
does not preclude a Conoco stockholder from voting in person at the Conoco
special meeting. A Conoco stockholder may revoke a proxy at any time before it
is voted by filing with Conoco a duly executed revocation of proxy, by
submitting a duly executed proxy or telephone or Internet proxy to Conoco with a
later date or by appearing at the Conoco special meeting and voting in person.
Conoco stockholders may revoke a proxy by any of these methods, regardless of
the method used to deliver a stockholder's previous proxy. Attendance at the
Conoco special meeting without voting will not itself revoke a proxy.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     Conoco and Phillips will share equally the expenses incurred in connection
with the printing and mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. In
addition to solicitation by mail, the directors, officers and employees of
Conoco and its subsidiaries, who will not be specially compensated, may solicit
proxies from Conoco stockholders by telephone or other electronic means or in
person. Arrangements will also be made with brokerage houses and other
custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the forwarding of solicitation
materials to the beneficial owners of shares held of record by these persons,
and Conoco will reimburse them for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

     Conoco will mail a copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to each
holder of record of Conoco common stock on the Conoco record date.

     You should not send in any Conoco share certificates with your proxy card.
A letter of transmittal with instructions for the surrender of your Conoco share
certificates will be mailed to you as soon as practicable after completion of
the merger.

     Conoco has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist in the
solicitation of proxies from banks, brokerage firms, nominees, institutional
holders and individual investors for a fee of $50,000 plus reimbursement for
expenses.

PROXIES FOR PARTICIPANTS IN CONOCO PLANS

     If you are a participant or eligible beneficiary in the Thrift Plan for
Employees of Conoco or the Thrift Plan for Retail Employees of Conoco, you will
receive combined voting instructions for those holdings in addition to the
voting instructions you will receive for your individual holdings. If you are a
record holder of Conoco common stock or a participant in any eligible stock
plans for employees outside the United States, you will receive a separate proxy
card for each of these holdings. Please complete, sign and mail all proxy cards
you receive, or submit a proxy for all of your holdings by telephone or over the
Internet, to ensure that all of your shares are represented at the Conoco
special meeting. An independent fiduciary for the thrift plans will direct the
voting, in its discretion, of all shares held in the thrift plans for which no
voting instructions are received by [     ], 2002.

and among Conoco, Phillips, New Parent, Corvette Merger Corp. and Porsche Merger
Corp., is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MERGER

       and

     - former Conoco stockholders will hold approximately 43.4%, and former
       Phillips stockholders will hold approximately 56.6%, of the outstanding
       shares of New Parent common stock.

BACKGROUND TO THE MERGER

     The oil and gas industry has experienced significant consolidation in
recent years. Beginning with the merger of British Petroleum and Amoco Corp. in
1998, the consolidation continued with the merger of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Oil
Corp. in 1999, the merger of Total Fina S.A. with Elf Aquitaine in 2000, the
acquisition of Atlantic Richfield Co. by BP Amoco p.l.c. in 2000, the merger of
Chevron Corporation and Texaco Inc. in 2001 and many smaller transactions.

     In June 2000, Archie W. Dunham, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief
Executive Officer of Conoco, contacted J.J. Mulva, Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer of Phillips, regarding a possible merger of equals of
the two companies. Several meetings and discussions ensued during the summer of
2000. In October 2000, Mr. Dunham proposed terms with respect to valuation,
board size and composition, headquarters' location, company name and transaction
structure. Mr. Dunham also proposed that he would serve as Chairman of the
Board, and that Mr. Mulva would serve as President and Chief Executive Officer,
of the combined company and that the two of them would be jointly responsible
for the selection, responsibilities, compensation and removal of the executive
officers, management structure, long-range plans, major acquisitions and
divestitures and major capital structure changes. However, Conoco and Phillips
could not reach agreement on key terms and discussions were terminated in late
October.

     Following the termination of talks between Conoco and Phillips, each of
Conoco and Phillips pursued alternative strategies to grow and increase
shareholder value. Conoco acquired Gulf Canada Resources Limited in July 2001,
and Phillips integrated Atlantic Richfield Co.'s Alaska production assets that
Phillips had acquired in April 2000 and acquired Tosco Corporation in September
2001.

     Following its acquisition of Tosco, Phillips again examined a number of
potential strategic business opportunities in the upstream sector. Based on
management analyses, the Phillips Board of Directors concluded that a business
combination with Conoco presented the best strategic opportunity for Phillips
and its stockholders.

     On September 10, 2001, at its regular meeting, the Phillips Board of
Directors authorized Mr. Mulva to contact Mr. Dunham to initiate a discussion
about a possible business combination between Phillips and Conoco.

     Later in the week of September 10, 2001, Mr. Mulva's office contacted Mr.
Dunham's office and a meeting between Messrs. Dunham and Mulva was scheduled for
September 28, 2001.

     On September 28, Mr. Dunham and Mr. Mulva met in Oklahoma City. At that
meeting Mr. Mulva outlined his proposal for a business combination. Mr. Mulva
also proposed that the selection of other executive officers for the combined
company be from the existing executives of Conoco and Phillips on the basis of
merit and that the name of the combined company be determined later. Mr. Dunham
and Mr. Mulva also discussed possible headquarters and other significant
locations for the combined company.

     On October 8, 2001, at the regular meeting of the Phillips Board of
Directors, Mr. Mulva reported on his meeting with Mr. Dunham. The Phillips Board
of Directors authorized Mr. Mulva to continue to negotiate the terms of a
possible merger of equals with Mr. Dunham. Throughout the period from October 3
through November 17, Mr. Mulva had regular telephone conversations with the
members of the Phillips Board of Directors, advising them of the status of the
merger discussions.

     On October 8, 2001, Mr. Dunham met with the Conoco Executive Committee and
discussed the possibility of a combination with Phillips on terms comparable to
those proposed by Mr. Dunham in October of 2000. The Executive Committee was
supportive of continued discussions.

     On October 11, 2001, Mr. Dunham and Mr. Mulva had a follow-up conversation
by telephone in which they further discussed the proposals made by Mr. Mulva at
their meeting on September 28, 2001, and agreed to meet in Houston on October
16, 2001.

     On October 16, 2001, Mr. Dunham and Mr. Mulva met in Houston to discuss
each company's vision, strategies, long-range objectives, values and culture. At
the conclusion of that meeting, Messrs. Dunham and Mulva agreed that the general
counsels of each company should meet to discuss certain matters relating to
Phillips' recent acquisition of Tosco about which Mr. Dunham and his management
team wished to be better informed before proceeding further with the merger
discussions.

     On October 19, 2001, Rick A. Harrington, Senior Vice President and General
Counsel of Conoco, and J. Bryan Whitworth, Executive Vice President, General
Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer of Phillips met in New York. At that
meeting Messrs. Harrington and Whitworth, assisted by other members of the
management of each company, discussed Phillips' recent acquisition of Tosco. In
addition, Messrs. Harrington and Whitworth, together with Conoco's and Phillips'
respective legal advisors, also discussed Conoco's recent acquisition of Gulf
Canada and various structuring and timetable issues with respect to a potential
transaction.

     On October 24, 2001, Mr. Dunham and Mr. Mulva spoke again by telephone and
determined that they were satisfied with the reports received on the meeting
between their general counsels. Mr. Dunham informed Mr. Mulva that he would
discuss the proposed combination of Conoco and Phillips at the upcoming meeting
of the Conoco Board of Directors on October 30 and agreed to meet again with Mr.
Mulva on November 1, 2001, if the Conoco Board of Directors was favorably
disposed toward proceeding to negotiate a transaction.

     During the meeting of the Conoco Board of Directors on October 30, 2001,
Mr. Dunham reported on his discussions with Mr. Mulva regarding the merger. The
Conoco Board of Directors authorized Conoco's management to continue to
negotiate the terms of a possible merger of equals with Phillips.

     On November 1, 2001, Mr. Dunham and Mr. Mulva met again in Houston. At that
meeting Mr. Dunham made a proposal for valuing the two companies and proposed
naming the combined company "ConocoPhillips." Mr. Dunham agreed that he would
delay his retirement in order to serve as Chairman, and that Mr. Mulva would
serve as President and Chief Executive Officer, of the combined company. Messrs.
Dunham and Mulva further discussed the appropriate division of their roles and
responsibilities as Chairman and President and Chief Executive Officer,
respectively, of the combined company.

     On November 2, 2001, at the instruction of Mr. Whitworth, Phillips' legal
advisors sent a draft of a merger agreement to Conoco's legal advisors. Conoco
and Phillips and their respective legal advisors began negotiating the merger
agreement and other documents related to the proposed transaction on November 5,
2001 and negotiations continued through November 17, 2001.

     On November 4, 2001, Mr. Dunham and Mr. Mulva again spoke by telephone.
They agreed that the valuation of the two companies should be based on the
average trading price of each company's common stock for the 20 trading days
prior to signing the merger agreement. They also further discussed the
governance arrangements for the combined company and agreed that Messrs.
Harrington and Whitworth should propose language on this subject to be
incorporated in the by-laws of the combined company and in the employment
agreements to be entered into in connection with the proposed transaction. Mr.
Dunham and Mr. Mulva agreed that the headquarters of the combined company would
be in Houston but that the company would maintain a significant and continuing
presence in Oklahoma. They also discussed procedural matters, including a
timetable for the proposed transaction.

     On November 6, 2001, Conoco and Phillips entered into a mutual
confidentiality agreement governing the exchange of confidential information
during each company's due diligence review of the other.

     Beginning November 7, 2001, a team of Conoco managers led by Philip L.
Frederickson, Conoco's Senior Vice President for Corporate Strategy and Business
Development, and a team of Phillips' managers led by John E. Lowe, Phillips'
Senior Vice President, Planning and Strategic Transactions, and John A. Carrig,
Phillips' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, met in New York to
discuss financial and accounting issues and potential synergies arising from
combining the two companies.

     On November 9, 2001, Conoco retained Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and
Phillips retained Goldman, Sachs & Co., as their respective financial advisors.
On November 14, 2001, Conoco also retained Salomon Smith Barney Inc. and Credit
Suisse First Boston Corporation as its financial advisors and Phillips also
retained J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated as its financial advisors.

     On November 11 and 12, 2001, teams of Conoco and Phillips management held a
series of meetings in New York to discuss the operations of the various business
units of their respective companies and to exchange due diligence materials
covering the major business units of each company. Management representatives
from each company's human resources, legal, finance and accounting, and health,
safety and environmental organizations also met to exchange due diligence
materials. Following these meetings, the companies continued to discuss
financial and accounting issues and to perform further due diligence on each
other.

     On November 11 and 12, 2001, Mr. Mulva and Mr. Dunham again spoke by
telephone. In these conversations, each expressed satisfaction with the progress
of the meetings between their respective management teams and each agreed that
they would present the final terms of the transaction for consideration by their
respective boards at special meetings to be scheduled for the coming weekend.

     On November 13, 2001, as contemplated by the Tax Sharing Agreement, dated
as of October 27, 1998, by and among E. I. Du Pont de Nemours and Company and
Conoco, entered into at the time of Du Pont's divestiture of Conoco, Conoco
delivered to Du Pont tax opinions of its and Phillips' legal advisors regarding
the effect of the proposed business combination between Conoco and Phillips on
the tax treatment of the split-off by Du Pont of its investment in Conoco in
August 1999 under Section 355 of the Code. On November 16, 2001, Du Pont advised
Conoco that the foregoing opinions were acceptable to it. As a result of Du
Pont's acceptance of the tax opinions, Conoco complied with the conditions
precedent in the Tax Sharing Agreement to its entry into the merger agreement
with Phillips.

     On November 16, 2001 the Conoco Board of Directors held a special meeting
in Houston at which Conoco's senior management and its financial and legal
advisors were present. Senior management made presentations on the background
and strategic rationale for the proposed combination with Phillips. Morgan
Stanley made a presentation on the financial aspects of the transaction, and
Conoco's legal advisors reviewed the terms of the proposed merger agreement and
the proposed governance of the combined company and discussed various legal and
regulatory issues relating to the proposed combination. Members of the Conoco
compensation committee shared the highlights of their discussions regarding, and
stated their support for, the new employment agreement and compensation
arrangements that Conoco and New Parent would enter into with Mr. Dunham.
Following further discussion, the Conoco Board of

Directors agreed to meet again on November 18 for further deliberation by the
directors, pending the outcome of the special meeting of the Phillips Board of
Directors scheduled for November 17, 2001.

     On November 17, 2001, the Phillips Board of Directors held a special
meeting in New York at which Phillips' senior management and its financial and
legal advisors were present. Senior management made presentations on the
background and strategic rationale for the proposed combination with Conoco. On
behalf of all three financial advisors, Goldman Sachs made a presentation on the
financial aspects of the transaction. Each of the three financial advisors
delivered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing on November 18,
2001, that the exchange ratio of one share of New Parent common stock for each
share of Phillips common stock relative to the exchange ratio of 0.4677 of a
share of New Parent common stock for each share of Conoco common stock, was fair
from a financial point of view to the holders of Phillips common stock.
Phillips' legal advisor reviewed with the Phillips Board of Directors the terms
of the proposed merger agreement and the fiduciary duties of the Phillips Board
of Directors. The Phillips Board of Directors also discussed the employment
agreement and compensation arrangements that Conoco and New Parent would enter
into with Mr. Dunham and discussed and approved the employment agreement and
other compensation arrangements that Phillips and New Parent would enter into
with Mr. Mulva. Following further discussion, the Phillips Board of Directors
unanimously determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by that agreement are advisable, fair to and in the
best interests of Phillips and its stockholders, unanimously approved the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by that agreement and unanimously
recommended that the merger agreement be adopted by the holders of Phillips
common stock.

     On the evening of November 17, 2001, Phillips and Conoco and their
respective legal advisors finalized the merger agreement and related documents.

     On November 18, a special meeting of the Conoco Board of Directors was
held. At that meeting, Morgan Stanley and Conoco's legal advisors updated the
Conoco Board of Directors on developments regarding the exchange ratio, the
terms of the merger agreement and other matters. In addition, Morgan Stanley
delivered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, and Salomon Smith
Barney delivered its written opinion that the exchange ratio of 0.4677 shares of
New Parent common stock for each share of Conoco common stock was fair from a
financial point of view to the holders of Conoco common stock. The Conoco Board
of Directors also discussed the employment agreement and compensation
arrangements that Conoco and New Parent would enter into with Mr. Dunham.
Following further discussion, the Conoco Board of Directors unanimously
determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by that agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests
of Conoco and its stockholders, approved the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by that agreement and recommended that the merger
agreement be adopted by the holders of Conoco common stock and unanimously
approved the terms of the employment agreement and compensation arrangements
that Conoco and New Parent would enter into with Mr. Dunham.

     On November 18, 2001, the definitive agreements providing for the merger
were executed. That afternoon Conoco and Phillips issued a joint press release
announcing the transaction.

REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     The Conoco Board of Directors and the Phillips Board of Directors believe
that the complementary strategies of Conoco and Phillips, in combination with
their management, personnel, technical expertise and financial strength, will
create a company with capabilities and resources better positioned to succeed
and grow in the new competitive energy marketplace.

     We believe the merger joins two well-managed companies, providing
substantial strategic and financial benefits to Conoco stockholders and Phillips
stockholders. The benefits are expected to include:

     - Expanded Scope and Scale to Succeed as a Major Integrated Oil Company in
      the Changing Marketplace.  We believe that the combined company should
      create significant additional value for our stockholders and accelerate
      our growth from a strong financial and operational position.

      In the upstream segment, the combined company's global scale and presence
      will allow for increased efficiency in core areas and delivery of legacy
      growth projects. The combined company will have pro forma hydrocarbon
      reserves at December 31, 2000 of 8.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent, or
      BOE, and daily production of 1.7 million BOE, based on Conoco's and
      Phillips' estimates for 2001 year-end production. The combined company
      will have numerous assets capable of long-term production, including those
      in Alaska, Canada, the Lower 48, the North Sea, Venezuela, Indonesia,
      Vietnam, China, the Timor Sea, the Middle East, Russia and the Caspian
      area.

      In the refining and marketing segment, the combined company will operate
      or have equity interests in 19 refineries in the United States, the United
      Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, the Czech Republic and Malaysia, with a
      refining capacity of 2.6 million barrels a day. It will also have a strong
      marketing presence in the United States.

      In addition to maintaining Conoco's midstream natural gas business in the
      United States, Canada and Trinidad, the combined company will continue
      Phillips' equity participation in the natural gas gathering and processing
      joint venture, Duke Energy Field Services. The combined company will also
      continue Phillips' equity participation in the chemicals and plastics
      joint venture, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company.

     - Strategic Fit and Compatibility.  We believe that the combination creates
      an extraordinary set of complementary capabilities, drawing on the
      talented management and core competencies of both Conoco and Phillips.
      Conoco and Phillips bring together a long history of technological
      innovation and leadership. The merger creates the opportunity to further
      apply our capabilities across a much broader asset base. As a result of
      the merger, the combined company will have numerous legacy asset positions
      in upstream areas, including those in Alaska, Canada, the lower 48 states,
      the North Sea, Venezuela, China, the Timor Sea, Indonesia, Vietnam, the
      Middle East, Russia and the Caspian area, and will become a global player
      in refining and marketing with operations in North America, Europe and
      Southeast Asia. We also will have a much broader platform for future
      growth in the Middle East, the Caspian Sea, West Africa and Russia. In
      addition, the combined company will inherit Conoco's and Phillips' shared
      core values and our commitment to safety, environmental responsibility,
      maintenance of the highest ethical standards and valuing our employees.

     - Strong Financial Position.  We believe that the combined company will
      have strong and stable earnings and cash flow as a result of its
      outstanding portfolio diversification and a larger relative presence in
      more politically stable regions of the world. The diversified portfolio
      base also will allow the combined company to optimize and high grade our
      portfolio assets to enhance the future returns from our capital
      investments. In addition, the combined company will have a strong balance
      sheet, with an expected debt-to-capitalization ratio of approximately 35
      percent.

     - Cost Savings.  We expect the combined company to achieve annual cost
      savings of at least $750 million within the first full year after the
      completion of the merger. These savings are expected to result from more
      efficient exploration, production and downstream activities, and the
      elimination of duplicate corporate and administrative positions, programs
      and operating offices. A transition team led by Philip L. Frederickson,
      Conoco's Senior Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Business
      Development, and John E. Lowe, Phillips' Senior Vice President, Corporate
      Strategy and Development, is already at work to ensure that integration
      and synergy realization occurs quickly and smoothly.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE CONOCO BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     At its meeting on November 18, 2001, after due consideration, the Conoco
Board of Directors unanimously:

     - determined that it was advisable for Conoco to enter into the merger
       agreement and that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
       by the merger agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests
       of Conoco stockholders;

     - approved the merger agreement; and

     - recommended that Conoco stockholders vote for the adoption of the merger
       agreement.

     In approving the merger agreement and making these determinations and
recommendations, the Conoco Board of Directors consulted with Conoco management
as well as its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and considered a
number of factors.

     The Conoco Board of Directors considered the following positive factors
relating to the merger:

     - the benefits of the merger described above;

     - the expectation that the merger would be immediately accretive to Conoco
       stockholders based on consensus security analyst earnings estimates and
       the achievement of anticipated synergies;

     - the expectation that the merger would be a tax-free transaction for U.S.
       federal income tax purposes and the conversion of the Conoco common stock
       would be tax free to Conoco stockholders;

     - anticipated synergies from the transaction of $750 million per year
       resulting in cost savings and other benefits over time;

     - the effect of the merger on the capital structure and financial ratios of
       Conoco;

     - the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, one of which provides
       the Conoco Board of Directors the right to terminate the merger agreement
       prior to its approval by Conoco stockholders in the exercise of its
       fiduciary duty in connection with a superior proposal, subject to the
       termination fees payable by Conoco in that event;

     - the proposed composition of the New Parent Board of Directors, that
       Archie W. Dunham, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Conoco, would
       be the Chairman of the New Parent Board of Directors and that J. J.
       Mulva, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Phillips, would be
       President and Chief Executive Officer of New Parent;

     - the provisions included in the New Parent organizational documents that
       ensure that the chairman and chief executive officer positions cannot be
       changed for a certain period of time without a supermajority vote of the
       New Parent Board of Directors, and that the "ConocoPhillips" name cannot
       be changed without a supermajority vote of New Parent stockholders and
       the unanimous approval of the New Parent Board of Directors;

     - the analysis and presentation of Morgan Stanley, and the opinion of
       Morgan Stanley delivered orally on November 18, 2001, and subsequently
       confirmed in writing, and the written opinion of Salomon Smith Barney
       dated November 18, 2001, to the effect that, as of the date of each
       opinion, and subject to and based on the considerations set forth in each
       opinion, the exchange ratio applicable to Conoco stockholders in the
       merger is fair from a financial point of view to the holders of Conoco
       common stock (the written opinions of Morgan Stanley and Salomon Smith
       Barney are attached as Annexes D and E, respectively, to this joint proxy
       statement/prospectus); and

     - the potential benefits to Conoco's employees from the expanded
       opportunities available as part of a larger organization.

     The Conoco Board of Directors considered the following negative factors
relating to the merger:

     - the problems inherent in merging the operations of two large companies,
       including the possibility that management may be distracted from regular
       business concerns by the need to integrate operations, unforeseen
       difficulties in integrating operations and systems, problems assimilating
       and retaining employees, and potential adverse short-term effects on
       operating results of the combined company; and

     - the timing of receipt and the terms of approvals from appropriate
       government entities, including the possibility of delay in obtaining
       satisfactory approvals or the imposition of unfavorable terms or
       conditions in the approvals.

     The Conoco Board of Directors also considered the following factors
relating to the merger:

     - the fact that the headquarters of New Parent will be in Houston, Texas,
       and that New Parent would have a significant and continuing presence in
       Oklahoma;

     - the review and analysis of each of Conoco's and Phillips' business,
       financial condition, earnings, risks and prospects;

     - the historical market prices and trading information with respect to the
       shares of Conoco common stock and Phillips common stock;

     - the comparisons of historical financial measures for Conoco and Phillips,
       including earnings, return on capital and cash flow, and comparisons of
       historical operational measures for Conoco and Phillips;

     - current industry, economic and market conditions, and the prospects of
       further restructuring and consolidation in the oil and gas industry;

     - the interests that certain Conoco executive officers and directors may
       have with respect to the merger in addition to their interests as Conoco
       stockholders; and

     - the feasibility and desirability of pursuing alternative strategies,
       including pursuing growth and increased stockholder value through
       acquisitions, such as the acquisition of Gulf Canada.

     The Conoco Board of Directors believed that, overall, the potential
benefits of the merger to Conoco and Conoco stockholders outweighed the risks.

     This discussion of the information and factors considered by the Conoco
Board of Directors in making its decision is not intended to be exhaustive but
includes all material factors considered by the Conoco Board of Directors. In
view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation
of the merger and the complexity of these matters, the Conoco Board of Directors
did not find it useful to, and did not attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise
assign relative weights to these factors. In addition, individual members of the
Conoco Board of Directors may have given different weight to different factors.

     THE CONOCO BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT HOLDERS OF CONOCO
COMMON STOCK VOTE FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

       each share of Phillips common stock relative to the exchange ratio of

  FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF MORGAN STANLEY

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by
Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the preparation of its
written opinion. These summaries of financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses
used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses.

     Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis.  Morgan Stanley compared the daily
closing share price of Conoco common stock to the daily closing price of
Phillips common stock during the period beginning from July 13, 1999 and ending
November 14, 2001, and reviewed and analyzed the historical exchange ratios
implied by these comparisons.

     Morgan Stanley also compared both the daily closing share price of Conoco
common stock to the corresponding price of Phillips common stock and the daily
last twenty-day average of Conoco common stock to the corresponding average of
Phillips common stock over various periods beginning from November 14, 2000 and
ending November 14, 2001, and reviewed and analyzed the historical exchange
ratios implied by these comparisons. The following table presents the implied
exchange ratios during the periods covered and as of November 14, 2001.

average of Conoco and Phillips common stock as of November 16, 2001, and Morgan
Stanley, for purposes of its opinion, reviewed Conoco's and Phillips' stock
prices until November 14, 2001, Morgan Stanley also analyzed the sensitivity to
the actual exchange ratio on November 16, 2001, by examining independently both
Conoco's and Phillips' stock price movements for November 15 and 16, 2001.

     Historical Share Price Performance.  Morgan Stanley reviewed the price
performance of Conoco common stock and Phillips common stock from July 13, 1999
through November 14, 2001. Morgan Stanley also reviewed the price performance of
Conoco common stock and Phillips common stock from January 1, 2001 through

     Research Analysts' Future Price Targets Analysis.  Morgan Stanley reviewed
the 12-month price targets for the shares of common stock of each of Conoco and
Phillips as projected by analysts from various financial institutions in recent
reports. These targets reflected each analyst's estimate of the future public
market trading price of Conoco common stock and Phillips common stock at the end
of the particular period considered for each estimate. Morgan Stanley then
arrived at the present value for these targets using an estimated equity
discount rate of 10.0%.

     This analysis showed the following range of values for Conoco common stock
and Phillips common stock:

The range of exchange ratios implied by this range of values for Conoco common
stock and Phillips common stock is 0.389x to 0.709x.

     Comparable Companies Analysis.  Morgan Stanley calculated aggregate value,
as equity value adjusted for capital structure, to earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, amortization and exploration cost, which is referred to as
EBITDAX, multiples for Conoco and Phillips for the fiscal year 2002 based on
First Call consensus estimates. Morgan Stanley then compared the EBITDAX
multiples obtained for Conoco and Phillips with multiples obtained for a group
of selected oil and gas companies.

     The selected oil and gas companies forming such group were ExxonMobil, BP,
ChevronTexaco, Royal Dutch Shell, Occidental, Amerada Hess and Marathon, which
is referred to as the Selected Companies. Morgan Stanley selected these
companies because they are publicly traded companies with integrated oil and gas
operations that for purposes of this analysis may be considered similar to those
of Conoco and Phillips.

     The analysis showed the following multiples:

                                                              AGGREGATE VALUE/

     Morgan Stanley then applied comparable company multiples (ranging between
4.0x and 5.0x for 2001 Aggregate Value/EBITDAX and between 4.5x and 5.5x for
2002 Aggregate Value/EBITDAX) to the corresponding Conoco and Phillips
statistics based on publicly available estimates. The following table presents
the range of exchange ratios implied by the resulting valuation ranges as
computed by Morgan Stanley.

     Pro Forma Contribution Analysis.  Morgan Stanley compared the pro forma
contributions of each of Conoco and Phillips, based on First Call consensus
estimates, to the resulting combined company. Morgan Stanley reviewed pro forma
estimates of earnings, cash flow and EBITDAX for the years 2001 and 2002. The
contributions made by Conoco and Phillips are consistent with the relative
exchange ratios offered in the merger.

     Morgan Stanley also reviewed the contributions of the pre-transaction
aggregate value, the pre-transaction equity value, and proved reserves based on
2000 reported figures. The contributions made by Conoco and Phillips are
consistent with the relative exchange ratios offered in the merger.

     Pro Forma Earnings and Cash Flow Impact Analysis.  Morgan Stanley analyzed
the pro forma effects of the merger and computed the resulting
accretion/dilution to the combined company's projected earnings per share and
cash flow per share during 2002 and 2003, based on the relative exchange ratios
offered in the merger. Such computations used earnings and cash flow projections
for both Conoco and Phillips based on First Call consensus estimates, synergy
estimates provided by Conoco's and Phillips' management, and certain purchase
accounting adjustments.

     The analysis indicated that, based on First Call estimates, the merger
would be accretive to estimated earnings per share in 2002 and 2003 of both
Conoco and Phillips, in each case as compared to the same estimates for Conoco
and Phillips on a stand-alone basis. Based on First Call estimates, the merger
would also be accretive to cashflow per share for Conoco and Phillips in 2002,
and for Conoco in 2003, in each case as compared to the same estimates for
Conoco and Phillips on a stand-alone basis.

     Morgan Stanley also analyzed the directional impact on pro forma
accretion/dilution to EPS in 2002, 2003 and 2004, for Conoco and Phillips, based
on movements in crude oil prices, natural gas prices and light-oil spreads.
Relative to First Call crude oil price estimates, an increase in the estimated
price of crude oil reduces the accretion to EPS of both Conoco and Phillips in
2002. Any such increase would reduce accretion to EPS of Conoco to a greater
degree than it would reduce accretion to EPS of Phillips. Under certain higher
crude oil price scenarios, the transaction could be dilutive to Conoco's
stand-alone estimated 2002 EPS. Relative to First Call crude oil price
estimates, an increase in the expected crude oil price slightly increases the
level of accretion to EPS for Phillips in 2003 and 2004, and reduces the level
of accretion to EPS for Conoco in 2003 and 2004.

     Relative to First Call natural gas price estimates, an increase in the
expected natural gas price increases the accretion to Phillips stand-alone
estimated EPS and decreases the accretion to Conoco's estimated stand-alone EPS
for 2002, 2003 and 2004. Under certain higher natural gas price scenarios, the
transaction could be dilutive in 2002 to Conoco's estimated stand-alone EPS and,
under certain lower natural gas price scenarios, the transaction could be
dilutive in 2003 to Phillips' estimated stand-alone EPS.

     Relative to First Call light-oil spread estimates, an increase in the
expected light-oil spread reduces the accretion to Phillips stand-alone
estimated EPS and increases the accretion to Conoco's estimated stand-alone EPS
for 2002, 2003 and 2004. Under certain lower light-oil spread scenarios, the
transaction could be dilutive to Conoco's estimated stand-alone EPS in 2002 and,
under certain higher light-oil spread scenarios, the transaction could be
dilutive to Phillips estimated stand-alone EPS in 2003.

     Potential Synergy Analysis.  Morgan Stanley compared the potential
synergies of this transaction to seven other recent business combinations in the
oil and gas industry. These transactions are: the Chevron/

Texaco transaction, the TOTALFina/Elf transaction, the Repsol/YPF transaction,
the BP Amoco/ARCO transaction, the Total/Petrofina transaction, the Exxon/Mobil
transaction and the BP/Amoco transaction. The following table presents the
potential synergies of these transactions relative to various statistics.

(1) Based on average of preliminary estimates provided by Conoco and Phillips
    prior to the finalization of their synergy review.

     In connection with the review of the merger by the Conoco Board of
Directors, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative
analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness
opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley
considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute
any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it. Furthermore,
Morgan Stanley believes that the summary provided and the analyses described
above must be considered as a whole and that selecting any portion of its
analyses, without considering all of them, would create an incomplete view of
the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may
have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses
and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than
other assumptions, so that the ranges of valuations resulting from any
particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley's
view of the actual value of Conoco or Phillips.

     In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business and economic condition and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Conoco or Phillips. Any
estimates contained in Morgan Stanley's analyses are not necessarily indicative
of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by such estimates. The analyses performed were
prepared solely as part of Morgan Stanley's analysis of the fairness from a
financial point of view to the Conoco stockholders, of the relative exchange
ratios pursuant to the merger agreement, and were prepared in connection with
the delivery by Morgan Stanley of its opinion dated November 18, 2001 to the
Conoco Board of Directors. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which Conoco common stock or Phillips common stock might
actually trade. The exchange ratio and other terms of the merger agreement were
determined through arm's length negotiations between Conoco and Phillips and
were unanimously approved by the Conoco Board of Directors. Morgan Stanley
provided advice to Conoco during such negotiations. However, Morgan Stanley did
not recommend any specific exchange ratio or form of consideration to Conoco or
that any specific exchange ratio or form of consideration constituted the only
appropriate consideration for the merger.

     Morgan Stanley's opinion was one of the many factors taken into
consideration by the Conoco Board of Directors in making its unanimous
determination to approve the merger. Morgan Stanley's analyses summarized above
should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Conoco Board of
Directors

with respect to the value of Conoco or Phillips or of whether the Conoco Board
of Directors would have been willing to agree to a different exchange ratio or
form of consideration.

  OPINION OF SALOMON SMITH BARNEY

     Salomon Smith Barney delivered its written opinion dated November 18, 2001,
to the Conoco Board of Directors to the effect that, as of such date, based upon
and subject to the considerations and limitations set forth in its opinion, the
exchange ratio under the merger agreement applicable to each share of Conoco
common stock is fair from a financial point of view to the holders of Conoco
common stock. In its analysis of this exchange ratio, Salomon Smith Barney took
into account, among other considerations set forth in its opinion, the exchange
ratio of one share of New Parent common stock for each share of Phillips common
stock in the merger.

     THE FULL TEXT OF THE SALOMON SMITH BARNEY FAIRNESS OPINION, WHICH SETS
FORTH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, THE GENERAL PROCEDURES
FOLLOWED, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND LIMITS ON THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY SALOMON
SMITH BARNEY IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX E TO THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS.
THE SUMMARY OF SALOMON SMITH BARNEY'S OPINION SET FORTH BELOW IS QUALIFIED IN
ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF THE OPINION. CONOCO STOCKHOLDERS
ARE URGED TO READ THIS OPINION CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE FAIRNESS
OPINION WAS PROVIDED TO THE CONOCO BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR ITS INFORMATION AND IS
DIRECTED ONLY TO THE FAIRNESS FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW OF THE EXCHANGE
RATIO PURSUANT TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT TO THE HOLDERS OF CONOCO COMMON STOCK.

     In connection with its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney, among other things:

     - reviewed a draft of the merger agreement dated November 16, 2001;

     - discussed with certain senior officers, directors and other
       representatives and advisors of both Conoco and Phillips the business,
       operations and prospects of Conoco, Phillips and New Parent;

     - examined certain publicly available business and financial information
       relating to Conoco and Phillips;

     - examined certain financial forecasts and other information and data
       concerning Conoco, Phillips and New Parent provided to or discussed with
       Salomon Smith Barney the respective management of Conoco and Phillips;

     - reviewed and discussed with the managements of Conoco and Phillips
       certain strategic, operational and financial benefits that they
       anticipate will result from the merger;

     - conducted such other analyses and considered such other information and
       financial, economic and market criteria as deemed appropriate.

     In rendering its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney assumed and relied, without
independent verification, upon the accuracy and completeness of all financial
and other information and data publicly available or furnished to or reviewed by
or discussed with it for the purposes of its opinion and it further relied upon
the assurances of managements of Conoco and Phillips that they are not aware of
any facts that would make any of that information inaccurate or misleading. With
respect to financial forecasts and other information and data provided to or
otherwise reviewed by it, Salomon Smith Barney relied on the advice of the
managements of Conoco and Phillips that such forecasts and other information and
data were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of the respective management of Conoco and Phillips as
to the future performance of Conoco, Phillips and New Parent and the strategic
implications and operational and financial benefits anticipated to result from
the merger. Salomon Smith Barney expressed no view with respect to such
forecasts and other information and data or the assumptions on which they were
based. Salomon Smith Barney did not make, nor was Salomon Smith Barney furnished
with, any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of
Conoco, Phillips or New Parent. Salomon Smith Barney's opinion relates to the
relative value of Conoco and Phillips. Salomon Smith Barney did not express any
opinion as to what the value of New Parent common stock will be when issued
pursuant to the merger or the price at which the New Parent

common stock will trade or otherwise be transferable subsequent to the merger.
Salomon Smith Barney was not asked to consider, and its opinion does not
address, the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative
business strategies that might exist for the company or the effect of any other
transaction in which Conoco might engage. Salomon Smith Barney assumed that the
merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax
purposes and that the final terms of the merger agreement will not vary
materially from those set forth in the draft merger agreement delivered to it
and that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the
merger agreement, without waiver of any material conditions contained in the
merger agreement. The opinion of Salomon Smith Barney is necessarily based on
information available to it and financial, stock market and other conditions and
circumstances existing and disclosed to it as of November 18, 2001. Salomon
Smith Barney did not make a presentation to the Conoco Board of Directors in
connection with rendering its fairness opinion. Salomon Smith Barney did not

rendering its fairness opinion.

     SALOMON SMITH BARNEY'S ADVISORY SERVICES AND ITS OPINION EXPRESSED HEREIN
WERE PROVIDED FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE CONOCO BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN ITS
EVALUATION OF THE MERGER AND SALOMON SMITH BARNEY'S OPINION IS NOT INTENDED TO
BE AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION OF THE MERGER TO THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS, CONOCO OR TO ANYONE ELSE OR A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY CONOCO
STOCKHOLDER AS TO HOW SUCH STOCKHOLDER SHOULD VOTE ON ANY MATTERS RELATING TO
THE MERGER.

  GENERAL

     The Conoco Board of Directors selected each of Morgan Stanley, Salomon
Smith Barney and Credit Suisse First Boston as its financial advisor because of
their respective reputations as internationally recognized investment banking
and advisory firms with substantial experience in transactions similar to the
merger and because each of Morgan Stanley, Salomon Smith Barney and Credit
Suisse First Boston is familiar with Conoco and its business. As part of its
investment banking and financial advisory business, each of Morgan Stanley,
Salomon Smith Barney and Credit Suisse First Boston is engaged in the valuation
of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of
listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate
and other purposes.

     Each of Morgan Stanley, Salomon Smith Barney and Credit Suisse First Boston
provides a full range of financial advisory, financing, and brokerage services
and, in the course of its normal trading and brokerage activities, may from time
to time effect transactions and hold positions in securities, including
derivative securities, or loans of Conoco or Phillips for its own accounts and
for the accounts of its customers. Each of Morgan Stanley, Salomon Smith Barney
and Credit Suisse First Boston also may provide investment banking services to
New Parent and its subsidiaries in the future.

     Under the terms of separate letter agreements dated November 16, 2001,
November 14, 2001 and November 14, 2001, Conoco has agreed to pay each of Morgan
Stanley, Salomon Smith Barney and Credit Suisse First Boston a customary fee
upon consummation of the merger. Conoco has also agreed to reimburse each of
Morgan Stanley, Salomon Smith Barney and Credit Suisse First Boston for its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the engagement,
including attorney's fees, and to indemnify each of Morgan Stanley, Salomon
Smith Barney and Credit Suisse First Boston and their respective related parties
from and against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal
securities laws.

date of each opinion, the exchange ratio of one share of New Parent common stock
for each share of Phillips common stock relative to the exchange ratio of 0.4677
of a share

of New Parent common stock for each share of Conoco common stock pursuant to the
merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of
Phillips common stock.

  OPINION OF GOLDMAN SACHS

     In connection with its opinion, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:

     - the merger agreement;

     - Annual Reports to Stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of
       Phillips for the five years ended December 31, 2000;

     - Annual Reports to Stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Conoco
       for the three years ended December 31, 2000;

     - certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form
       10-Q of Phillips and Conoco;

     - certain other communications from Phillips and Conoco to their respective
       stockholders; and

     - certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Phillips and Conoco
       prepared by their respective managements, including certain cost savings
       and operating synergies projected by the managements of Phillips and
       Conoco to result from the transaction contemplated by the merger
       agreement.

     Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior managements
of Phillips and Conoco regarding their assessment of the strategic rationale
for, and the potential benefits of, the transaction contemplated by the merger
agreement and the past and current business operations, financial condition, and
future prospects of their respective companies. In addition, Goldman Sachs:

     - reviewed the reported price and trading activity for Phillips common
       stock and Conoco common stock;

     - compared certain financial and stock market information for Phillips and
       Conoco with similar information for certain other companies, the
       securities of which are publicly traded; and

     - reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in
       the oil and gas industry specifically and in other industries generally,
       and performed such other studies and analyses as it considered
       appropriate.

     Goldman Sachs relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial, accounting and other information discussed with or reviewed by it and
assumed such accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering its opinion. In
that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent of the Phillips Board of
Directors that the internal financial forecasts prepared by the managements of
Phillips and Conoco, including certain cost savings and operating synergies
projected by the managements of Phillips and Conoco to result from the
transaction contemplated by the merger agreement, were reasonably prepared on a
basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of
Phillips and Conoco. In addition, Goldman Sachs did not make an independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities of Phillips or Conoco or
any of their subsidiaries, and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such
evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs also assumed that all governmental,
regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the
transaction contemplated by the merger

agreement will be obtained without any adverse effect on Phillips or Conoco or
their respective subsidiaries or on the contemplated benefits of the transaction
contemplated by the merger agreement in any respect material to Goldman Sachs'
analysis. Goldman Sachs did not express any opinion as to the price at which New
Parent common stock will trade if and when such New Parent common stock is
issued.

  OPINION OF JPMORGAN

     In arriving at its opinion, JPMorgan:

     - reviewed the merger agreement;

     - reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
       concerning Phillips and Conoco and the industries in which they operate;

     - compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the publicly
       available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies
       JPMorgan deemed relevant and the consideration received for such
       companies;

     - compared the financial and operating performance of Phillips and Conoco
       with publicly available information concerning certain other companies
       JPMorgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market
       prices of Phillips common stock and Conoco common stock and certain
       publicly traded securities of such other companies;

     - reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by
       the managements of Phillips and Conoco relating to their respective
       businesses, as well as the estimated amount and timing of the cost
       savings and related expenses and synergies expected to result from the
       merger; and

     - performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such
       other information as JPMorgan deemed appropriate for the purposes of its
       opinion.

     In addition, JPMorgan held discussions with certain members of the
managements of Phillips and Conoco with respect to certain aspects of the
merger, and the past and current business operations of Phillips and Conoco, the
financial condition and future prospects and operations of Phillips and Conoco,
the effects of the merger, including the cost savings and related expenses and
synergies expected to result from the merger, on the financial condition and
future prospects of Phillips and Conoco, and certain other matters JPMorgan
believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.

     In giving its opinion, JPMorgan relied upon and assumed, without any
obligation of independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all
information that was publicly available or was furnished to it by Phillips and
Conoco or otherwise reviewed by it, and JPMorgan did not assume any
responsibility or liability for such information. JPMorgan did not conduct any
valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor were any such
valuations or appraisals provided to it. In relying on financial analyses and
forecasts provided to it, including the cost savings and related expenses and
synergies expected to result from the merger, JPMorgan assumed that they were
reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of
operations and financial condition of Conoco and Phillips to which such analyses
or forecasts relate. JPMorgan also assumed that the merger will qualify as a
tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes and that
the merger will be consummated as described in the merger agreement. JPMorgan
relied as to all legal matters relevant to rendering its opinion upon the advice
of its counsel. JPMorgan further assumed that all governmental, regulatory or
other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will
be obtained without any adverse effect on Phillips or Conoco or their respective
subsidiaries or on the contemplated benefits of the transaction contemplated by
the merger agreement in any respect material to its analysis and that all
conditions to the merger will be satisfied in all respects material to its
analysis.

     JPMorgan's opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other
conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the
date of its opinion. Subsequent developments may affect its opinion, and
JPMorgan does not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm its
opinion.

JPMorgan's opinion is limited to the fairness from a financial point of view to
the holders of Phillips common stock of the exchange ratio of one share of New
Parent common stock for each share of Phillips common stock relative to the
exchange ratio of 0.4677 of a share of New Parent common stock for each share of
Conoco common stock pursuant to the merger agreement, and JPMorgan expressed no
opinion as to the underlying decision by Phillips to engage in the transaction.
JPMorgan expressed no opinion as to the price at which Phillips common stock or
New Parent common stock will trade at any future time.

merger furnished to or discussed with it by Phillips or Conoco, Merrill Lynch
was advised by management of Phillips and Conoco, respectively, that they have
been reasonably prepared and reflect the best currently available estimates and

accounting and tax consequences of the merger.

     Merrill Lynch's opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic and

any respect material to its analysis, and Merrill Lynch further assumed that all
conditions to the merger will be satisfied in all respects material to its
analysis. Merrill Lynch expressed no opinion as to the price at which Phillips
common stock or New Parent common stock will trade following the announcement or
consummation of the merger, as the case may be.

  JOINT FINANCIAL ANALYSES OF PHILLIPS' FINANCIAL ADVISORS

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses jointly used
by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch in connection with providing their
opinions to the Phillips Board of Directors. Some of the summaries of the
financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to
more fully understand the financial analyses used by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and
Merrill Lynch, the tables must be read together with the full text of each
summary. The tables alone are not a complete description of the financial
analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch. Goldman Sachs,
JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch jointly prepared the presentation made to the
Phillips Board of Directors.

     Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis.  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill
Lynch reviewed the closing prices of Conoco common stock divided by the
corresponding closing price of Phillips common stock over the period beginning
with Conoco's initial public offering in October 1998 and ending on November 16,
2001. In addition, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch calculated the
average of these historical daily exchange ratios for the twenty-day, six-month,
one-year and three-year periods ended November 16, 2001. The following table
presents the results of these calculations:

                                                                  AVERAGE
PERIOD                                                         EXCHANGE RATIO
- ------                                                         --------------

Transaction.................................................       0.4677
20-Day Average..............................................       0.4677
6-Month Average.............................................       0.4983
1-Year Average..............................................       0.5014
3-Year Average..............................................       0.5066

     The transaction exchange ratio of 0.4677 would result in the holders of
Phillips common stock owning approximately 57% of the outstanding common stock
of the pro forma combined company following the merger.

     Contribution Analysis.  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch reviewed
specific historical and future operating and financial information, including,
among other things, equity market value, net income and cash flow for Phillips,
Conoco and the pro forma combined company resulting from the merger based on
financial data provided by the managements of Phillips and Conoco and
Institutional Brokers Estimate System, or I/B/E/S, estimates. Cash flow was
defined as net income adjusted for the non-cash impact of depreciation,
depletion, amortization, deferred taxes, dry-hole write offs and other non-
cash/non-recurring items. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch also
analyzed the relative income statement contribution of Phillips and Conoco to
the combined company on a pro forma basis before taking into account any of the
possible benefits that may be realized following the merger based on actual
1998, 1999, 2000 and estimated 2001, 2002 and 2003 results, based on financial
data provided by the

managements of Phillips and Conoco and I/B/E/S estimates. The following table
presents the results of this analysis:

                                               PHILLIPS CONTRIBUTION TO COMBINED COMPANY
                                           --------------------------------------------------
                                                                  LAST 3 YEARS   NEXT 3 YEARS
                                           2000   2001E   2002E    AGGREGATE      AGGREGATE
                                           ----   -----   -----   ------------   ------------

Net Income...............................   50%    53%     56%         47%            58%
Cash Flow................................   54     52      56          49             57

     The analysis further indicated that Phillips would contribute approximately
57% of the equity market value of the pro forma combined company as compared to
the approximately 57% of the outstanding common equity of the pro forma combined
company that holders of Phillips common stock would receive after the merger
based on the exchange ratio of 0.4677.

     Pro Forma Merger Analysis.  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch
prepared pro forma analyses of the financial impact of the transaction using
I/B/E/S estimates and synergy estimates prepared by the managements of Phillips
and Conoco. For each of the years 2002 and 2003, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and
Merrill Lynch compared the earnings per share and cash flow per share of
Phillips common stock, on a stand-alone basis, to the earnings per share and
cash flow per share of the common stock of the combined company on a pro forma
basis assuming pre-tax synergies of $750 million per year. These analyses were
performed based on the closing price of Phillips and Conoco common stock on
November 16, 2001. Based on these analyses, the proposed transaction would
result in an increase in earnings on a per share basis when compared to
Phillips' earnings per share on a stand-alone basis in the years 2002 and 2003.
In addition, based on these analyses, the proposed transaction would result in
an increase in cash flow on a per share basis, when compared to Phillips' cash
flow per share on a stand-alone basis, in the years 2002 and 2003.

     Selected Transactions Analysis.  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch
analyzed certain information relating to the proposed transaction in relation to
certain publicly available information for the following five stock-for-stock
transactions in the oil and gas industry:

     - The British Petroleum Company p.l.c.'s combination with Amoco
       Corporation, completed in December 1998;

     - Exxon Corporation's combination with Mobil Corporation, completed in
       November 1999;

     - BP Amoco p.l.c.'s combination with Atlantic Richfield Company, completed
       in April 2000;

     - Total Fina S.A.'s combination with Elf Aquitaine, completed in February
       2000; and

     - Chevron Corporation's combination with Texaco Inc., completed in October
       2001.

     Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch calculated and compared for each
of the five selected oil and gas industry transactions the synergy value split
between the respective shareholders of the larger and smaller company, as
compared to the corresponding synergy value split for the proposed transaction.
The synergy values were determined based on both (1) the estimated dollar value
of synergies publicly announced by the companies at the time of announcement of
the transaction and (2) to the extent subsequently revised, the revised
estimated dollar value of synergies publicly announced by the companies, other
than for the Chevron/Texaco transaction for which the revised synergy value was
based on then-available market estimates. The synergy value for the proposed
transaction was based on estimates

prepared by the managements of Phillips and Conoco. The following table presents
the results of this analysis:

                                                                                          SYNERGY VALUE SPLIT(2)

- ---------------
(1) The potential value created from the synergies was calculated at six times
    the pre-tax synergy estimate, based upon discounted cash flow analyses of
    the estimated cash flows of the synergies as provided by the managements of
    Phillips and Conoco and assuming a range of discount rates and perpetuity
    growth rates.

(2) The synergy value split calculation took into account that, when analyzing
    the estimated proportion of the synergy value that the shareholders of the
    larger company would enjoy, any premium paid by the larger company to the
    shareholders of the smaller company would erode the synergy value available
    to the larger company's shareholders.

     Selected Companies Analyses.  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch
reviewed and compared certain financial information as described below for
Phillips and Conoco to corresponding financial information, ratios and public
market multiples for the following publicly traded corporations in the oil and
gas industry, which were divided into two tiers reflecting their relative market
capitalization:

              SUPER MAJORS                                INTEGRATEDS

  Shell Transportation and Trading         - ENI SpA
  Company p.l.c.
- - BP p.l.c.
- - ChevronTexaco Corporation
- - TotalFinaElf S.A.

     Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch also calculated and compared
various financial multiples and ratios based on publicly available financial
data as of November 16, 2001, information it obtained from Securities and
Exchange Commission filings, Goldman Sachs Equity Research Estimates and I/B/E/S
estimates. The multiples for Phillips were calculated using Phillips' closing
price on November 16, 2001, and the multiples for Conoco were calculated using
Conoco's closing price on November 16, 2001. The multiples for each of the
selected companies were based on the most recent publicly available information.

     The results of these analyses are as summarized as follows:

                                                            MARKET

  GENERAL

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving
various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstance, and therefore is not readily susceptible to partial analysis.
Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch believe that selecting portions of
their analyses or the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses
as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying their
opinions. In arriving at their fairness determinations, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan
and Merrill Lynch considered the results of each of these analyses in their
totality and did not isolate or reach separate conclusions with respect to any
particular analysis. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a
comparison is directly comparable to Phillips or Conoco or the merger.

     The analyses were prepared solely for the purposes of Goldman Sachs,
JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch providing their opinions to the Phillips Board of
Directors as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders of
Phillips common stock as of the date of such opinions of the exchange ratio of
one share of New Parent common stock for each share of Phillips common stock
relative to the exchange ratio of 0.4677 of a share of New Parent common stock
for each share of Conoco common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. These
analyses do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at
which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon
forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by
such analyses. Because such analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty,
being based on numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or
their respective advisors, none of Phillips, Conoco, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan,
Merrill Lynch or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are
materially different from those forecast. As described above, the opinions of
Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch to the Phillips Board of Directors
were one of many factors taken into consideration by the Phillips Board of
Directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The
foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses
performed by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch.

     Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch, as part of their investment
banking businesses, are continually engaged in performing financial analyses
with respect to businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and
financial analyses for estate, corporate and other purposes. Phillips selected
Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch as financial advisors because each is
an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial
experience in transactions similar to the merger.

     Goldman Sachs is familiar with Phillips having provided certain investment
banking services to Phillips from time to time, including having acted as
financial advisor to Phillips in connection with its acquisition of assets from
Atlantic Richfield Company in April 2000, having acted as co-arranger in
connection with the public offering of $200 million aggregate principal amount
of Phillips' 7% Debentures due 2029 in March 1999 and the public offering of
$300 million aggregate principal amount of Phillips' 6 3/8% Notes due 2009 in
March 1999, and having acted as its financial advisor in connection with, and
having participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the merger
agreement. Goldman Sachs has also provided certain investment banking services
to Conoco from time to time, including having acted as co-manager in connection
with the public offering of 191.5 million shares of Conoco's Class A Common
Stock in October 1998, as co-arranger in connection with the public offering of
$1.35 billion aggregate principal amount of Conoco's 5.90% Notes due 2004, $1.9
billion aggregate principal amount of Conoco's 6.95% Notes due 2029 and $750
million aggregate principal amount of Conoco's 6.35% Notes due 2009 in April
1999, and as agent for Conoco's commercial paper program.

     JPMorgan is familiar with Phillips and Conoco having provided financial
advisory and financing services from time to time to Phillips and Conoco,
including acting as co-lead on Conoco's $4.5 billion high grade bond offering,
advising and arranging the financing for Conoco's acquisition of Gulf Canada
Resources Limited, advising Phillips on its joint venture with Chevron Corp. and
financing Phillips' acquisition of ARCO's Alaskan assets. In addition, one of
JPMorgan's commercial bank affiliates is the agent bank for certain outstanding
credit facilities for Phillips and Conoco.

     Merrill Lynch is familiar with Phillips and Conoco having provided
financial advisory and financing services from time to time to Phillips and
Conoco, including acting as financial advisor to Phillips in connection with the
formation of a gathering, processing and marketing joint venture (called Duke
Energy Field Services, L.L.C.) with Duke Energy Corporation, acting as
co-arranger for Phillips' $6.5 billion interim credit facility in connection
with the acquisition of ARCO's Alaskan assets and acting as joint book-running
manager on Phillips' public offering of $1.15 billion 8.5% Notes due 2005 and
$1.35 billion 8.75% Notes due 2010.

     Each of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch provides a full range of
financial advisory and securities services and, in the course of its normal
trading activities, may from time to time effect transactions and hold positions
in securities, including derivative securities, of Phillips or Conoco for its
own accounts and for the accounts of its customers. Each of Goldman Sachs,
JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch also may provide investment banking services to New
Parent and its subsidiaries in the future.

     Pursuant to separate letter agreements dated November 15, 2001, November
16, 2001 and November 16, 2001, Phillips engaged each of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan
and Merrill Lynch, respectively, to act as financial advisor in connection with
the contemplated transaction. Pursuant to the terms of these letters, Phillips
has agreed to pay each of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch a customary
fee upon consummation of the transaction.

     Phillips has agreed to reimburse each of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and
Merrill Lynch for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including attorneys'
fees, and to indemnify each of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws.

INTERESTS OF CONOCO DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT IN THE MERGER

     In considering the recommendation of the Conoco Board of Directors to vote
for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, Conoco stockholders should be
aware that members of the Conoco Board of Directors and members of Conoco
management team have agreements or arrangements that provide them with interests
in the merger that differ from those of other Conoco stockholders. The Conoco
Board of Directors was aware of these agreements and arrangements during its
deliberations of the merits of the merger and in determining to recommend to
Conoco stockholders that they vote for the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement.

  GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND MANAGEMENT POSITIONS

     The merger agreement provides for the initial composition of the New Parent
Board of Directors, certain committees of the New Parent Board of Directors and
selected New Parent executive officer positions. See "Directors and Management
Following the Merger."

  TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS

     Upon Conoco stockholder approval of the merger agreement, outstanding
Conoco stock options and other stock-based awards granted under Conoco employee
and director stock plans that were not previously vested or exercisable will
become fully vested and exercisable and generally will remain exercisable for
the remainder of their term. As of [          ] 2002, the number of shares of
Conoco common stock subject to unvested options held by Archie W. Dunham, Robert
E. McKee III, Jimmy W. Nokes, Robert W. Goldman and all other Conoco executive
officers and all Conoco directors (including Mr. Dunham) were [ ], [ ], [ ], [
], and [ ], respectively. The weighted average exercise price of the unvested
options held by Messrs. Dunham, McKee, Nokes, Goldman and all other Conoco
executive officers and all Conoco directors (including Mr. Dunham) is $[ ], $[
], $[ ], $[ ], and $[ ], respectively. As of [          ] 2002, the number of
shares of Conoco common stock subject to other unvested stock-based awards held
by Messrs. Dunham, McKee, Nokes and Goldman, all other Conoco executive officers
of Conoco and all Conoco directors (including Mr. Dunham) are [ ], [ ], [ ], [
], and [ ], respectively.

  EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WITH ARCHIE W. DUNHAM

     Conoco and Mr. Dunham are parties to an existing employment agreement. In
connection with entering into the merger agreement, New Parent, Conoco and Mr.
Dunham entered into a new employment agreement that contains substantially the
same terms and conditions as Mr. Dunham's current employment agreement, with
modifications to reflect Mr. Dunham's new responsibilities with New Parent and
to provide Mr. Dunham with appropriate incentives to continue his employment
with New Parent following the completion of the merger. Upon the completion of
the merger, Mr. Dunham's new employment agreement will become effective and will
supersede Mr. Dunham's current employment agreement. The term of Mr. Dunham's
new employment agreement will commence upon the date of the completion of the
merger and end on the later of October 1, 2004 and the second anniversary of the
date of the completion of the merger.

     During the term of Mr. Dunham's employment, Mr. Dunham will be a senior
executive employee of New Parent, a member and Chairman of the New Parent Board
of Directors and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the New Parent Board of
Directors, and Mr. Dunham's services will be performed at New Parent's
headquarters in Houston, Texas. During the term of his employment, Mr. Dunham
will preside at meetings of the New Parent Board of Directors and of New Parent
stockholders, will work with the Chief Executive Officer of New Parent on
external stakeholder relations (community, state, federal and foreign
governments), business development (growth) initiatives, and the creation of an
outstanding and cohesive New Parent Board of Directors, and will have other
executive responsibilities as may be agreed between Mr. Dunham and the Chief
Executive Officer of New Parent.

     While Mr. Dunham is Chairman of the New Parent Board of Directors, he and
the Chief Executive Officer of New Parent will jointly recommend to the New
Parent Board of Directors the long-range strategic plan for New Parent, major
acquisitions and divestitures, and major changes to New Parent's capital
structure, and, with respect to all other matters, the Chief Executive Officer
will, in consultation with Mr. Dunham, arrange the agenda for meetings of, and
shall report to, the New Parent Board of Directors. At the conclusion of the
term of Mr. Dunham's employment, Mr. Dunham will retire from employment with New
Parent and as Chairman, but shall remain a member of the New Parent Board of
Directors and a member of the Executive Committee and Chairman of the Committee
on Directors' Affairs of the New Parent Board of Directors until his 70th
birthday (or earlier retirement from such positions), subject to being
periodically re-elected to the New Parent Board of Directors by New Parent
stockholders. New Parent will propose Mr. Dunham for re-election whenever his
then current term as a

member of the New Parent Board of Directors is set to expire before his 70th
birthday. See also "Directors and Management Following the Merger". Pursuant to
Mr. Dunham's new employment agreement, Mr. Dunham's duties and responsibilities
may not be terminated or diminished during the term of his employment other than
pursuant to the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the members of the
New Parent Board of Directors.

     Stockholder approval of the merger will constitute a "change of control"
under Mr. Dunham's current employment agreement, and the election of another
individual as Chief Executive Officer will constitute "good reason" under Mr.
Dunham's current employment agreement. As a result, Mr. Dunham would be
permitted under the terms of Mr. Dunham's current employment agreement to
terminate his employment with Conoco and receive certain compensation and
benefits. In consideration for Mr. Dunham's entering into a new employment
agreement, which results in substantial modifications of the terms and
conditions of Mr. Dunham's continuing relationship with Conoco, in lieu of the
compensation and benefits that would have been payable to Mr. Dunham under his
current employment agreement had he voluntarily terminated his employment at
such time, Mr. Dunham will receive, promptly following the completion of the
merger, a lump sum severance payment equal to (1) the sum of his salary,
deferred compensation and vacation accrued to the date of completion of the
merger, (2) the salary and bonus that would have been payable to him under his
current employment agreement for three years following the date of completion of
the merger, based on his then current salary and an assumed annual bonus equal
to the average of the two highest annual bonus awards to Mr. Dunham in the three
fiscal years preceding the completion of the merger, and (3) an amount equal to
the additional retirement benefit he would have accrued if he had remained
employed for three years following the date of completion of the merger. In
addition, Mr. Dunham will receive grants of options, restricted stock and other
compensatory awards he would have received had his employment continued for
three years following the date of completion of the merger, based upon grants of
options and restricted stock and other compensatory awards received by Mr.
Dunham in the preceding three years, and to the vesting of, and termination of
restrictions on, any unvested equity or performance-based awards, and extension
of the term during which these awards may be exercised by Mr. Dunham until the
earlier of (x) the first anniversary of the date of completion of the merger or
(y) the date upon which the right to exercise any such award would have expired
if Mr. Dunham had continued to be employed by Conoco under the terms of his
current employment agreement for three years following the date of completion of
the merger; provided, however, that any option grants described above will not
vest until the second anniversary of the completion of the merger, subject to
earlier vesting upon the occurrence of certain events as contemplated by Mr.
Dunham's new employment agreement as described below and/or Conoco's customary
stock option grants. Mr. Dunham will receive welfare and other benefits
continuation for three years following the date of completion of the merger, and
will also continue to receive at no cost to him, until the earlier of Mr.
Dunham's death or the expiration or exercise of all his company stock options,
the financial and tax planning and life insurance benefits afforded during
employment. The foregoing payments and benefits are substantially the same as
those that Mr. Dunham would have been entitled to receive under his current
employment agreement except that, had he voluntarily terminated his employment
at the completion of the merger, Mr. Dunham would have been entitled to receive
under his current employment agreement an additional $3 million cash payment,
and the new grants of options described above would have been fully vested under
his current employment agreement, and not subject to a two-year cliff vesting
schedule.

     Mr. Dunham's new employment agreement provides that Mr. Dunham will also be
entitled to receive an additional payment sufficient to compensate him for the
amount of any excise tax imposed on the payments described above or otherwise
pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code and for any taxes imposed
on that additional payment. Mr. Dunham's new employment agreement also provides
that Mr. Dunham may elect, on or before March 31, 2002 (but in no event later
than the date 30 days prior to the date of completion of the merger), to defer
any of the payments described above under the terms of Conoco's Global Variable
Compensation Deferral Plan. Assuming that the merger is completed in [July]
2002, and excluding any gross-up payments for excise taxes that may be payable
under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the estimated amount of the
cash portion of the payments described above payable to Mr. Dunham at the
completion of the merger is $[          ], the estimated

number of shares subject to New Parent options that will be granted to Mr.
Dunham at the completion of the merger is [          ] and the estimated number
of shares of New Parent common stock that will be granted to Mr. Dunham at the
completion of the merger is [          ].

     In general, during the term of Mr. Dunham's employment, Mr. Dunham's
compensation and benefits will be, both in the aggregate and with respect to
each element of compensation and benefits, the same as that provided to the
Chief Executive Officer of New Parent.

     Pursuant to Mr. Dunham's new employment agreement, Mr. Dunham will receive
an annual base salary of not less than his annual base salary in effect
immediately prior to the completion of the merger, subject to annual reviews and
increases, bonuses and long-term equity-based compensation that are competitive
with industry practices, and participation in the most favorable incentive,
retirement, welfare and other benefits New Parent offers to New Parent senior
executives, including term life insurance in an amount equal to four times Mr.
Dunham's annual base salary. In no event will the annual base salary or annual
bonuses (in respect of each applicable fiscal year) provided to Mr. Dunham be
less than that provided to the Chief Executive Officer of New Parent. In
addition, the long-term equity-based compensation provided to Mr. Dunham will be
substantially the same, both in amount, exercise or strike or base price, and
other terms and conditions, as those awarded to the Chief Executive Officer of
New Parent.

     During the term of Mr. Dunham's new employment agreement, Mr. Dunham has
agreed not to terminate his employment within six months following a subsequent
change of control of New Parent (as defined in Mr. Dunham's new employment
agreement), other than as a result of retirement at the end of the term of Mr.
Dunham's employment, for good reason (as defined in Mr. Dunham's new employment
agreement) or disability. If, during the term of Mr. Dunham's employment, Mr.
Dunham's employment is terminated by Mr. Dunham at any time for good reason or
by New Parent at any time other than for cause (as defined in Mr. Dunham's new
employment agreement) or by reason of Mr. Dunham's death or disability, then Mr.
Dunham will be entitled to payments and benefits comparable to those provided to
him at the completion of the merger as described above, replacing references to
the completion of the merger with references to the termination of Mr. Dunham's
employment; provided, that (1) the lump-sum severance payment of salary and
bonus plus the additional retirement benefit accruals as described above will be
based on the salary and bonus and retirement benefit accruals that Mr. Dunham
would have received through the end of the term of his employment, (2) Mr.
Dunham will receive a pro rata annual bonus for the year in which his
termination of employment occurs, based on the annual bonus paid or awarded in
respect of the fiscal year immediately preceding the date of termination of
employment, (3) the grants of options, restricted stock and other compensatory
awards described above will be based on those that Mr. Dunham would have
received through the end of the term of his employment and (4) welfare and other
benefits will be continued through the later of three years following the date
of termination of his employment and the date Mr. Dunham attains age 70, which
we refer to as the "benefits continuation period;" provided, that New Parent's
obligation to provide these welfare benefits will cease upon Mr. Dunham's
refusal to serve as a member of the New Parent Board of Directors.

     If Mr. Dunham's employment is terminated under circumstances described
above, Mr. Dunham will receive the following additional benefits, which we refer
to as "post-employment compensation," during the benefits continuation period:
(1) continued participation in the Director's Charitable Gift Program, (2)
continued participation in welfare benefit plans and fringe benefits
arrangements applicable as if Mr. Dunham had remained employed, (3) continued
coverage under the comprehensive security program applicable during employment
(in the same manner and providing the same level of security protection as in
effect on the date of the merger agreement, and in any event on a basis no less
favorable than the coverage provided to the Chief Executive Officer of New
Parent) and (4) continued participation in the Conoco domestic relocation policy
with respect to a single relocation.

     If Mr. Dunham remains employed through the expiration of the term of his
employment, upon any termination of his employment thereafter, he is entitled to
vesting of, and termination of restrictions on, any unvested equity or
performance-based awards. In addition, upon such a termination, Mr. Dunham will

receive his post-employment compensation; provided that New Parent's obligation
to provide these benefits will cease upon Mr. Dunham's refusal to serve as a
member of the New Parent Board of Directors. It is contemplated that Mr. Dunham
will serve as a member of the New Parent Board during the benefits continuation
period.

  SEVERANCE ARRANGEMENTS

     Conoco's executive officers (other than Mr. Dunham) participate in the
Conoco Key Employee Severance Plan. The plan provides that if the employment of
a participant in the plan is terminated (i) within two years of a "Change in
Control" of Conoco or (ii) after a "Potential Change in Control" of Conoco but
prior to a Change in Control (whether or not a Change in Control ever occurs),
in either case by Conoco other than for "cause" or by the participant for "good
reason" (as such terms are defined in the plan), the participant will be
entitled to:

     - a lump-sum severance payment equal to one-and-one-half, two, or three
       times the sum of the employee's base salary, previous year's bonus, and
       economic equivalent of the previous year's stock option award;

     - the present value of the increase in retirement benefits resulting from
       the crediting of an additional one-and-one-half, two, or three times the
       employee's number of years of age and service under the applicable
       retirement plan;

     - 36 months of welfare benefits continuation;

     - a pro rata portion of the annual bonus for which the employee is eligible
       in the year of termination; and

     - if necessary, a gross-up payment sufficient to compensate the participant
       for the amount of any excise tax imposed on payments made under the plan
       or otherwise pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code and
       for any taxes imposed on this additional payment.

     Prior to October 19, 2005, the Key Employee Severance Plan may not be
amended or terminated if such amendment would be adverse to the interests of any
eligible employee, without the employee's written consent. Amounts payable under
the plan will be in lieu of any payments or benefits that may be payable to the
severed employee under any other plan, policy or program of Conoco relating to
severance.

     Stockholder approval of the merger will constitute a "Change of Control"
under the Key Employee Severance Plan. Assuming that the merger is completed in
[July] 2002, and excluding any gross-up payments for excise taxes that may be
payable under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the estimated maximum
amount of the cash severance payments that would be payable to Messrs. McKee,
Nokes and Goldman and all other executive officers of Conoco, upon a termination
of their employment by New Parent without cause, is $[ ], $[ ], $[ ], and $[ ],
respectively.

  DIRECTOR DEFERRED COMPENSATION

     Pursuant to the Conoco Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
Directors, participants may elect that, upon a change in control of Conoco, at
the director's election, all deferred amounts (including deferred restricted
stock units) may be paid in full in a lump-sum payment within 60 days of the
Change in Control. Stockholder approval of the merger will constitute a Change
of Control under the Conoco Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
Directors. Assuming that the merger is completed in [July] 2002, the estimated
aggregate maximum amount of payments that would be payable to all of Conoco
directors within 60 days following the Conoco stockholder approval of the merger
is $[ ].

  DIRECTOR SUPPLEMENTAL COMPENSATION

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, Conoco may, but is not obligated to, pay
to any Conoco non-employee director immediately prior to the completion of the
merger who does not become a New Parent director, an amount per Conoco
non-employee director not in excess of three times the then-annual

compensation for that Conoco non-employee director. Based on the current annual
compensation provided by Conoco to Conoco non-employee director, the estimated
maximum amount that could be payable to each applicable Conoco non-employee
director is approximately $[ ].

  INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

     The merger agreement includes provisions relating to indemnification and
insurance for directors, officers and employees of Conoco and Phillips. See "The
Merger Agreement -- Indemnification and Insurance."

INTERESTS OF PHILLIPS DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT IN THE MERGER

     In considering the recommendation of the Phillips Board of Directors to
vote for the adoption of the merger agreement, Phillips stockholders should be
aware that members of the Phillips Board of Directors and members of the
Phillips management team have agreements or arrangements that provide them with
interests in the merger that differ from those of Phillips stockholders. The
Phillips Board of Directors was aware of these agreements and arrangements
during its deliberations on the merits of the merger and in determining to
recommend to the Phillips stockholders that they vote for the adoption of the
merger agreement.

  GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND MANAGEMENT POSITIONS

     The merger agreement provides for the initial composition of the New Parent
Board of Directors, certain committees of the New Parent Board of Directors and
selected New Parent executive officer positions. See "Directors and Management
Following the Merger."

  PHILLIPS STOCK OPTIONS, SARS AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS

     All unvested Phillips employee stock options, SARs, restricted stock and
restricted stock units that were outstanding on November 18, 2001, other than
certain stock options and restricted stock units granted to James J. Mulva
described below, will vest upon stockholder approval of the merger, which is
considered a "change of control" for purposes of those awards. As of
[          ], 2002, the number of unvested stock options and SARs held by Mr.
Mulva, J.A. Carrig, B.Z. Parker, J.B. Whitworth, and all other Phillips
executive officers and all Phillips directors are expected to be [     ],
[     ], [     ], [     ] and [     ], respectively. The weighted average price
of unvested stock options and SARs held by Mr. Mulva, J.A. Carrig, B.Z. Parker,
J.B. Whitworth, all other Phillips executive officers and all Phillips directors
are expected to be [     ], [     ], [     ], [     ], and [     ],
respectively. As of [          ], 2002, the number of shares underlying other
unvested stock-based awards held by Messrs. Mulva, Carrig, Parker, Whitworth,
all other Phillips executive officers and all Phillips directors are expected to
be [     ], [     ], [     ], [     ], [     ] and [     ], respectively.

  EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WITH JAMES J. MULVA

     As of November 18, 2001, Phillips and New Parent entered into an employment
agreement with James J. Mulva under which Mr. Mulva will serve as Chief
Executive Officer and President of New Parent beginning upon completion of the
merger, and as Chairman of the New Parent Board of Directors, beginning when Mr.
Dunham ceases to hold that position. Unless either party gives a notice of
nonrenewal, the initial three-year term of the agreement will be automatically
extended by one year on each anniversary of the completion of the merger, but
not beyond the end of the month in which Mr. Mulva attains age 65.

     During his employment under this new agreement, Mr. Mulva will have general
responsibility for the management of New Parent as provided in the by-laws of
New Parent, reporting directly to the New Parent Board of Directors, and he will
be a member of the New Parent Board of Directors. His services will be performed
at New Parent's headquarters in the Houston, Texas metropolitan area. He will
have all the customary duties and responsibilities of a chief executive officer
and president, and all of New Parent's

executive officers will report directly to him or indirectly to him through
another such executive officer who reports to him. While Mr. Dunham is serving
as Chairman of the New Parent Board of Directors, Mr. Mulva will work with Mr.
Dunham on external stakeholder relations (community, state, federal and foreign
governments), business development (growth) initiatives, and the creation of an
outstanding and cohesive New Parent Board of Directors. Furthermore, while Mr.
Dunham is Chairman of the New Parent Board of Directors, Messrs. Mulva and
Dunham will jointly recommend to the New Parent Board of Directors the
long-range strategic plan for New Parent, major acquisitions and divestitures,
and major changes to New Parent's capital structure and with respect to all
other matters, Mr. Mulva will, in consultation with Mr. Dunham, arrange the
agenda for meetings of the New Parent Board of Directors, and will report to the
New Parent Board of Directors and arrange for other executives and advisors to
report to the New Parent Board of Directors. Until the later of October 1, 2004
and the second anniversary of completion of the merger, Mr. Mulva's duties and
responsibilities may not be terminated or diminished, except by the affirmative
vote of two-thirds of the members of the New Parent Board of Directors.

     While Mr. Dunham is Chairman, Mr. Mulva's compensation and benefits will be
the same as Mr. Dunham's. Mr. Mulva's base salary will be not less than his
annual base salary as in effect immediately before completion of the merger,
subject to annual review, and increased as necessary to be substantially
consistent with competitive industry practice. In addition, Mr. Mulva will be
awarded annual bonus opportunities substantially consistent with competitive
industry practice. Mr. Mulva will also be entitled to other compensation,
benefits and perquisites to the extent applicable generally to other executives
of New Parent. In connection with Mr. Mulva's relocation to Houston, Texas,
Phillips will provide Mr. Mulva with the home sale assistance that he would have
received, had he been eligible for such assistance under the Phillips Work Force
Stabilization Plan.

     If New Parent terminates Mr. Mulva's employment other than for death,
disability or cause, or Mr. Mulva resigns for good reason, Mr. Mulva will
receive a lump sum payment equal to three times the sum of his annual base
salary and the average of the two highest annual bonuses paid or awarded to him
for the last three full fiscal years, a pro-rata bonus for the year in which the
termination occurs, and the value of the additional pension benefits he would
have received, had he continued to be employed by New Parent for an additional
three years. In addition, he will be granted the stock options and other equity-
based awards to which he would have been entitled, had his employment continued
for three additional years, all of his then-outstanding unvested equity-based
awards will vest and the remaining term for exercise of his stock options will
be not less than one year or, if shorter, until the date they would have
expired, had his employment continued for three years. His welfare benefits will
continue for three years after the termination date or, if longer, until age 70,
and he will receive tax and financial planning benefits with related income tax
gross-ups so long as he or his family hold New Parent stock options. In
addition, if a future change of control of New Parent precedes or occurs within
one year following the termination date, Mr. Mulva will have the right to cash
out his equity-based compensation awards at the most favorable price paid in the
context of the change of control. Mr. Mulva's stock options and other equity-
based awards will also vest upon termination of his employment at or after the
expiration of the agreement.

     New Parent will pay Mr. Mulva's legal fees and expenses incurred in any
contest involving the employment agreement. If any payments or benefits that Mr.
Mulva receives are subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the
Internal Revenue Code, he will receive an additional payment to restore him to
the after-tax position that he would have been in, if the excise tax had not
been imposed. However, it is not expected that any such excise tax will be owed.

     If the merger were completed on July 1, 2002 and the employment of Mr.
Mulva were terminated without "cause" immediately thereafter, the estimated cash
severance that would be payable to Mr. Mulva under the agreement, based on
certain assumptions and currently available information, would be $[ ].

     GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO JAMES J. MULVA

     On November 17, 2001, Mr. Mulva was granted options to purchase 750,000
shares of Phillips common stock for $51.31 per share, which is the average of
the high and low trading prices of Phillips common stock on November 16, 2001,
and options to purchase 750,000 shares of Phillips common stock for $64.13 per
share, which is 125% of the average of the high and low trading prices of
Phillips common stock on November 16, 2001. These options will be converted into
options for New Parent common stock when the merger is completed. Generally, the
options will vest one-third on completion of the merger, one-third on the first
anniversary thereof, and one-third on the second anniversary thereof. If the
merger is not completed, they will vest on November 17, 2007. The options will
also vest upon a future change of control other than the merger, and as required
by his employment agreement in the case of certain terminations of employment.

     Mr. Mulva was also granted, on November 17, 2001, 250,000 restricted stock
units based on shares of Phillips common stock, which will be converted into
units based on New Parent common stock when the merger is completed. Additional
restricted stock units representing a number of shares having a fair market
value equal to the value of the dividends that would have been paid on the units
if they had been actual shares will be credited to Mr. Mulva under the award
when dividends are paid on the Phillips common stock or, after the merger, New
Parent common stock.

     The restricted stock units will be forfeited if the merger is not
completed. If the merger is completed, the restricted stock units will vest on
June 19, 2006. The units will also vest upon a future change of control other
than the merger, upon his death or disability, and as required by his employment
agreement in the case of certain terminations of employment. When the units
vest, Mr. Mulva will be paid the value of the units, unless he has previously
elected to defer the payments under the Phillips Key Employee Deferred
Compensation Plan.

EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN

     Phillips maintains an Executive Severance Plan that provides for the
payment of certain severance benefits to participants, including Phillips'
executive officers, in the event of a termination of a participant's employment
within two years after a change in control of Phillips either (1) by Phillips,
other than for death, disability, transfer to another employer, retirement,
cause, as a result of certain sales of subsidiaries or divisions, or (2) by the
participant, within 90 days of an event constituting good reason. Stockholder
approval of the merger will constitute a change in control of Phillips for
purposes of this severance plan. Upon completion of the merger, the plan will be
assumed by New Parent.

     "Group one" participants in the plan, which include Phillips' Executive
Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents and, until completion of the merger,
Mr. Mulva, receive severance benefits based on three years' pay, and "group two"
participants, including Phillips' Vice Presidents, receive benefits based on two
years' pay. The severance benefits under the severance plan consist of:

     - a lump-sum payment of three or two times the sum of the participant's
       base salary and the greater of (1) the bonus earned by the participant
       for the last fiscal year before the termination date or (2) the highest
       target award for the calendar year of the termination date; and

     - continuation of medical, dental and prescription drug coverage for 18
       months after the termination date.

     The participant will also be credited with additional years of service
under Phillips' retirement plans based upon the number of years represented by
the above lump-sum payment, and up to one year's worth of such lump-sum payment
will be treated as pensionable earnings.

     In addition, in the event that a participant institutes any legal action
seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by the severance
plan, the participant is entitled to be reimbursed for all reasonable costs and
expenses relating to such legal action, including any legal fees and expenses
incurred by the participant, unless a court makes a determination that the
participant's position was frivolous.

Finally, if the participant relocates in order to secure new employment, he or
she will be entitled to the home sale assistance benefits provided under the
Phillips Work Force Stabilization Plan.

     If any payments or benefits that a participant receives are subject to the
excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the
participant will generally receive an additional payment to restore such
participant to the after-tax position that the participant would have been in if
the excise tax had not been imposed, except that, if the payments or benefits
that the participant receives do not exceed 110% of the maximum amount that the
participant is permitted to receive without being subjected to the golden
parachute excise taxes, no such additional payment will be made, and the amounts
payable under the severance plan will be reduced to the maximum amount
permissible to avoid imposition of the tax. However, it is not expected that any
such excise tax will be owed.

     If the merger were completed on July 1, 2002 and the employment of Phillips
executive officers other than Mr. Mulva were terminated without cause
immediately thereafter, the estimated cash severance that would be payable under
the severance plan, plus the value of the additional retirement benefits
described above, based on certain assumptions and currently available
information, to Messrs. Carrig, Parker, Whitworth, and all other Phillips
executive officers would be $[     ], $[     ], $[     ], and $[     ],
respectively. After the completion of the merger, Mr. Mulva will not be eligible
to receive any severance benefits under the severance plan because it will be
superseded by his new employment agreement with Phillips and New Parent,
described above.

  INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

     The merger agreement includes provisions relating to indemnification and
insurance for directors, officers and employees of Conoco and Phillips. See "The
Merger Agreement -- Indemnification and Insurance."

LISTING OF NEW PARENT CAPITAL STOCK

     It is a condition to the completion of the merger that New Parent common
stock issuable to Conoco and Phillips stockholders pursuant to the merger
agreement be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange.

DIVIDENDS

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, each of Conoco and Phillips are
prohibited from making any changes to their dividend policies prior to the
completion of the merger without the other's consent. The most recent quarterly
dividend declared by Conoco was $0.19 per share payable on December 10, 2001.
Conoco's current dividend is $0.76 per share of Conoco common stock on an annual
basis. The most recent quarterly dividend declared by Phillips was $0.36 per
share payable on December 3, 2001. Phillips' current dividend is $1.44 per share
of Phillips common stock on an annual basis.

     We expect that, after the completion of the merger, New Parent will adopt a
competitive dividend policy. The payment of dividends by New Parent, however,
will be subject to approval and declaration by the New Parent Board of
Directors, and will depend on a variety of factors, including business,
financial and regulatory considerations.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

     The following general discussion summarizes the anticipated material U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders of Conoco common stock
and holders of Phillips common stock. This summary applies only to holders of
Conoco common stock or Phillips common stock that are U.S. holders.

     For purposes of this discussion, a U.S. holder means:

     - a citizen or resident of the United States,

     - a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created or
       organized under the laws of the United States or any of its political
       subdivisions,

     - a trust, if a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the
       administration of the trust and one or more U.S. fiduciaries have the
       authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or

     - an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income,
       regardless of its source.

     This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code, Treasury
regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions currently in effect,
all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. The
discussion applies only to Conoco stockholders that hold their Conoco common
stock and Phillips stockholders that hold their Phillips common stock as a
capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Further, the discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income
taxation that may be relevant to a particular stockholder in light of his, her
or its personal investment circumstances or to stockholders subject to special
treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including:

     - insurance companies,

     - tax-exempt organizations,

     - dealers in securities or foreign currency,

     - banks or trusts,

     - financial institutions,

     - mutual funds,

     - persons that hold their Conoco common stock or Phillips common stock as
       part of a straddle, a hedge against currency risk or a constructive sale
       or conversion transaction,

     - persons that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar,

     - investors in pass-through entities,

     - stockholders who acquired their Conoco common stock or Phillips common
       stock through the exercise of options, or otherwise as compensation or
       through a tax-qualified retirement plan, or

     - holders of options granted under any Conoco or Phillips benefit plan.

     THE SUMMARY DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY NON-INCOME TAX OR ANY FOREIGN, STATE OR
LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER. THE SUMMARY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF ANY TRANSACTION OTHER THAN THE MERGER. ACCORDINGLY, EACH CONOCO
STOCKHOLDER AND PHILLIPS STOCKHOLDER IS STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT WITH A TAX
ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN INCOME OR
OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THE HOLDER.

     The following discussion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service.
None of Conoco, Phillips or New Parent has requested a ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service with respect to any of the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of the merger and, as a result, there can be no assurance that the Internal
Revenue Service will not disagree with or challenge any of the conclusions
described below.

     We have structured the transaction so that it is anticipated that the
merger of Corvette Merger Corp. with and into Conoco and the merger of Porsche
Merger Corp. with and into Phillips will each be a reorganization for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, and that the merger will constitute an exchange
described in Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code. Completion of the merger
is conditioned upon, among other things, (1) the receipt by Conoco of a written
opinion dated the closing date of Cravath,

Swaine & Moore, counsel to Conoco, to the effect that for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, the merger of Corvette Merger Corp. with and into Conoco will
constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code and/or the mergers, taken together, will constitute an exchange
described in Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code and (2) the receipt by
Phillips of a written opinion dated the closing date of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen
& Katz, counsel to Phillips, to the effect that for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the merger of Porsche Merger Corp. with and into Phillips will
constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code and/or the mergers, taken together, will constitute an exchange
described in Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code. Those opinions will be
based upon customary assumptions and representations, including representations
made by Conoco and Phillips.

     Assuming the merger of Corvette Merger Corp. with and into Conoco and the
merger of Porsche Merger Corp. with and into Phillips each constitutes a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
and/or the mergers, taken together, constitute an exchange described in Section
351 of the Internal Revenue Code:

     - no gain or loss will be recognized by Conoco stockholders or Phillips
       stockholders on the exchange of Conoco common stock or Phillips common
       stock, respectively, for New Parent common stock in the transaction,
       except with respect to cash received by Conoco stockholders in lieu of
       fractional shares of New Parent common stock,

     - the aggregate adjusted basis of the New Parent common stock received in
       the transaction by Conoco stockholders or Phillips stockholders will be
       equal to the aggregate adjusted basis of those stockholders' Conoco
       common stock or Phillips common stock, as the case may be, exchanged for
       the New Parent common stock reduced, in the case of a Conoco stockholder
       that receives cash in lieu of fractional shares of New Parent common
       stock, by any amount allocable to the fractional share interests in New
       Parent common stock for which cash is received, and

     - the holding period of New Parent common stock received in the merger by a
       Conoco stockholder or Phillips stockholder, including, in the case of a
       Conoco stockholder, any New Parent fractional interest deemed received in
       the merger, will include the holding period of the stockholder's Conoco
       common stock or Phillips common stock, as the case may be, exchanged for
       that New Parent common stock.

     The receipt of cash instead of a fractional share of New Parent common
stock by a holder of Conoco common stock will result in taxable gain or loss to
that Conoco stockholder for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the
difference between the amount of cash received by the Conoco stockholder and the
Conoco stockholder's adjusted tax basis in its Conoco common stock allocable to
the fractional share as set forth above. The gain or loss will generally
constitute capital gain or loss and will constitute long-term capital gain or
loss if the holder's holding period is greater than 12 months as of the date of
the merger. For non-corporate holders, this long-term capital gain generally
will be taxed at a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20%. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitation. Certain non-corporate
Conoco stockholders and Phillips stockholders, as the case may be, may be
subject to backup withholding at a rate not to exceed 30% on cash payments
received instead of fractional shares of New Parent common stock unless they
comply with certain certification requirements.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     The merger will be accounted for using purchase accounting. Although the
business combination of Conoco and Phillips is a merger of equals, generally
accepted accounting principles require that one of the two companies in the
transaction be designated as the acquiror for accounting purposes. Phillips has
been designated as the acquiror based on the fact that its stockholders are
expected to hold more than 50% of the New Parent stock after the merger. The
purchase price (based on the price of Phillips common stock two days before and
after November 19, 2001) will be allocated to Conoco's identifiable assets and
liabilities based on their estimated fair market values at the date of the
completion of the merger, and any excess of the purchase price over those fair
market values will be accounted for as goodwill. The results of

final valuations of property, plant and equipment, and intangible and other
assets and the finalization of any potential plans of restructuring have not yet
been completed. We may revise the allocation of the purchase price when
additional information becomes available.

REGULATORY MATTERS

     Certain regulatory requirements imposed by U.S. and foreign regulatory
authorities must be complied with before the merger is completed. Conoco and
Phillips are not aware of any material governmental consents or approvals that
are required prior to the completion of the merger other than those described
below. We have agreed that, if any additional governmental consents and
approvals are required, we shall each use our reasonable best efforts to obtain
these consents and approvals.

     Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated under it by the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission, which we refer to as the FTC, the merger cannot be completed
until notifications have been given and certain information has been furnished
to the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, which
we refer to as the Antitrust Division, and the specified waiting periods have
expired or been terminated. Conoco and Phillips intend to file notification and
report forms under the HSR Act with the FTC and the Antitrust Division on
[               ], in which case the waiting period under the HSR Act will
expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on [               ] unless the FTC or
Antitrust Division makes a request for additional information or documentary
material before that time or the waiting period is terminated earlier.

     At any time before or after completion of the merger, the Antitrust
Division or the FTC or any state could take such action under the antitrust laws
as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to
enjoin the completion of the merger, to rescind the merger or to seek
divestiture of particular assets of Conoco or Phillips. Private parties also may
seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.
A challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds may be made, and, if such a
challenge is made, it is possible that Conoco and Phillips will not prevail.

     Completion of the merger may also require other regulatory approvals of
foreign regulatory authorities. Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the
merger may not be completed unless certain filings are made with the antitrust
regulatory authorities of these jurisdictions and these authorities approve or
clear the merger. Conoco and Phillips each conducts business in member states of
the European Union. Council Regulation (EEC) 4064/89, as amended, requires
notification to and approval by the European Commission of mergers or
acquisitions involving parties with aggregate worldwide sales and individual
European Union sales exceeding specific thresholds before these mergers or
acquisitions are implemented. Conoco and Phillips intend to file a merger
notification with the European Union antitrust authorities as soon as
practicable.

     The European Commission must review the merger to determine whether or not
it is compatible with the common market, and, accordingly, whether or not to
permit it to proceed. A merger or acquisition that does not create or strengthen
a dominant position that would significantly impede effective competition in the
common market or in a substantial part of it shall be declared compatible with
the common market and must be allowed to proceed. If, following a preliminary
one-month Phase I investigation, the European Commission determines that it
needs to examine the merger more closely because the merger raises serious
doubts as to its compatibility with the common market, it must initiate a Phase
II investigation. If it initiates a Phase II investigation, the European
Commission must issue a final decision as to whether or not the merger is
compatible with the common market no later than four months after the initiation
of the Phase II investigation.

     Conoco and Phillips intend to make a short-form pre-merger notification
filing with the Commissioner of Competition under the Competition Act (Canada)
as soon as practicable. Verification by the Competition Bureau of receipt of a
complete notification will begin the running of a 14-day statutory waiting
period. The Commissioner has the ability to require a long-form pre-merger
notification to be made where he believes one is justified, in which case
receipt of a complete long-form notification will begin the running of a further
42-day statutory waiting period. Conoco and Phillips may implement the

merger at the conclusion of the relevant waiting period, unless the Commissioner
obtains an order from the Canadian Competition Tribunal preventing or delaying
the completion of the transaction. In addition to a Canadian competition filing,
Phillips and Conoco may also be required to file a notification or application
for review under the Investment Canada Act, which is a foreign investment,
rather than competition, law.

     Conoco and Phillips conduct operations in a number of jurisdictions where
other regulatory filings or approvals may be required or advisable in connection
with the completion of the merger. Under the merger agreement, we are required
to obtain these approvals prior to completing the merger, unless the failure to
obtain the approvals would not have a material adverse effect on New Parent
after completion of the merger. Conoco and Phillips are currently reviewing
whether filings or approvals may be required or advisable in those jurisdictions
that may be material to Conoco and Phillips. These jurisdictions include, but
are not limited to, Australia, Brazil, Czech Republic and Poland.

     It is possible that any of the regulatory authorities with which filings
are made may seek regulatory concessions as conditions for granting approval of
the merger. Under the merger agreement, each of Conoco and Phillips has agreed
to use its reasonable best efforts to complete the merger, including to gain
clearance from antitrust and competition authorities and to obtain other
required approvals. However, neither Conoco nor Phillips nor any of their
respective subsidiaries is required to hold separate or divest any of their
businesses or assets, or to take, or to agree to take, any action or agree to
any limitation that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on New Parent after giving effect to the merger or to impair
substantially the benefits that Conoco and Phillips expected to realize from the
merger at the time they entered into the merger agreement. Also, neither Conoco
nor Phillips is required to agree to any divestiture, to hold separate any
business or to take any other action that is not conditional on the consummation
of the merger.

     Prior to completing the merger, the applicable waiting period under the HSR
Act must expire or be terminated, and Conoco and Phillips are required to obtain
antitrust approvals from the European Commission and any other regulatory
authorities if the failure to obtain antitrust approvals of those regulatory
authorities would have a material adverse effect on New Parent after the
completion of the merger.

     Although we do not expect regulatory authorities to raise any significant
objections in connection with their review of the merger, we cannot assure you
that we will obtain all required regulatory approvals or that these regulatory
approvals will not contain terms, conditions or restrictions that would be
detrimental to New Parent after the completion of the merger.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, neither Conoco stockholders nor
Phillips stockholders will have any appraisal rights as a result of the merger.

RESALE OF NEW PARENT COMMON STOCK

     New Parent common stock issued in the merger will not be subject to any
restrictions on transfer arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
except for shares of New Parent common stock issued to any Conoco stockholder or
Phillips stockholder that is, or is expected to be, an "affiliate" of Conoco or
Phillips, as applicable, for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act.
Persons that may be deemed to be "affiliates" of Conoco or Phillips for such
purposes generally include individuals or entities that control, are controlled
by, or are under common control with, Conoco or Phillips, respectively, and
include the directors of Conoco and Phillips, respectively. The merger agreement
requires each of Conoco and Phillips to use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each of its affiliates to execute a written agreement with New Parent to the
effect that they will not transfer any New Parent common stock received in the
merger, except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act or in a transaction not required to be registered under the
Securities Act.

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus does not cover resales of New Parent
common stock received by any person upon completion of the merger, and no person
is authorized to make any use of this joint proxy statement/prospectus in
connection with any resale.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO THE MERGER

     Several complaints have been filed and remain pending in the Delaware Court
of Chancery naming as defendants one or more of Conoco, the directors of Conoco
and Phillips. The complaints purport to be filed on behalf of holders of Conoco
common stock and allege breaches of fiduciary duty by Conoco directors and, in
certain complaints, aiding and abetting these breaches of fiduciary duty by
Phillips, in connection with the merger of Conoco and Phillips. The plaintiffs
in each case seek to enjoin completion of the merger and/or damages. No answers
have been filed and no applications for preliminary relief have been made. Each
of Conoco and Phillips intends to defend against these lawsuits vigorously.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following summary of the merger agreement is qualified by reference to
the complete text of the merger agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus by reference and attached as Annex A.

THE MERGER

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, Corvette Merger Corp. will merge with and
into Conoco and Porsche Merger Corp. will merge with and into Phillips, with
each of Conoco and Phillips surviving as wholly owned subsidiaries of New
Parent. In the merger, each outstanding share of Conoco common stock will be
converted into the right to receive 0.4677 of a share of New Parent common
stock, and each outstanding share of Phillips common stock will be converted
into the right to receive one share of New Parent common stock.

MERGER CONSIDERATION

     The merger agreement provides that each share of Conoco common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the merger will be
converted into the right to receive 0.4677 of a share of New Parent common stock
upon the effectiveness of the merger. Any shares of Conoco capital stock held by
Conoco as treasury shares or owned by Conoco, New Parent, Corvette Merger Corp.
or Porsche Merger Corp. will be canceled without any payment for those shares.
The merger agreement provides that each share of Phillips common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the merger will be
converted into the right to receive one share of New Parent common stock upon
the effectiveness of the merger. Any shares of Phillips capital stock held by
Phillips as treasury shares or owned by Phillips, New Parent, Corvette Merger
Corp. or Porsche Merger Corp. will be canceled without any payment for those
shares.

PROCEDURES FOR EXCHANGE OF SHARE CERTIFICATES; FRACTIONAL SHARES

     Conoco stockholders and Phillips stockholders should not return share
certificates with the enclosed proxy card.

     As soon as reasonably practicable after the completion of the merger,
[               ], the exchange agent, will mail the following materials to each
holder of record of Conoco common stock whose shares were converted into the
right to receive shares of New Parent common stock:

     - a letter of transmittal for use in submitting their shares to the
       exchange agent for exchange, and

     - instructions explaining what Conoco stockholders must do to effect the
       surrender of Conoco share certificates in exchange for the consideration
       to be issued in the merger.

     Conoco stockholders should complete and sign the letter of transmittal and
return it to the exchange agent together with the Conoco stockholders' share
certificates in accordance with the instructions.

     Upon completion of the merger, each Conoco share certificate will represent
only the right to receive 0.4677 of a share of New Parent common stock, with
cash instead of any fractional shares of New Parent common stock. New Parent
will not issue any fractional shares of New Parent common stock upon the
conversion of Conoco common stock.

     Phillips share certificates of Phillips stockholders immediately prior to
the completion of the merger will be deemed to represent New Parent common stock
upon completion of the merger. Phillips stockholders, however, may elect to
exchange their Phillips share certificates for New Parent share certificates, at
their option.

     At or prior to the completion of the merger, New Parent will deposit with
the exchange agent, in trust for the benefit of the former Conoco stockholders,
New Parent share certificates and will make available to the exchange agent cash
sufficient to pay to each former Conoco stockholder after the completion of the
merger an amount in cash equal to the product of any fractional share interest
to which the former Conoco stockholder would otherwise be entitled and the
closing price for a share of New Parent common stock as reported on the New York
Stock Exchange on the first trading day following the date of the completion of
the merger.

     No dividends or distributions with a record date after the merger will be
paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Conoco share certificate, nor will
those holders be paid cash for any fractional shares of New Parent common stock
until their Conoco share certificates are surrendered to the exchange agent for
exchange. When their Conoco share certificates are surrendered, any unpaid
dividends and any cash instead of fractional shares will be paid without
interest.

     All shares of New Parent common stock issued upon surrender of Conoco share
certificates, including any cash paid instead of any fractional shares of New
Parent common stock, will be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of
all rights relating to those shares of Conoco common stock. Each of Conoco and
Phillips will remain obligated, however, to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions declared or made by Conoco or Phillips on Conoco common stock or
Phillips common stock, as appropriate, with a record date before the completion
of the merger and that remain unpaid at the completion of the merger. If Conoco
share certificates or Phillips share certificates are presented to New Parent,
Conoco, Phillips or the exchange agent after the completion of the merger, they
will be canceled and exchanged as described above.

       and prospectus, and the compliance of this joint proxy statement and
       prospectus with the applicable U.S. securities laws;

     - state takeover laws, rights plans;

     Many of the representations and warranties are qualified by a material
adverse effect standard. A material adverse effect, with respect to either
Conoco or Phillips, means a material adverse effect on (1) the business,
operations, results of operations or financial condition of Conoco or Phillips,
as the case may be, and its respective subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (2) the
ability of Conoco or Phillips to timely consummate the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement, except, in each case, for any effect reasonably
attributable to:

     - general political and economic conditions (including prevailing interest
       rate and stock market levels) in the United States or the other countries
       in which it operates;

     - the general state of the industries in which it operates; or

     - the negotiation, announcement, execution or delivery of the merger
       agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
       merger agreement.

INTERIM OPERATIONS OF CONOCO AND PHILLIPS

     Under the merger agreement, each of Conoco and Phillips and their
respective subsidiaries has agreed that, prior to completion of the merger,
except as expressly contemplated or permitted by the merger agreement, it will
carry on its respective business in the usual, regular and ordinary course in
all material respects, substantially in the same manner as previously conducted,
and will use its reasonable best efforts, among other things, to retain its key
employees and to preserve intact its present lines of business and its
relationships with third parties so that its ongoing businesses will not be
impaired in any material respect at the completion of the merger. Each of Conoco
and Phillips has also agreed that it will not, and it will not permit any of its
subsidiaries to, enter into any new material line of business or incur or commit
any capital expenditures or any obligations or liabilities in connection with
such capital expenditures, other than as previously disclosed to the other party
or in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

     In addition to these agreements regarding the conduct of business
generally, subject to specified exceptions, each of Conoco and Phillips has
agreed to specific restrictions relating to the following:

     - the declaration or payment of dividends;

     - the alteration of share capital, including, among other things, stock
       splits, combinations or reclassifications;

     - the repurchase or redemption of capital stock;

     - the issuance or sale of capital stock, any voting debt, stock options or
       other equity interests;

     - the amendment of its certificate of incorporation or by-laws;

     - the acquisition of material assets or other entities;

     - the disposition of material assets;

     - the extension of loans, advances, capital contributions or investments;

     - the incurrence or guarantee of debt;

     - the issuance or sale of debt securities, warrants or other rights to
       acquire debt securities;

     - the taking of actions that would prevent or impede the merger from
       qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
       the Internal Revenue Code or from qualifying as an exchange within the
       meaning of Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code;

     - changes in compensation of directors or executive officers of the company
       and its significant subsidiaries;

     - changes to employee benefits;

     - changes in accounting policies and procedures;

     - the amendment or waiver of any standstill agreements; and

     - any actions for the purpose of preventing, delaying or impeding the
       completion of the merger or any other transaction contemplated by the
       merger agreement.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS

     After the completion of the merger, New Parent and its subsidiaries will
honor the obligations under employment agreements, severance arrangements and
employee and director stock plans of Conoco and Phillips and their respective
subsidiaries existing as of the date of the merger agreement in accordance with
their terms.

     New Parent will also adopt and assume the employee and director stock plans
of Conoco and Phillips effective upon completion of the merger.

     Subject to obligations under applicable law, it is the intention of Conoco
and Phillips to develop new benefit plans, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the completion of the merger, which, among other things, (1) treat
similarly situated employees on a substantially equivalent basis, taking into
account all relevant factors, including duties, geographic location, tenure,
qualifications and abilities, and (2) do not discriminate between employees who
were covered by Conoco benefit plans, on the one hand, or Phillips benefit
plans, on the other hand. It is the current intention of Conoco and Phillips
that, for one year following the completion of the merger, New Parent will
provide employee benefits to employees and former employees of Conoco or
Phillips and their subsidiaries that are comparable in the aggregate to those
provided to those employees pursuant to the benefit plans of Conoco or Phillips
or their subsidiaries, respectively, in effect on the date of the merger
agreement and the date of the completion of the merger.

     With respect to benefit plans in which employees and former employees of
Conoco or Phillips become eligible to participate after the completion of the
merger, and in which such employees and former employees did not participate
prior to the completion of the merger, New Parent will:

     - waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods under
       the new benefit plan with respect to applicable participation and
       coverage requirements, except to the extent those conditions, exclusions
       and waiting periods would apply under the analogous benefit plan of
       Conoco or Phillips, as the case may be;

     - provide each employee and his or her eligible dependents with credit for
       any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the completion of the
       merger under a benefit plan of Conoco or Phillips to the same extent that
       such credit was given prior to the completion of the merger under the
       analogous benefit plan of Conoco or Phillips, as the case may be, in
       satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under
       any new benefit plan; and

     - recognize all service with Conoco and Phillips, and their respective
       affiliates, for all purposes (including purposes of eligibility to
       participate, vesting credit, entitlement to benefits, and, except with
       respect to defined benefit pension plans, benefit accrual) to the extent
       that service is taken into account under the new benefit plan, but not if
       such credit would result in the duplication of benefits.

EFFECT ON AWARDS OUTSTANDING UNDER STOCK PLANS

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, each stock option and other stock-based
award of Conoco and Phillips will be converted into a stock option to acquire,
or right in respect of, the same number of shares of New Parent common stock as
the holder of that stock option or stock-based award would have been entitled to
receive pursuant to the merger had the holder exercised that stock option or
stock-based award immediately prior to the completion of the merger. The
exercise price or base price of each Conoco stock option and Conoco stock-based
award that is converted into a New Parent stock option and New Parent
stock-based award will be equal to the exercise price or base price of the
applicable Conoco stock option or Conoco stock-based award divided by 0.4677.
The exercise price or base price of each Phillips stock option and Phillips
stock-based award that is converted into a New Parent stock option and New
Parent stock-based award will be equal to the exercise price or base price of
the applicable Phillips stock option or Phillips stock-based award. The terms
and conditions of the New Parent options and stock-based awards will otherwise
be the same as were applicable under the stock option or stock-based award of
Conoco or Phillips, as the case may be, but taking into account any changes,
including acceleration, provided for in the applicable stock plan of Conoco or
Phillips, as the case may be, in any applicable award agreement or as a result
of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. All dividend equivalents credited to the account of each holder of a
stock-based award of Conoco or Phillips as of the completion of the merger will
remain credited to that holder's account immediately following the completion of
the merger, subject to adjustment in the same manner as provided above for the
adjustment of stock-based awards of Conoco and Phillips.

     All Conoco stock options, Phillips stock options and other stock-based
awards, granted, or committed to be granted, after the merger agreement was
signed shall be on terms consistent with past practice, except that no reload
rights may be granted, and the vesting, exercisability or lapse of restrictions
with respect to any Conoco stock option, Phillips stock option or other
stock-based award will not accelerate as a result of the approval or
consummation of any transaction contemplated by the merger agreement.

"NO SOLICITATION" COVENANT

     Conoco, Phillips, their respective subsidiaries, and the directors and
officers of Conoco, Phillips and their respective subsidiaries, will not, and
Conoco and Phillips must use their reasonable best efforts to cause their and
their subsidiaries' employees, agents and representatives not to:

     - initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the
       making of any proposal or offer with respect to an acquisition proposal,

     - have any discussions with or provide any confidential information or data
       to a third party relating to an acquisition proposal, or engage in any
       negotiations regarding any acquisition proposal, or knowingly facilitate
       any effort or attempt to make or implement an acquisition proposal,

     - approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
       acquisition proposal or

     - approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or
       enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
       agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to
       any acquisition proposal.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Conoco Board of Directors and
the Phillips Board of Directors is permitted to: (1) change its recommendation
to its stockholders or (2) engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
provide any information to, a third party in response to an unsolicited bona
fide written acquisition proposal for the company, if:

     - the vote of the company's stockholders on the adoption of the merger
       agreement has not been taken;

     - in the case of clause (1) above, the company's board of directors, in
       good faith, concludes that the acquisition proposal is a superior
       proposal, and, in the case of clause (2) above, the company's board of
       directors concludes in good faith that there is a reasonable likelihood
       that an acquisition proposal would lead to a superior proposal;

     - the company's board of directors, after consultation with outside
       counsel, determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability
       that failure to take this action would violate its fiduciary obligations;

     - prior to providing any information or data to the third party, the
       company executes a confidentiality agreement with the third party having
       provisions that are at least as restrictive as the confidentiality
       agreement, dated as of November 6, 2001, between Conoco and Phillips; and

     - prior to taking any action in relation to the acquisition proposal, the
       company promptly notifies the other of the existence and the terms of
       such proposal or inquiry, including the name of the third party.

     Additionally, notwithstanding the no solicitation covenant, the Conoco
Board of Directors and the Phillips Board of Directors are permitted to comply
with applicable law (including Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).

     "Acquisition proposal" means, with respect to Conoco and Phillips, any
inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to (1) a merger, reorganization, share
exchange, consolidation, business combination, liquidation, or similar
transaction, (2) any purchase or sale of 20% or more of the consolidated assets
(including stock of its subsidiaries) of such company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (3) any purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer
for, its equity securities that, if consummated, would result in a third party
beneficially owning securities representing 20% or more of its total voting
power (or of the surviving parent entity in the transaction).

     "Superior proposal" means, with respect to Conoco and Phillips, a bona fide
proposal made by a third party that is (1) for an acquisition proposal (except
that the references to 20% shall be 50%) involving such company and (2) is on
terms which the Conoco Board of Directors or the Phillips Board of Directors, as
the case may be, in good faith concludes (following advice of its financial
advisors and

outside counsel) would result in a more favorable transaction to Conoco
stockholders or Phillips stockholders, as the case may be, from a financial
point of view and is reasonably capable of being completed.

TIMING OF CLOSING

     The closing will occur on the first business day following the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, unless Conoco and

INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

     The merger agreement provides that New Parent (1) will indemnify and hold

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

     Each of Conoco and Phillips has agreed to cooperate with each other and to
use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions and do all things necessary,
proper and advisable under the merger agreement and applicable laws to complete
the merger as soon as practicable. Accordingly, each has agreed to use its
reasonable best efforts to:

     - as promptly as practicable, prepare and file all applications, notices,
       petitions, filings, tax ruling requests and other documents, and to
       obtain all consents, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals,
       permits, rulings, authorizations and clearances from any third party or
       any domestic or foreign governmental entity necessary to complete the
       merger; and

     - take all reasonable steps to obtain all necessary consents and required
       approvals, including those required under applicable antitrust laws.

     Conoco and Phillips have also agreed to use their reasonable best efforts,
including (1) selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing of or conducting
their respective businesses in a specified manner,

or (2) agreeing to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct their
business in a specified manner, or (3) permitting the sale, holding separate or

materially impairing or delaying the merger. However, neither Conoco nor
Phillips shall be required to take any action that could reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on New Parent after giving effect to the
merger or to impair substantially the benefits that Conoco and Phillips expected
to realize from the merger at the time they entered into the merger agreement.
Also, neither Phillips nor Conoco shall be required to agree to, or effect any
divestiture, hold separate any business or take any other action that is not

     The merger agreement provides that the executive headquarters for New
Parent will be located in the Houston, Texas area and also provides for other
governance related matters. See "Directors and Management Following the Merger."

AMENDMENT; EXTENSION AND WAIVER

     The merger agreement may be amended by Conoco and Phillips, by action taken
or authorized by their respective boards of directors at any time before or
after the adoption of the merger agreement by Conoco stockholders or Phillips
stockholders. After the adoption of the merger agreement, no amendment may be
made that by law or in accordance with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange
requires further approval by Conoco stockholders or Phillips stockholders, as

- ---------------

(1) As of October 31, 2001, Vanguard as Trustee held 35,992,898 shares under the
    Phillips' Thrift Plan, Long-Term Stock Savings Plan ("LTSSP"), Retirement
    Savings Plan and Tosco Corporation's Capital Accumulation Plan ("Tosco CAP")
    (together the "Plans") with shared voting power. Vanguard and the Plans have
    disclaimed beneficial ownership of the shares held by Vanguard as Trustee of
    the Plans. Vanguard votes shares held by the Plans which represent the
    allocated interests of participants in the manner directed by individual
    participants. Employee participants in the Thrift Plan, LTSSP and Tosco CAP
    are appointed by Phillips and Tosco as fiduciaries entitled to direct the
    Trustee as to how to vote allocated shares which are not directed in these
    plans and unallocated shares held by the Thrift Plan, LTSSP and Tosco CAP.
    Such shares are allocated pro rata among employee participants accepting
    their fiduciary appointment and are voted by the Trustee as directed by the
    employee fiduciaries. The Trustee votes non-directed shares of the
    Retirement Savings Plan at its discretion. The Trustee will vote other
    shares held by the Plans at its discretion only if required to do so by
    ERISA.

    Vanguard is also the Trustee and record holder of the 27,556,573 shares in
    the Compensation and Benefits Trust ("CBT"), without any voting power.
    Vanguard has disclaimed beneficial ownership of such shares. As Trustee of
    the CBT, Vanguard will vote shares in the CBT only in accordance with the
    pro rata directions of eligible domestic employees and the trustees of
    certain international stock plans of Phillips. Trust agreements for the
    Plans and CBT each provide that all voting directions of individual
    employees received by the Trustee will be held in confidence and not be
    disclosed to any person, including Phillips.

(2) On April 10, 2001, AXA Financial, Inc. ("Alliance"), the parent of Alliance
    Capital Management L.P. which acquired the investment advisory assets of
    Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc., reported that it exercised sole voting
    power over 13,583,791 shares, shared voting power over 3,115,065 shares,
    sole dispositive power over 26,273,291 shares and shared dispositive power
    over 107,200 shares, as of March 31, 2001. According to the Schedule 13G
    filed by Alliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such shares
    equal 10.3% of the outstanding shares of Phillips common stock. However,
    when shares held as of [October 31, 2001], by the CBT and shares issued in
    the Tosco merger are included, shares held by Alliance equal only 6.5% of
    Phillips' outstanding shares.

                     UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED
                             FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The following unaudited pro forma financial statements combine the
historical consolidated balance sheets and statements of income of Conoco and
Phillips, giving effect to the merger using the purchase method of accounting.
The business combination of Conoco and Phillips is a merger of equals. Neither
company paid a premium in the stock-for-stock exchange ratio and neither company
anticipates dominating the New Parent Board of Directors. However, generally
accepted accounting principles require that one of the two companies in the
transaction be designated as the acquiror for accounting purposes. Phillips has
been designated as the acquiror based on the fact that its stockholders are
expected to hold more than 50% of the New Parent stock after the merger.

     Conoco's historical income statements have been adjusted for the pro forma
impact of the acquisition of Gulf Canada effective July 1, 2001, and Phillips'
historical income statements have been adjusted to reflect the pro forma impact
of the acquisition of Tosco Corporation on September 14, 2001. In addition,
Phillips' historical income statement for 2000 has been adjusted to reflect the
pro forma impact of the acquisition of ARCO's Alaska businesses and the
formation of the Duke Energy Field Services and Chevron Phillips Chemical
Company joint ventures during 2000.

     We are providing the following information to aid you in your analysis of
the financial aspects of the merger. We derived this information for the year
ended December 31, 2000, from the audited financial statements of Conoco and
Phillips for that year. The income statement information for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2001, and the balance sheet information at September
30, 2001, were derived from the unaudited financial information of the
companies. Conoco has provided all the information set forth herein regarding
Conoco and its subsidiaries. Phillips has provided all the information set forth
herein regarding Phillips and its subsidiaries. Neither Conoco nor Phillips
assumes any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the information
provided by the other party. THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH OUR
HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES CONTAINED IN THE ANNUAL
REPORTS AND OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS JOINT PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. SEE "WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION" ON PAGE [ ].

     The unaudited pro forma combined statements of income assume the merger was
effected on January 1, 2000. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet
gives effect to the merger as if it had occurred on September 30, 2001. Except
for planned major maintenance expenditures, the accounting policies of Conoco
and Phillips are substantially comparable.

     The unaudited pro forma combined information is for illustrative purposes
only. The financial results may have been different had the companies always
been combined. Further, the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do
not reflect the effect of asset dispositions, if any, that may be required by
order of regulatory authorities, restructuring charges that will be incurred to
fully integrate and operate the combined organization more efficiently, or
anticipated synergies resulting from the merger. You should not rely on the pro
forma combined financial information as being indicative of the historical
results that would have been achieved had the companies always been combined or
the future results that New Parent will experience.

               NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(a)  Phillips' historical income statements for the year ended December 31,
     2000, and the nine months ended September 30, 2001, have been adjusted on a
     pro forma basis to reflect the acquisition of Tosco on September 14, 2001,
     as if it had occurred on January 1, 2000. During the third quarter of 2001,
     Phillips began including excise taxes on the sales of petroleum products in
     operating revenues, with the corresponding expense included in taxes other
     than income taxes. Prior periods have been restated to reflect this change
     in presentation.

     The significant pro forma adjustments that were made for the acquisition of
     Tosco were:

     - Estimated income statement impacts resulting from the purchase price
       allocation to the Tosco assets and liabilities -- for example increased
       depreciation due to the step-up of the property, plant and equipment to
       fair value. These preliminary purchase price allocations have not yet
       been finalized;

      - The conforming of Tosco's accounting policies to Phillips'; and

      - An increase in average common shares outstanding for stock and stock
        options issued in the acquisition.

      For additional information on this transaction, including pro forma
      financial presentations, see Phillips' Current Report on Form 8-K filed on
      September 28, 2001, as amended by filings on Form 8-K/A on October 31, and
      November 13, 2001.

      Phillips' income statement information for the year ended December 31,
      2000, has been further adjusted on a pro forma basis to reflect four
      significant transactions that were consummated during 2000:

      - The disposition of Phillips' gas gathering, processing and marketing
        business, and the simultaneous acquisition of a 30.3% equity interest in
        Duke Energy Field Services on March 31, 2000;

      - The acquisition of ARCO's Alaska businesses, completed in two phases on
        April 26 and August 1, 2000;

      - The disposition of Phillips' chemicals business, and the simultaneous
        acquisition of a 50% equity interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical
        Company on July 1, 2000; and

      - The disposition of Tosco's Avon refinery on August 31, 2000;

      as if they had occurred January 1, 2000.

      The significant pro forma adjustments that were made for the Duke Energy
      Field Services and Chevron Phillips Chemical Company transactions were:

      - The removal of Phillips' chemical and gas gathering, processing, and
        marketing businesses from consolidation;

      - The inclusion of Phillips' estimated 50% and 30.3% equity interest
        earnings from Chevron Phillips Chemical Company and Duke Energy Field
        Services, respectively, based on the pro forma financial results of
        those two entities prior to their inception; and

      - The amortization of the basis difference between the book value of
        Phillips' contributions to Duke Energy Field Services and Chevron
        Phillips Chemical Company, and its equity in the two entities.

      For additional information about these two transactions, including pro
      forma financial presentations, see Phillips' Current Report on Form 8-K
      filed on April 13, 2000, related to the Duke Energy Field Services
      transaction; and Phillips' Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 14,
      2000, related to the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company transaction.

      The significant pro forma adjustments that were made for the acquisition
      of ARCO's Alaska businesses were:

      - Estimated income statement impacts resulting from the purchase price
        allocation to the Alaska assets and liabilities -- for example,
        increased depreciation due to the step-up of the property, plant and
        equipment to fair-market value. These preliminary purchase price
        allocations continued to be refined during 2000 and into 2001;

      - The conforming of ARCO's accounting policies to Phillips'; and

      - An increase in interest expense due to the debt incurred to partially
        fund the acquisition.

      For additional information on this transaction, including pro forma
      financial presentations, see Phillips' Current Report on Form 8-K filed on
      May 18, 2000.

(b)  Conoco's historical income statements for the year ended December 31, 2000,
     and the nine months ended September 30, 2001, have been adjusted on a pro
     forma basis to reflect the July 1, 2001, acquisition of Gulf Canada, as if
     it occurred on January 1, 2000.

      The as-adjusted income for the year ended December 31, 2000, of $1,890
      million is the total of Conoco's historical income of $1,902 million, Gulf
      Canada's as-adjusted income of $183 million (which includes the November
      2000 Crestar acquisition), and net purchase price adjustments related to
      Gulf Canada of $(195) million (see Conoco's Current Report on Form 8-K
      filed on July 31, 2001, as amended by Form 8-K/A filed September 10, 2001,
      and Current Report on Form 8-K filed October 22, 2001).

      The as-adjusted income for the nine months ended September 30, 2001, of
      $1,564 million is the total of Conoco's historical income of $1,449
      million (see Form 10-Q filed on November 7, 2001), Gulf Canada's
      historical income of $185 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001,
      and net purchase price adjustments related to Gulf Canada of $(70) million
      (see Conoco's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 31, 2001, as
      amended by Form 8-K/A filed September 10, 2001, and Current Report on Form
      8-K filed October 22, 2001).

(c)  The following is a preliminary estimate of the deemed purchase price for
     Conoco on a purchase accounting basis:

     Number of shares of New Parent common stock
       expected to be issued in the exchange.......         292.5   million
     Multiplied by Phillips' average stock price
       two days before and after the announcement
       date........................................  X    $ 53.15
                                                          -------
                                                          $15,546   million
     Estimated fair value of Conoco stock options
       expected to be exchanged for New Parent
       stock options...............................           327   million
     Estimated transaction-related costs...........            50   million
                                                          -------
     Total.........................................       $15,923   million
                                                          =======

     For purposes of this pro forma analysis, the above deemed purchase price
     has been allocated based on a preliminary assessment of the fair value of
     the assets and liabilities of Conoco at September 30, 2001. The pro forma
     income statement adjustments reflect the estimated effects of depreciating
     and amortizing these purchase accounting adjusted balances in properties,
     plants and equipment, equity method investments, and identifiable
     intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. The preliminary
     assessment of fair value resulted in $950 million of tradename assets with
     indefinite lives and $9,309 million of goodwill, both of which will be
     subject to periodic impairment testing instead of amortization.

     Due to the non-taxable nature of this transaction, Conoco's tax basis in
     its assets would carry over to the New Parent. The difference between the
     financial and tax bases is estimated to result in approximately $6,067
     million of net deferred tax liabilities and an increase in goodwill in the
     purchase price allocation.

(d)  Conforms Conoco's accounting policy on planned major maintenance to
     Phillips', expensing the costs of such maintenance as incurred.

(e)  Under Phillips' current accounting policy and current prevalent industry
     accounting practice for the acquisition of oil and gas businesses, the New
     Parent will not record an initial liability for the estimated costs of
     removing Conoco's properties, plants and equipment at the end of their
     useful lives. Instead, a preliminary estimate of $1,100 million of such
     removal costs will be accrued as an additional component of future
     depreciation, building the liability for removal over the remaining lives
     of the properties, plants and equipment on a unit-of-production basis.

(f)  Includes the impact of discounting Conoco's estimated environmental
     liabilities and recording the related accretion.

(g)  Capitalization of interest based on the estimated fair value of Conoco's
     qualifying assets.

(h)  Reflects the estimated income tax effects of the pro forma adjustments to
     Conoco's pretax income.

(i)  Adjustment to increase Conoco's pension and other post-retirement benefit
     obligations to the estimated difference between projected benefit
     obligations and plan assets.

(j)  Included in the preliminary assessment of fair value of Conoco was an
     estimated $100 million for the value of in-process research and
     development projects. Under generally accepted accounting principles, this
     value, net of its related deferred tax liability, would be charged against
     earnings immediately after consummation of the merger. Due to the
     non-recurring nature of this one-time charge, the pro forma income
     statements do not include this charge. The after-tax effect of the charge
     is reflected in the pro forma balance sheet as a reduction of common
     stockholders' equity.

(k)  Reflects the exchange of outstanding Conoco stock, the issuance of 292.5
     million shares of New Parent common stock, and the effect of New Parent's
     stock options issued in the exchange to Conoco stock option holders.

                    DESCRIPTION OF NEW PARENT CAPITAL STOCK

     The following description of the material terms of the capital stock of New
Parent includes a summary of specified provisions of New Parent's restated
certificate of incorporation and by-laws that will be in effect upon completion
of the merger. This description is subject to the relevant provisions of
Delaware law and is qualified by reference to New Parent's restated certificate
of incorporation and by-laws, copies of which are attached as Annex B and C,
respectively, to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and are incorporated in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus by reference.

AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK

     New Parent will be authorized to issue 2.5 billion shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, and 500 million shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.01 per share.

COMMON STOCK

     The shares of New Parent common stock to be issued in the merger will be
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Each holder of
New Parent common stock will be entitled to one vote per share in the election
of directors and on all other matters submitted to the vote of stockholders;
provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of New
Parent common stock will not be entitled to vote on any amendment to New
Parent's restated certificate of incorporation that relates solely to the terms
of any series of New Parent preferred stock if holders of the New Parent
preferred stock are entitled to vote on the amendment under New Parent's
restated certificate of incorporation or Delaware law. No holder of New Parent
common stock may cumulate votes in voting for New Parent directors.

     Subject to the rights of the holders of any New Parent preferred stock that
may be outstanding from time to time, each share of New Parent common stock will
have an equal and ratable right to receive dividends as may be declared by the
New Parent Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the payment of
dividends, and, in the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
New Parent, will be entitled to share equally and ratably in the assets
available for distribution to New Parent stockholders. No holder of New Parent
common stock will have any preemptive right to subscribe for any securities of
New Parent.

     Application will be made to list New Parent common stock on the New York
Stock Exchange under the trading symbol "COP." [  ] will be the transfer agent
and registrar for New Parent common stock.

PREFERRED STOCK

     New Parent's restated certificate of incorporation permits New Parent to
issue up to 500 million shares of New Parent preferred stock in one or more
series with designations and powers, preferences, and rights, and such
qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, as may be fixed by the New
Parent Board of Directors without any further action by New Parent stockholders.

     In connection with New Parent's adoption of a rights plan (as described
below), [10] million shares of New Parent preferred stock will be designated
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. New Parent Series A preferred
stock will be issuable only in connection with the exercise of rights under the
rights plan.

     Each share of New Parent Series A preferred stock will be entitled to a
minimum preferential quarterly dividend payment per share of the greater of $1
or 100 times the dividend declared per share of New Parent common stock. In the
event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of New Parent, the holders
of New Parent Series A preferred stock will be entitled to a minimum
preferential liquidation payment per share equal to the greater of $100 (plus
all accrued and unpaid dividends) or 100 times the liquidation payment made per
share of New Parent common stock. Each share of New Parent Series A preferred
stock will have 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of New Parent
stockholders, voting together with the New Parent common stock. In the event of
any merger, consolidation or other

transaction in which shares of New Parent common stock are exchanged for
securities, cash and/or any other property, each share of New Parent Series A
preferred stock will be entitled to receive 100 times the amount of securities,
cash and/or other properties received per share of New Parent common stock.
These rights will be protected by customary antidilution provisions.

RIGHTS PLAN

     Before the effective time of the merger, New Parent will enter into a
rights agreement. As with most rights agreements, the terms of the New Parent
rights agreement are complex and not easily summarized, particularly as they
relate to the acquisition of New Parent common stock and to the exercisability
of the rights. Accordingly, this summary may not contain all of the information
that is important to you, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
form of the New Parent rights agreement which we have filed as an exhibit to the
registration statement on Form S-4 of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is a part.

     Under the terms of the New Parent rights agreement, each share of New
Parent common stock issued will have attached to it a right to purchase one
one-hundredth of a share of New Parent Series A preferred stock. The purchase
price per one-hundredth of a share of New Parent Series A preferred stock under
our rights agreement will be determined prior to the effective time of the
merger.

     Initially, the rights under the New Parent rights agreement will be
attached to certificates representing New Parent common stock and no separate
certificates representing the rights will be distributed. The rights will
separate from the New Parent common stock and be represented by separate
certificates at the earlier of (1) the first date of a public announcement that
a person has acquired 15% or more of the outstanding New Parent common stock or
(2) the date as may be determined by the New Parent Board of Directors after the
commencement by a person of a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of
the outstanding New Parent common stock.

     After the rights separate from the New Parent common stock, certificates
representing the rights will be mailed to record holders of New Parent common
stock. Once distributed, the rights certificates alone will represent the
rights.

     The rights will not be exercisable until the date the rights separate from
the New Parent common stock. The rights will expire on the tenth anniversary of
the date of the rights agreement unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by New
Parent.

     If an acquiror obtains beneficial ownership of 15% or more of New Parent
common stock, then each right will be adjusted so that it will entitle the
holder (other than the acquiror, whose rights will become void) to purchase a
number of shares of New Parent common stock equal to two times the exercise
price of the right.

     If an acquiror obtains beneficial ownership of 15% or more of New Parent
common stock and any of the following occurs:

     - New Parent merges into or consolidates with another entity,

     - an acquiring entity merges into New Parent with New Parent as the
       surviving entity and the outstanding shares of New Parent common stock
       are converted into cash, property or securities, or

     - New Parent sells more than 50% of its assets or earning power;

then each right will entitle the holder to purchase a number of shares of common
stock of the acquiror having a then-current market value of twice the exercise
price of the right.

     In the event of a public announcement of an acquiror obtaining beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of New Parent common stock
(but only if the beneficial ownership of the acquiror is less than 50%), the New
Parent Board of Directors may, at its option, exchange all or a part of the
outstanding rights for New Parent common stock at an exchange ratio of one share
of New Parent common stock per right, adjusted to reflect stock splits, stock
dividends or similar transactions.

     The New Parent Board of Directors may, at its option, redeem the rights, in
whole but not in part, at any time prior to the time an acquiror obtains
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of New Parent
common stock. The redemption price will be $.01 per right, adjusted to reflect
stock splits, stock dividends or similar transactions. New Parent may, at its
option, pay the redemption price in cash, common stock or other consideration as
deemed appropriate by the New Parent Board of Directors.

     The terms of the rights may be amended by the New Parent Board of Directors
without the consent of the holders of the rights, except that, after an acquiror
obtains 15% or more of New Parent common stock, the New Parent rights agreement
may not be amended in any manner that would adversely affect the interests of
the rights holders.

     The New Parent rights agreement will contain rights that will have certain
anti-takeover effects. The rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or
group that attempts to acquire New Parent on terms not approved by the New
Parent Board of Directors. However, since the rights may either be redeemed or
otherwise made inapplicable by New Parent prior to an acquiror obtaining
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of New Parent common stock, the rights
should not interfere with any merger or business combination approved by the New
Parent Board of Directors prior to that occurrence. In addition, the rights
should not interfere with a proxy contest.

                        COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS

     Conoco, Phillips and New Parent are incorporated under the laws of the
State of Delaware. In accordance with the merger agreement, at the effective
time of the merger, the holders of Conoco common stock and Phillips common stock
will exchange their respective shares of common stock for New Parent common
stock. Your rights as a New Parent stockholder will be governed by Delaware law
and New Parent's restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws of New
Parent. The following is a comparison of the material rights of Conoco
stockholders, Phillips stockholders and New Parent stockholders under each
company's organizational documents and the statutory framework in Delaware.

     The forms of the New Parent restated certificate of incorporation and
by-laws are included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B and
Annex C, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. Copies of the
restated certificates of incorporation and by-laws of Conoco and Phillips were
previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. See "References to
Additional Information" and "Where You Can Find More Information" on page [ ].

                       NOTE TO CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     CorvettePorsche Corp. (the company) was incorporated in the state of
Delaware on November 16, 2001. CorvettePorsche Corp. has two stockholders,
Conoco Inc. (Conoco) and Phillips Petroleum Company (Phillips), each holding one
share of the company's common stock, par value $.01. Phillips contributed $100
for its share on November 30, 2001, while Conoco contributed $100 for its share
on December 4, 2001. The company was formed in connection with the anticipated
merger of Conoco and Phillips.

     The company has two wholly owned subsidiaries -- Corvette Merger Corp. and
Porsche Merger Corp. At the effective date of the merger, Corvette Merger Corp.
would merge with and into Conoco, and Porsche Merger Corp. would merge with and
into Phillips, at which point Corvette Merger Corp. and Porsche Merger Corp.
would no longer exist as separate corporate entities, and the company's only two
wholly owned subsidiaries would be Conoco and Phillips. Upon completion of the
merger, the name of the company will change to ConocoPhillips. Also at that
time, each outstanding share of Conoco common stock would be converted into
0.4677 of a share of the company's common stock, and each outstanding share of
Phillips common stock would be converted into one share of the company's common
stock. This action will necessitate the authorization of additional common
shares of the company before the merger takes place.

     The consolidated balance sheet includes the accounts of the company and its
two wholly owned subsidiaries, Corvette Merger Corp. and Porsche Merger Corp.
Intercompany accounts have been eliminated. Other than its formation, the
company and its subsidiaries have not conducted any activities.

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
balance sheet.
