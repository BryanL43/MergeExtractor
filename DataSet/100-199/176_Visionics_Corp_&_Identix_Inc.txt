                                                                          , 2002

Dear Stockholders of Identix Incorporated and Stockholders of Visionics
Corporation:

                  A MERGER PROPOSAL -- YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT

     Identix Incorporated and Visionics Corporation have agreed to a merger of
equals in which Visionics will merge with a subsidiary of Identix and Visionics
will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Identix. We are proposing this merger
to our respective stockholders because we believe the combined strengths of our
two companies will enable us to create a global leader in the security industry.

     Identix is a leader in designing, developing, manufacturing and marketing
products for the capture and/or comparison of fingerprints for security,
anti-fraud, law enforcement, physical access and other applications. Identix
designs and develops proprietary, cost-effective, security products and
solutions for personal identification and verification. Visionics is a leader in
designing, developing, manufacturing and marketing identification technologies
and systems, including without limitation biometric fingerprint live scan
products and systems and award winning biometric facial recognition technology.

     Already recognized as leaders in their respective fields, both companies
believe that the merger will create a company strategically positioned at the
forefront of the security industry to better respond to the increased demand for
biometric products and solutions across multiple security markets. The companies
believe the combined entity will have the broad-based products, services and
solutions, size, assets, customer base and operational efficiency to accelerate
revenue growth and accomplish sustained profitability.

     We believe that offering a total security solution, sold through multiple
sales channels to federal, state and local government customers, consumers and
businesses of all sizes, will provide an accelerated revenue growth opportunity
and operational efficiencies for the combined company resulting from the merger.
When the merger is completed, stockholders of Visionics will receive for each
share of Visionics common stock 1.3436 shares of Identix common stock.
Approximately 38.8 million shares of Identix common stock will be issued in
exchange for outstanding shares of Visionics common stock. In addition,
approximately 3.8 million shares will be issuable on exercise of Visionics
options and 0.7 million shares will be issuable on exercise of Visionics
warrants to be assumed by Identix. Identix' common stock is listed on the Nasdaq
National Market under the trading symbol "IDNX." On [               ], 2002, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on the merger, the
closing price of Identix common stock was $[               ] per share.

     Each of the boards of directors of Identix and Visionics have unanimously
determined the merger to be fair to and in the best interests of the
stockholders of their respective companies. The boards of directors of both
Identix and Visionics have unanimously approved the merger and recommend their
respective stockholders vote FOR the merger proposal. The joint proxy
statement/prospectus provides detailed information concerning Identix,
Visionics, the merger and proposals related to the merger. WE URGE YOU TO READ

15.

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q: WHY ARE WE PROPOSING THE MERGER?

A: We believe that combining the products, services and technologies of the two
   companies will create a company strategically positioned at the forefront of
   the security industry to even better respond to the increased demand for
   biometric products and solutions across multiple security markets. Relative
   to the separate businesses, the combined company will have a larger customer
   base, greater depth of skilled personnel, stronger research and development
   capability, greater financial strength, a more concentrated sales effort and
   a higher market profile and operational efficiencies, all of which we believe
   will create greater market opportunities for us and enhance the potential for
   greater value for our respective stockholders.

Q: WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE MERGER?

A: In the merger, Visionics will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Identix.
   Based on the capitalization of Identix and Visionics as of February 22, 2002,
   the stockholders of Visionics will receive approximately 38.8 million shares
   of Identix common stock, representing an aggregate of approximately 46.4% of
   Identix' outstanding common stock following the merger. Approximately 4.5
   million additional shares of Identix common stock would become issuable upon
   the exercise of Visionics stock options and upon exercise of Visionics
   warrants assumed by Identix.

Q: WHAT WILL VISIONICS' STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A: Visionics' stockholders will receive 1.3436 shares of Identix common stock
   for each share of Visionics common stock they own. Identix will not issue
   fractional shares of stock. Instead, Visionics' stockholders will receive
   cash based on the closing price of a share of Identix common stock on the
   trading day immediately preceding the effective time of the merger instead of
   any fractional share. For example, a holder of one share of Visionics common
   stock will receive one share of Identix common stock and an amount of cash
   equal to 0.3436 times the closing price of a share of Identix common stock
   when the merger is completed.

Q: WHAT IS THE VALUE PER SHARE TO BE RECEIVED BY THE VISIONICS' STOCKHOLDERS?

A: The number of shares of Identix common stock to be issued for each share of
   Visionics common stock is fixed at 1.3436 shares and will not be adjusted
   based upon changes in the respective values of these shares. As a result, the
   value of the shares of Identix common stock to be issued to Visionics'
   stockholders in connection with the merger will not be known until
   immediately prior to the closing of the merger, and may go up or down as the
   market price of Identix common stock fluctuates. The merger agreement does
   not permit either party to terminate its obligations to complete the merger
   or resolicit the vote of its stockholders based solely on changes in the
   value of Identix or Visionics common stock. Visionics shares will be
   exchanged for 1.3436 shares of Identix common stock and Visionics common
   stock will cease to trade. Identix stockholders will continue to own their
   shares of Identix common stock after the merger.

Q: DO THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF IDENTIX AND VISIONICS RECOMMEND VOTING IN FAVOR
OF THE MERGER?

A: Yes. The Visionics board of directors has unanimously approved, and
   recommends that its stockholders vote in favor of, adopting the merger
   agreement. Similarly, the Identix board of directors has unanimously
   approved, and recommends that its stockholders vote in favor of, the issuance
   of Identix common stock in the merger. For a more complete description of the
   recommendations of the boards of directors of both companies, see the
   sections titled "The Merger -- Identix' reasons for the merger" on page 35,
   "-- Recommendation of the Identix board of directors" on page 42,
   "-- Visionics' reasons for the merger" on page 42 and "-- Recommendation of
   the Visionics board of directors" on page 50.

Q: ARE THERE RISKS I SHOULD CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHETHER TO VOTE FOR THE MERGER?

A: Yes. In evaluating the merger, you should carefully consider the factors
   discussed in the section titled "Risk Factors" on page 15.

Q: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A: Mail your signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as
   possible so that your shares may be represented at your meeting. You may
   instead vote by following the telephone or Internet instructions on the proxy
   card. If you return a properly signed proxy card but do not include
   instructions on how to vote your proxy, your shares will be voted "FOR"
   adoption of the merger agreement if you are a Visionics stockholder, and
   "FOR" the issuance of Identix common stock in the merger, the amendment to
   Identix' certificate of incorporation and the adoption of the Identix 2002
   Equity Incentive Plan if you are an Identix stockholder. For a more complete
   description of voting at the meetings, see the sections titled "The Identix
   Special Meeting -- Voting of proxies" on page 28 and "The Visionics Special
   Meeting -- Voting of proxies" on page 31.

Q: WHAT DO I DO IF I WANT TO CHANGE MY VOTE?

A: If you want to change your vote, send the secretary of Identix or Visionics,
   as appropriate, a later-dated, signed proxy card before your meeting or
   attend your meeting in person. You may also revoke your proxy by sending
   written, dated notice to the secretary of Identix or Visionics, as
   appropriate, before your meeting. For a more complete description of how to
   change your vote, see the sections titled "The Identix Special
   Meeting -- Voting of proxies" on page 28 and "The Visionics Special
   Meeting -- Voting of proxies" on page 31.

Q: IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
SHARES FOR ME?

A: Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to
   vote by following the information provided to you by your broker. For a more
   complete description of voting shares held in "street name," see the sections
   titled "The Identix Special Meeting -- Voting of proxies" on page 28 and "The
   Visionics Special Meeting -- Voting of proxies" on page 31.

Q: SHOULD I SEND IN MY VISIONICS STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A: No. After the merger is completed, you will be sent written instructions for
   exchanging your Visionics stock certificates for Identix stock certificates.
   PLEASE DO NOT SEND YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH YOUR PROXY.

Q: WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A: We hope to complete the merger by June 30, 2002. However, the exact timing of
   completion of the merger cannot be determined at this time because completion
   of the merger is subject to a number of conditions. For a complete
   description of the conditions to completion of the merger, see the section
   titled "The Merger Agreement -- Conditions to the merger" on page 65.

Q: AS A VISIONICS STOCKHOLDER, WILL I RECOGNIZE A GAIN OR LOSS ON THE EXCHANGE
   OF MY VISIONICS STOCK FOR IDENTIX STOCK IN THE MERGER?

A: We expect that if the merger is completed, you will not recognize gain or
   loss for United States federal income tax purposes, except that Visionics
   stockholders will recognize gain or loss with respect to cash received
   instead of fractional shares. However, Visionics stockholders are urged to
   consult their own tax advisors to determine their particular tax
   consequences. For a more complete description of the tax consequences, see
   the section titled "The Merger -- Material United States federal income tax
   consequences of the merger" on page 54.

Q: AM I ENTITLED TO DISSENTERS' OR APPRAISAL RIGHTS?

A: Under Delaware law, neither stockholders of Visionics nor stockholders of
   Identix are entitled to dissenters' or appraisal rights in the merger.

Q: WHOM SHOULD I CALL WITH QUESTIONS?

A: Visionics stockholders should call Visionics Investor Relations at (201)
   332-9213, Ext. 205 with any questions about the merger. Identix stockholders
   should call Identix Investor Relations at (408) 335-1547 with any questions
   about the merger. You may also obtain additional information about Identix
   and Visionics from the documents each company files with the Securities and
   Exchange Commission, as more fully described in the section titled "Where you
   can find more information" on page 88.

     Visionics is in the business of empowering identification through the use
of biometrics, the science of identifying individuals by measuring
distinguishable physical or behavioral characteristics. Biometrics is used to
determine physical access or logical access. Visionics' biometric identification
technology, systems and information technology services enable customers to
identify individuals for physical or logical access; help commercial employers
and government agencies to conduct background checks on applicants for
employment or permits; or verify identity for the purposes of issuing
identification documents, conducting transactions, or conducting criminal
investigations. Visionics' product and service offerings include computer-based
face recognition, fingerprinting, and photographic systems, software tools,
multi-media data storage and communications servers, and the systems integration
and software development services required to deploy and use these systems.

     Visionics has evolved from essentially a single-product live scan hardware
supplier to an identification information systems company. Visionics has two
established product lines and two product lines in various stages of
development.

     Fingerprint live scan -- These systems combine patented, high-resolution
optics and specialized hardware and software with industry-standard computers.
They capture, digitize and transmit forensic-grade fingerprint images and
related data to large-scale databases. The database systems, along with
fingerprint matching algorithms, are maintained on AFIS supplied by other
vendors.

     FaceIt(R) Face Recognition -- FaceIt(R) is an award-winning facial
recognition software engine that allows computers to rapidly and accurately
detect and recognize faces. FaceIt is a core technology that enables a broad
range of products and applications built by developers and partners (original
equipment manufacturers "OEMs", value-added resellers "VARs" and system
integrators). These include enhanced CCTV systems, identity fraud applications
and authentication systems for information security, access control, travel,
banking and e-commerce. Our FaceIt technology product offerings include software
development toolkits, run-time licenses and application software.

     Identification Based Information System ("IBIS") -- IBIS is a patented
wireless, real-time mobile identification system that combines expertise in
biometric capture and connectivity. The system is capable of capturing
photographs and forensic quality fingerprints for transmission to law
enforcement and other legacy databases. The IBIS system currently is undergoing
testing by customers in Minnesota and California.

     Biometric Network Platform ("BNP") -- The BNP is a development stage
technology framework for building scalable biometric solutions. The BNP is made
up of the following:

     Biometric Network Appliances ("BNAs") -- BNAs are individual hardware
components within the BNP platform. Each component is dedicated to performing a
specific task such as capturing a facial image, creating a biometric template,
and matching the images against a database.

     Application-Specific Business Logic -- While the BNAs are dedicated to
performing one specific task surrounding identification, the business logic
tells what action should be taken based on either a match being made or not.

THE MERGER

     In the merger, Visionics and a wholly owned subsidiary of Identix will
merge, and Visionics will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Identix. As a
result of the merger, Visionics stockholders will own approximately 46.4% of the
combined entity. Every share of Visionics will be exchanged for 1.3436 shares of
Identix. The merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex A. We encourage you to read the merger agreement
carefully.

Identix are entitled to dissenters' or appraisal rights in the merger.

NO OTHER NEGOTIATIONS

     Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated,
Visionics and Identix have agreed, with limited exceptions, not to take any
action, directly or indirectly, with respect to any Visionics Acquisition
Proposal or any Identix Acquisition Proposal, each as defined on page 62. For a

titled "The Merger Agreement -- No solicitation," on page 61, "-- Termination of

page 63 and the corresponding sections of the merger agreement.

CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

     Identix' and Visionics' respective obligations to complete the merger are
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions. For a
discussion of these conditions, see the section titled "The Merger Agreement --
Conditions to the merger" on page 65.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     Under certain circumstances, Identix and Visionics each has the right to

titled "The Merger Agreement -- Fees, expenses and termination fee" on page 63.

OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS

     In deciding to approve the merger, the Identix board of directors
considered, among other things, an opinion from Lehman Brothers Inc. ("Lehman
Brothers"), its financial advisor, that as of February 22, 2002, and based on
and subject to certain matters stated therein, from a financial point of view,
the exchange ratio to be offered by Identix in the merger of 1.3436 shares of
Identix common stock for each share of Visionics stock common stock was fair to
Identix stockholders. The Visionics board of directors considered, among other
things, an opinion from its financial advisor, Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.
("Morgan Keegan"), that as of February 22, 2002, from a financial point of view,
the exchange ratio to be received by Visionics in the merger was fair to the
holders of Visionics common stock.

     For a more complete description of the financial advisors' opinions, see
the sections entitled "The Merger -- Opinion of financial advisor to Identix" on
page 36 and "-- Opinion of financial advisor to Visionics" on page 43. These
opinions are attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annexes B and
C and we urge you to read them in their entirety.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

     We expect the merger to be treated as a tax-free reorganization for federal
income tax purposes. Assuming the merger qualifies as a reorganization,
Visionics stockholders will not recognize gain or loss on the exchange of their
Visionics stock for Identix stock in the merger, except for gain on fractional
shares of Identix common stock for which cash is received. Identix stockholders
will not recognize any gain or loss in connection with the merger.

     Tax matters are complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you
may depend on your own situation. For a more complete description of the tax
consequences of the merger, see "The Merger -- Material federal income tax
consequences of the merger" on page 54.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER

     We intend to account for the merger using the purchase method of accounting
under generally accepted accounting principles within the United States. For a
more complete description of the accounting treatment of the merger see the
section titled "The Merger -- Accounting treatment of the merger" on page 56.

REGULATORY FILINGS AND APPROVALS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER

     The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act, which prevents certain transactions from being
completed until required information and materials are furnished to the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission
and the applicable waiting periods end or expire. For a more complete
description of the regulatory filings and approvals necessary to complete the
merger, see the section titled "Regulatory filings and approvals required to
complete the merger" on page 57.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

     Certain members of Identix and Visionics management and of the Identix and
Visionics boards of directors have interests in the merger that are different
from, or are in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. These interests
include:

     - Dr. Joseph J. Atick, current chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
       Visionics, has entered into an employment agreement relating to his
       service as the Chief Executive Officer upon completion of the merger;

     - Robert McCashin, current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Identix,
       has entered into an amendment to employment agreement relating to his
       service as Chairman of the Board upon completion of the merger;

     - James P. Scullion, President and Chief Operating Officer of Identix, has
       entered into an employment agreement relating to his service in the same
       role upon completion of the merger;

     - Erik E. Prusch, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of
       Identix, will assume the same role in the merged entity;

     - Robert F. Gallagher, Chief Financial Officer of Visionics, has entered
       into a change of control agreement with Visionics;

     - vesting of restricted shares of common stock and options to purchase
       shares of Visionics common stock held by directors of Visionics and
       options to purchase shares of Identix common stock held by directors of
       Identix will be accelerated upon completion of the merger; and

     - the combined entity's board of directors will initially consist of eight
       directors, four designated by each of Identix and Visionics, which will
       include Mr. McCashin and Dr. Atick. After the closing of the merger, the
       parties will appoint a ninth board member mutually agreed upon by the
       parties.

     As a result, these officers and directors of Visionics and Identix could be
more likely to recommend the adoption of the merger agreement by Visionics
stockholders and issuance of the shares in the merger by Identix stockholders
than if they did not have these interests. For a more complete description of
the interests of certain persons in the merger see the sections titled "The
Merger -- Interests of certain persons in the merger" on page 50 and "The
Merger -- Employment and change in control arrangements" on page 52.

RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY TO SELL IDENTIX STOCK

     All shares of Identix common stock received by Visionics stockholders in
connection with the merger will be freely transferable unless the holder is
considered an affiliate of either Identix or Visionics under the Securities Act.
For a more complete description of transfer restrictions applicable to our
affiliates see the section titled "The Merger -- Restrictions on sales of shares
by affiliates of Identix or Visionics" on page 58.

ADDITIONAL MATTERS TO BE VOTED UPON BY IDENTIX STOCKHOLDERS

     At the Identix special meeting, the stockholders of Identix will also vote
on:

     - an amendment to Identix' certificate of incorporation to increase the
       number of authorized shares of common stock by 100,000,000 shares to
       200,000,000 shares; and

     - adoption of the Identix 2002 Equity Incentive Plan and the reservation
       for issuance thereunder of 5,800,000 shares of Identix common stock.

     For a more complete description of these votes, see the section titled
"Additional Matters Being Submitted to a Vote of Only Identix Stockholders" on
page 82.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS

     Statements contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the
documents incorporated into this joint proxy statement/prospectus by reference
that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements within
the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. These statements include statements with respect to Identix' and
Visionics' financial condition, results of operations and business and on the
expected effect of the merger on Identix' financial performance. Words such as

differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking
statements. These risks and uncertainties include:

       corresponding adjustment to the number of shares of Identix stock to be
       received by Visionics stockholders);

     - the possibility that the market value of the Visionics common stock to be
       exchanged for Identix common stock will decrease prior to completion of
       the merger (the merger agreement does not provide for a corresponding
       adjustment to the number of shares of Identix stock to be issued to
       Visionics stockholders);

     - the possibility that one or more of the conditions to the merger will not
       be satisfied and the merger will not be consummated;

     - the possibility that the anticipated benefits from the merger will not be
       fully realized;

     - the possibility that timing, costs or difficulties related to the
       integration of our businesses and infrastructure are greater than
       expected;

     - the effect of competition on revenues and margins;

     - rapidly changing technology and shifting demand requirements;

     - the effect of the costs of completing the merger and future amortization
       of certain intangible assets on results of operations;

     - other risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties
       involved in continued acceptance of the combined company's products and
       services; and

     - other risk factors as may be detailed from time to time in Visionics' and
       Identix' public announcements and filings with the Securities and
       Exchange Commission.

     In evaluating the merger, you should carefully consider the discussion of
these and other factors in the section titled "Risk Factors" beginning on page
15.

     This summary may not contain all of the information that is important to
you. Investors should read carefully this entire document and the other

- ---------------

(1) The historical net book value per Identix common share and Visionics common
    share is computed by dividing common stockholders' equity at period end by
    the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the respective period
    end. The pro forma net book value per combined company's common share is
    computed by dividing the pro forma common stockholders' equity by the pro
    forma number of shares of Identix common stock outstanding at the respective
    period end, assuming the merger had occurred as of that date.

(2) Shares used to calculate unaudited pro forma loss per combined company's
    basic and diluted share before cumulative effect of a change in accounting
    principle were computed by adding 39.1 million shares assumed to be issued
    in exchange for the outstanding Visionics' shares and for shares assumed to
    be issued to financial advisors in connection with this transaction to
    Identix' weighted average outstanding shares.

(3) The equivalent pro forma combined per Visionics share is calculated by
    multiplying the pro forma combined amounts by the exchange ratio of 1.3436
    shares of Identix common stock for each share of Visionics common stock.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     The merger involves a high degree of risk for both Visionics and Identix
stockholders. Visionics stockholders will be choosing to invest in Identix
common stock by voting in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. An
investment in Identix common stock involves a high degree of risk. Both
Visionics and Identix stockholders will decide to combine the businesses of
Identix and Visionics, which will change the business of each of Visionics and
Identix. This change involves significant risk. In addition to the other
information contained or incorporated by reference in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, both Identix and Visionics stockholders should carefully
consider the following risk factors in deciding whether to vote for the issuance
of shares of Identix common stock in connection with the merger, in the case of
Identix stockholders, or for adoption of the merger agreement, in the case of
Visionics stockholders.

                      RISKS RELATED TO THE PROPOSED MERGER

THE EXCHANGE RATIO IS FIXED, SO THE MARKET VALUE OF THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED
BY VISIONICS STOCKHOLDERS WILL CHANGE AS THE MARKET PRICE OF IDENTIX COMMON
STOCK GOES UP OR DOWN.

     The exchange ratio is fixed at 1.3436 shares of Identix common stock for
each share of Visionics common stock and will not be adjusted in the event of
changes in the market prices of either the Identix common stock or the Visionics
common stock. If the market price of Identix common stock changes, the value of
the consideration to be received by the Visionics stockholders will also change.
For instance, if the market price of Identix common stock decreases, the value
of the consideration to be received by the Visionics stockholders will also
decrease. On the other hand, if the market price of Identix common stock
increases, the value of the consideration to be received by the Visionics
stockholders will increase correspondingly.

     The number of shares of Identix common stock paid by Identix in connection
with the merger will remain the same whether or not the market price of
Visionics common stock goes up or down. Even if the market price of Visionics
common stock decreases or increases substantially, the number of shares of
Identix common stock issued for each share of Visionics common stock will not be
adjusted. Neither company may terminate the merger agreement or elect not to
complete the merger because of changes in their stock prices.

     The market prices of Identix common stock and Visionics common stock on the
date of the merger may be different from their prices on the date of the merger
agreement, the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or the dates of the
special meetings. Because the merger may occur on a date later than the dates of
the special meetings, the market prices of Identix common stock and Visionics
common stock on the dates of the special meeting may not be indicative of their
market prices on the date of the merger. You are urged to obtain current market
quotations for Identix and Visionics common stock.

INTEGRATION OF THE TWO BUSINESSES MAY BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE, WHICH MAY
ADVERSELY AFFECT OPERATIONS.

     The merger involves risks related to the integration and management of
technology, operations and personnel of two companies. The integration of the
businesses of Identix and Visionics will be a complex, time-consuming and
expensive process and may disrupt their business if not completed in a timely
and efficient manner. Following the merger, Identix and Visionics must operate
as a combined organization utilizing common information and communications
systems, operating procedures, financial controls and human resources practices.

     Identix and Visionics may encounter substantial difficulties, costs and
delays involved in integrating their operations, including:

     - potential conflicts between business cultures;

     - adverse changes in business focus perceived by third-party
       constituencies;

     - potential conflicts in distribution, marketing or other important
       relationships;

     - inability to implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and
       policies;

     - integration of the research and development and product development
       efforts; and

     - loss of key employees and/or the diversion of management's attention from
       other ongoing business concerns.

     In addition, Visionics is co-headquartered in New Jersey and Minnesota,
with offices in five locations, and Identix is headquartered in Northern
California, with offices in nine locations. The geographic distances between the
companies and their respective offices and operations increases the risk that
the integration will not be completed successfully or in a timely and
cost-effective manner. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any
other problems encountered in connection with the integration of the companies.

THE COSTS TO COMPLETE THE MERGER ARE SUBSTANTIAL. THESE COSTS AND THE MANNER OF
ACCOUNTING FOR THE MERGER MAY AFFECT IDENTIX' REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

     It is anticipated that Identix and Visionics will incur approximately $16
to $20 million of costs in connection with the merger. Such amount includes
costs associated with combining the businesses of the two companies, including
integration and restructuring costs, and the fees of financial advisors,
attorneys and accountants. A significant portion of these costs will be charged
to expense in the period incurred, reducing Identix' earnings or increasing its
loss for such period. The remaining costs, consisting primarily of fees and
expenses paid to financial advisors, attorneys and accountants, will be a
component of the purchase price and capitalized as an element of goodwill.
Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually and Identix
will be required to record a charge to earnings in the period any impairment of
goodwill is determined. There is a risk that the management of the combined
company will not be able to effectively control the costs associated with the
integration of the two companies or that such costs may be higher than
anticipated. The failure to manage such integration costs effectively could have
a material adverse effect on the business operations, financial results and
stock price of the combined company.

THE MARKET PRICE OF IDENTIX COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE.

     The market price of Identix common stock could decline if:

     - the integration of Identix and Visionics is unsuccessful;

     - the combined company is unable to successfully market Identix' products
       and services to Visionics' customers or Visionics' products and services
       to Identix customers;

     - the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the
       merger as rapidly as, or to the extent, anticipated by financial or
       industry analysts, or such analysts do not perceive the same benefits to
       the merger as do Identix and Visionics; or

     - the effect of the merger on Identix' financial results is not consistent
       with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.

FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE MERGER COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT IDENTIX AND/OR VISIONICS
STOCK PRICES, FUTURE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS.

     If the merger is not completed for any reason, Identix and Visionics may be
subject to a number of material risks, including the following:

     - either Identix or Visionics could be required to pay the other a
       termination fee of $12.3 million plus the other's merger-related expenses
       if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances; and

     - the parties' costs and expenses related to the merger, which are
       substantial, must be paid even if the merger is not completed; in some
       cases, either Identix or Visionics could be required to pay the other's
       merger-related expenses even if the $12.3 million termination fee is not
       payable.

            RISKS COMMON TO THE BUSINESSES OF IDENTIX AND VISIONICS

IDENTIX' AND VISIONICS' BUSINESSES WILL NOT GROW UNLESS THE MARKET FOR THEIR
SECURITY SOLUTIONS EXPANDS BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY.

     A large portion of both Identix' and Visionics' revenues are derived from
the sale of security products and services. Security solutions have not gained
widespread commercial acceptance. Neither company can accurately predict the
future growth rate, if any, or the ultimate size of the biometric technology
market. The expansion of the market for Identix' and Visionics' products and
services depends on a number of factors, including:

     - the cost, performance and reliability of the companies' products and
       services and the products and services of competitors;

     - customers' perception of the benefit of biometric security solutions;

     - public perceptions of the intrusiveness of these solutions and the manner
       in which firms are using the biometric information collected;

     - public perceptions regarding the confidentiality of private information;

     - customers' satisfaction with the companies' products and services; and

     - marketing efforts and publicity regarding these products and services.

     Certain groups have publicly objected to the use of biometric products for
some applications on civil liberties grounds and legislation has been proposed
to regulate the use of biometric security products. From time to time, facial
recognition and other biometrics technologies have been the focus of
organizations and individuals seeking to curtail or eliminate the use of these
technologies on the grounds that these technologies may be used to diminish
personal privacy rights. In the event that such initiatives result in
restrictive legislation, the market for facial recognition products may be
adversely affected. Even if biometric markets develop, the combined company's
products and services may not gain wide market acceptance. Even if biometric
security solutions gain wide market acceptance, the company's products and
services may not adequately address the market requirements.

IDENTIX AND VISIONICS FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM OTHER BIOMETRIC SECURITY
SOLUTION PROVIDERS AS WELL AS IDENTIFICATION AND SECURITY SYSTEMS PROVIDERS.

     A significant number of established and startup companies have developed or
are developing hardware for fingerprint biometric security applications that
currently compete or will compete directly with those products designed,
developed and sold by Identix and Visionics. Other companies have developed or
are developing and marketing biometric security applications for the recognition
of facial structure that currently compete or will compete with those products
designed, developed and sold by Visionics. Some of these companies have
developed or are developing and marketing semiconductor or optically based
direct contact fingerprint image capture devices. Other companies have developed
or are developing and marketing other methods of biometric identification such
as retinal blood vessel or iris pattern, hand geometry, or voice recognition.

     If one or more of these technologies or approaches were widely adopted, it
would significantly reduce the potential market for the combined company's
products. Identix' and Visionics' products also compete with non-biometric
technologies such as certificate authorities and traditional keys, cards,
surveillance systems and passwords. Many competitors offering products that are
competitive with the combined company's products and services have significantly
more cash and resources than the combined company would have. The biometric
security market is a rapidly evolving and intensely competitive market, and we
believe that additional competitors may yet enter the market and become
significant long-term competitors.

     The combined company's line of products also faces intense competition from
a number of competitors that are actively engaged in developing and marketing
live scan products, including Heimann Biometric

Systems GmbH, Sagem Morpho, Inc., Printrak, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Motorola, and Cross Match Technologies, Inc.

     Both companies expect competition to increase and intensify in the near
term in the biometrics markets. Companies competing with the combined company
may introduce products that are competitively priced, have increased performance
or functionality or incorporate technological advances not yet developed or
implemented by either Identix or Visionics. Some present and potential
competitors have financial, marketing, research, and manufacturing resources
substantially greater than the combined company.

     In order to compete effectively in this environment, the combined company
must continually develop and market new and enhanced products at competitive
prices and must have the resources available to invest in significant research
and development activities. The failure to do so could have a material adverse
effect on the business operations, financial results and stock price of the
combined company.

THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 HAVE INCREASED FINANCIAL
EXPECTATIONS THAT MAY NOT MATERIALIZE.

     The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks have created an uncertain economic
environment and an increased awareness of biometric security solutions. However,
it is uncertain whether the actual level of demand for the combined company's
biometric products and services will increase as a result of such heightened
awareness. Increased demand for the combined company's products and services may
not result in an actual increase in product or services revenues. The combined
company cannot predict with certainty which security solutions, if any, will be
adopted in the fight against terrorism and whether Identix' and Visionics'
products will be among of those solutions. In addition, it is unclear what the
level of funding will be for these solutions and how quickly funding may be made
available.

     These factors may create unpredictability in the combined company's
revenues and operating results.

THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCING IN
THE FUTURE.

     While the management of Identix and Visionics believe that cash flows from
operations, together with existing working capital and available lines of
credit, are adequate to fund the combined company's current cash requirements,
the combined company may need to raise additional debt or equity financing in
the future. Risks relating to the ability of the combined company to maintain
adequate working capital and liquidity include the continued availability of
vendor credit as needed and payment by customers of accounts receivable at such
times and in such amounts as to enable the combined company to meet its payment
obligations. In addition, the combined company may not be able to obtain
additional debt or equity financing. If successful in raising additional
financing, the combined company may not be able to do so on terms that are not
excessively dilutive to existing stockholders or less costly than existing
sources of financing. Failure to secure additional financing in a timely manner
and on favorable terms if and when needed in the future could have a material
adverse effect on the financial performance, balance sheet and stock price of
the combined company and require it to implement cost reduction initiatives and
curtail operations.

THE BIOMETRICS INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND
EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, WHICH COULD RENDER EXISTING PRODUCTS OBSOLETE.

     The future success of the combined company will depend upon its ability to
develop and introduce a variety of new products and services and enhancements to
these new product and services in order to address the changing and
sophisticated needs of the marketplace. Frequently, technical development
programs in the biometrics industry require assessments to be made of the future
directions of technology and technology markets generally, which are inherently
difficult to predict. Delays in introducing new products, services and
enhancements, the failure to choose correctly among technical alternatives or
the failure to offer innovative products and services at competitive prices may
cause customers to forego purchases of the combined company's products and
services and purchase those of its competitors.

     Continued participation by Identix and Visionics in the market for
biometric products that are linked to forensic quality databases under the
jurisdiction of governmental agencies may require the investment of resources in
upgrading the products and technology of the combined company in order for it to
compete and to meet regulatory and statutory standards. The combined company may
not have adequate resources available to it or may not adequately keep pace with
appropriate requirements in order to effectively compete in the marketplace.

IDENTIX' AND VISIONICS' FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS OFTEN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY
FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER AND THE COMBINED COMPANY'S RESULTS MAY BE NEGATIVELY
AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS.

     Identix' and Visionics' financial and operating results may fluctuate from
quarter to quarter because of the following reasons:

     - downturns in the U.S., North American or international economies;

     - reduced demand for products and services caused by competitors;

     - price reductions, new competitors or the introduction of enhanced
       products or services from new or existing competitors;

     - changes in the mix of products and services the combined company or its
       distributors sell;

     - cancellations, delays or contract amendments by government agency
       customers;

     - the lack of availability of government funds;

     - unforeseen legal expenses, including litigation costs;

     - expenses related to acquisitions;

     - other one-time financial charges;

     - the lack of availability or increase in cost of key components and
       subassemblies;

     - increases required in the development and marketing expenses to address
       opportunities or competitive pressures in the market; and

     - the inability to successfully manufacture in volume certain products that
       may contain complex designs and components.

     Particularly important is the need to invest in planned technical
development programs to maintain and enhance the competitiveness of the combined
company, and to develop and launch new products and services. Improving the
manageability and likelihood of success of such programs requires the
development of budgets, plans and schedules for the execution of these programs
and the adherence to such budgets, plans and schedules. The majority of such
program costs are payroll and related staff expenses, and secondarily materials,
subcontractors and promotional expenses. These costs are very difficult to
adjust in response to short-term fluctuations in our revenues, compounding the
difficulty of achieving profitability in the event of a revenue downturn.

     Furthermore, management may from time to time determine that the combined
company's competitive position may be enhanced through substantial and increased
investments in product and technology development programs and/or marketing
initiatives. Management may determine to make such investments despite its
assessment that gross profit during the investment period will be less than the
expenses to be incurred, thus resulting in an anticipated loss during the
period. Such planned losses may be particularly difficult to manage in light of
the volatility of the combined company's revenue stream discussed above.

     Additionally, certain of Identix' and Visionics' products often have a
lengthy sales cycle while the customer evaluates and receives approvals for
purchase. If, after expending significant funds and effort, the combined company
fails to receive an order, its financial results and stock price could be
adversely affected.

     It is difficult to predict accurately the sales cycle of any large order
for any of Identix' or Visionics' products. If the combined company does not
ship one or more large orders as forecast for a fiscal quarter, its total
revenues and operating results for that quarter could be materially and
adversely affected.

     Further, the lead-time for ordering parts and materials and building
Identix' and Visionics' products can be many months. As a result, the combined
company will need to order parts and materials and build its products based on
forecasted demand. If demand for the products lags significantly behind
forecasts, the combined company may produce more products than it can sell,
which can result in cash flow problems and write-offs or write-downs of obsolete
inventory.

IDENTIX AND VISIONICS BOTH DERIVE A LARGE PORTION OF THEIR REVENUE FROM
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN NON-STANDARD, INVOLVE COMPETITIVE BIDDING,
AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO CANCELLATION WITHOUT PENALTY AND MAY PRODUCE VOLATILITY IN
EARNINGS AND REVENUE.

     The performance of Identix and Visionics in any one reporting period is not
necessarily indicative of sales trends or future operating or earnings
performance because of the reliance by Identix and Visionics on a small number
of large customers, the majority of which are government agencies. Government
contracts frequently include provisions that are not standard in private
commercial transactions. For example, government contracts may include bonding
requirements and provisions permitting the purchasing agency to cancel the
contract without penalty in certain circumstances. As public agencies, the
combined company's prospective customers are also subject to public agency
contract requirements that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some of these
requirements may be onerous or impossible to satisfy.

     In addition, public agency contracts are frequently awarded only after
formal competitive bidding processes, which have been and may continue to be
protracted, and typically impose provisions that permit cancellation in the
event that funds are unavailable to the public agency. There is a risk that the
combined company may not be awarded any of the contracts for which it bids or,
if awarded, that substantial delays or cancellations of purchases may follow as
a result of protests initiated by losing bidders. In addition, local government
agency contracts may be contingent upon availability of matching funds from
federal or state entities. Also, law enforcement and other government agencies
are subject to political, budgetary, purchasing and delivery constraints which
we expect may continue to result in quarterly and annual revenues and operating
results which may be irregular and difficult to predict. Such revenue volatility
makes management of inventory levels, cash flow and profitability inherently
difficult. In addition, in the event the combined company is successful in
winning such procurements, there may be planned unevenness in shipping
schedules, as well as potential delays and schedule changes in the timing of
deliveries and recognition of revenue, or cancellation of such procurements.

     For the three and six months ended December 31, 2001, Identix derived
approximately 78% and 84% of its services revenue directly from contracts
relating to the Department of Defense, the Immigration and Naturalization
Services and other U.S. Government and state agencies. For the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2001, Visionics derived 10.4% of its revenues from contracts with
the Immigration and Naturalization Services and 24% of its revenue from its top
twenty customers, mostly U.S. governmental and state and local agencies. The
loss of a material government contract due to budget cuts or otherwise could
have a severe negative impact on our financial results, balance sheet and stock
price.

     In addition, revenues generated from government contracts are subject to
audit and subsequent adjustment by negotiation with representatives of the
government agencies. The Defense Contract Audit Agency is currently auditing IPS
for the periods from July 1, 1997 to June 30, 2000. While Identix management
believes that the results of such audit will have no material effect on the
profits of the combined company, such adjustments may have a material adverse
effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY ARE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENTAL
CREDIT, FUNDING, AND OTHER RELATED FACTORS.

     Both Identix and Visionics extend substantial credit to federal, state and
local governments in connection with sales of their products and services. Sales
to sizeable customers requiring large and sophisticated networks of fingerprint
recognition and live scan systems and peripheral equipment often include
technical requirements which may not be fully known at the time requirements are
specified by the customer. In addition, contracts may specify performance
criteria that must be satisfied before the customer accepts the products and
services. Collection of accounts receivable may be dependent on completion of
customer requirements, which may be unpredictable, subject to change by the
customer, and not fully understood at the time of acceptance of the order, and
may involve investment of additional resources. These investments of additional
resources are accrued when amounts can be estimated but may be uncompensated and
negatively affect profit margins and our liquidity.

     Furthermore, in many instances, customer procurements are dependent on the
availability or continued availability of state or federal government grants and
general tax funding. Such funding may be subject to termination at any time at
the sole discretion of the government body providing or receiving such funds.

     Additionally, without regard to termination of funding, government agencies
both domestically and internationally may successfully assert the right to
terminate business or funding relationships with us at their sole discretion
without adequate or any compensation or recourse for us.

IDENTIX AND VISIONICS RELY IN PART UPON ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEM)
AND DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS TO DISTRIBUTE THEIR PRODUCTS, AND THE COMBINED COMPANY
MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THOSE PARTIES DO NOT ACTIVELY PROMOTE THE IDENTIX
AND VISIONICS PRODUCTS OR PURSUE INSTALLATIONS THAT USE IDENTIX AND VISIONICS
EQUIPMENT.

     A significant portion of Identix and Visionics product revenues comes from
sales to partners including OEMs, AFIS suppliers, systems integrators,
distributors and resellers. Some, but not all, of these relationships are
formalized in written agreements. Even where these relationships are formalized
in written agreements, the agreements are often terminable with little or no
notice and subject to periodic amendment. Identix and Visionics cannot control
the amount and timing of resources that our partners devote to activities on our
behalf. At times, these third-party distributors may offer products of
competitors as well.

     The combined company intends to continue to seek strategic relationships to
distribute, license and sell certain of its products. However the combined
company may not be able to negotiate acceptable relationships in the future and
cannot predict whether current or future relationships will be successful.

LOSS OF SOLE OR LIMITED SOURCE SUPPLIERS MAY RESULT IN DELAYS OR ADDITIONAL
EXPENSES.

     Identix and Visionics obtain certain components, subassemblies and complete
products from a single source or a limited group of suppliers. Neither Identix
nor Visionics has long-term agreements with any of its suppliers. The combined
company will experience significant delays in manufacturing and shipping of
products to customers if it loses these sources or if supplies from these
sources are delayed.

     As a result, the combined company may be required to incur additional
development, manufacturing and other costs to establish alternative sources of
supply. It may take several months to locate alternative suppliers, if required,
or to re-tool the combined company's products to accommodate components from
different suppliers. Identix and Visionics cannot predict if the combined
company will be able to obtain replacement components within the time frames it
will require at an affordable cost, or at all. Any delays resulting from
suppliers failing to deliver components or products on a timely basis in
sufficient quantities and of sufficient quality or any significant increase in
the price of components from existing or alternative suppliers could have a
severe negative effect on the combined company's financial results, balance
sheet and stock price.

IDENTIX' AND VISIONICS' PRODUCTS AND CERTAIN OF THEIR SERVICES ARE COMPLEX, MAY
CONTAIN UNDETECTED OR UNRESOLVED DEFECTS WHEN SOLD OR MAY NOT MEET CUSTOMERS'
PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, OR MAY BE DIFFICULT TO SUCCESSFULLY MANUFACTURE IN VOLUME.

     Performance failure in Identix' or Visionics' products or certain of their
services may cause loss of market share, delay in or loss of market acceptance,
additional warranty expense or product recall, or other contractual liabilities.
The complexity of certain of the fingerprint and face recognition systems make
the manufacturing and assembly process of such products, especially in volume,
complex. This may in turn lead to delays or shortages in the availability of
certain products, or, in some cases, the unavailability of certain products. The
negative effects of any delay or failure could be exacerbated if the delay or
failure occurs in products or services (such as Identix' itrust services) that
provide personal security, secure sensitive computer data, authorize significant
financial transactions or perform other functions where a security breach could
have significant consequences.

     If a product or service launch is delayed or is the subject of an
availability shortage because of problems with the ability of the combined
company to manufacture or assemble the product or service successfully on a
timely basis, or if a product or service otherwise fails to meet performance
criteria, the combined company may lose revenue opportunities entirely and/or
experience delays in revenue recognition associated with a product or service in
addition to incurring higher operating expenses during the period required to
correct the defects. There is a risk that for unforeseen reasons the combined
company may be required to repair or replace a substantial number of products in
use or to reimburse customers for products that fail to work or meet strict
performance criteria. Identix and Visionics carry product liability insurance,
but existing coverage may not be adequate to cover potential claims.

FAILURE BY THE COMBINED COMPANY TO MAINTAIN THE PROPRIETARY NATURE OF ITS
TECHNOLOGY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES COULD HAVE A
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION
OF THE COMBINED COMPANY AND ON ITS ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

     Both Identix and Visionics principally rely upon patent, trademark,
copyright, trade secret and contract law to establish and protect their
proprietary rights. There is a risk that claims allowed on any patents or
trademarks that Identix and Visionics hold may not be broad enough to protect
the technology of the combined company. In addition, Identix' and Visionics'
patents or trademarks may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and
management cannot be certain that the rights granted thereunder will provide
competitive advantages to the combined company. Moreover, any current or future
issued or licensed patents, or trademarks, or currently existing or future
developed trade secrets or know-how may not afford sufficient protection against
competitors with similar technologies or processes, and the possibility exists
that certain of Identix' and Visionics' already issued patents or trademarks may
infringe upon third party patents or trademarks or be designed around by others.

     In addition, there is a risk that others may independently develop
proprietary technologies and processes, which are the same as, substantially
equivalent or superior to those of the combined company, or become available in
the market at a lower price.

     There is a risk that Identix or Visionics have infringed or in the future
will infringe patents or trademarks owned by others, that the combined company
will need to acquire licenses under patents or trademarks belonging to others
for technology potentially useful or necessary to the combined company, and that
licenses will not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.

     The combined company may have to litigate to enforce its patents or
trademarks or to determine the scope and validity of other parties' proprietary
rights. Litigation could be very costly and divert management's attention. An
adverse outcome in any litigation may have a severe negative effect on the
financial results and stock price of the combined company. To determine the
priority of inventions, the combined company may have to participate in
interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark
Office or oppositions in foreign patent and trademark offices, which could
result in substantial cost to the combined company and limitations on the scope
or validity of its patents or trademarks.

     Both Identix and Visionics also rely on trade secrets and proprietary
know-how, which they seek to protect by confidentiality agreements with their
employees, consultants, service providers and third parties. There is a risk
that these agreements may be breached, and that the remedies available to the
combined company may not be adequate. In addition, Identix' and Visionics' trade
secrets and proprietary know-how may otherwise become known to or be
independently discovered by others.

IF THE COMBINED COMPANY FAILS TO ADEQUATELY MANAGE THE SIZE OF ITS BUSINESS, IT
COULD HAVE A SEVERE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS OR STOCK PRICE.

     Identix and Visionics management believe that in order to be successful the
combined company must appropriately manage the size of its business. This will
mean reducing costs and overhead following the merger in an effort to integrate
the two businesses and may mean reducing costs in certain economic periods, and
selectively growing in periods of economic expansion. In addition, the combined
company will be required to implement operational, financial and management
information procedures and controls that are efficient and appropriate for the
size and scope of our operations. The management skills and systems currently in
place may not be adequate and we may not be able to manage any significant
reductions or growth effectively.

THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN ACQUIRING AND EFFECTIVELY
INTEGRATING COMPLEMENTARY ASSETS AND BUSINESSES.

     As part of its business strategy, the combined company may acquire assets
and businesses principally relating to or complementary to Identix' and
Visionics' current operations. Identix acquired Identicator Technology, Inc. in
fiscal 1999, one company in fiscal 1998 and two companies in fiscal 1996.
Digital Biometrics, Inc. merged with Visionics Technology in February 2001 and
changed its name from Digital Biometrics to Visionics. These and any other
acquisitions and/or mergers by Identix, Visionics or the combined company are
and will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of
companies. These risks include, among other things:

     - exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies;

     - higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses;

     - effects of costs and expenses of acquiring and integrating new businesses
       on the operating results and financial condition of the combined company;

     - the difficulty and expense of assimilating the operations and personnel
       of the companies;

     - disruption of the combined company's ongoing business;

     - diversion of management time and attention;

     - failure to maximize the combined company's financial and strategic
       position by the successful incorporation of acquired technology;

     - the inability to implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and
       policies;

     - loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management;

     - the incurrence of amortization expenses; and

     - possible dilution to the stockholders of the combined company.

     In addition, geographic distances may make integration of businesses more
difficult. The combined company may not be successful in overcoming these risks
or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions.

LOSS OF CURRENT SENIOR EXECUTIVES AND KEY TECHNICAL PERSONNEL WOULD ADVERSELY
AFFECT THE BUSINESS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY.

     Identix and Visionics are dependent in their operations on the continued
availability of the services of their employees, many of whom are individually
key to the future success of the combined company, and the availability of new
employees to implement the growth plans of the combined company. The market for
skilled employees is highly competitive, especially for employees in technical
fields. Although Identix' and Visionics' compensation programs are intended to
attract and retain the employees required for the combined company to be
successful, there can be no assurance that the combined company will be able to
retain the services of all of the key employees or a sufficient number to
execute its plans, nor can there be any assurances that the combined company
will be able to continue to attract new employees as required.

     Identix and Visionics personnel may voluntarily terminate their
relationship with the combined company at any time. The process of locating
additional personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to
carry out the combined company's strategy could be lengthy, costly and
disruptive.

     If the combined company loses the services of key personnel, or fails to
replace the services of key personnel who depart, the financial results and
stock price of the combined company could be adversely affected. The loss of the
services of any key engineering or other personnel or the failure of the
combined company to attract, integrate, motivate and retain additional key
employees could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating and
financial results and stock price.

THE SUCCESS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY'S STRATEGIC PLAN TO PURSUE SALES IN
INTERNATIONAL MARKETS MAY BE LIMITED BY RISKS RELATED TO CONDITIONS IN THOSE
MARKETS.

     For the year ended June 30, 2001, and the three and six months ended
December 31, 2001, Identix derived approximately 11%, 16% and 11%, respectively,
of its product revenues from international sales. Identix currently has a local
presence in the United Kingdom. For the year ended September 30, 2001, and the
three months ended December 31, 2001, Visionics derived approximately six
percent and four percent, respectively, of its products and services revenues
from international sales. Visionics currently has a subsidiary in the United
Kingdom.

     There is a risk that the combined company may not be able to successfully
market, sell and deliver Identix products in foreign countries, or successfully
rely on supplemental offshore research and development resources.

     Risks inherent in marketing, selling and delivering products in foreign and
international markets, include those associated with:

     - regional economic conditions;

     - delays in or prohibitions on exporting products resulting from export
       restrictions for certain products and technologies, including "crime
       control" products and encryption technology;

     - loss of, or delays in importing products, services and intellectual
       property developed abroad, resulting from unstable or fluctuating social,
       political or governmental conditions;

     - fluctuations in foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar;

     - loss of revenue, property (including intellectual property) and equipment
       from expropriation, nationalization, war, insurrection, terrorism,
       criminal acts and other political and social risks;

     - the overlap of different tax structures;

     - seasonal reductions in business activity;

     - risks of increases in taxes and other government fees; and

     - involuntary renegotiations of contracts with foreign governments.

     In addition, foreign laws treat the protection of proprietary rights
differently from laws in the United States and may not protect our proprietary
rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. The failure of foreign laws or judicial
systems to adequately protect our proprietary rights or intellectual property,
including intellectual property developed on our behalf by foreign contractors
or subcontractors may have a material adverse effect on our business,
operations, financial results and stock price.

              ADDITIONAL RISKS RELATED TO THE BUSINESS OF IDENTIX

FUTURE GROWTH DEPENDS IN PART ON THE SUCCESS OF ITRUST, A RELATIVELY NEW
BUSINESS ACTIVITY WITH LITTLE OPERATING HISTORY.

     Future growth of the combined company may depend in part on the success of
Identix' proprietary itrust security platform and related services. itrust is a
relatively new and evolving solution, and the ultimate success of the itrust
offering may depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:

     - the ability of the combined company to form additional collaborative
       partnerships that will contribute technical and commercial value to
       itrust;

     - the demand for Identix' security products and itrust products and
       services;

     - the ability of the combined company to successfully and rapidly
       manufacture, disseminate and deploy biometric enabled products and
       services;

     - the ability and willingness of Identix' collaborative partners to
       successfully and rapidly promote, manufacture, disseminate and deploy
       biometric enabled products services;

     - the levels of competition in the space for Internet and wireless web
       security services;

     - the perceived need for secure communications and commerce in such
       markets;

     - the ability of the combined company to successfully introduce new
       products and services; and

     - the ability of the combined company to expand its operations and attract,
       integrate, retain and motivate qualified sales, marketing, and research
       and development personnel.

     A significant number of established and startup companies have developed or
are developing and marketing security and/or authentication solutions that
currently compete or will compete directly with itrust solutions. Some of these
companies have significantly more cash and resources than Identix or the
combined company, and may currently offer a broader or more robust range of
solutions than those currently available through the itrust offering. The wired
and wireless security and authentication marketplace is a rapidly evolving and
intensely competitive market and the management of Identix believes that
additional competitors may yet enter the market and become significant long-term
competitors.

     Identix has experienced net losses in the last two fiscal years and expect
additional losses in the future. itrust solutions are not expected to contribute
significant revenues or positive cash flows in the foreseeable future. At the
same time, however, the combined company will incur significant costs in the
continuing design, development, manufacture, sale and deployment of itrust
products and services. The significant investment the combined company will
continue to make in itrust is expected to have a negative impact on the combined
company's income and cash flows for the foreseeable future.

IDENTIX FACES SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM PROFESSIONAL SERVICES PROVIDERS OF
ALL SIZES IN THE GOVERNMENT MARKETPLACE FOR SERVICES.

     IPS is increasingly being required to bid on firm fixed price and similar
contracts that result in greater performance risk to IPS. If IPS is not able to
maintain a competitive cost structure, support specialized market niches, retain
highly qualified personnel or align with technology leaders, Identix or the
combined company may lose its ability to compete successfully in the services
business.

IDENTIX RELIES HEAVILY ON PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY INTERNATIONAL
TECHNOLOGY CONCEPTS, INC. ("IT CONCEPTS").

     Both Identix' imaging and security divisions purchase certain complete
biometric security and imaging products, components of products and research,
development and engineering services related to the development of products from
IT Concepts. IT Concepts is also contributing to the development of certain of
itrust's solutions. In turn IT Concepts subcontracts portions of its development
work to an affiliate in Russia.

     If Identix were to lose IT Concepts as a supplier of products and
engineering services, or if IT Concepts were prohibited or restricted under
applicable laws from bringing in a portion of its engineering requirements or
resources from Russia, the combined company would be required to find
alternative suppliers of products and services or hire additional engineering
personnel to provide the services. This could require the combined company to
incur significant additional research and development costs and delay shipment
of products to customers and the development of new technology and products.
There is a risk that the combined company would not be able to find such
personnel or suppliers at a reasonable cost, or at all. Any delay in product
development or shipment could have a material adverse effect on the combined
company's business, operations, financial results and stock price. Identix is
party to a series of agreements with IT Concepts governing IT Concepts' supply
of research, development and engineering services to Identix. Identix relies in
part on these agreements to protect its ownership, and the confidentiality of,
Identix' proprietary technology, trade secrets and other intellectual property
rights developed under the agreements. There is a risk that these agreements may
be inadequate to protect Identix, or that such agreements may be breached, and
that the remedies available to Identix or the combined company may not be
adequate.

ONE STOCKHOLDER OWNS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF IDENTIX' STOCK AND MAY DELAY OR
PREVENT A CHANGE IN CONTROL OR ADVERSELY AFFECT THE STOCK PRICE THROUGH SALES IN
THE OPEN MARKET.

     As of December 31, 2001, State of Wisconsin Investment Board owned
approximately 19.25% of Identix' outstanding common stock and would own
approximately eight percent of the outstanding common stock of the combined
company. The concentration of large percentages of ownership in any single
stockholder may delay or prevent change in control of the combined company.
Additionally, the sale of a significant number of shares in the open market by a
single stockholder or otherwise could adversely affect our stock price.

IDENTIX' BUSINESS OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE EVENT OF AN
EARTHQUAKE.

     Identix' corporate headquarters and most of its research and development
operations are located in Silicon Valley in Northern California, a region known
for dramatic seismic activity. An earthquake or other significant natural
disaster could have a material adverse impact on the business, financial
condition, operating results and stock price of the combined company.

                          THE IDENTIX SPECIAL MEETING

DATE, TIME, PLACE AND PURPOSE OF THE IDENTIX SPECIAL MEETING

     The special meeting of stockholders of Identix will be held at [      ]
a.m., Pacific time, on [               ], 2002 at the Toll House Hotel, 140 S.
Santa Cruz Avenue, Los Gatos, California 95030. At the special meeting,
stockholders at the close of business on [               ], 2002 will be asked:

     1.  To approve the issuance of shares of Identix common stock to the
         holders of Visionics common stock in the merger pursuant to which
         Visionics will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Identix. In the
         merger, Identix will issue 1.3436 shares of common stock for each share
         of outstanding Visionics common stock. The merger agreement relating to
         the proposed merger is included as Annex A to the joint proxy
         statement/prospectus.

     2.  To approve an amendment to Identix' certificate of incorporation to
         increase the number of authorized shares of Identix common stock by
         100,000,000 shares to 200,000,000 shares.

     3.  To approve the Identix 2002 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan") and
         the reservation for issuance thereunder of 5,800,000 shares of Identix
         common stock.

     4.  To transact any other business that may properly come before the
         special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

RECORD DATE AND OUTSTANDING SHARES

     Identix stockholders of record of common stock and Series A preferred stock
at the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of and to
vote at the special meeting. As of the close of business on February 22, 2002,
there were 234,558 shares of Identix Series A preferred stock, par value $0.01
per share outstanding and entitled to vote (convertible into 235,553 shares of
common stock) and 44,840,000 shares of Identix common stock, par value $0.01 per
share outstanding and entitled to vote.

SHARES BENEFICIALLY OWNED BY IDENTIX DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS OF THE
RECORD DATE

     On the record date, directors and executive officers of Identix and their
affiliates beneficially owned, and were entitled to vote, [74,534] shares of
Identix common stock, or approximately [0.2]% of the shares outstanding as of
the record date.

VOTE REQUIRED

     Holders of Identix common stock and Series A preferred stock on an as
converted basis are entitled to one vote for each share held as of the record
date. Holders of Series A preferred stock vote with the holders of common stock
(not as a separate class).

  ISSUANCE OF SHARES IN THE MERGER

     Approval of the issuance of shares in the merger with Visionics requires
the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Identix common stock and the
shares of Series A preferred stock on an as converted basis represented in
person or by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.

     The members of the Identix board and certain executive officers of Identix,
who together beneficially hold approximately [0.2]% of the Identix common stock
outstanding as of the record date, have entered into voting agreements with
Visionics, in which they have agreed, in their capacities as stockholders of
Identix, to vote in favor of the issuance of Identix common stock in the merger
and have granted Visionics an irrevocable proxy.

  APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

     Approval of the amendment to Identix' certificate of incorporation requires
the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Identix common
stock and the outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock on an as converted
basis as of the record date.

  ADOPTION OF THE 2002 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN

     Adoption of the 2002 Plan requires the affirmative vote of a majority of
the shares of Identix common stock and the shares of Series A preferred stock on
an as converted basis represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting
and entitled to vote on the proposal.

QUORUM REQUIREMENTS

     A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. The
presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of shares representing a
majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Identix common stock and the
shares of Series A preferred stock on an as converted basis entitled to vote as
of the record date is a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes count as
present at the special meeting for establishing a quorum. A broker non-vote
occurs with respect to any proposal when a broker is not permitted to vote on
that proposal without instruction from the beneficial owner of the shares and no
instruction is given.

VOTING OF PROXIES

     The Identix proxy accompanying this joint proxy statement/prospectus is
solicited on behalf of the Identix board of directors for use at the meeting.
Identix recommends that you vote by proxy, using the telephone, the Internet or
the enclosed proxy card, even if you plan to attend the meeting to vote in
person. You can always change your vote at the meeting.

     If a stockholder's shares are held of record in "street name" by a broker,
bank or other nominee and the stockholder intends to vote the shares in person
at the Identix meeting, the stockholder must bring to the meeting a letter from
the broker, bank or other nominee confirming the stockholder's beneficial
ownership of the shares to be voted.

HOW TO VOTE BY PROXY

     Voting instructions are included on the proxy accompanying this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. If you properly give your proxy and submit it to Identix
in time to vote, one of the individuals named as your proxy will vote your
shares as you have directed. You may vote for or against the proposals or
abstain from voting. Please complete, sign, date and return the accompanying
proxy card in the enclosed envelope. Alternatively, you may vote by following
the telephone or Internet instructions on the proxy card. If you submit your
proxy but do not make specific choices, your proxy will follow the board
recommendations and vote your shares FOR the proposals.

  INTERNET AND TELEPHONE VOTING

     Stockholders whose shares are registered in the name of a bank or brokerage
firm may be eligible to vote electronically through the Internet or by
telephone. A large number of banks and brokerage firms are participating in the
ADP Investor Communication Services online program. This program provides
eligible stockholders the opportunity to vote via the Internet or by telephone.
Voting forms will provide instructions for stockholders whose bank or brokerage
firm is participating in ADP's program.

     Registered stockholders may vote electronically through the Internet by
following the instructions included with their proxy card. Stockholders not
wishing to vote electronically through the Internet or whose form does not
reference Internet or telephone voting information should complete and return
the enclosed paper proxy card. Signing and returning the proxy card or
submitting the proxy via the Internet or by telephone does not affect the right
to vote in person at the special meeting.

REVOKING YOUR PROXY

     You may revoke your proxy before it is voted by:

     - notifying Identix' secretary in writing before the meeting that you have
       revoked your proxy;

     - submitting a new proxy with a later date; or

     - voting in person at the meeting.

     You may send a notice to the secretary of Identix at the principal
executive offices of Identix.

VOTING IN PERSON

     If you plan to attend the meeting and wish to vote in person, Identix will
give you a ballot at the meeting. Attendance at a stockholders meeting, however,
will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy.

EFFECT OF ABSTAINING

     You may abstain from voting on any of the proposals. Abstentions will be
included in determining the number of shares present and voting at the special
meeting. If you mark your proxy "ABSTAIN" with respect to any proposal, you will
be in effect voting against that proposal. In addition, if you fail to send in
your proxy, this will have the effect of a vote against proposal 2.

BROKER NON-VOTE

     If you are an Identix stockholder and your broker holds shares in its name,
the broker cannot vote your shares without your instructions. This is a "broker
non-vote." A "broker non-vote" with respect to proposal 2 will have the effect
of a vote against the proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on any of
the other proposals.

PROXY SOLICITATION

     Identix will pay its own costs of soliciting proxies. Identix has retained
Georgeson Shareholder to aid in the solicitation of proxies and to verify
records relating to the solicitations. Georgeson Shareholder will receive
customary fees and expense reimbursement for these services. The extent to which
these proxy soliciting efforts will be necessary depends entirely upon how
promptly proxies are received. You should send in your proxy by mail without
delay or vote by telephone or using the Internet. Identix also reimburses
brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their expenses in
sending these materials to you and getting your voting instructions. For a more
complete description of how to send your proxy, see the section titled "-- How
to vote by proxy" on page 28.

OTHER BUSINESS; ADJOURNMENTS

     Identix is not currently aware of any business other than the named
proposals to be acted upon at the Identix special meeting. If, however, any
other matters are properly brought before the meeting, or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy, and
acting under that proxy, will have discretion to vote or act on those matters in
accordance with their best judgment, including any proposal to adjourn the
meeting (provided, however, that a proxy voted against the issuance of shares of
Identix common stock in the merger agreement will not be voted in favor of
adjournment of the meeting).

     Adjournments may be made for the purpose of, among other things soliciting
additional proxies. Any adjournment may be made from time to time by approval of
the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes present in person or
by proxy at the meeting, whether or not a quorum exists, without further notice
other than by an announcement at the meeting. Identix does not currently intend
to seek an adjournment of its meeting unless such an adjournment is necessary to
solicit additional votes.

NO APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Under Delaware law, holders of Identix common stock or Series A preferred
stock are not entitled to dissenters' rights or appraisal rights with respect to
the matters to be considered at the Identix special meeting.

                         THE VISIONICS SPECIAL MEETING

DATE, TIME, AND PLACE AND PURPOSE OF THE VISIONICS SPECIAL MEETING

     The special meeting of stockholders of Visionics will be held at [      ]
a.m., Central Time, on [               ], 2002 at the Lutheran Brotherhood
Auditorium, 625 Fourth Avenue South, Minneapolis, Minnesota. At the special
meeting, stockholders at the close of business on [               ], 2002 will
be asked:

        1. To adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger pursuant to which Visionics
           will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Identix. The merger
           agreement relating to the proposed merger is included as Annex A to
           this joint proxy statement/prospectus. In the merger, Identix will
           issue 1.3436 shares of common stock for each outstanding share of
           Visionics common stock.

        2. To transact any other business that may properly come before the
           special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

RECORD DATE AND OUTSTANDING SHARES

     Only holders of record of Visionics common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, at the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of and
to vote at the special meeting. As of the close of business on February 22,
2002, there were 28,877,031 shares of Visionics common stock outstanding and
entitled to vote.

SHARES BENEFICIALLY OWNED BY VISIONICS DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS OF
THE RECORD DATE

     On the record date, directors and executive officers of Visionics and their
affiliates beneficially owned, and were entitled to vote, [3,827,657] shares of
Visionics common stock, or approximately [13.1]% of the shares outstanding as of
the record date.

VOTE REQUIRED

     Holders of Visionics common stock are entitled to one vote for each share
held as of the record date.

     Adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the total outstanding shares of Visionics common stock on the record
date.

     The members of the Visionics board and certain officers of Visionics, who
together hold approximately [13.1]% of the Visionics common stock outstanding as
of the record date, have entered into voting agreements with Identix in which
they have agreed to vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and
approval of the merger and have granted Identix an irrevocable proxy.

QUORUM REQUIREMENTS

     A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. The
presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of shares representing a
majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Visionics common stock entitled
to vote as of the record date is a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes
count as present at the special meeting for establishing a quorum. A broker
non-vote occurs with respect to any proposal when a broker is not permitted to
vote on that proposal without instruction from the beneficial owner of the
shares and no instruction is given.

VOTE NECESSARY TO APPROVE THE MERGER

     The affirmative vote by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Visionics common stock on the record date is necessary to adopt the merger
agreement. Broker non-votes and abstentions have the same effect as a vote
against adoption of the merger agreement.

VOTING OF PROXIES

     The proxy accompanying this joint proxy statement/prospectus is being
solicited on behalf of the Visionics board of directors for use at the meeting.
Visionics recommends that you vote by proxy, using the telephone, the Internet
or the enclosed proxy card, even if you plan to attend the meeting to vote in
person. You can always change your vote at the meeting.

     If a stockholder's shares are held of record in "street name" by a broker,
bank or other nominee and the stockholder intends to vote the shares in person
at the Visionics meeting, the stockholder must bring to the meeting a letter
from the broker, bank or other nominee confirming the stockholder's beneficial
ownership of the shares to be voted.

HOW TO VOTE BY PROXY

     Voting instructions are included on the proxy accompanying this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. If you properly give your proxy and submit it to Visionics
in time to vote, one of the individuals named as your proxy will vote your
shares as you have directed. You may vote for or against the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement or abstain from voting. Please complete, sign, date and
return the accompanying proxy card in the enclosed envelope. Alternatively, you
may vote by following the telephone or Internet instructions on the proxy card.
If you submit your proxy but do not make specific choices, your proxy will
follow the board's recommendations and vote your shares FOR the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement.

  INTERNET AND TELEPHONE VOTING

     Stockholders whose shares are registered in the name of a bank or brokerage
firm may be eligible to vote electronically through the Internet or by
telephone. A large number of banks and brokerage firms are participating in the
ADP Investor Communication Services online program. This program provides
eligible stockholders the opportunity to vote via the Internet or by telephone.
Voting forms will provide instructions for stockholders whose bank or brokerage
firm is participating in ADP's program.

     Registered stockholders may vote electronically through the Internet by
following the instructions included with their proxy card. Stockholders not
wishing to vote electronically through the Internet or whose form does not
reference Internet or telephone voting information should complete and return
the enclosed paper proxy card. Signing and returning the proxy card or
submitting the proxy via the Internet or by telephone does not affect the right
to vote in person at the special meeting.

REVOKING YOUR PROXY

     You may revoke your proxy before it is voted by:

     - notifying Visionics' secretary in writing before the meeting that you
       have revoked your proxy;

     - submitting a new proxy with a later date; or

     - voting in person at the meeting.

     You may send a notice to the secretary of Visionics at the principal
executive offices of Visionics.

VOTING IN PERSON

     If you plan to attend the meeting and wish to vote in person, Visionics
will give you a ballot at the meeting. Attendance at a stockholders meeting will
not in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy.

EFFECT OF ABSTAINING

     You may abstain from voting on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
If you mark your proxy "ABSTAIN" with respect to the proposal, you will in
effect be voting against that proposal. In addition, if you fail to send in your
proxy, this, too, will have the effect of a vote against the proposal.

BROKER NON-VOTE

     If you are a Visionics stockholder and your broker holds shares in its
name, the broker cannot vote your shares on the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement without your instructions. This is a "broker non-vote." A "broker
non-vote" with respect to the proposal will have the effect of a vote against
the proposal.

PROXY SOLICITATION

     Visionics will pay its own costs of soliciting proxies. Visionics has
retained Georgeson Shareholder to aid in the solicitation of proxies and to
verify records relating to the solicitations. Georgeson Shareholder will receive
customary fees and expense reimbursement for these services. The extent to which
these proxy soliciting efforts will be necessary depends entirely upon how
promptly proxies are received. You should send in your proxy by mail without
delay or vote by telephone or using the Internet. Visionics also reimburses
brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their expenses in
sending these materials to you and getting your voting instructions. For a more
complete description of how to send your proxy, see section titled "-- How to
vote by proxy" on page 31.

     Do not send in any stock certificates with your proxy. The exchange agent
will mail transmittal forms with instructions for the surrender of stock
certificates for Visionics common shares to former Visionics stockholders as
soon as practicable after the completion of the merger.

OTHER BUSINESS; ADJOURNMENTS

     Visionics is not currently aware of any business other than the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement to be acted upon at the Visionics special meeting.
If, however, any other matters are properly brought before the meeting, or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, the persons named in the enclosed form of
proxy, and acting under that proxy, will have discretion to vote or act on those
matters in accordance with their best judgment, including any proposal to
adjourn the meeting (provided, however, that a proxy voted against adoption of
the merger agreement will not be voted in favor of adjournment of the meeting).

     Adjournments may be made for the purpose of, among other things, soliciting
additional proxies. Any adjournment may be made from time to time by approval of
the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes present in person or
by proxy at the meeting, whether or not a quorum exists, without further notice
other than by an announcement at the meeting. Visionics does not currently
intend to seek an adjournment of its meeting unless such an adjournment is
necessary to solicit additional votes.

NO APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Under Delaware law, holders of Visionics common stock are not entitled to
dissenters' rights or appraisal rights with respect to the matters to be
considered at the Visionics special meeting.

                                   THE MERGER

     This section describes the proposed merger and the merger agreement. While
Identix and Visionics believe that the description covers the material terms of
the proposed merger, this summary may not contain all of the information that is
important to you. Stockholders should carefully read this entire document and
the other documents referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, such
as the merger agreement, for a more complete understanding of the merger.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     During June and October 2001, representatives of Identix and Visionics
conducted a series of meetings to discuss potential strategic opportunities
between the companies, including a possible business combination. All
discussions between the parties terminated with no agreement with respect to a
potential transaction.

     On January 10, 2002, Visionics instructed its financial advisor, Morgan
Keegan, to contact Identix about arranging a meeting with Dr. Joseph Atick,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Visionics, to discuss a possible
business combination. Senior executives of Identix and Visionics and
representatives of Morgan Keegan met on January 12, 2002 to discuss each
company's general business strategy and the potential benefits of a business
combination. The discussions addressed, among other matters, potential
financial, business operational and integration synergies.

     On January 13, 2001, the Visionics board of directors met with
representatives of Morgan Keegan concerning a potential transaction with
Identix. The Morgan Keegan representatives discussed with the Visionics' board a
non-binding proposed term sheet, including share exchange formulas and other
terms of a potential business combination. The Visionics board discussed the
terms of a possible transaction as well as other strategic alternatives
available to Visionics. The Visionics board authorized management, with support
from Morgan Keegan and Visionics' outside advisors and legal counsel, to pursue
further discussions with Identix.

     On January 17, 2002, Visionics formally engaged Morgan Keegan to act as its
financial advisor in connection with a potential transaction with Identix.

     On January 18, 2002, Identix and Visionics entered into a confidentiality
agreement to facilitate more detailed discussions and the companies' review of
each others' proprietary information in connection with a possible merger.

     On January 18 and 19, 2002, representatives of the parties and their
respective financial advisors met to consider and negotiate a basis for
establishing an exchange ratio based on publicly available market data, subject
to approval by the parties' boards of directors and the results of the parties'
due diligence investigations.

     On January 22, 2002, Identix signed a formal engagement letter with Lehman
Brothers to assist Identix in evaluating a possible merger with Visionics.

     On January 23, 2002, the parties agreed to a preliminary non-binding
outline setting forth the major terms of a proposed business combination,
subject to further discussion and due diligence review, and subject to review
and approval by each company's board of directors.

     On January 29, 2002, the Identix board of directors met for a regularly
scheduled meeting. Certain Identix senior executives presented an overview of
discussions and activities to date, including the engagement of Lehman Brothers.
Preliminary terms for a possible transaction were outlined, and possible next
steps were discussed by the Identix board. The Identix board authorized the
appropriate officers of Identix, with support from Lehman Brothers and Identix'
outside advisors and legal counsel, to continue discussions with Visionics,
proceed to the next level of diligence and analysis, and report back to the
board with additional information and recommendations.

     Following the Identix board of directors meeting on January 29, 2002, each
party initiated due diligence investigations of the other. This due diligence
review continued through February 21, 2002. During this period,

members of Identix' senior management, Lehman Brothers and Identix' independent
accountants and internal and outside legal counsel held meetings with members of
Visionics' senior management, Morgan Keegan and Visionics' independent
accountants and legal counsel regarding business, financial, legal, operational
and integration matters associated with the proposed merger. Identix' internal
and outside legal counsel, independent accountants, and Lehman Brothers reviewed
the due diligence materials provided by Visionics. Visionics' legal counsel,
independent accountants and Morgan Keegan reviewed the due diligence materials
provided by Identix. During this period, the parties also began negotiations
regarding the merger agreement.

     The Visionics board of directors met on February 7, 2002 to discuss a
potential transaction with Identix. Visionics management described the
discussions with Identix regarding a proposed transaction and representatives of
various advisors to Visionics reported to its board the results of their
respective due diligence investigations. Visionics management led board members
through a discussion of the joint strategic planning process conducted by the
parties and a summary of the merger agreement. The board discussed the proposed
business combination and alternative strategies available to Visionics. The
board also reviewed the terms of potential employment agreements between Identix
and its senior executives, including a potential agreement with Dr. Atick,
contingent upon completion of merger.

     The Visionics board met again on February 18, 2002. Visionics management
provided board members with an updated report on the status of the proposed
transaction and representatives of Morgan Keegan presented the board with a
detailed description of the financial analyses it deemed appropriate and
relevant in determining the fairness of the transaction, from a financial point
of view, to the stockholders of Visionics and the results derived from such
analyses. Representatives of Morgan Keegan concluded their presentation by
delivering to the board of directors Morgan Keegan's oral opinion that, as of
February 18, 2002, from a financial point of view, the exchange ratio to be
received by Visionics in the merger was fair to the stockholders of Visionics.
Representatives of Visionics' legal counsel described for the board the status
of the parties' negotiation of the merger agreement. The board also heard a
report concerning the status of potential employment agreements with senior
executives of Identix, including Dr. Atick.

     On February 21, 2002, the Identix board of directors held a special meeting
during which it considered the proposed merger with Visionics. The board of
directors received presentations from the management, as well as Identix'
financial, accounting and legal advisors. Identix board members received a copy
of the merger agreement. The Compensation Committee of the board of directors
also presented recommendations regarding the potential employment agreements and
compensation of certain senior executives of the merged entity, contingent upon
completion of the merger. The Identix board of directors also received Lehman
Brothers' oral opinion that as of February 21, 2002 and subject to certain
matters, from a financial point of view, the exchange ratio to be offered by
Identix in the merger was fair to the stockholders of Identix.

     On February 22, 2002, the Identix board reconvened to continue discussions
of the proposed transaction. Initially, the meeting was comprised of
non-employee directors, who discussed elements of the proposed merger relating
to the employment arrangements of certain senior executives of the combined
company. Thereafter, the entire board convened, and Lehman Brothers delivered to
the board of directors its final written fairness opinion that, as of February
22, 2002, and based on and subject to certain matters stated therein, from a
financial point of view, the exchange ratio to be offered by Identix in the
merger was fair to the stockholders of Identix (see "Opinion of financial
advisor to Identix" on page 36). After further discussion and for the reasons
contained in the section titled "-- Identix' reasons for the merger," the
Identix board unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby and determined to recommend approval by Identix
stockholders of the issuance of Identix common stock in the merger.

     On February 22, 2002, the Visionics board of directors held a telephone
meeting to discuss the Identix transaction. Management reported on the status of
the parties' negotiations and due diligence review, and each board member
received a copy of the merger agreement. Representatives of Morgan Keegan
presented the board of directors with Morgan Keegan's final written opinion
that, as of February 22, 2002, from a financial point of view, the exchange
ratio to be received by Visionics was fair to the stockholders of Visionics.
(See "Opinion of financial advisor to Visionics" on page 44). The board
discussed the proposed transaction and whether it was in the best interests of
Visionics and its stockholders. Following the discussion, the board

unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereunder, including the merger, and resolved to recommend to the stockholders
of Visionics that the merger agreement and proposed merger be approved and
adopted by the stockholders.

IDENTIX' REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     At meetings held on February 21 and February 22, 2002, the Identix board of
directors unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. The board of directors concluded that the
proposed merger and related transactions were fair to and in the best interests
of Identix and its stockholders. In reaching its decision, the board of
directors consulted with its financial advisors, Lehman Brothers, its legal
counsel, Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe LLP, its independent accountants,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and with Identix' senior management. The board took
into consideration a number of factors, including the following:

     - the opportunity to respond more fully to the needs of multiple markets
       and industries for live scan and biometric security applications and
       solutions through combined product and service offerings;

     - the opportunity to create multi-biometric enabled enterprise security
       systems;

     - the opportunity to offer a more complete line of products to the combined
       company's customer base;

     - the opportunity to realize efficiencies in combined field sales and
       support teams to produce increased productivity and greater customer
       satisfaction;

     - the opportunity to build upon relationships with selected product and
       service partners of Identix and Visionics;

     - the opportunity to further pursue the global capabilities of Identix and
       Visionics;

     - the opportunity to integrate engineering and technical resources to
       create greater productivity and broader product and service offerings;

     - the potential enhancement of revenue growth associated with combining
       complementary product lines and sales channels;

     - the potential cost savings associated with the elimination of redundant
       expenses; and

     - the opinion of Lehman Brothers that, as of February 22, 2002, and based
       on and subject to certain matters stated therein, from a financial point
       of view, the exchange ratio to be offered by Identix in the merger was
       fair to the stockholders of Identix.

     The Identix board also identified and considered a variety of potential
risks and potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the
merger, including, but not limited to:

     - the risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger might not be
       fully realized;

     - the possibility that the merger might not be consummated;

     - the potential dilutive effect of the issuance of Identix common stock in
       the merger;

     - the substantial charges to be incurred, primarily in the quarter ending
       June 30, 2002, in connection with the merger, including costs of
       integrating the businesses and transaction expenses arising from the
       merger; and

     - various other risks.

     The Identix board believed that these risks were outweighed by the
potential benefits of the merger.

     In view of the wide variety of the material factors considered in
connection with the evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these
matters, the Identix board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did
not, quantify or otherwise attempt to assign any relative weight to the various
factors considered. In addition, the Identix board of directors did not
undertake to make any specific determination as to whether

any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or
unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the Identix board of directors, but
rather the Identix board of directors conducted an overall analysis of the
factors described above, including discussions with and questioning of Identix'
senior management and legal and financial advisors.

     There can be no assurance that the potential savings, synergies or
opportunities considered by the Identix board of directors will be achieved
though consummation of the merger. See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 15.

OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO IDENTIX

     General.  Lehman Brothers has acted as financial advisor to Identix in
connection with the merger. On February 22, 2002, Lehman Brothers rendered its
opinion to the Identix board of directors that as of such date and, based upon
and subject to certain matters stated therein, from a financial point of view,
the exchange ratio to be offered by Identix in the merger, was fair to the
stockholders of Identix.

     THE FULL TEXT OF THE LEHMAN BROTHERS' WRITTEN OPINION DATED FEBRUARY 22,
2002 IS INCLUDED AS ANNEX B TO THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. IDENTIX
STOCKHOLDERS MAY READ THE LEHMAN BROTHERS OPINION FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE
PROCEDURES FOLLOWED, FACTORS CONSIDERED, ASSUMPTIONS MADE AND QUALIFICATIONS AND
LIMITATIONS OF THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY LEHMAN BROTHERS IN CONNECTION WITH ITS
OPINION. THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE LEHMAN BROTHERS OPINION AND THE
METHODOLOGY THAT LEHMAN BROTHERS USED TO RENDER ITS OPINION.

     Lehman Brothers' advisory services and opinion were provided for the
information and assistance of the Identix board of directors in connection with
its consideration of the merger agreement. Lehman Brothers' opinion is not
intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of
Identix as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the merger.
Lehman Brothers was not requested to opine as to, and Lehman Brothers' opinion
does not address, Identix' underlying business decision to proceed with or
effect the merger.

     In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers reviewed and analyzed:

     - the merger agreement and the specific terms of the merger;

     - publicly available information concerning Identix that Lehman Brothers
       believed to be relevant to its analysis, including Identix' Annual Report
       on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 and Quarterly
       Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2001 and
       December 31, 2001;

     - publicly available information concerning Visionics that Lehman Brothers
       believed to be relevant to its analysis, including Visionics' Annual
       Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 and
       Visionics' Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December
       31, 2001;

     - financial and operating information with respect to the business,
       operations and prospects of Identix furnished to Lehman Brothers by
       Identix;

     - financial and operating information with respect to the business,
       operations and prospects of Visionics furnished to Lehman Brothers by
       Visionics;

     - the operating synergies and strategic benefits expected by the management
       of Identix and Visionics to result from a combination of the businesses
       of Identix and Visionics (the "Expected Synergies");

     - publicly available estimates of the future financial performance of
       Identix prepared by Lehman Brothers' research analyst;

     - publicly available estimates of the future financial performance of
       Visionics prepared by third party research analysts;

     - trading histories of the common stock of Identix and Visionics from
       January 1, 2001 to February 20, 2002 and a comparison of these trading
       histories with each other and those of other companies that Lehman
       Brothers deemed relevant;

     - a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial
       condition of Identix and Visionics with each other and those of other
       companies that Lehman Brothers deemed relevant;

     - a comparison of the financial terms of the merger with the financial
       terms of certain other recent transactions that Lehman Brothers deemed
       relevant;

     - the pro forma effect of the merger on the projected earnings per share of
       Identix; and

     - the relative contributions of Identix and Visionics to the future
       financial performance of the combined company on a pro forma basis
       including Expected Synergies.

     In addition, Lehman Brothers had discussions with the management of Identix
and Visionics concerning their respective businesses, operations, assets,
financial conditions and prospects, and undertook such other studies, analyses
and investigations as Lehman Brothers deemed appropriate.

     In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers assumed and relied upon the
accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information used by it
without assuming any responsibility for independent verification of such
information. Lehman Brothers also relied upon the assurances of management of
Identix and Visionics that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that
would make such information inaccurate or misleading. Upon advice of Identix,
Lehman Brothers assumed that the financial projections of Identix were
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments of the management of Identix as to the future financial
performance of Identix and that Identix will perform substantially in accordance
with such projections. Upon advice of Visionics, Lehman Brothers assumed that
the financial projections of Visionics ("Visionics Management Case") were
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments of the management of Visionics as to the future financial
performance of Visionics. However, for the purposes of its analysis, Lehman
Brothers also considered certain somewhat more conservative assumptions and
estimates which resulted in certain adjustments to the financial projections of
Visionics ("Visionics Lehman Brothers Case"). Upon the advice of Identix, Lehman
Brothers also assumed that the amounts and timing of the Expected Synergies are
reasonable and that the Expected Synergies will be realized substantially in
accordance with such estimates. In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers
conducted only a limited physical inspection of the properties and facilities of
Identix and Visionics. Lehman Brothers also did not make or obtain any
evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of Identix and Visionics.
Upon advice of Identix and its legal advisors, Lehman Brothers assumed that the
proposed transaction will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and accordingly
as a tax-free transaction to the stockholders of Identix. Lehman Brothers'
opinion necessarily was based upon market, economic and other conditions as they
existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of such opinion.

     In addition, Lehman Brothers expressed no opinion as to the prices at which
shares of Identix common stock would trade following the announcement of the
merger, and its opinion should not be viewed as providing any assurance that the
market value of shares of Identix' stock after consummation of the merger will
be in excess of the market value of such shares at any time prior to
announcement or consummation of the merger.

     In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers did not ascribe a specific
range of value to Identix or Visionics, but rather made its determination as to
the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to be
offered by Identix to Visionics in the merger on the basis of financial and
comparative analyses described below. The preparation of a fairness opinion
involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods
of financial and comparative analysis and the application of those methods to
the particular circumstances, and therefore, such an opinion is not readily
susceptible to summary description. Furthermore, Lehman Brothers did not
attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but
rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each
analysis and factor. Accordingly, Lehman Brothers believes that its analyses
must be considered as a whole and that considering any portion of such analyses
and factors, without considering all analyses and factors as a whole, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion. In
its analyses, Lehman Brothers made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business and economic

conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Identix
and Visionics. None of Identix, Visionics, Lehman Brothers or any other person
assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those
discussed. Any estimates contained in these analyses were not necessarily
indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may
be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth in the analyses. In
addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses actually may be sold.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by
Lehman Brothers in connection with rendering its opinion to the Identix board of
directors. Some of the summaries of the financial and comparative analyses
include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand
the methodologies used by Lehman Brothers and the results of its financial and
comparative analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial and comparative analyses. Accordingly, the information presented in
the tables and described below must be considered as a whole. Considering any
portion of such analyses and of the factors considered, without considering all
analyses and factors as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of
the process underlying Lehman Brothers' opinion.

     Comparable Company Analysis.  Using publicly available information, Lehman
Brothers compared selected financial data of Identix and Visionics with each
other and with similar data of selected companies engaged in businesses
considered by Lehman Brothers to be comparable to that of Identix and Visionics.
Specifically, Lehman Brothers included in its review the following companies:

     - Biometrics Companies:

      - Communication Intelligence Corporation;

      - Nuance Communications;

      - SAC Technologies, Inc.;

      - SAFLINK Corporation;

      - Sandata Technologies, Inc.;

      - SENSE Holdings, Inc.;

      - SpeechWorks International Incorporated;

      - Viisage Technology, Inc.;

     - Authentication/Authorization Companies:

      - ActivCard S.A.;

      - Netegrity, Inc.;

      - RSA Security Inc.;

      - Secure Computing Corporation; and

      - VASCO Data Security International Inc.

     For each of Identix (with and without the Identix Public Sector business),
Visionics Management Case and Visionics Lehman Brothers Case and the selected
biometrics and authentication/authorization companies, Lehman Brothers
calculated the ratios of enterprise value to revenue and enterprise value to
gross profit estimates for the calendar years 2001, 2002 and 2003. For the
selected biometrics and authentication/authorization companies, Lehman Brothers
used revenue and gross profit estimates published by third party research. The
enterprise value of each company was obtained by adding its short and long term
debt to the sum of the market value of its diluted common equity, the value of
any preferred stock and the book value of any minority interest, and subtracting
its cash and cash equivalents. Lehman Brothers then compared those ratios for
the selected companies to similar ratios calculated for Identix and for
Visionics based on the

consideration and on estimates for Visionics Management Case and Visionics
Lehman Brothers Case revenue. The following table presents the revenue
multiples:

                                                                   ENTERPRISE VALUE/
                                                                   REVENUE MULTIPLES

     Because of the inherent differences between the businesses, operations,
financial conditions and prospects of Identix and Visionics and the businesses,
operations, financial conditions and prospects of the companies included in its
comparable company groups, Lehman Brothers believed that it was inappropriate to
rely solely on the quantitative results of the analysis, and accordingly, also
made qualitative judgments concerning differences between the financial and
operating characteristics of Identix and Visionics and the companies in its
respective comparable company groups that would affect the public trading values
of Identix and Visionics and the comparable companies. In particular, Lehman
Brothers considered markets served, rates of growth and profitability of Identix
and Visionics and each of the companies in the comparable company groups. Lehman
Brothers concluded that such analysis was supportive of its opinion as to the
fairness of the exchange ratio to be offered by Identix in the merger.

     Stock Trading History.  Lehman Brothers considered historical data
concerning the history of the trading prices for Identix, Visionics, an index of
the stock prices of biometrics and authentication/authorization companies and
the Nasdaq composite index for the period from January 1, 2001 to February 20,
2002.

     Purchase Price Ratio Analysis.  Lehman Brothers performed a purchase price
ratio analysis to estimate the transaction price implied by various exchange
ratios, the premium or discount to market price and various average prices, and
the pro forma ownership of Identix in the combined entity. The following table
summarizes this data for the agreed upon exchange ratio, wherein the transaction
price is based on 1.3436 times the Identix closing price on February 21, 2002:

     Comparable Transaction Analysis.  The comparable transaction analysis
provides a market benchmark based on the consideration paid in selected
comparable transactions. For this analysis, Lehman Brothers reviewed publicly
available information to determine the purchase prices and multiples paid in
twelve acquisitions of public security companies since January 1, 1996.

     Lehman Brothers identified six transactions with a transaction value of
over $300 million of the twelve transactions reviewed and divided the enterprise
values of the relevant transactions by each of the following revenue
measurements from the acquired businesses: (1) the total revenue for the latest
twelve months, or LTM, and (2) the total revenue for the following four
consecutive quarters, or Forward 4Q. Lehman Brothers also adjusted the revenue
multiples for transactions announced after January 1, 2000 from the announcement
date of these transactions to February 20, 2002 based on the change in Nasdaq
Index value during the same period. The following table shows the revenue
multiples and the adjusted revenue multiples for the selected transactions:

                                                                               NASDAQ ADJUSTED

                                                       ------   ----------   ------   ----------

COMPARABLE TRANSACTION MULTIPLES:
Identix/Visionics Merger (Visionics Management
  Case)..............................................   9.06x     6.35x       9.06x     6.35x
Identix/Visionics Merger (Visionics Lehman Brothers

Median of Selected Comparable Transactions...........  10.18x     6.19x      10.05x     5.80x

     Because the reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the
transactions analyzed were so diverse and because of the inherent differences in
the businesses, operations, financial conditions and prospects of Identix and
Visionics and the businesses, operations, and financial conditions of the
companies included in the comparable transactions group, Lehman Brothers
believed that a purely quantitative comparable transaction analysis would not be
particularly meaningful in the context of the merger. Lehman Brothers believed
that the appropriate use of a comparable transaction analysis in this instance
would involve qualitative judgments concerning the differences between the
characteristics of these transactions and the merger which would affect the
acquisition values of the acquired companies and Visionics. Lehman Brothers
concluded that such analysis was supportive of its opinion as to the fairness of
the exchange ratio to be offered by Identix in the merger.

     Premium Paid Analysis.  Using publicly available information, Lehman
Brothers reviewed the premiums paid, or proposed to be paid, in the case of
transactions pending as of the date of the Lehman Brothers opinion, in twelve
merger of equals transactions of public technology companies since January 1,
1994.

     Lehman Brothers calculated the premium per share paid by the acquirer
compared to the share price of the target company for one day and for the
average of the 30 trading days prior to announcement of each transaction. Lehman
Brothers compared the premiums paid in the technology sector to the premium to
be paid by Identix for Visionics in the merger. Lehman Brothers concluded that
such analysis was supportive of its opinion as to the fairness of the exchange
ratio to be offered by Identix in the merger. The following table shows the one
day and 30 day average premiums:

                                                              1 DAY   30 DAY AVG.

Median of Selected Technology Merger of Equals
  Transactions..............................................  17.7%       15.4%

     Pro Forma Merger Analysis.  Lehman Brothers analyzed the pro forma impact
of the merger on Identix' earnings per share based on the Visionics Management
Case and Visionics Lehman Brothers Case with and without taking into account
possible revenue and cost synergies. In each case, Lehman Brothers concluded
that the transaction was accretive to Identix' earnings per share in calendar
years 2002 and 2003. Lehman Brothers concluded that such analysis was supportive
of its opinion as to the fairness of the exchange ratio to be offered by
Identix' stockholders in the merger.

     Adjusted Contribution Analysis.  Lehman Brothers utilized Management
projections for Identix and both Management and Lehman Brothers projections for
Visionics to calculate the relative contributions of Identix and Visionics to
the pro forma combined company with respect to gross profit. Lehman Brothers
then adjusted the resulting relative enterprise values for each company's
balance sheet contributions as well as contributions of cost and revenue
synergies and tax savings due to future use of net operating losses. Lehman
Brothers concluded that such analysis was supportive of its opinion as to the
fairness of the exchange ratio to be offered by Identix in the merger. The
following table demonstrates the ranges for the net adjusted ownership
percentages of Identix and Visionics:

                                                                                     LEHMAN BROTHERS

     Lehman Brothers is an internationally recognized investment banking firm
and, as part of its investment banking activities, is regularly engaged in the
valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with

mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. The Identix Board selected Lehman
Brothers because of its expertise, reputation and familiarity with Identix and
the security industry generally and because its investment banking professionals
have substantial experience in transactions comparable to the merger.

     As compensation for its services in connection with the merger, Identix has
agreed to pay Lehman Brothers a customary fee, a portion of which will be
payable in Identix common stock and a portion of which is payable on
consummation of the merger. In addition, Identix has agreed to reimburse Lehman
Brothers for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
merger and to indemnify Lehman Brothers for certain liabilities that may arise
out of its engagement by Identix and the rendering of Lehman Brothers' opinion.

     In the ordinary course of its business, Lehman Brothers may actively trade
in the debt or equity securities of Identix and Visionics for its own account
and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a
long or short position in such securities.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE IDENTIX BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The Identix board of directors unanimously believes that the terms of the
merger are fair to and in the best interests of Identix and its stockholders and
recommends to its stockholders that they vote "FOR" the proposal to issue shares
of Identix common stock in the merger.

     In considering the recommendation of the Identix board of directors with
respect to the merger, you should be aware that certain directors and officers
of Identix have certain interests in the merger that are different from, or are
in addition to, the interests of Identix' stockholders generally. Please see the
section titled "The Merger -- Interests of certain persons in the merger" on
page 51.

VISIONICS' REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     On February 22, 2002, the Visionics board of directors unanimously approved
the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
The board of directors concluded that the proposed merger and related
transactions was fair to and in the best interests of Visionics and its
stockholders. In reaching its decision, the board of directors consulted with
its financial advisors, Morgan Keegan, its legal counsel, Maslon Edelman Borman
& Brand, LLP, and with Visionics' senior management. The Visionics board took
into consideration a number of factors including the following:

     - the opportunity to leverage the greater asset base of the combined
       company to place it at the forefront of the biometric industry;

     - the opportunity to improve customer value by offering a broader array of
       products and solutions, including background checks, physical or logical
       access control, and surveillance;

     - the opportunity to create a scalable platform offering for both finger
       and face recognition and the largest available offering of biometric
       solutions empowering both authorization and identification;

     - the opportunities for the combined company to sell biometrics products to
       the broader customer base;

     - the opportunity to develop operational efficiencies conducive to
       achieving sustained profitability without a slowdown in innovation or
       market development; and

     - the opportunity for the combined company to migrate into a more
       significant role in the fast growing security market.

     The Visionics board also identified and considered a number of potentially
negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger, including, but not
limited to:

     - the risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger might not be
       fully realized;

     - the substantial costs to be incurred, primarily in the quarter ending
       June 30, 2002, in connection with the merger, including costs of
       integrating the businesses and transaction expenses arising from the
       merger; and

     - various other risks.

     The Visionics board believed that these risks were outweighed by the
potential benefits of the merger.

     The foregoing discussion of the information and factors by the Visionics
board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive. In view of the wide variety
of the material factors considered in connection with the evaluation of the
merger and the complexity of these matters, the Visionics board of directors did
not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attempt to assign
any relative weight to the various factors considered. In addition, the board
did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any
particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or
unfavorable to their ultimate determination, but rather the board conducted an
overall analysis of the factors described above, including discussion with, and
questioning of, Visionics' senior management, and legal and financial advisors.

     There can be no assurance that the potential savings, synergies or
opportunities considered by the board of directors of Visionics will be achieved
through consummation of the merger. See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 15.

OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO VISIONICS

     Morgan Keegan acted as financial advisor to Visionics in connection with
the merger. As part of its engagement, Morgan Keegan was requested by the board
of directors of Visionics to deliver its opinion that the exchange ratio is
fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Visionics common stock.
Morgan Keegan is a nationally recognized investment banking firm and was
selected by Visionics based on its reputation and experience in investment
banking in general and its recognized expertise in the valuation of businesses
as well as its prior investment banking relationships with Visionics. On
February 18, 2002, at the special meeting of the Visionics board of directors,
Morgan Keegan delivered to the board of directors its oral opinion, which was
subsequently confirmed in a written opinion, dated February 22, 2002, that,
based on and subject to the matters set forth therein, the exchange ratio is
fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Visionics common stock.

     You should consider the following when reading the discussion of the
opinion of Morgan Keegan herein:

     - You are urged to read carefully the entire opinion of Morgan Keegan,
       which is attached as Annex C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and
       is incorporated herein by reference;

     - Morgan Keegan's advisory services and opinion were provided to the board
       of directors of Visionics for its information in its consideration of the
       merger and was directed only to the fairness of the exchange ratio, from
       a financial point of view, to the holders of Visionics common stock; and

     - Morgan Keegan's opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to
       whether or not any holder of Visionics common stock should vote in favor
       of the merger and does not address the underlying business decision of
       Visionics to engage in the merger as compared to any other alternative
       business strategy that might exist for Visionics or the effect of any
       other transactions in which Visionics might engage.

     Although Morgan Keegan evaluated the fairness of the exchange ratio, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of Visionics common stock pursuant to
the merger agreement, the exchange ratio itself was determined by Visionics and
Identix through arm's-length negotiations. Visionics did not provide specific
instructions to, or place any limitations on, Morgan Keegan with respect to the
procedures to be followed or factors to be considered by Morgan Keegan in
performing its analyses or providing its opinion.

     In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Keegan reviewed, among other things, the
following:

     - the merger agreement;

     - certain publicly available business and financial information relating to
       Visionics and Identix; and

     - certain other information provided to it by Visionics and Identix,
       including management's forecasts of cost savings and synergies to be
       achieved in the merger.

     Morgan Keegan also held discussions with members of the senior management
of Visionics and Identix regarding the strategic rationale for, and the
potential benefits of, the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement and
the past and current business operations, financial condition and future
prospects of their respective companies. In addition, Morgan Keegan:

     - reviewed the reported historical prices and historical trading activity
       for Visionics common stock and Identix common stock;

     - compared the financial performance of Visionics common stock and Identix
       common stock with that of certain other publicly-traded companies;

     - reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of
       certain other business combinations and other transactions that it deemed
       relevant; and

     - performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as it
       deemed appropriate.

     Morgan Keegan assumed and relied upon, without independent verification,
the accuracy and completeness of the information it reviewed in arriving at its
opinion. With respect to the financial forecasts, including information relating
to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the
merger, Morgan Keegan assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the future
financial performance of Visionics and Identix. Morgan Keegan also relied upon,
without independent verification, the assessments of both the management of
Visionics and Identix as to (i) the existing and future technology and products
of Visionics and Identix and the risks associated with such technology and
products, (ii) the potential cost savings and synergies (including the amount,
timing and achievability thereof) anticipated to result from the merger and
(iii) strategic benefits anticipated to result from the merger and the ability
of management of the combined company to integrate the businesses of Visionics
and Identix. Morgan Keegan assumed that there had been no material changes in
Visionics' or Identix' assets, financial condition, results of operations,
business or prospects since the respective dates of the last financial
statements made available. Morgan Keegan was informed that it is the intention
of the parties that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and
Morgan Keegan assumed that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the
terms set forth in the merger agreement and in compliance with the applicable

  HISTORICAL TRADING AND EXCHANGE RATIO ANALYSIS

     Morgan Keegan examined the historical closing prices of Visionics common
stock and Identix common stock from February 15, 2001 to February 21, 2002.
Morgan Keegan observed that, during this time period, Visionics common stock
reached a high of $21.12 per share and a low of $3.38 per share. For the same
time period, Identix common stock reached a high of $15.74 per share and a low
of $3.75 per share. Based on the closing prices of Visionics common stock and
Identix common stock, Morgan Keegan observed that, during this time period,
Visionics common stock appreciated 72.6% and Identix common stock depreciated
22.7%. In addition, Morgan Keegan noted that the closing prices of Visionics
common stock and Identix common stock increased 93.2% and 71.4%, respectively,
between September 10, 2001 and September 17, 2001. Morgan Keegan also observed
that, between September 10, 2001 and February 21, 2002, Visionics common stock
appreciated 141.2% and Identix common stock appreciated 69.3%.

     Morgan Keegan compared the historical ratios of the closing price of
Visionics common stock to the closing price of Identix common stock for various
time periods ended February 21, 2002 to determine the average market exchange
ratio for each time period measured. Morgan Keegan then compared the exchange
ratio set forth in the merger agreement to the average market exchange ratio for
each time period measured and examined the premium or discount represented by
the exchange ratio in the merger agreement over the average market exchange
ratio. A summary of the average market exchange ratios for the time periods
measured and the corresponding premium or discount relative to the exchange
ratio in the merger agreement is set forth in the table below:

     Morgan Keegan observed that the exchange ratio in the merger agreement
constituted a premium to the average market exchange ratio, based on stock
price, for five of the eleven periods measured.

     In addition, Morgan Keegan compared the historical ratios of the market
capitalization of Visionics to the market capitalization of Identix for various
time periods ended February 21, 2002 to determine the average market exchange
ratio for each time period measured. For the purposes of its analysis, Morgan
Keegan defined market capitalization as the product of closing price and basic
shares outstanding, and did not give consideration to any options and warrants
issued and outstanding by each of Visionics and Identix and their potential
impact on the average market exchange ratio for the time period measured. Morgan
Keegan then compared the exchange ratio in the merger agreement to the average
market exchange ratio for each time period measured and examined the premium or
discount represented by the exchange ratio in the merger agreement over the
average market exchange ratio. A summary of the market exchange ratios for the
time

periods measured and the corresponding premium or discount relative to the
exchange ratio in the merger agreement is set forth in the table below:

     Morgan Keegan observed that the exchange ratio in the merger agreement
constituted a premium to the average market exchange ratio, based on market
capitalization, for all eleven of the time periods measured.

  PEER GROUP ANALYSIS

     Morgan Keegan compared the financial, market, and operating information,
including forecasted financial information, for selected publicly traded
companies that Morgan Keegan deemed appropriate for comparison with financial,
market, and operating information, including forecasted financial information,
for each of Visionics and Identix. For the purposes of its peer group analysis,
Morgan Keegan segmented the lines of business of each of Visionics and Identix,
and identified two lines of business for Visionics, consisting of imaging and
security, and three lines of business for Identix, consisting of imaging,
security and government services. Morgan Keegan identified two sets of peer
group companies deemed comparable to the imaging and security lines of business
of both Visionics and Identix:

     - Peer Group 1 -- technology-oriented security products and services
       companies; and

     - Peer Group 2 -- data security software and services companies.

     Morgan Keegan identified a third set of peer group companies deemed
comparable to the government services line of business of Identix:

     - Peer Group 3 -- government-focused information technology ("IT") services
       companies.

     The forecasted financial information used by Morgan Keegan for the selected
comparable companies for the peer group analysis was based on an average of the
published estimates of securities analysts from various investment banking
firms, as reported by I/B/E/S. The segmentation of business lines and the
forecasted financial information for each of Visionics and Identix used by
Morgan Keegan for the purposes of the peer group analysis was provided by the
management of Visionics and Identix, respectively.

     In performing the peer group analysis, Morgan Keegan:

     - calculated the enterprise value of each peer group company as a multiple
       of its historical revenues for the latest twelve months ("LTM") ended
       December 31, 2001, and forecasted revenues for the calendar year ending
       December 31, 2002, and the calendar year ending December 31, 2003;

     - applied the median valuation multiples derived from Peer Groups 1 and 2
       to the historical and forecasted revenues from the imaging and security
       lines of business of Visionics and Identix for the

       LTM ended December 31, 2001, calendar year ending December 31, 2002, and
       calendar year ending December 31, 2003. Morgan Keegan also applied the
       median valuation multiple derived from Peer Group 3 to the historical and
       forecasted revenues from the government services line of business of
       Identix for the LTM ended December 31, 2001, calendar year ending
       December 31, 2002, and calendar year ending December 31, 2003;

     - determined implied equity values and implied prices per share for each of
       Visionics and Identix; and

     - used the implied price per share information to calculate a range of
       implied exchange ratios and compared the range of implied exchange ratios
       to the exchange ratio in the merger agreement.

     The enterprise value of a company is equal to the product of its stock
price and diluted common stock outstanding plus debt and the liquidation value
of its preferred stock, if any, minus cash and the value of certain other assets
including minority interests in other entities and certain intangible assets.
For the purposes of the peer group analysis, in determining enterprise value,
Morgan Keegan used closing stock prices as of February 21, 2002.

     A summary of the peer group analysis is set forth in the following table:

                                                                 ENTERPRISE VALUE/
                                                                 REVENUE MULTIPLES
                                                              ------------------------

- ----------                                                    ----   -------   -------

Peer Group 1 -- Technology-Oriented Security Products and
  Services..................................................  3.2x    1.7x      1.6x
Peer Group 2 -- Data Security Software and Services.........  4.2x    3.6x      3.3x
Peer Group 3 -- Government-Focused IT Services..............  1.0x    0.8x      0.7x

     Based on the peer group analysis, Morgan Keegan derived a range of implied
exchange ratios of .9486 to 1.3663.

  SELECTED PRECEDENT TRANSACTIONS ANALYSIS

     Morgan Keegan reviewed certain financial terms, to the extent publicly
available, of 51 mergers and acquisitions transactions it deemed comparable to
the merger. For the purposes of its selected precedent transactions analysis,
Morgan Keegan segmented the lines of business of each of Visionics and Identix
in the same manner as described previously in the peer group analysis. In
addition, Morgan Keegan categorized the 51 transactions into three groups.
Morgan Keegan identified two groups of precedent transactions it deemed relevant
in analyzing the imaging and security lines of business of both Visionics and
Identix:

     - Precedent Transaction Group 1 -- nine selected merger of equals
       transactions involving technology companies effective or pending
       completion since January 1, 2000; and

     - Precedent Transaction Group 2 -- 21 selected mergers and acquisitions
       transactions involving companies providing technology-based security
       products and services effective or pending completion since January 1,
       1999.

     Morgan Keegan identified one group of precedent transactions it deemed to
be relevant in analyzing the government services line of business of Identix:

     - Precedent Transaction Group 3 -- 21 selected mergers and acquisitions
       transactions involving companies providing IT services, either in whole
       or in part, to governmental entities effective or pending completion
       since January 1, 1999.

     For each of the selected transactions, Morgan Keegan calculated the
multiple of the enterprise value for each target company implied by the
transaction to the target company's reported revenues for the last twelve

month period prior to the public announcement of the transaction. Morgan Keegan
then calculated the median valuation multiple for each precedent transaction
group, as summarized in the table below:

                                                                ENTERPRISE
                                                               VALUE/REVENUE
                                                                 MULTIPLES
                                                               -------------
PRECEDENT TRANSACTION GROUP                                         LTM
- ---------------------------                                    -------------

Precedent Transaction Group 1 -- Technology-Based Mergers of
  Equals....................................................       6.1x
Precedent Transaction Group 2 -- Technology-Oriented
  Security Products and Services............................       5.4x
Precedent Transaction Group 3 -- Government-Focused IT
  Services..................................................       1.0x

     In performing the selected precedent transactions analysis, Morgan Keegan:

     - applied the median valuation multiples derived from Precedent Transaction
       Groups 1 and 2 to the historical revenues from the imaging and security
       lines of business of each of Visionics and Identix for the LTM ended
       December 31, 2001;

     - applied the median valuation multiples derived from Precedent Transaction
       Group 3 to the historical revenues from the government services line of
       business of Identix for the LTM ended December 31, 2001;

     - determined the implied equity values and implied prices per share for
       each of Visionics and Identix; and

     - used the implied price per share information to determine a range of
       implied exchange ratios and compared the range of implied exchange ratios
       to the exchange ratio in the merger agreement.

     Based on the selected precedent transactions analysis, Morgan Keegan
derived a range of implied exchange ratios of 1.0712 to 1.0985. All multiples
for the selected precedent transactions were based on public information
available at the time of announcement of such transaction, without taking into
account differing market and other conditions during the period in which the
selected transactions occurred. Because the reasons for, and circumstances
surrounding, each of the precedent transactions analyzed were so diverse, and
due to the inherent differences between the operations and financial conditions
of Visionics and Identix and the companies involved in the selected precedent
transactions, Morgan Keegan believes that a precedent transaction analysis is
not simply mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and
qualitative judgments, reflected in Morgan Keegan's opinion, concerning
differences between the characteristics of these transactions and the merger
that could affect the value of the subject companies and businesses and
Visionics and Identix.

  PREMIUM ANALYSIS

     Morgan Keegan analyzed the premiums-to-market in selected completed merger
of equals transactions involving publicly-traded companies with enterprise
values above $50 million effective or pending completion since January 1, 1999.
Morgan Keegan analyzed the premium-to-market over the analyzed target company's
stock price one-day, one-week and one-month prior to the announcement date of
their respective transactions, calculated the median of these premiums for the
transactions analyzed and applied these premiums to Visionics closing stock
price on February 21, 2002, February 15, 2002, and January 25, 2002, to
calculate an implied price per share for Visionics common stock. The range of
implied share prices for Visionics was then compared to the implied price per
share of Visionics common stock based on the exchange ratio in the merger
agreement and the closing prices of Visionics and Identix as of February 21,
2002.

     The median premiums over the one-day, one-week and one-month closing prices
for the transactions analyzed were 6.0%, 6.0% and 1.9%, respectively, resulting
in a range of implied prices of $10.92 to $14.07 per share of Visionics common
stock, as compared to the implied price per share of $9.55 per share based on
the exchange ratio in the merger agreement and the closing prices of Visionics
and Identix as of February 21, 2002.

     In addition, in performing the premium analysis, Morgan Keegan analyzed the
volume-weighted average prices per share for Visionics and Identix over certain
time periods between September 10, 2001 and February 21, 2002. Morgan Keegan
applied the exchange ratio in the merger agreement to the volume-weighted
average price per share of Identix for each of the time periods measured to
derive an implied price per share for Visionics and then compared the implied
price per share to the actual volume-weighted average price per share of
Visionics for the time period measured. Based on this analysis, Morgan Keegan
observed that the implied price per share of Visionics exceeded the actual
volume-weighted average price per share of Visionics for four of the nine time
periods measured.

  CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS

     Morgan Keegan analyzed the relative contributions of Visionics and Identix,
comparing Visionics' pro forma relative ownership of approximately 47.4% of the
outstanding capital of the combined company, on a diluted basis, as calculated
based on the exchange ratio in the merger agreement and closing prices as of
February 21, 2002, to pro forma financial condition and results of operations of
the combined company, as calculated based on historical financial results for
the LTM ended December 31, 2001, and financial forecasts for the calendar year
ending December 31, 2002, and the calendar year ending December 31, 2003, as
provided to Morgan Keegan by the management of Visionics and Identix. The
analysis assessing the relative contribution of revenues indicated that on a pro
forma combined basis (excluding the effect of any synergies that may be realized
as a result of the merger), the range of Visionics' contribution to the combined
company's pro forma revenue is 28.5% to 36.8%. The analysis assessing the
relative contribution of gross profits indicated that on a pro forma combined
basis (excluding the effect of any synergies that may be realized as a result of
the merger), the range of Visionics' contribution to the combined company's pro
forma gross profit is 45.8% to 49.2%. Based on financial results as of December
31, 2001, Visionics' contribution to the combined company's pro forma tangible
stockholders' equity is 33.5%.

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving
various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analysis and the application of these methods to the particular
circumstances and, therefore, is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis
or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set
forth above, without considering the analysis as a whole, could create an
incomplete view of the processes underlying Morgan Keegan's opinion. In arriving
at its fairness determination, Morgan Keegan considered the results of all such
analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis
considered by it; rather, Morgan Keegan made its determination as to fairness on
the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the
results of all such analyses. No company or transaction used in the above
analyses is directly comparable to Visionics, Identix or the contemplated
transaction. In addition, mathematical analysis such as determining the mean or
median is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected data. The analyses
were prepared solely for purposes of Morgan Keegan providing its opinion to the
Board of Directors as to the fairness of the exchange ratio, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Visionics common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement and do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices
at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based on
forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by
such analyses. Because such analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty,
being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or
their respective advisors, none of Visionics, Identix, Morgan Keegan or any
other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different
from those forecast. As described below, the opinion of Morgan Keegan to the
Board of Directors of Visionics was among several factors taken into
consideration by the Board of Directors in making its determination to approve
the merger agreement.

     Morgan Keegan, as part of its investment banking business, is continually
engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements
and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes.

     Morgan Keegan provides a full range of financial advisory and securities
services and, in the course of its normal trading activities, may from time to
time effect transactions and hold securities, including derivative

securities, of Visionics or Identix for its own account or for the accounts of
customers. Prior to this engagement, Morgan Keegan has provided investment
banking services to Visionics and Morgan Keegan may provide investment banking
services to Visionics and its subsidiaries in the future.

     Under the terms of an engagement letter dated January 17, 2002, Visionics
has agreed to pay Morgan Keegan a customary fee for its financial advisory
services, a portion of which is payable in Visionics common stock, and a portion
of which is payable upon consummation of the merger. Visionics has also agreed
to reimburse Morgan Keegan for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with the engagement, including attorney's fees, and to indemnify
Morgan Keegan and its respective related parties from and against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE VISIONICS BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The Visionics board of directors unanimously believes that the terms of the
merger are fair to and in the best interests of Visionics and its stockholders
and recommends to its stockholders that they vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement.

     In considering the recommendation of the Visionics board of directors with
respect to the merger, you should be aware that certain directors and officers
of Visionics have certain interests in the merger that are different from, or
are in addition to, the interests of Visionics stockholders generally as
discussed below in the section titled "The Merger -- Interests of certain
persons in the merger" on page 50.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

     Some of the directors and officers of Visionics and Identix have interests
in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of
Visionics and Identix stockholders. These interests include:

     - options to purchase shares of Visionics common stock, including those
       held by officers and directors of Visionics, will be assumed by Identix
       and will become options to acquire Identix common stock as adjusted for
       the exchange ratio of the merger, and the vesting of some of these
       options and certain grants of restricted shares previously awarded to
       Visionics' non-employee directors will be accelerated upon completion of
       the merger in accordance with the terms of option agreements and the
       applicable stock based compensation plan;

     - Identix will continue certain indemnification arrangements and maintain a
       directors and officers liability insurance policy for persons serving as
       directors and officers of Visionics at the time of the merger for a
       period of six years following the effective time of the merger;

     - Dr. Joseph J. Atick, current chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
       Visionics, will serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the combined
       entity upon completion of the merger, pursuant to an employment agreement
       discussed below in the section titled "-- Employment and change of
       control arrangements" on page 52;

     - Robert McCashin, current chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Identix,
       will serve as chairman of the board, pursuant to an amendment to
       employment agreement discussed below in the section titled "-- Employment
       and change of control arrangements" on page 52;

     - James P. Scullion, President and Chief Operating Officer of Identix, will
       assume the same roles in the merged entity, pursuant to an employment
       agreement discussed below in the section titled "-- Employment and change
       of control arrangements" on page 52;

     - Erik E. Prusch, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of
       Identix, will assume the same role in the merger entity; in addition, Mr.
       Prusch has been granted an option to purchase 100,000 shares of Identix
       common stock at a price per share equal to the fair market value of
       Identix common stock as of the closing date, which option grant is
       contingent upon the completion of the merger and vests over four years
       thereafter;

     - Mark Molina, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of
       Identix, has been granted an option to purchase 70,000 shares of Identix
       common stock at a price per share equal to the fair market value of
       Identix common stock as of the closing date, which option grant is
       contingent upon the completion of the merger and vests over four years
       thereafter;

     - Robert F. Gallagher, Chief Financial Officer of Visionics, has entered
       into a change of control agreement with Visionics discussed below in the
       section titled "-- Employment and change of control arrangements" on page
       52; and

     - The combined entity's board of directors will initially consist of eight
       directors, four each designated by each of Identix and Visionics, which
       will include Mr. McCashin and Dr. Atick. Following the closing of the
       merger, the parties will appoint a ninth board member mutually agreed
       upon by the parties.

     Visionics' non-employee members of its board of directors receive annual
awards of restricted shares of Visionics common stock and stock option grants.
These awards and grants vest over time and are subject to forfeiture in the
event that service on the board of directors is terminated before vesting has
occurred. The Visionics stock plan under which the restricted shares of common
stock are awarded contains a change of control provision that will cause all
unvested awards to fully vest upon the consummation of the proposed merger. The
stock option agreements governing all unvested option grants currently held by
non-employee directors were amended in February 2002 to provide for immediate
and full vesting of such grants upon a change in control of Visionics (which
will occur in connection with the proposed merger). The following table
summarizes the restricted share awards and stock option grants that will vest
upon completion of the proposed merger:

(1) Mr. Choo resigned from Visionics' board on February 25, 2002. As a result of
    his resignation, Mr. Choo forfeited 2,242 restricted shares and options to
    purchase 15,000 shares which were unvested on that date.

     Identix' non-employee members of its board of directors receive annual
stock option grants. These stock options vest over time provided that the
director continues to serve on the board. The Identix stock option plan under
which the options are awarded contains a provision that will cause all unvested
options to immediately and fully vest upon completion of the proposed merger.

EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE IN CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS

     Mr. McCashin currently serves as the Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer of Identix. Mr. McCashin has entered into an amendment of his
Employment Agreement, which will be effective on completion of the merger (the
"Effective Date"), pursuant to which he will serve as Chairman of the Board
following the merger. The agreement provides for a payment of $400,000 to Mr.
McCashin upon the Effective Date and an additional payment of $900,000 payable
over two years. The agreement also provides for possible additional payments of
up to $350,000 per year, based upon objectives set by the Compensation
Committee, for a period of two years. Identix will pay the cost of continuing
coverage of standard medical insurance and a life insurance policy insuring Mr.
McCashin for $1,000,000 until the earlier of his reaching the age of 65 or his
accepting employment with another company.

     The agreement also provides that approximately 379,167 shares of Mr.
McCashin's option to purchase shares of common stock granted in October 2000
will cease to vest as of the Effective Date (assuming the merger is completed on
June 30, 2002) and that 220,833 shares of the October 2000 options will be
exercisable until 90 days after Mr. McCashin ceases to serve as Chairman
(assuming the merger is completed on June 30, 2002). In addition, options to
purchase a total of 150,000 shares of Identix common stock granted to Mr.
McCashin in October 2000 and 600,000 shares granted to Mr. McCashin in August
2001 will be fully vested as of the Effective Date and such options will be
exercisable until 12 months after Mr. McCashin ceases to serve as Chairman. Upon
a termination other than for "cause" (as defined in the agreement) or a
resignation for "good reason" (as described below) within the first two years
after the Effective Date, Mr. McCashin will be entitled to receive payments
equal to the sum of $2,000,000, less the $400,000 closing payment described
above and the total payments made to McCashin while he served as Chairman
following the merger. If Mr. McCashin voluntarily resigns during the first two
years after the Effective Date, Mr. McCashin will be entitled to receive a
payment of $400,000, but only to the extent that the total payments made to Mr.
McCashin while he served as Chairman do not exceed $2,000,000. If certain
payments or benefits received by, or to be received by, Mr. McCashin following a
"change in control" (as defined in the agreement) occurring after the merger are
subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue
Code, Identix will pay Mr. McCashin a "gross-up payment" intended to compensate
him fully for such tax. The agreement also contains certain restrictive
covenants which prohibit Mr. McCashin from competing with Identix, soliciting
its employees or customers during the term of the agreement and for a period of
two years thereafter. Resignation for "good reason" includes, among other
things, voluntary resignation following a material diminution in his
compensation or responsibilities.

     Joseph Atick, President and Chief Executive Officer of Visionics, has
agreed to serve as Chief Executive Officer of Identix following the merger. Dr.
Atick has entered into an employment agreement with Identix, which will be
effective upon the Effective Date. The agreement, which has a four-year term,
provides that Dr. Atick will receive an annual base salary of $300,000 (subject
to increase) plus an annual bonus of up to 50 percent of his base salary upon
achievement of objectives established by the Compensation Committee of the
Identix board of directors following consultation with Dr. Atick. In addition,
on the Effective Date, Dr. Atick will receive a 10-year option to purchase
450,000 shares of Identix common stock, vesting over four years at a rate of
twenty-five percent per year, at an exercise price equal to the fair market
value of Identix' common stock on that date, a $4,000 per month housing
allowance and a $1,000 per month automobile allowance. The agreement states that
Dr. Atick will be appointed to the board of directors of Identix, subject to
reelection by Identix' stockholders.

     Dr. Atick's employment agreement also provides that in the event his
employment is terminated other than for "cause" (as defined in the agreement) or
resignation for "good reason" (as described below), Dr. Atick will be entitled
to receive from Identix payments equal to the greater of: (a) two times the sum
of his then current base salary and most recent bonus or (b) the lesser of: (i)
$2,000,000 or (ii) five percent of Identix' liquid assets (defined as cash, cash
equivalents, marketable securities and accounts payable), plus his accrued but
unpaid base salary and bonus, a pro rata bonus based on Dr. Atick's most recent
actual bonus, continued funding of employee benefits, including retirement
plans, for a period of one year and immediate vesting of all unexercised stock
options and stock grants then held by Dr. Atick, with 12 months to exercise such
options from the date of termination. If certain payments or benefits received
by, or to be received by,

Dr. Atick following a "change in control" (as defined in the agreement)
occurring after the merger are subject to the excise tax imposed under section
4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, Identix will pay Dr. Atick a "gross up
payment" intended to compensate him fully for such tax. The agreement contains
certain restrictive covenants which prohibit Dr. Atick from competing with
Identix, soliciting its employees or customers during the term of the agreement
and for a period of two years thereafter. Resignation for "good reason"
includes, among other things, voluntary resignation following: (i) a material
diminution in his compensation or responsibilities or an involuntary relocation
from his current place of employment; (ii) removal from the Identix board of
directors or failure to be reelected to the board of directors; or (iii) a
change in control of Identix (subsequent to the merger with Visionics).

     James Scullion currently serves as President and Chief Operating Officer of
Identix. Mr. Scullion has entered into an Employment Agreement which will be
effective upon completion of the merger, pursuant to which he will continue to
serve as President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company. The agreement,
which has a three-year term, provides that Mr. Scullion will receive an annual
base salary of $280,000 (subject to increase) and an annual bonus of up to 50
percent of his base salary, based upon objectives set by the Compensation
Committee of the Identix board of directors. In addition, on the Effective Date,
Mr. Scullion will receive a 10-year option to purchase 260,000 shares of common
stock, vesting over four years at a rate of 25% per year, at an exercise price
equal to the fair market value of Identix common stock on that date, and a
$10,000 annual car allowance. Mr. Scullion's agreement provides that upon a
termination other than for "cause" (as defined in the agreement) or a
resignation for "good reason" (as described below) Mr. Scullion will be entitled
to receive from Identix payments equal to base salary and bonus for two years,
COBRA payments and life insurance payments for one year and immediate vesting of
all unexercised stock options then held by Mr. Scullion, with 12 months to
exercise such options from the date of termination. If certain payments or
benefits received by, or to be received by, Mr. Scullion following a "change in
control" (as defined in the agreement) occurring after the merger are subject to
the excise tax imposed under section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, Identix
will pay Mr. Scullion a "gross up payment" intended to compensate him fully for
such tax. Resignation for "good reason" means a voluntary resignation by Mr.
Scullion as a result of a material diminution in his compensation or
responsibilities or an involuntary relocation from his current place of
employment.

     Visionics entered into a change of control agreement with its Chief
Financial Officer, Robert F. Gallagher, dated February 7, 2002 (approved in
principle by the Visionics board in October 2001). The agreement, which has a
three-year term, subject to automatic one-year renewals and a two-year renewal
in the event of a "change in control" of Visionics, provides that if during the
term of the agreement Mr. Gallagher's employment is terminated by his employer
without "cause" (as defined in the agreement) or by Mr. Gallagher following a
"constructive termination" (as defined in the agreement) within two years after
the occurrence of a "change of control" of Visionics, Mr. Gallagher will be
entitled to receive a payment equal to one year's base salary plus continued
funding of all employee benefits for a period of one year. In addition, all
unexercised stock options held by Mr. Gallagher will fully vest on the date of
his termination and he will have a period of one year thereafter to exercise
such options.

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER

     The merger will be completed when all of the conditions to completion of
the merger are satisfied or waived, including adoption of the merger agreement
by the stockholders of Visionics and approval of the issuance of shares of
Identix common stock in the merger by the stockholders of Identix. The merger
will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

     Both Identix and Visionics anticipate that they will satisfy all conditions
to the merger at or prior to consummation of the merger.

STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER AND CONVERSION OF VISIONICS COMMON STOCK

     Viper Acquisition Corp., a newly formed and wholly owned subsidiary of
Identix referred to herein as "Merger Sub," will be merged with and into
Visionics. As a result of the merger, the separate corporate

existence of Merger Sub will cease and Visionics will survive the merger as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Identix.

     Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding share of Visionics common
stock, other than shares held by Visionics, Merger Sub, Identix or any
subsidiary of Identix, will be converted into the right to receive 1.3436 shares
of Identix common stock. The number of shares of Identix common stock issuable
in the merger will be proportionately adjusted for any stock split, stock
dividend or similar event with respect to Identix common stock or Visionics
common stock effected between the date of the merger agreement and the
completion of the merger.

     No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the merger. Instead
of a fractional share of Identix common stock, each Visionics stockholder will
receive from Identix an amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent)
equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the closing price
of a share of Identix common stock on the last trading day immediately preceding
the effective time, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market.

EXCHANGE OF VISIONICS STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR IDENTIX STOCK CERTIFICATES

     When the merger is completed, Identix' exchange agent will mail to
Visionics stockholders a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in
surrendering Visionics stock certificates in exchange for Identix stock
certificates. When a Visionics stockholder delivers Visionics stock certificates
to the exchange agent along with an executed letter of transmittal and any other
required documents, the Visionics stock certificates will be canceled and the
Visionics stockholder will receive Identix common stock certificates
representing the number of full shares of Identix common stock to which the
stockholder is entitled under the merger agreements. Visionics stockholders will
receive payment in cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Identix common
stock.

TREATMENT OF OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

     As of February 22, 2002, Visionics had outstanding options to purchase
approximately 2.8 million shares of Visionics common stock under the Visionics
stock option plans. Upon the merger, Identix will assume all options to purchase
Visionics common stock then outstanding under the Visionics stock option plans.
Of the outstanding options to purchase Visionics common stock under the
Visionics stock option plans as of February 22, 2002 options to purchase
approximately 1.4 million shares will be immediately exercisable at the
effective time of the merger.

     Each Visionics option that is outstanding and unexercised upon the merger
will be converted into an option to purchase 1.3436 Identix common shares for
each share of Visionics common stock covered by an option before the merger. The
exercise price per Identix common share subject to each option will equal its
pre-conversion price per share of Visionics common stock subject to such option
divided by 1.3436.

     As of February 22, 2002, Visionics had outstanding warrants to purchase
approximately 548,000 shares of Visionics common stock. Upon the merger, Identix
will assume all outstanding warrants to purchase Visionics common stock in
accordance with their terms and subject to adjustments based on the exchange
ratio.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

     The following general discussion summarizes the anticipated material United
States federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders of Visionics
common stock. This discussion addresses only such stockholders who hold their
Visionics common stock as a capital asset, and does not address all of the
United States federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to particular
stockholders in light of their individual circumstances or to stockholders who
are subject to special rules, such as:

     - financial institutions;

     - insurance companies;

     - foreign individuals and entities;

     - tax-exempt entities;

     - dealers in securities;

     - persons who are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the
       Code;

     - persons who hold Visionics shares as a hedge against currency risk, or as
       part of a constructive sale or conversion transaction;

     - holders whose shares are qualified small business stock for purposes of
       Sections 1202 and 1045 of the Internal Revenue Code;

     - persons who acquired Visionics common stock pursuant to the exercise of
       an employee stock option or otherwise as compensation; or

     - persons who hold Visionics common stock as part of an integrated
       investment (including a "straddle") composed of Visionics common stock
       and one or more other positions.

     Tax consequences under state, local and foreign laws are not addressed, nor
are the tax consequences of transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to, or
concurrently with, the merger (whether or not any such transactions are
undertaken in connection with the merger), including without limitation any
transaction in which shares of Visionics common stock are acquired or shares of
Identix common stock are disposed of.

     The following discussion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service. It
is based upon the Internal Revenue Code, and other laws, regulations, rulings
and decisions in effect as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, all
of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. The parties
are not requesting a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service as to the United
States federal income tax consequences of the merger and there can be no
assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will agree with the conclusions
expressed below.

     Completion of the merger is conditioned upon the delivery of an opinion to
Identix from Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe LLP, Identix' legal counsel, and to
Visionics from Maslon Edelman Borman & Brand LLP, Visionics' legal counsel, in
each case to the effect that: (i) the merger will be treated as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code; (ii) each of
Identix, Merger Sub and Visionics will be a party to such reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Internal Revenue Code; and (iii) except
with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Identix common
stock, no gain or loss will be recognized for United States federal income tax
purposes by a stockholder of Visionics as a result of the conversion of
Visionics common stock into Identix common stock in the merger.

     The opinions of tax counsel will assume the absence of any changes in
existing material facts and will rely on assumptions, representations and
covenants, including those contained in the merger agreement, and certificates
executed by officers of Identix and Visionics. These opinions do not bind the
Internal Revenue Service or the courts, nor do they preclude the Internal
Revenue Service or a court from adopting a contrary position. Accordingly, there
can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge the
conclusions set forth in the closing tax opinions or that a court will not
sustain such a challenge. A successful Internal Revenue Service challenge to the
"reorganization" status of the merger would result in Visionics stockholders
being treated as if they sold their Visionics shares in a fully taxable
transaction. In such event, each Visionics stockholder would recognize gain or
loss with respect to each share of Visionics common stock surrendered equal to
the difference between the stockholder's adjusted tax basis in such share and
the sum of the cash, if any, and fair market value, as of the time the merger
becomes effective, of the Identix common stock received in exchange therefor. In
such event, a Visionics stockholder's aggregate basis in the Identix common
stock so received would equal its fair market value as of the effective time of
the merger, and the stockholder's holding period for such Identix common stock
would begin the day after the merger. The discussion below assumes that the
merger qualifies as a reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code.

     ACCORDINGLY, HOLDERS OF VISIONICS COMMON STOCK ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR
TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER,
INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN
INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

     Effect of Qualification as a Reorganization; Exchange of Visionics Common
Stock for Identix Common Stock.  If the merger qualifies as a reorganization,
the following tax consequences will apply to holders of Visionics common stock
who exchange their Visionics common stock for Identix common stock in the
merger:

     Exchange of Visionics Common Stock for Identix Common Stock.  Except as
discussed below, no gain or loss will be recognized for federal income tax
purposes by Visionics stockholders who exchange their Visionics common stock for
Identix common stock pursuant to the merger. Each Visionics stockholder's
aggregate tax basis in the Identix common stock that he or she receives in the
merger will be the same as his or her aggregate tax basis in the Visionics
common stock surrendered in the merger (reduced by any tax basis allocable to
fractional shares exchanged for cash), and the holding period of the Identix
common stock received will include the holding period of the Visionics common
stock surrendered.

     Cash Received Instead of Fractional Shares.  The payment of cash to a
Visionics stockholder instead of a fractional share in Identix common stock
generally will result in the recognition of capital gain or loss measured by the
difference between the amount of cash received and the portion of the tax basis
of the Visionics common stock allocable to that fractional share interest. In
the case of an individual, capital gains are generally subject to United States
federal income tax at the reduced rates applicable to long-term capital gains if
such individual has held his or her Visionics common stock for more than one
year at the time of the merger, and at ordinary income rates (as a short-term
capital gain) if the individual has held his or her Visionics common stock for
one year or less at the time of the merger.

     Reporting Requirements.  Each Visionics stockholder that receives Identix
common stock in the merger will be required to file a statement with his or her
federal income tax return setting forth his or her basis in the Visionics common
stock surrendered and the fair market value of the Identix common stock and cash
received in the merger, and to retain permanent records of these facts relating
to the merger.

     Backup Withholding.  Unless an exemption applies, the exchange agent will
withhold 30% of any cash payment in lieu of fractional shares made to a
Visionics stockholder who does not furnish a correct taxpayer identification
number and certifies that he or she is not subject to backup withholding on the
substitute Form W-9 or successor form included in the letter of transmittal that
will be mailed to Visionics stockholders by the exchange agent shortly after
completion of the merger, does not provide a certification of foreign status on
Form W-8BEN or successor form, or is not otherwise exempt from backup
withholding.

     The preceding discussion is not meant to be a complete analysis or
discussion of all potential tax effects relevant to the merger. Thus, Visionics
stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the specific tax
consequences to them of the merger, including tax return reporting requirements,
federal, state, local and other applicable tax laws and the effect of any
proposed changes in the tax laws.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER

     The merger will be accounted for as a "purchase" transaction for accounting
and financial reporting purposes, in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. After the merger, the results of
operations of Visionics will be included in the consolidated financial
statements of Identix. The purchase price will be allocated based on the fair
values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Pursuant to
Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations"
and No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," goodwill will no longer be
subject to amortization over its estimated useful life. Rather, goodwill will be
subject to at least annual assessment for impairment based on a fair value test.
Identified intangible assets with finite lives will be amortized over those
lives. A final determination of the intangible asset values and required
purchase accounting adjustments, including the allocation of the purchase price
to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair
values, has not yet been made. Identix will determine the fair value of assets
and liabilities and will make appropriate business combination accounting
adjustments. However, for purposes of disclosing unaudited pro forma information
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Identix has made a preliminary
determination of the purchase price allocation, based upon current estimates and
assumptions, which is subject to revision upon consummation of the merger.

     Completion of the merger will result in total pre-tax costs of
approximately $16 to $20 million, primarily relating to costs associated with
combining the businesses of the two companies, including integration and
restructuring costs, and the fees of financial advisors, attorneys and
accountants. Although we do not believe the merger costs will significantly
exceed our estimate, our estimate may not be correct and unanticipated events
could occur that would substantially increase the costs of combining the two
companies. The extent of these additional costs is not yet determined. In any
event, any costs associated with the merger would negatively affect Identix'
results of operations in the quarter in which the merger is completed. In
addition, certain costs consisting primarily of fees and expenses paid to
financial advisors, attorneys and accountants, will be a component of the
purchase price and capitalized as an element of goodwill. Goodwill is required
to be tested for impairment at least annually and Identix will be required to
record a charge to earnings in the period any impairment of goodwill is
determined.

REGULATORY FILINGS AND APPROVALS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER

     The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act, which prevents certain transactions from being
completed until required information and materials are furnished to the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission
and the applicable waiting periods end or expire. Identix and Visionics have
filed the required information and materials with the Department of Justice and
the Federal Trade Commission. The waiting period will terminate thirty days
after such filing. The requirements of Hart-Scott-Rodino will be satisfied if
the merger is completed within one year from the termination of the waiting
period. The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade
Commission may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds either before or after
expiration of the waiting period. Other persons could also take action under the
antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the merger, regardless of whether
the waiting period has ended.

     Neither Identix nor Visionics is aware of any other material governmental
or regulatory approval required for completion of the merger, other than the
effectiveness of the registration statement of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is a part, and compliance with applicable corporate law of
the State of Delaware.

RESTRICTIONS ON SALES OF SHARES BY AFFILIATES OF IDENTIX OR VISIONICS

     The issuance of Identix common stock in the merger will be registered under
the Securities Act. These shares will be freely transferable under the
Securities Act, except for shares of Identix common stock issued to any person
who is an affiliate of Visionics (or becomes an affiliate of Identix following
the merger). Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of Visionics include
individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
control with Visionics and may include some of the officers and directors of
Visionics, as well as the principal stockholders of Visionics. For a period of
one year following the merger, affiliates of Visionics may not sell their shares
of Identix common stock acquired in the merger except pursuant to (1) an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of
those shares, (2) in compliance with Rule 145 under the Securities Act or (3)
any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act. After the one-year
anniversary of the merger, Identix shares held by affiliates of Visionics (who
are not affiliates of Identix) will be freely tradable. Shares held by
affiliates of Identix will be subject to Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

LISTING OF IDENTIX COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN THE MERGER

     It is a condition to the closing of the merger that the shares of Identix
common stock to be issued in the merger be approved for listing on the Nasdaq
National Market, subject to official notice of issuance.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF VISIONICS COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER

     If the merger is completed, Visionics common stock will be delisted from
the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary of the complete merger agreement attached as
Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Stockholders are urged to read
the full text of the merger agreement.

EFFECTIVE TIME; EFFECT OF MERGER

     The merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as is
agreed to in writing by Identix, Visionics and Viper Acquisition Corp. (the
"Merger Sub") and specified in the certificate of merger. That time is the
"effective time" of the merger. The closing of the merger will occur at the
offices of Identix' outside legal counsel on a date to be specified by the
parties, which will be no later than the second business day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the merger unless the parties agree
otherwise. That date is the "closing date" of the merger. The certificate of
merger will be filed on the closing date. The closing and the effective time are
anticipated to occur in the calendar quarter ending June 30, 2002.

     At the effective time Merger Sub will be merged with and into Visionics,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and Visionics will be
the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Identix. Visionics,
as the surviving corporation after the merger, is sometimes referred to in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus as the "surviving corporation."

CONVERSION OF SHARES

     At the effective time, each outstanding share of Visionics common stock
will be canceled and converted into the right to receive 1.3436 shares of
Identix common stock.

     The exchange ratio of 1.3436 will be adjusted for any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend, extraordinary dividend or distribution,
reorganization, recapitalization or other similar change with respect to Identix
common stock or Visionics common stock occurring or having a record or effective
date after the date of the merger agreement.

     Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the effective time will be converted into and exchanged for one share of
Visionics common stock as the surviving corporation.

     No fractional shares of Identix common stock will be issued in the merger.
Rather than fractional shares of Identix common stock, each Visionics
stockholder will receive from Identix cash (rounded down to the nearest whole
cent) in an amount equal to the product of (a) such fraction, multiplied by (b)
the closing price of a share of Identix common stock on the last trading day
immediately preceding the effective time.

     Promptly after the effective time, Identix, acting through an exchange
agent, will deliver to each Visionics stockholder of record as of the effective
time a letter of transmittal with instructions to be used by that stockholder in
surrendering certificates which represented shares of Visionics common stock
prior to the effective time. CERTIFICATES SHOULD NOT BE SURRENDERED BY VISIONICS
STOCKHOLDERS UNTIL THEY RECEIVE THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL FROM THE EXCHANGE
AGENT.

TREATMENT OF OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

     At the effective time, Identix will assume all options to purchase
Visionics common stock then outstanding under the Visionics stock option plans
so that they will be exercisable after the effective time on the same terms and
conditions as under the Visionics stock option plan under which they were
granted and the related option agreements. All shares of Visionics common stock
issued under the Visionics restricted stock plan will automatically be converted
into shares of Identix common stock. Subject to provisions of the Visionics
restricted stock plan for accelerated lapsing of restrictions upon a merger for
certain issuances of restricted stock, these shares will continue to be subject
to currently applicable restrictions and rights of repurchase under the plan.

     Each option to purchase Visionics common stock granted under Visionics'
stock plans that is outstanding and unexercised as of the effective time, will
be converted into an option to purchase 1.3436 Identix common

shares for each share of Visionics common stock covered by the option before the
merger. The exercise price per Identix common share subject to each option will
be adjusted to equal its pre-conversion price per share of Visionics common
stock subject to such option divided by 1.3436.

     As of February 22, 2002, there were outstanding warrants to purchase
approximately 548,000 shares of Visionics common stock. Upon the merger, Identix
will assume all outstanding warrants to purchase Visionics common stock in
accordance with their terms, subject to adjustments to reflect the exchange
ratio. To the extent the warrants are not exercised in full prior to the
completion of the merger, Identix intends to file a post effective amendment to
the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms
a part to register shares of Identix common stock issuable upon exercise of the
assumed Visionics warrants.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     Visionics, Identix and Merger Sub have made representations in the merger
agreement relating to, among other things:

       agreement;

CONDUCT OF BUSINESS FOLLOWING THE MERGER

     Pursuant to the merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist as a corporation and
will be merged with and into Visionics, with Visionics as the surviving
corporation. All property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
Visionics and Merger Sub will vest in the surviving corporation. All debts,
liabilities and duties of Visionics and Merger Sub will become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the surviving corporation, and the surviving
corporation will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Identix.

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, the certificate of incorporation of
Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the effective time will be certificate
of incorporation of the surviving corporation and the bylaws of Merger Sub will
be the bylaws of the surviving corporation. At the effective time, the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub will be amended so that the name of
the surviving corporation is Visionics Corporation. The directors and officers
of Merger Sub at the effective time will become the initial directors and
officers of the surviving corporation.

     Following the merger, the Identix board of directors will consist of the
following eight persons, four of whom were directors of Identix immediately
prior to the merger, and four of whom were directors of Visionics prior to the
merger:

     [                    ]

     In addition, after the merger is completed:

     - Robert McCashin, Identix' Chief Executive Officer, will become the
       Chairman of the Board of Identix;

     - Joseph Atick, Visionics' Chief Executive Officer, will become the Chief
       Executive Officer of Identix;

     - James Scullion, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Identix,
       will continue to serve in those positions; and

     - the parties will appoint a ninth board member mutually agreed upon by
       Identix and Visionics.

NO SOLICITATION

     Until the earlier of the termination of the merger agreement or the
effective time, each of Visionics and Identix has agreed that it will not, and
its subsidiaries will not:

     - solicit, initiate, encourage or induce any Acquisition Proposal (as
       defined below);

     - participate in negotiations or discussions with, or furnish to any person
       any non-public information with respect to, or take any other actions to
       facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes
       or is reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition Proposal;

     - engage in discussions with any person with respect to any Acquisition
       Proposal;

     - approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or

     - enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract,
       agreement or commitment relating to any Acquisition Transaction.

     An "Acquisition Proposal" is any offer or proposal relating to any
Acquisition Transaction. An "Acquisition Transaction" is any transaction or
series of related transactions involving:

     - any purchase from the entity or acquisition by any person or group of
       more than a 15% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of
       the entity;

     - any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in
       any person or group beneficially owning 15% or more of the total
       outstanding voting securities of the entity;

     - any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
       involving the entity;

     - any sale, lease outside the ordinary course of business, exchange,
       transfer, license outside the ordinary course of business, acquisition or
       disposition of more than 15% of the assets of the entity; or

     - any liquidation or dissolution of the entity.

     However, each of Visionics and Identix and their respective boards of
directors may take the following actions:

     - participate in discussions with or furnish non-public information or data
       to any third party that has made an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal if
       the board is advised by its financial advisor that the third party has
       the financial wherewithal to consummate such a proposal and the board
       determines in good faith (a) after consultation with its financial
       advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal is, or is likely to result in, a
       Superior Offer (as defined below); and (b) following consultation with
       outside legal counsel, that the failure to participate in those
       negotiations would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the board
       under applicable law; and

     - withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor of the
       merger if a Superior Offer is made and not withdrawn.

     A "Superior Offer" is an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by a
third party to complete any of the following transactions:

     - a merger or consolidation involving the affected company pursuant to
       which the stockholders of the affected company immediately preceding the
       transaction would hold less than a 50% equity interest in the surviving
       or resulting entity of the transaction; or

     - the acquisition by any person or group, including by way of a tender
       offer or an exchange offer or a two step transaction involving a tender
       offer followed with reasonable promptness by a merger involving the
       affected entity, directly or indirectly, of ownership of 51% of the
       outstanding shares of capital stock of the affected entity;

in either case, on terms that the board of directors of the affected entity
determines, in its reasonable judgment, after consultation with its financial
advisor, to be more favorable to its stockholders than the terms of the merger.
An offer will not be a "Superior Offer" if any financing required to complete
the transaction is not committed and is not likely in the reasonable judgment of
the board of directors of the affected entity, after consultation with its
financial advisor, to be obtained on a timely basis.

     In addition, each party has agreed to inform the other party in writing
promptly of any Acquisition Proposal, and in any event within 24 hours of any
meeting to consider such proposal of the affected party's board, and must
furnish to the other party the identity of the recipient of the information to
be provided and/or the potential acquiror and the terms of such Acquisition
Proposal.

     Visionics' board of directors is required to recommend the adoption of the
merger agreement and Identix' board of directors is required to recommend the
issuance of Identix common stock in the merger. Neither party may:

     - withdraw, amend or modify, or propose to withdraw, amend or modify, in
       any manner adverse to the other party, its approval and recommendation of
       the merger agreement and the merger or the issuance of common stock; or

     - approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
       Proposal;

unless, in each case, the board of the affected party has determined that a
Superior Offer is made to that party and is not withdrawn; and

     - the affected party has provided written notice advising the other party
       that the affected party has received a Superior Offer, specifying the
       material terms and conditions of such Superior Offer and identifying the
       person or entity making such Superior Offer;

     - the other party does not, within three business days after receiving the
       Notice, make an offer that the board of the affected party by a majority
       vote determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its
       financial advisor, to be at least as favorable to its stockholders as
       such Superior Offer;

     - the board of the affected party concludes in good faith, after
       consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such Superior
       Offer, the failure to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify such
       recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of
       the board of directors to its stockholders under applicable law; and

     - the affected party has not violated specified provisions of the merger
       agreement.

FEES, EXPENSES AND TERMINATION FEE

     In general, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be paid
by the party that incurs them. Identix and Visionics will share equally the
filing fees paid in connection with the filing of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and the registration statement of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is a part, and the costs of printing and mailing this joint
proxy statement/prospectus and will share equally all fees incurred in
connection with the filings made with Nasdaq or under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act.

     Subject to the exceptions specified in the merger agreement, Visionics has
agreed to pay Identix a termination fee of $12.3 million plus Identix'
merger-related expenses if:

          (a) the merger has not been consummated by September 30, 2002, for any
     reason other than Identix' action or failure to act which has been a
     principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur before
     September 30, 2002, and which constitutes a material breach of the merger
     agreement; or

          (b) the required approval of Visionics' stockholders has not been
     obtained by reason of the failure to hold the meeting or the failure to
     obtain the required vote at a duly convened meeting of Visionics'
     stockholders; and

          (c) in either case, prior to the termination of the merger agreement,
     a third party publicly announces an Acquisition Proposal and within twelve
     months following the termination of the merger agreement, Visionics enters
     into an agreement providing for Visionics Acquisition. A "Visionics
     Acquisition" is any of the following transactions:

        - a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
          liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Visionics
          pursuant to which the stockholders of Visionics immediately preceding
          such transaction hold less than 50% of the aggregate equity interests
          in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction;

        - a sale or other disposition by Visionics of assets representing in
          excess of 50% of the aggregate fair market value of Visionics'
          business immediately prior to such sale; or

        - an acquisition by any person or group (including by way of a tender
          offer or an exchange offer or issuance by Visionics), directly or
          indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial
          ownership of shares representing in excess of 50% of the voting power
          of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of Visionics.

     Visionics will also pay a termination fee of $12.3 million plus Identix'
merger-related expenses if a "Visionics Triggering Event" occurs. A Visionics
Triggering Event will occur if:

     - Visionics' board of directors withdraws, amends or modifies in a manner
       adverse to Identix its recommendation in favor of the adoption of the
       merger agreement;

     - Visionics fails to include in this joint proxy statement/prospectus the
       recommendation of its board of directors in favor of the adoption of the
       merger agreement;

     - Visionics' board of directors fails to reaffirm its recommendation in
       favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and its approval of the
       merger within ten days after Identix requests in writing that its
       recommendation and approval be reaffirmed;

     - Visionics' board of directors approves or recommends any Acquisition
       Proposal; or

     - a tender or exchange offer relating to securities of Visionics is
       commenced by a person or entity unaffiliated with Identix and Visionics
       does not send to its security holders pursuant to Rule 14e-2 of the
       Securities Act, within ten business days after the tender or exchange
       offer is first published, sent or given, a statement disclosing that
       Visionics recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer.

     Subject to the exceptions specified in the merger agreement, Identix has
agreed to pay Visionics a termination fee of $12.3 million plus Visionics'
merger-related expenses if:

          (a) the merger has not been consummated by September 30, 2002, for any
     reason other than Visionics' action or failure to act which has been a
     principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur before
     September 30, 2002, and which constitutes a material breach of the merger
     agreement; or

          (b) if the required approval of Identix' stockholders has not been
     obtained by reason of the failure to hold the meeting or the failure to
     obtain the required vote at a duly convened meeting of Identix'
     stockholders; and

          (c) in either case, prior to the termination of the merger agreement,
     a third party publicly announces an Acquisition Proposal and within twelve
     months following the termination of the merger agreement, Identix enters
     into an agreement providing for an Identix Acquisition. An "Identix
     Acquisition" is any of the following transactions:

        - a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
          liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Identix
          pursuant to which the stockholders of Identix immediately preceding
          such transaction hold less than 50% of the aggregate equity interests
          in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction;

        - a sale or other disposition by Identix of assets representing in
          excess of 50% of the aggregate fair market value of Identix' business
          immediately prior to such sale; or

        - an acquisition by any person or group (including by way of a tender
          offer or an exchange offer or issuance by Identix), directly or
          indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial
          ownership of shares representing in excess of 50% of the voting power
          of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of Identix.

     Identix will also pay a termination fee of $12.3 million plus Visionics'
merger-related expenses if an "Identix Triggering Event" occurs. An Identix
Triggering Event will occur if:

     - Identix' board of directors withdraws, amends or modifies in a manner
       adverse to Identix its recommendation in favor of the issuance of Identix
       common stock in the merger;

     - Identix fails to include in this joint proxy statement/prospectus the
       recommendation of its board of directors in favor of the issuance of
       Identix common stock in the merger;

     - Identix' board of directors fails to reaffirm its recommendation in favor
       of the issuance of Identix common stock in the merger within ten days
       after Identix requests in writing that its recommendation be reaffirmed;

     - Identix' board of directors approves or recommends any Acquisition
       Proposal; or

     - a tender or exchange offer relating to securities of Identix is commenced
       by a person or entity unaffiliated with Identix and Visionics does not
       send to its security holders pursuant to Rule 14e-2 of the Securities
       Act, within ten business days after the tender or exchange offer is first
       published, sent or given, a statement disclosing that Identix recommends
       rejection of such tender or exchange offer.

     In addition, under circumstances specified in the merger agreement, either
Identix or Visionics is required to pay the other party's merger-related
expenses if the merger agreement is terminated even if the $12.3 termination fee
is not payable.

      - where the failure of those representations and warranties to be so true
        and correct does not have a material adverse effect on Identix; and

     - Identix and Merger Sub must have performed and complied in all material
       respects with all agreements and obligations required by the merger
       agreement to be performed or complied with by them on or prior to the
       closing date.

     The obligations of Identix and Merger Sub to consummate the merger are
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the following additional
conditions:

     - the representations and warranties of Visionics contained in the merger
       agreement must be true and correct in all material respects as of the
       closing date with the same force and effect as if made at the closing
       date, except:

      - for changes specifically permitted by the terms of the merger agreement;
        and

      - where the failure of those representations and warranties to be so true
        and correct does not have a material adverse effect on Visionics; and

     - Visionics must have performed or complied in all material respects with
       all agreements and obligations required by the merger agreement to be
       performed or complied with by it on or prior to the closing date.

     Currently, both Identix and Visionics anticipate that they will satisfy all
conditions to the merger at or prior to consummation of the merger.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective
time, whether before or after approval of the merger by Visionics stockholders
and approval of the issuance of Identix common stock in the merger by Identix
stockholders:

     - by mutual written consent;

     - by either Identix or Visionics if the merger is not consummated on or
       before September 30, 2002, except that the right to terminate will not be
       available to any party that breached its obligations under the merger
       agreement in any material respect and consequently contributed to the
       failure to consummate the merger by that date;

     - by either Identix or Visionics if a statute, rule regulation or executive
       order would prohibit the consummation of the merger or a governmental
       authority issues a final and nonappealable order permanently enjoining
       the merger;

     - by either Visionics or Identix if Visionics' stockholders do not adopt
       the merger agreement or Identix' stockholders do not approve the issuance
       of Identix common stock in the merger at either special meeting, except
       that the right to terminate will not be available to any party that
       breached its obligations under the merger agreement in any material
       respect in a manner that proximately contributed to the failure to obtain
       that stockholder approval;

     - by Visionics if an Identix Triggering Event occurs;

     - by Identix if a Visionics Triggering Event occurs; or

     - by Identix or Visionics if the other party materially breaches any of its
       representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the merger
       agreement and that breach is not cured within 20 business days after
       notice of the breach has been received by the party allegedly in breach,
       provided that neither party may terminate the agreement based on the
       other party's material breach of the agreement if that party is also in
       material breach of the merger agreement on the date of termination.

VOTING AGREEMENTS

     Each of the directors and certain officers of Visionics, who together held
approximately [13.1]% of the Visionics common stock outstanding as of the record
date, have entered into voting agreements with Identix and granted it
irrevocable proxies. A copy of the form of Identix voting agreement is attached
as Exhibit A to Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and
incorporated herein by this reference. These stockholders, in their capacities
as stockholders, have agreed to vote all their shares of Visionics common stock
in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement.

     Each of the directors and certain officers of Identix, who together held
approximately [0.2%] of the Identix common stock outstanding as of the record
date, have entered into voting agreements with Visionics and granted it
irrevocable proxies. A copy of the form of Visionics voting agreement is
attached as Exhibit B to Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and

as stockholders, have agreed to vote all their shares of Identix common stock in
favor of the issuance of shares of Identix common stock in the merger.

VISIONICS AFFILIATE AGREEMENTS

     The following is a brief summary of material terms of the Visionics
affiliate agreements executed by affiliates of Visionics. A copy of the form of
Visionics affiliate agreement is attached as Exhibit D to Annex A to this joint
proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated herein by this reference. You are
urged to read the Visionics affiliate agreement in its entirety for a more
complete description of the rights and obligations of the parties under the
agreement.

     Shares of Identix common stock received by persons who are deemed to be
"affiliates" (as that term is defined in the Securities Act) of Visionics at the
time of the special meeting, or affiliates of Identix after the merger, may be
resold by them only in transactions permitted by the resale provisions of Rule
145 promulgated under the Securities Act or as otherwise permitted under the
Securities Act. The resale limitations imposed by Rule 145 survive for a period
of one year after the merger. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of
Visionics or Identix generally include individuals or entities that control, are
controlled by, or are under common control with, that party and may include
certain officers and directors of that party as well as principal stockholders
of that party.

     The merger agreement requires Visionics to deliver a written affiliates
agreement executed by each Visionics affiliate to the effect that such person or
entity will not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any of the shares of
Identix common stock issued to that person in or pursuant to the merger unless:

     - the sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the
       Securities Act;

     - the sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with Rule
       145 under the Securities Act;

     - the limitations imposed by Rule 145 no longer apply; or

     - in the opinion of counsel the sale, transfer or other disposition is
       exempt from registration under the Securities Act.

 COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF IDENTIX CAPITAL STOCK AND VISIONICS CAPITAL
                                     STOCK

     This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes differences
between Identix common stock and Visionics common stock. While we believe that
the description covers the material differences between the two, this summary
may not contain all of the information that is important to you, including the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws of each company. You should read this
entire document and the other documents we refer to carefully for a more
complete understanding of the differences between Identix common stock and
Visionics common stock. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference
into this joint proxy statement/prospectus without charge by following the
instructions in the section titled "Where You Can Find More Information" on page
88.

     After the merger, the holders of Visionics common stock will become
stockholders of Identix. Because Identix and Visionics are both Delaware
corporations, the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, will continue
to govern the rights of all stockholders. The Visionics certificate of
incorporation and bylaws currently govern the rights of the stockholders of
Visionics. As stockholders of Identix after the merger, the Identix certificate
of incorporation and bylaws will instead govern their rights following the
merger. The following paragraphs compare certain provisions of the certificates
of incorporation and bylaws of Identix and Visionics.

VOTING

     Each stockholder of Visionics and Identix has the right to one vote for
each share of common stock held by the stockholder. Each holder of Identix
Series A preferred stock is entitled to one vote per share, on an as converted
to common stock basis. The Series A preferred stock is convertible into shares
of common stock on a one-to-one basis, subject to adjustment for anti-dilution.
As of February 22, 2002, the 234,558 shares of Series A preferred stock
outstanding were convertible into 235,553 shares of Identix common stock.

SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

     The Identix bylaws provide that only the chairman of the board, the
president or the board of directors may call special meetings of the
stockholders.

not less than one-fifth of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to
vote.

ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT IN LIEU OF A STOCKHOLDERS MEETING

     Visionics stockholders have the ability to take action by written consent
so long as the action is signed by the holders having the minimum number of
shares to approve the action if the action were taken at a meeting at which all
outstanding shares of common stock were present and voting.

     The Identix stockholders do not have the ability to take action by written
consent.

VOTING BY WRITTEN BALLOT

     Both the Identix and Visionics certificates of incorporation provide that
written ballots for the election of directors are not required.

a record date in the manner described above, then the record date shall be at
the close of business on the business day next

preceding the day on which the notice is given, or if notice is waived, the
close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the
meeting is held.

     The Visionics bylaws provide that the board of directors may fix a record
date that is not more than 60 nor less than 10 days, or in the case of a merger
or consolidation, not less than 20 days, before the date of the stockholder
meeting, nor more than 60 days prior to any other action.

be received at the principal offices of Identix no later than 90 days prior to
the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders. In
addition, certain information regarding the business proposed for discussion
must be included in the stockholder notice to Identix.

     The Visionics bylaws contain no similar provisions.

NOTICE OF BOARD NOMINATION AND OTHER STOCKHOLDER BUSINESS -- SPECIAL MEETINGS

     The Identix certificate of incorporation provides that business transacted
at special meetings shall be confined to the purpose or purposes stated in the
notice of meeting.

     The Visionics certificate and bylaws contain no similar provision.

less than five nor more than eight members, with changes in the number of
directors permitted by a resolution of the board of directors. The board of
directors of the merged entity will pass a resolution following the closing of
the merger increasing the minimum number of directors to nine. Immediately prior
to the effective time, the Identix bylaws will be amended to provide for nine
members. The Visionics bylaws provide that the board of directors shall consist

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The Identix bylaws provide that the chairman of the board, the president,
the secretary, any vice president or any two directors may call a special
meeting of the board of directors. The bylaws require that written notice of the
time and place of these meetings be given at least four days before the meeting
if the notice is mailed, or at least 48 hours before the meeting if notice is
delivered personally or by telephone or telegraph.

     The Visionics bylaws provide that the chairman of the board, the president
or the secretary on the written request of any director may call a special
meeting of the board of directors. The bylaws require that notice of the meeting
be given at least two days before the meeting.

BOARD ACTION -- GENERALLY

     Both the Identix and Visionics bylaws provide that, except as required by
the DGCL, their respective boards of directors take action on the vote of a
majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present or a
written consent to action executed by all members of the board of directors.

ACTION BY COMMITTEES

     Both the Identix bylaws and the Visionics bylaws authorize their respective
boards of directors to establish committees by resolution of a majority of the
whole board.

PREFERRED STOCK

     Both the Identix and Visionics certificates of incorporation authorize the
respective board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more
series and to fix the designations, preferences, powers and rights of the shares
to be included in each series. The Identix certificate of incorporation reserves
for issuance 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and the Visionics certificate
of incorporation reserves for issuance 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
Identix has authorized and issued 234,558 shares of Series A preferred stock.
These shares are convertible into shares of common stock on a one-to-one basis,
subject to adjustment for anti-dilution. As of February 22, 2002, the 234,558
shares of Series A preferred stock outstanding were convertible into 235,553
shares of Identix common stock. In the event of a liquidation, each holders of
Series A preferred stock will receive per share, in preference to the holders of
common stock, an amount equal to all unpaid dividends plus the greater of the
then current market price of the common stock or the original issue price of
$15.9875 per share. Visionics has not issued preferred stock.

INDEMNIFICATION

     The Identix certificate of incorporation provides that its directors and
officers shall be indemnified to the full extent authorized by Delaware law
against all expenses, liabilities and losses reasonably incurred by that person
in connection with any action, proceeding or suit brought against that person by
reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of Identix or
is or was serving at the request of Identix as a director or officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or similar
entity.

     The Visionics bylaws provide that any person shall be indemnified against
expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by that person in connection with any action, proceeding or
suit brought or threatened against that person by reason of the fact that he or
she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of Visionics, is or was
serving at the request of Visionics as a director or officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or similar entity, or
is or was serving as a fiduciary of, or otherwise rendering services to, any
employee benefit plan of or relating to Visionics. This indemnification is
authorized to the extent that the indemnitee has been successful in his or her
defense and only after a majority of the disinterested members of the board of
directors, independent legal counsel appointed by the disinterested members or
the stockholders have determined that the indemnitee has met certain applicable
standards of conduct.

     The Identix certificate of incorporation and the Visionics bylaws authorize
Identix and Visionics to pay all expenses incurred by their respective
indemnitees in defending any proceeding within the scope of the indemnification
provisions as these expenses are incurred in advance of its final disposition.

LIMITATION ON LIABILITY

     Both the Identix certificate of incorporation and Visionics certificate of
incorporation provide that a director of the respective corporation shall not be
personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages
for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (a) for any
breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation and its
stockholders; (b) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or knowing violations of law; (c) under section 174 of
the DGCL; or (d) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper
personal benefit.

DIVIDENDS

     The Identix certificate of incorporation provides that the holders of
common stock and preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if
declared by the board of directors, out of the assets of the corporation which
are by law available therefor, dividends payable either in cash, in property or
in shares of capital stock.

     The Visionics certificate of incorporation provides that stockholders are
entitled to receive dividends or other distributions as may be declared by the
board of directors from time to time.

LIQUIDATION

     The Identix certificate of incorporation provides that, in the event of any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Identix, the holders of Series A
preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any
distribution to the holders of common stock, an amount equal to all accrued or
declared but unpaid dividends plus an amount equal to the greater of (x) the
then current market price of each share of common stock or (y) the original
issue price of preferred stock of $15.9875 per share. After distribution in full
of the preferential amounts, holders of common stock shall be entitled to
receive, pro rata, all of the remaining assets of Identix available for
distribution to its stockholders.

     The Visionics certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain no such
provisions.

SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS

     The Identix bylaws provide that, unless otherwise approved by the holders
of a majority of Identix' shares present and entitled to vote at a duly convened
meeting of Identix' stockholders, Identix shall not (i) sell or issue any
security of Identix convertible, exercisable or exchangeable into shares of
Identix' common stock having a conversion, exercise or exchange price per share
which is subject to downward adjustment based on the market price of the common
stock at the time of conversion, exercise or exchange of such security into
common stock; or (ii) enter into any (A) equity line of credit or similar
agreement or arrangement or (B) any agreement to sell Identix common stock or
any "common stock equivalent" (as defined in the bylaws) for cash at a per share
price, or conversion, exercise or exchange price, that is fixed after the
execution of date of the agreement, whether or not based on any predetermined
price-setting formula or calculation method, subject to limited exceptions
described in the bylaws.

     The Identix bylaws also provide that, unless otherwise approved by the
holders of a majority of Identix' shares present and entitled to vote at a duly
convened meeting of Identix' stockholders, Identix shall not (i) grant any stock
options with an exercise price that is less than 100% of the fair market value
of the underlying stock on the date of grant, or (ii) reduce the exercise price
of any stock option granted under any existing or future stock option plan.

AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS

     The Identix bylaws provide that the board of directors or the stockholders
holding a majority of Identix' outstanding voting stock may adopt, amend or
repeal the bylaws, except that the bylaw provisions described under the heading
"Specific restrictions" above may not be amended or repealed without the
approval of the stockholders holding a majority of Identix' outstanding voting
stock.

     The Visionics certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorize the board
of directors to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the bylaws without
the assent or vote of the stockholders, subject to the power of the stockholders
to change or repeal the bylaws.

                  PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

OVERVIEW

     The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
have been prepared to give effect to the proposed merger of Identix and
Visionics using the purchase method of accounting and the assumptions and
adjustments described in the accompanying notes to unaudited pro forma combined
condensed financial statements. These pro forma statements were prepared as if
the merger had been completed as of July 1, 2000 for statements of operations
purposes and as of December 31, 2001 for balance sheet purposes.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements are
presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of
the financial position or results of operations that would have actually been
reported had the merger occurred July 1, 2000 for statements of operation
purposes and as of December 31, 2001 for balance sheet purposes, nor is it
necessarily indicative of the future financial position or results of
operations. The pro forma combined condensed financial statements include
adjustments, which are based upon preliminary estimates, to reflect the
allocation of purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of
Visionics, before any integration or restructuring adjustments. The final
allocation of the purchase price will be determined after the completion of the
merger and will be based upon actual net tangible and intangible assets acquired
as well as liabilities assumed. Because the unaudited pro forma combined
condensed financial statements are based upon preliminary estimates, the pro
forma adjustments may differ materially based upon the final allocation.

     These unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements are based
upon the respective historical consolidated financial statements of Identix and
Visionics and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated
financial statements of Identix and Visionics and related notes and
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" contained in the reports and other information Identix and Visionics
have on file with the SEC.

1.  BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION

     On February 22, 2002, Identix and Visionics entered into a merger agreement
whereby each outstanding share of Visionics common stock will be converted into
1.3436 newly issued shares of Identix common stock. Each outstanding option and
warrant to purchase shares of Visionics common stock will be assumed also using
the 1.3436 exchange ratio. Identix expects to issue approximately 39.1 million
shares of Identix common stock, and options and warrants to purchase
approximately 4.5 million shares of common stock. The actual number of shares of
Identix common stock, options and warrants to be issued will be determined on
the effective date of the merger using the 1.3436 exchange ratio based on the
number of shares of Visionics common stock, options and warrants actually
outstanding on such date. Identix will account for the merger as a purchase.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet at December 31,
2001 combines the Identix and Visionics consolidated balance sheets at December
31, 2001 as if the merger had been consummated on that date.

     The combining companies have different year-ends for reporting purposes.
Identix' fiscal year end is June 30, whereas Visionics' fiscal year end is
September 30. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of
operations for the year ended June 30, 2001 and for the six month period ended
December 31, 2001 give effect to the proposed merger as if it had occurred on
July 1, 2000. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2001 combine the results of operations of Identix
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 and Visionics for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2001. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for
the six month period ended December 31, 2001 combine the results of operations
of Identix and Visionics for the six month period ended December 31, 2001.
Accordingly, for Visionics, the three months ended September 30, 2001 are
included in both the pro forma results of operations for the year ended
September 30, 2001 and the six months ended December 31, 2001.

2.  PRELIMINARY PURCHASE PRICE

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements reflect an
estimated purchase price of approximately $330.3 million. The preliminary fair
value of Identix' common stock to be issued was determined using the five
trading day average price surrounding the date the acquisition was announced of
$7.75 per share, less estimated registration costs. The preliminary fair value
of Identix' stock options and warrants to be issued was determined using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following assumptions were used to
determine the fair value of the options: expected life of 48 months, risk-free
interest rate of 3.88%, expected volatility of 81% and no expected dividend
yield. The following assumptions were used to determine the fair value of the
warrants: expected life ranging from 6 months to 56 months, risk free interest
rate ranging from 1.38% to 4.03%, expected volatility of 81% and no expected
dividend yield. The final purchase price is dependent on the actual number of
shares of common stock exchanged, the actual number of options and warrants
issued, and actual direct merger costs. The final purchase price will be
determined upon completion of the merger. The estimated total purchase price of
the proposed Visionics merger is as follows (in thousands):

Value of Identix common stock to be issued..................   $300,700
Value of Identix options and warrants to be issued..........     25,600
Estimated direct merger costs...............................      4,000
                                                               --------
Total estimated purchase price..............................   $330,300
                                                               ========

     Under the purchase method of accounting, the total estimated purchase price
is allocated to Visionics net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based
upon their estimated fair value as of the date of completion of the merger.
Based upon the estimated purchase price and the preliminary independent
valuation, the

                      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     A preliminary estimate of $23.6 million has been allocated to amortizable
intangible assets with useful lives ranging from 3 to 6 years as follows:
Developed technology -- 5 years; Service/Maintenance agreements -- 6 years;
Patents/Core technology -- 6 years; Tradename/Trademarks -- 3 years; Other -- 3
months to 4 years.

     A preliminary estimate of $254.5 million has been allocated to goodwill.
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the
net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets", goodwill will not be amortized and will be tested for
impairment at least once annually.

3.  PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

     There were no transactions between Identix and Visionics. Certain
reclassifications have been made to conform Visionics' historical amounts to
Identix' financial statement presentation.

     The pro forma adjustments do not reflect any integration adjustments such
as restructuring costs to be incurred in connection with the merger or operating
efficiencies and cost savings that may be achieved with respect to the combined
entity.

     The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined financial statements have
been prepared as if the merger was completed on December 31, 2001 for balance
sheet purposes and as of July 1, 2000 for statement of operations purposes and
reflect the following pro forma adjustments:

          (a) To establish amortizable intangible assets and goodwill resulting
     from the proposed merger.

          (b) To record estimated direct merger costs of approximately $4.0
     million to be incurred by Identix of which $0.8 million is assumed to be
     settled in Identix common stock.

          (c) To adjust Visionics deferred revenue and inventory to estimated
     fair value.

          (d) To eliminate the historical stockholders' equity of Visionics and
     record the estimated value of Identix common stock, options and warrants to
     be issued in the proposed merger.

          (e) To record the intrinsic value of unvested options assumed by
     Identix in connection with the proposed merger.

                NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED
                      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

          (f) To reflect amortization of the amortizable intangible assets and
     deferred stock-based compensation resulting from the proposed merger. For
     presentation purposes, the entire amount of the amortization of deferred
     stock-based compensation is presented as an adjustment to general and
     administrative expense.

4.  UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE DATA

     Shares used to calculate unaudited pro forma combined net loss per basic
and diluted share were computed by adding 39.1 million shares assumed to be
issued in exchange for the outstanding Visionics shares and for shares assumed
to be issued to financial advisors in connection with this transaction to
Identix' weighted average shares outstanding. As the pro forma condensed
combined consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented shows a
net loss, weighted average basic and diluted shares are the same.

                       ADDITIONAL MATTERS BEING SUBMITTED
                     TO A VOTE OF ONLY IDENTIX STOCKHOLDERS

     In addition to proposal 1 related to the issuance of shares in the merger,
Identix stockholders are being asked to approve the following proposals:

PROPOSAL 2 -- APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO AUTHORIZE
            THE ISSUANCE OF UP TO 200,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

     Identix' certificate of incorporation currently authorizes Identix to issue
up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 2,000,000 shares of preferred
stock. This proposal would amend the certificate of incorporation to authorize
Identix to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of common stock and 2,000,000 shares
of preferred stock. The larger number of authorized shares of common stock
provided for in this proposal will provide Identix the certainty and flexibility
to undertake various types of transactions, including stock splits in the form
of stock dividends, financings, increases in the shares reserved for issuance
under stock incentive plans or other corporate transactions not yet determined.
Based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of February 22,
2002, on consummation of the merger, Identix would have approximately 83.6
million shares of common stock issued and outstanding, excluding shares of
common stock to be issued by Identix to Lehman Brothers and by Visionics to
Morgan Keegan as part of their financial advisory fees. This number does not
include approximately 10.7 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance
upon exercise of options outstanding, equity awards to be granted under Identix'
stock plans and shares subject to options and warrants to be assumed in the
merger.

     In order for the Identix board to be able to respond to future
circumstances with a reasonable degree of flexibility, Identix must have a
sufficient number of authorized shares to cover any stock dividends or other
transactions. There are currently 100,000,000 shares of common stock authorized
and approximately 44,840,000 issued and outstanding shares of Identix common
stock and approximately another 6,099,000 shares reserved for issuance under
Identix' stock plans. In addition, Identix will issue approximately 38.8 million
shares in the merger, and may issue up to 4.5 million shares to holders of
Visionics options and warrants being assumed in the merger if those options and
warrants are exercised. Under the proposed amendment to the certificate of
incorporation, the additional shares of common stock would be available for
issuance without further stockholder action, unless stockholder action is
otherwise required by Delaware law or Nasdaq. Identix has no current plans to
issue the remainder of the additional authorized shares other than shares that
could be issued in connection with any additional stock options granted under
the 2002 Plan. Although Identix currently has no agreements or understandings
with respect to any other material acquisitions, the increase in the authorized
number of shares of Identix common stock will provide Identix with additional
flexibility with regard to any future acquisitions.

     The additional shares of Identix common stock that would become available
for issuance if the proposed amendment were adopted could also be used by
Identix to oppose a hostile takeover attempt or delay or prevent changes of
control of Identix or changes in or removal of management of Identix. For
example, without further stockholder approval, the Identix board could
strategically sell shares of common stock in a private transaction to purchasers
who would oppose a takeover or favor the current board. Although this proposal
to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock has been prompted by
business and financial considerations, not by the threat of any attempt to
accumulate shares or otherwise gain control of Identix, stockholders
nevertheless should be aware that approval of the proposal could facilitate
future efforts by Identix to deter or prevent changes of control of Identix,
including transactions that are favored by a majority of the independent
stockholders or in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for
their shares over then-current market price or benefit in some other manner.

     Identix' certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain other provisions
that could have an anti-takeover effect, including the following:

     - Identix' board must be given advance notice regarding
       stockholder-sponsored proposals for consideration at annual meetings and
       for stockholder nominations for the election of directors; and

     - special meetings of stockholders may only be called by the chairman of
       the board, the president or the board, not by Identix' stockholders.

     In addition, the authority granted by Identix' certificate of incorporation
to the board to fix the designation, powers, preferences, rights,
qualifications, limitations and restrictions of any class or series of Identix
preferred stock could be used for anti-takeover purposes. The proposal to
increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, however, is not part
of any plan to adopt a series of amendments having an anti-takeover effect, and
Identix' management presently does not intend to propose anti-takeover measures
in future proxy solicitations.

     Stockholders are being asked to approve the amendment to the certificate of
incorporation. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of the common stock and Series A preferred stock of Identix
(voting on an as-converted basis with the holders of Identix common stock) is
required to amend the certificate of incorporation.

THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE AMENDMENT TO IDENTIX' CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM
100,000,000 TO 200,000,000.

          PROPOSAL 3 -- ADOPTION OF IDENTIX 2002 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN

     The Identix board has approved, subject to stockholder approval, the
adoption of the 2002 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan"). Under the terms
and conditions of the 2002 Plan, an aggregate of 5,800,000 shares of common
stock will be reserved for issuance thereunder. The 2002 Plan authorizes Identix
to grant options, restricted stock, stock purchase rights, performance shares,
or any combination of these (collectively, "awards") to eligible employees,
directors and consultants. A copy of the 2002 Plan is attached as exhibit the
Registration Statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part.
The following description of the 2002 Plan is a summary and is qualified by
reference to the complete text of the 2002 Plan.

     Summary Description of the 2002 Plan.  The 2002 Plan is intended to
strengthen Identix by allowing our selected employees, directors and consultants
to participate in our future growth and success by offering them an opportunity
to acquire stock in Identix in order to retain, attract and motivate them. The
board has ultimate responsibility for administering the 2002 Plan but may
delegate this authority to a committee of the board or an executive of Identix
(the "Committee"), subject to certain limitations. The Committee could have
broad discretion to determine the amount and type of awards and terms and
conditions of the awards. Individual grants will generally be based on a
person's present and potential contribution to Identix.

     As of February 22, 2002, Identix had approximately 425 employees, six
non-employee directors and no consultants who would be eligible to participate
in the 2002 Plan. In addition, Visionics employees will be eligible to
participate in the 2002 Plan upon completion of the merger. Since the grant of
awards is based upon a determination made by the Committee after a consideration
of various factors, Identix currently cannot determine the nature and amount of
any awards that will be granted in the future to any eligible individual or
group of individuals. However, the maximum number of shares that can be granted
under the 2002 Plan during any calendar year to any employee is 400,000. Identix
believes that with this limitation and other provisions of the 2002 Plan,
options and stock awards granted under the 2002 Plan will generate "qualified
performance-based compensation" within the meaning of section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code and will therefore not be subject to the $1,000,000 cap on
deductibility for federal income tax purposes of certain compensation payments
in excess of $1,000,000. See "Federal Income Tax Consequence of Awards and
Exercises under the 2002 Plan" below.

     Awards may be granted in the form of options, restricted stock, stock
purchase rights or performance shares. Any award may be granted either alone or
in addition to other awards granted under the 2002 Plan. The Committee may
condition the grant of the award upon the attainment of specified group or
division performance goals or other criteria, which need not be the same for all
participants. The Committee may condition the grant of the award upon the
attainment of specified performance goals or other criteria, which

need not be the same for all participants. The 2002 Plan will expire on February
22, 2012 but options outstanding under the 2002 Plan may extend beyond that
date.

     Options.  Stock options granted under the 2002 Plan may be incentive stock
options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code ("ISOs") or non-qualified
stock options ("NQOs"). The exercise price of ISOs may not be less than the fair
market value of the shares subject to the option on the date of grant. The
exercise price of NQOs may not be less than the fair market value of the shares
subject to the option on the date of grant unless otherwise approved by the
stockholders of Identix, and in any event must be at least 85% of the fair
market value of the shares subject to the option on the date of grant. The term
of any ISO granted under the plan may not exceed ten years and the term of any
NQO may not exceed fifteen years. Certain other limitations are also applicable
to ISOs in order to take advantage of the favorable tax treatment that may be
available for ISOs. The consideration payable for, upon exercise of an option
may be paid in cash, shares of stock, cashless exercise or by promissory note
(subject to no more than five year term and in the principal amount of no
greater than 90% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of
grant).

     Restricted Stock.  Restricted stock awards consist of non-transferable
shares of Identix common stock. The restrictions on transfer can lapse based on
service, performance or other criteria determined by the Committee, which may
not be waived or accelerated except in the event of a change of control or a
fundamental transaction. The exercise period for the restricted stock awards
cannot be more than ten years. The purchase price of the restricted stock must
be at least par value of the common stock and may be paid in cash, shares of
stock, cashless exercise or by promissory note (subject to no more than five
year term and in the principal amount of no greater than 90% of the fair market
value of the common stock on the date of grant).

     Stock Purchase Rights.  Stock purchase rights consist of a grant to
purchase common stock at a purchase price of not less than 85% of the fair
market value of the common stock on the grant date. Stock purchase rights are
generally exercisable for a period of up to 30 days after the grant date.

     Performance Shares.  Performance shares are shares of common stock issuable
upon the attainment of performance criteria. At the time of a grant the
Committee will determine the number of shares of common stock to be awarded at
the end of the performance period if and to the extent that the specified
performance targets are met. The consideration payable by a participant with
respect to a performance share award will be determined by the Committee but may
not exceed 50% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of
grant. The Committee will determine the performance period, the performance
objectives to be used in granting the awards and the extent to which awards have
been earned. Performance periods may overlap, and participants may be awarded
performance shares having different performance criteria. Performance share
awards may be payable in cash or stock, at the discretion of the Committee, and
may bear interest or earn dividends.

     General.  The consideration payable for, upon exercise of, or for tax
payable in connection with, an award may be paid in cash, by promissory note of
the participant, or by delivery of other property, including securities of
Identix, as authorized by the Committee. Identix generally will not receive any
consideration upon the grant of any awards, although the 2002 Plan provides that
consideration may be payable with respect to the grant of performance shares.
Awards generally may be exercised at any time within three months after a
participant's employment by, or consulting relationship with, Identix terminates
(but, only to the extent exercisable or payable at the time of termination). If
termination is due to the participant's death, retirement or disability, the
award may be exercised for two years thereafter. Shares issued under an award
may be subject to a right of repurchase by Identix. No award is assignable or
otherwise transferable by a participant other than by will or by the laws of
descent and distribution.

     The Identix board may amend, alter or discontinue the 2002 Plan or any
award at any time, except that the consent of a participant is required if the
participant's rights under an outstanding award would be impaired. In addition,
to the extent required for the 2002 Plan to satisfy the conditions of Rule 16b-3
under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 or, with respect to provisions
solely as they relate to ISOs, to the extent required for the 2002 Plan to
comply with Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, the stockholders of
Identix must approve any amendment, alteration or discontinuance of the 2002
Plan that would (i) increase

the total number of shares reserved under the 2002 Plan, (ii) change the minimum
price terms for Option exercise, (iii) change the class of employees and
consultants eligible to participate in the 2002 Plan, (iv) extend the maximum
option exercise period, (v) change the exercise price of the option or change
the provisions requiring stockholder approval for option repricing or (vi)
materially increase the benefits accruing to participants under the 2002 Plan.

     The 2002 Plan constitutes an unfunded plan for incentive and deferred
compensation. The Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or arrangements
to meet the obligations under the 2002 Plan to deliver stock or make payments.

     In the event of a "change in control" of Identix, as defined in the 2002
Plan, the board may, subject to certain limitations, accelerate the vesting
provisions of awards or may cash out the awards. A "change in control" is
defined to include the acquisition of 20% or more of the voting power of
Identix' outstanding stock, a proxy solicitation for one or more directors
without support of the then current board, a dissolution or liquidation of
Identix and certain asset sales, mergers or reorganizations or other changes in
ownership of Identix' assets or stock.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF OPTION AWARDS AND EXERCISES UNDER THE 2002
PLAN

     The following is a general summary of the typical federal income tax
consequences of the issuance and exercise of options or awards of restricted
stock under the 2002 Plan. It does not describe state or other tax consequences
of the issuance and exercise of options or of grant of restricted stock.

     Options.  The grant of an ISO has no federal income tax effect on the
optionee. Upon exercise the optionee does not recognize income for "regular" tax
purposes. However, the excess of the fair market value of the stock subject to
an option over the exercise price of such option (the "option spread") is
includible in the optionee's "alternative minimum taxable income" for purposes
of the alternative minimum tax. If the optionee does not dispose of the stock
acquired upon exercise of an ISO until more than two years after the option
grant date and more than one year after exercise of the option, any gain upon
sale of the shares will be a long-term capital gain. If shares are sold or
otherwise disposed of before both of these periods have expired (a
"disqualifying disposition"), the option spread at the time of exercise of the
option (but not more than the amount of the gain on the sale or other
disposition) is ordinary income in the year of such sale or other disposition.
If gain on a disqualifying disposition exceeds the amount treated as ordinary
income, the excess is taxable as capital gain (which will be long-term capital
gain if the shares have been held more than one year after the date of exercise
of the option). Identix is not entitled to a federal income tax deduction in
connection with ISOs, except to the extent that the optionee has taxable
ordinary income on a disqualifying disposition.

     The grant of a NQO has no federal income tax effect on the optionee. Upon
the exercise of a NQO, the optionee has taxable ordinary income (and Identix is
entitled to a corresponding deduction) equal to the option spread on the date of
exercise. Upon the disposition of stock acquired upon exercise of a NQO, the
optionee recognizes either long-term or short-term capital gain or loss,
depending on how long such stock was held.

     In the case of both ISOs and NQOs, special federal income tax rules apply
if Identix common stock is used to pay all or part of the option price. Special
rules may also apply when a transferable option is transferred.

     Awards.  Upon receipt of an award of shares, a recipient generally has
taxable income in the amount of the excess of the then fair market value of the
common stock over any consideration paid for the common stock (the "spread").
However, if the common stock is subject to a "substantial risk of forfeiture"
(such as a requirement that the recipient continue in the employ of Identix) and
the recipient does not make an election under section 83(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code, the recipient will have taxable income upon the lapse of the risk
of forfeiture, rather than at receipt, in an amount equal to the spread on the
date of lapse. The taxable income constitutes supplemental wages subject to
income and employment tax withholding, and Identix receives a corresponding
income tax deduction. If the recipient makes an election under section 83(b) of
the Internal Revenue Code, the stock received by the recipient is valued as of
the date of receipt (without taking

the restrictions into account) and the recipient has taxable income equal to any
excess of that value over the amount he or she paid for the stock. Identix would
again have a deduction equal to the income to the recipient. The consequences
upon sale or disposition of the shares awarded or sold generally are the same as
for common stock acquired under an NQO (see above).

     Limitation on Deduction of Certain Compensation.  Compensation of over
$1,000,000 paid in any year to one of the top five officers of a publicly-held
corporation is not deductible for tax purposes unless the grant of the
compensation meets the Internal Revenue Code's definition of "performance-based"
compensation. Identix will generally attempt to ensure that any awards under the
2002 Plan meet these standards, but may not do so in every instance.

     The following table shows the number of shares covered by options awarded
to certain executive officers and the identified groups under the 1995 Equity
Incentive Plan and the New Employee Stock Incentive Plan in fiscal 2001. Unless
otherwise noted, each option has an exercise price per share equal to the fair
market value of one share of common stock on the date of grant.

                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered
into as of February 22, 2002 by and among Identix Incorporated, a Delaware
corporation ("Identix"), Viper Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Identix ("Merger Sub"), and Visionics Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Visionics"), with respect to the following facts:

     A.  The respective boards of directors of Identix, Merger Sub and Visionics
have approved and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub with and into
Visionics (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, and have determined that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, their
respective stockholders.

     B.  Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, the outstanding shares of
Visionics Common Stock, $0.01 par value ("Visionics Common Stock"), will be
converted into shares of Identix Common Stock, $0.01 par value ("Identix Common
Stock"), at the rate set forth herein.

     C.  Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition and inducement to Identix' and Merger Sub's willingness to enter
into this Agreement, Identix is entering into Voting Agreements in the form of
Exhibit A attached hereto with each of the members of the Board of Directors and
each officer of Visionics in their respective capacities as stockholders of
Visionics (the "Visionics Voting Agreements").

     D.  Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition and inducement to Visionics' willingness to enter into this
Agreement, Visionics is entering into Voting Agreements in the form of Exhibit B
attached hereto with each of the members of the Board of Directors and each
officer of Identix in their respective capacities as stockholders of Identix
(the "Identix Voting Agreements").

     E.  For United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger will qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

     The parties agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

     1.1 The Merger.  At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law"), (i)
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Visionics, (ii) the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and (iii) Visionics shall be the surviving
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Identix. Visionics, as the
surviving corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as
the "Surviving Corporation."

     1.2 Closing; Effective Time.  The closing of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m.,
local time, on a date to be specified by the parties (the "Closing Date"), which
shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Articles VI and VII, unless another time or date is
agreed to by the parties hereto. The Closing shall take place at the offices of
Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe LLP, 275 Middlefield Road, Menlo Park,
California, or at such other location as the parties hereto shall mutually
agree. At the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger substantially in the form of
Exhibit C (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the
time of such filing, or such later time as may be agreed in writing by the
parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger, being the "Effective Time").

     1.3 Effects of the Merger.  The effects of the Merger shall be as provided
in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law. Without limiting the foregoing, at the

                                       A-1

Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
Visionics and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of Visionics and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

     1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.

     (a) Subject to Section 5.8, from and after the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub shall be amended so that the name of the Surviving
Corporation shall be "Visionics Corporation".

     (b) Subject to Section 5.8, from and after the Effective Time the bylaws of
Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

     1.5 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.  The directors and
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall serve as
the initial directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

                                   ARTICLE II

                              CONVERSION OF SHARES

     2.1 Conversion of Stock.  Pursuant to the Merger, and without any action on
the part of the holders of any outstanding shares of capital stock or securities
of Visionics or Merger Sub:

          (a) As of the Effective Time, each share of Visionics Common Stock,
     together with the rights (the "Visionics Rights"), if any, associated with
     each such share issued in connection with the Visionics Rights Agreement
     (the "Visionics Rights Plan") dated May 2, 1996 between Visionics and Wells
     Fargo Bank, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
     (other than shares of Visionics Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to
     Section 2.1(c)), shall be automatically converted into 1.3436 (the
     "Exchange Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable shares of Identix Common
     Stock.

          (b) As of the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate or
     certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
     outstanding shares of Visionics Common Stock shall cease to have any rights
     with respect thereto, except the right to receive (i) a certificate (or
     direct registration) representing the number of whole shares of Identix
     Common Stock into which such shares have been converted (the "Identix
     Certificates"), and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Identix
     Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.1(f), without interest.

          (c) As of the Effective Time, each share of Visionics Common Stock
     held of record immediately prior to the Effective Time by Visionics, Merger
     Sub, Identix or any Subsidiary (as defined in Section 2.1(g)) of Visionics
     or of Identix shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
     thereof.

          (d) As of the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock, $0.01 par
     value, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, extinguished and
     automatically converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
     nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.01 par value, of the Surviving
     Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of a number of shares of
     Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed to evidence ownership of the same
     number of shares of Common Stock, $0.01, of the Surviving Corporation.

          (e) Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, the
     Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock
     split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
     distribution of securities convertible into Identix Common Stock or
     Visionics Common Stock), extraordinary dividend or distribution,
     reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other like change
     with respect to Identix Common Stock or Visionics Common Stock occurring or
     having a record date or an effective date on or after the date hereof and
     prior to the Effective Time.

                                       A-2

          (f) No fraction of a share of Identix Common Stock will be issued by
     virtue of the Merger. Instead, each holder of shares of Visionics Common
     Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Identix
     Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Identix Common
     Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from Identix an amount
     of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of
     (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Identix Closing Value. For the
     purposes of this Agreement, "Identix Closing Value" shall mean the closing
     price per share of Identix Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq National
     Market ("NASDAQ") on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective
     Time.

          (g) For the purposes of this Agreement, the "Exchange Multiple" of any
     quantity means the product obtained from multiplying such quantity by the
     Exchange Ratio, and the "Exchange Quotient" of any quantity means the
     quotient obtained from dividing such quantity by the Exchange Ratio. For
     purposes of this Agreement, (i) the term "Subsidiary", when used with
     respect to any Person, means any corporation or other organization, whether
     incorporated or unincorporated, of which (A) at least a majority of the
     securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary voting power
     to elect a majority of the board of directors or others performing similar
     functions with respect to such corporation or other organization is
     directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such Person (through
     ownership of securities, by contract or otherwise) or (B) such Person or
     any Subsidiary of such Person is a general partner of any general
     partnership or a manager of any limited liability company. For the purposes
     of this Agreement, the term "Person" means any individual, group,
     organization, corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability
     company, trust or entity of any kind.

     2.2 Visionics Options, Visionics Warrants.

     (a) As of the Effective Time, Identix shall, to the full extent permitted
by applicable law, assume all of the stock options of Visionics outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Visionics Stock Plans (as
defined below) (the "Visionics Options"). For purposes of this Agreement,
"Visionics Stock Plans" means Visionics' Stock Incentive Plan, 1990 Stock Option
Plan, as amended, and 1998 Stock Option Plan. Each Visionics Option, whether or
not exercisable at the Effective Time, shall, to the full extent permitted by
applicable law, be assumed by Identix in such a manner that it shall be
exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as under the Visionics Stock Plan
pursuant to which it was granted and the applicable option agreement issued
thereunder; provided that (i) each such option thereafter shall be exercisable
for a number of shares of Identix Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) equal to the Exchange Multiple of the number of shares of Visionics
Common Stock subject to such option, and (ii) the option price per share of
Identix Common Stock thereafter shall equal the Exchange Quotient (rounded up to
the nearest whole cent) of the option price per share of Visionics Common Stock
subject to such option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"Identix Exchange Options"). With respect to shares of Visionics Common Stock
issued pursuant to the Visionics 1992 Restricted Stock Plan ("Visionics
Restricted Stock"), all such Visionics Restricted Stock, which shall
automatically be converted into shares of Identix Common Stock as provided in
Section 2.1, shall continue to be subject to such restrictions and rights of
repurchase as are provided for in the 1992 Restricted Stock Plan. Prior to the
Effective Time, Visionics shall make all adjustments provided for in the
Visionics Stock Plans with respect to the Visionics Options to facilitate the
implementation of the provisions of this Section 2.2(a).

     (b) As of the Effective Time, Identix shall, to the full extent permitted
by applicable law, assume all of the warrants of Visionics identified on
Schedule 3.6(e) of the Identix Disclosure Statement and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the "Visionics Warrants") under the agreements
pursuant to which the Visionics Warrants were issued (the "Visionics Warrant
Agreements"). Each Visionics Warrant shall, to the full extent permitted by
applicable law, be assumed by Identix in such a manner that it shall be
exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as under the Visionics Warrant
Agreement pursuant to which it was granted; provided that (i) each such warrant
thereafter shall be exercisable for a number of shares of Identix Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the Exchange Multiple of the
number of shares of Visionics Common Stock subject to such warrant, and (ii) the
warrant exercise price per share of Identix Common Stock thereafter shall equal
the Exchange Quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) of the warrant
exercise price per share of Visionics Common Stock subject to such warrant in
effect

                                       A-3

immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Identix Exchange Warrants"). Prior
to the Effective Time, Visionics shall make all adjustments provided for in the
Visionics Warrant Agreements with respect to the Visionics Warrants to
facilitate the implementation of the provisions of this Section 2.2(b).

     2.3 Exchange of Stock Certificates.

     (a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Identix shall enter into an
agreement with a bank or trust company selected by Identix and reasonably
acceptable to Visionics to act as the exchange agent for the Merger (the
"Exchange Agent").

     (b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Identix shall supply or cause to be
supplied to or for the account of the Exchange Agent in trust for the benefit of
the holders of Visionics Common Stock, for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.3
(i) certificates (or direct registration) evidencing the shares of Identix
Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 to be exchanged for outstanding
shares of Visionics Common Stock, and (ii) cash in an aggregate amount
sufficient to make the payments in lieu of fractional shares provided for in
Section 2.1(f).

     (c) Promptly after the Effective Time, Identix shall mail or shall cause to
be mailed to each Holder (as defined below) a letter of transmittal in customary
form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Visionics Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Visionics Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for surrender of
the Visionics Certificates. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Visionics
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the Holder
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor: (i) certificates evidencing
that number of shares of Identix Common Stock issuable to such Holder in
accordance with this Article II; (ii) any dividends or other distributions that
such Holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.3(d); and (iii) cash
in respect of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.1(f), and such
Visionics Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No certificate
representing shares of Identix Common Stock will be issued to a Person who is
not the registered owner of a surrendered Visionics Certificate unless (i) the
Visionics Certificate so surrendered has been properly endorsed or otherwise is
in proper form for transfer, and (ii) such Person shall either (A) pay any
transfer or other tax required by reason of such issuance or (B) establish to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 2.3, from and after the Effective Time, each Visionics
Certificate shall be deemed to represent, for all purposes other than payment of
dividends, the right to receive a certificate representing the number of full
shares of Identix Common Stock as determined in accordance with this Article II
and cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.1(f). For
purposes of this Agreement, "Visionics Certificate" means a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Visionics Common
Stock, and "Holder" means a person who holds one or more Visionics Certificates
as of the Effective Time.

     (d) No dividend or other distribution declared with respect to Identix
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to Holders
of unsurrendered Visionics Certificates until such Holders surrender their
Visionics Certificates. Upon the surrender of such Visionics Certificates, there
shall be paid to such Holders, promptly after such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions, excluding interest, declared with a record
date after the Effective Time and not paid because of the failure to surrender
Visionics Certificates for exchange.

     (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the
Exchange Agent, Identix, the Surviving Corporation nor any party hereto shall be
liable to any holder of shares of Visionics Common Stock for shares of Identix
Common Stock or cash in lieu of fractional shares delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     2.4 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.  In the event that any
Visionics Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall issue and pay in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Visionics
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, certificates representing the shares of Identix Common Stock as may be
required pursuant to Section 2.1 and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any,
as may be required pursuant to Section 2.1(f) and any dividends or distributions

                                       A-4

payable pursuant to Section 2.3(d); provided, however, that Identix may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Visionics Certificates to deliver a bond
in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Identix or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Visionics
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

     2.5 Tax Consequences.  For United States federal income tax purposes, it is
intended by the parties hereto that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement
constitutes a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3.

                                  ARTICLE III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF VISIONICS

     Visionics makes to Identix and Merger Sub the representations and
warranties contained in this Article III, in each case subject to the exceptions
set forth in the disclosure statement, dated as of the date hereof, delivered by
Visionics to Identix at least forty-eight hours prior to the execution of this
Agreement (the "Visionics Disclosure Statement"). The Visionics Disclosure
Statement shall be arranged in schedules corresponding to the numbered and
lettered Sections of this Article III, and the disclosure in any Schedule of the
Visionics Disclosure Statement shall qualify only the corresponding Section of
this Article III.

     3.1 Organization, Etc.

     (a) Each of Visionics and its Subsidiaries, all of which are listed on
Schedule 3.1(b) of the Visionics Disclosure Statement (the "Visionics
Subsidiaries"), is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, and has all
requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the failure to be so
organized, existing or in good standing or to have such power, authority or
qualification would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Visionics
Material Adverse Effect. Each of Visionics and the Visionics Subsidiaries is
duly qualified as a foreign Person to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character of its owned or leased properties or the
nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Visionics Material Adverse Effect.

     For the purposes of this Agreement, "Visionics Material Adverse Effect"
means any state of facts, change, event or effect that has had or could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (i) the business,
financial condition, results of operations or assets and liabilities, taken as a
whole, of Visionics, including the Visionics Subsidiaries, (ii) the ability of
Visionics to consummate the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by
the Agreement or to perform any of its obligations under the Agreement before
the Effective Time, or (iii) Identix' ability to vote, receive dividends with
respect to or otherwise exercise ownership rights with respect to the stock of
the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to item
(i) above, none of the following shall be deemed (either alone or in
combination) to constitute, and none of the following shall be taken into
account in determining whether there has been or will be, a Visionics Material
Adverse Effect: (A) any adverse change, event or effect arising from or relating
to general business or economic conditions; (B) any adverse change, event or
effect relating to or affecting the security industry generally; and (C) any
adverse change, event or effect arising from or relating to the announcement or
pendency of the Merger.

     (b) Neither Visionics nor any of the Visionics Subsidiaries is in violation
of any provision of its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or any other
charter document. Schedule 3.1(b) of the Visionics Disclosure Statement sets
forth (i) the full name of each Visionics Subsidiary and any other entity in
which Visionics has a significant equity interest, its capitalization and the
ownership interest of Visionics and each other Person (if any) therein, (ii) the
jurisdiction in which each such Visionics Subsidiary is organized, (iii) each
jurisdiction in which Visionics and each of the Visionics Subsidiaries is
qualified to do business as a foreign Person, and (iv) the names of the current
directors and officers of Visionics and of each Visionics

                                       A-5

Subsidiary. Visionics has made available to Identix accurate and complete copies
of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and any other charter documents, as
currently in effect, of Visionics and each of the Visionics Subsidiaries.

     3.2 Authority Relative to this Agreement.  Visionics has full corporate
power and authority to (i) execute and deliver this Agreement, and (ii) assuming
the approval of the Merger by a majority of the outstanding shares of Visionics
Common Stock at the Visionics Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof in accordance with Delaware Law, consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, have been duly and validly authorized by the vote of the board of
directors of Visionics, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Visionics are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby (other than, with respect to the
Merger, the approval of the adoption of the Agreement and approval of the Merger
by a majority of the outstanding shares of Visionics Common Stock at the
Visionics Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof in
accordance with Delaware Law). The Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by Visionics and, assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by Identix and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of
Visionics, enforceable against Visionics in accordance with its terms, except to
the extent that its enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting the enforcement
of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles.

     3.3 No Violations, Etc.  No filing with or notification to, and no permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any court, administrative agency,
commission, or other governmental or regulatory body, authority or
instrumentality ("Government Entity") is necessary on the part of Visionics for
the consummation by Visionics of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, or for the exercise by Identix and the Surviving
Corporation of full rights to own and operate the business of Visionics and the
Visionics Subsidiaries as presently being conducted, except (i) for the filing
of the Certificate of Merger as required by Delaware Law, (ii) the applicable
requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together
with the Rules and Regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act"),

required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the

obtain such permit, authorization, consent or approval would not prevent or
materially delay the Merger, or otherwise prevent or materially delay Visionics
from performing its obligations under this Agreement or individually or in the
aggregate, have a Visionics Material Adverse Effect. Neither the execution and
delivery of the Agreement, nor the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by Visionics with all of the
provisions hereof and thereof, nor the exercise by Identix and the Surviving
Corporation of full rights to own and operate the business of Visionics and the
Visionics Subsidiaries as presently being conducted will, subject to obtaining
the approval of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Visionics Common Stock at the Visionics Special Meeting or any
adjournment thereof in accordance with Delaware Law, (i) conflict with or result
in any breach of any provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
other charter document of Visionics or any Visionics Subsidiary, (ii) violate
any material order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation
applicable to Visionics or any Visionics Subsidiary, or by which any of their
properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) result in a violation or breach of,
or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default
under, or result in any material change in, or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation, acceleration, redemption or repurchase under, any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any material note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, contract, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which Visionics or any Visionics Subsidiary is a
party or by which any of them or any of their properties or assets may be bound.
Schedule 3.3 of the Visionics Disclosure Statement lists all consents, waivers
and approvals required to be obtained in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby under any of Visionics' or any Visionics
Subsidiaries' notes, bonds, mortgages, indentures, deeds of trust, licenses or
leases, contracts, agreements or other instruments or obligations the failure to
obtain which would have a Visionics Material Adverse Effect.

of such opinion to Identix.

     3.6 Capitalization.

     (a) The authorized capital stock of Visionics consists of 40,000,000 shares
of Visionics Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.01 par

or agreements or commitments of any nature obligating Visionics to issue,
deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of
capital stock or other equity interests of Visionics, or obligating Visionics to
grant, issue, extend, accelerate the vesting of, or enter into, any such
warrant, option, convertible security, call, right, stock appreciation right,
preemptive right, right of first refusal, agreement or commitment. To the
knowledge of Visionics, except for the Visionics Voting Agreements, there are no
voting trusts, proxies or other agreements or understandings with respect to the
capital stock of Visionics. For purposes of this Agreement, "To the Knowledge of
Visionics," or words of similar import, shall mean the actual knowledge of the
persons set forth on Schedule 3.6(b) of the Visionics Disclosure Statement.

     (c) True and complete copies of each Visionics Stock Plan, the Visionics
Warrant Agreements and the Visionics Rights Plan, and of the forms of all
agreements and instruments relating to or issued under each thereof, have been

amended, modified or supplemented, and there are no agreements to amend, modify
or supplement any such agreements, instruments or forms.

following information with respect to each Visionics Option: the aggregate
number of shares issuable thereunder, the type of option, the grant date, the
expiration date, the exercise price and the vesting schedule. Each Visionics
Option and share of Visionics Restricted Stock was granted in accordance with
the terms of the Visionics Stock Plan applicable thereto or the 1992 Restricted
Stock Plan, respectively. The terms of each of the Visionics Stock Plans do not
prohibit the assumption of the Visionics Options as provided in Section 2.2(a).
Consummation of the Merger will not accelerate vesting of any Visionics Option
or any Visionics Restricted Stock.

     (e) Schedule 3.6(e) of the Visionics Disclosure Statement sets forth the
following information with respect to each Visionics Warrant: the aggregate
number of warrants outstanding, the expiration date and the exercise price. Each
Visionics Warrant was issued in accordance with the terms of the Visionics

Agreements do not prohibit the assumption of the Visionics Warrants as provided
in Section 2.2(b).

     3.7 Sec Filings.  Visionics has filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") all required forms, reports, registration statements and
documents required to be filed by it with the SEC (collectively, all such forms,
reports, registration statements and documents filed since January 1, 1999 are
referred to herein as the "Visionics SEC Reports"). All of the Visionics SEC
Reports complied as to form,

                                       A-7

when filed, in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the "Securities Act") and the Exchange Act. Accurate and
complete copies of the Visionics SEC Reports have been made available to
Identix. As of their respective dates, the Visionics SEC Reports (including all
exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein)
did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Visionics has been advised by each of its officers and directors
that each such person and such persons' affiliates have complied with all filing
requirements under Section 13 and Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

     3.8 Compliance with Laws.  Neither Visionics nor any Visionics Subsidiary
has violated or failed to comply with any statute, law, ordinance, rule or
regulation (including without limitation relating to the export or import of
goods or technology) of any foreign, federal, state or local government or any
other governmental department or agency, except where any such violations or
failures to comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Visionics
Material Adverse Effect. Visionics and the Visionics Subsidiaries have all
permits, licenses and franchises from governmental agencies required to conduct
their businesses as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted, except
for those, the absence of which, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Visionics Material Adverse Effect.

     3.9 Financial Statements.  Each of the consolidated financial statements
(including, in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in the Visionics
SEC Reports (the "Visionics Financial Statements"), (x) was prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited
interim financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q under
the Exchange Act) and (y) fairly presented the consolidated financial position
of Visionics and the Visionics Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof
and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the periods
indicated, consistent with the books and records of Visionics, except that the
unaudited interim financial statements were or are subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments which were not, or are not expected to be,
material in amount. The balance sheet of Visionics contained in Visionics' Form
10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2001 (the "Reference Date") is
hereinafter referred to as the "Visionics Balance Sheet."

liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) other than (i)
liabilities included in the Visionics Balance Sheet and the related notes to the

provided for in any such license or agreement, (ii) cause the forfeiture or
termination of any Visionics IP Rights, (iii) give rise to a right of forfeiture

Rights or portion thereof.

Subsidiaries and any third party or (ii) infringes in any material respect any
patents or other intellectual property rights of any other party; and there is

which adequately protect the Visionics IP Rights.

     (f) To Visionics' knowledge, Visionics' and the Visionics Subsidiaries'
source codes and trade secrets have not been used, distributed or otherwise
commercially exploited under circumstances which have caused, or with the
passage of time could cause, the loss of copyright or trade secret status.

     (g) Neither Visionics nor any of the Visionics Subsidiaries has knowledge
that any of its employees or consultants is obligated under any contract,
covenant or other agreement or commitment of any nature, or subject to any
judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative agency, that would
interfere with the use of such employee's or consultant's best efforts to
promote the interests of Visionics and the Visionics Subsidiaries or that would
conflict with the business of Visionics as presently conducted or proposed to be
conducted. Neither Visionics nor any of the Visionics Subsidiaries has entered
into any agreement to indemnify any other person, including but not limited to
