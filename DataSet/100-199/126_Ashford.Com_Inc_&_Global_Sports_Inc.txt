(1) This Registration Statement relates to common stock, par value $0.01 per
    share, of Global Sports, Inc. issuable to holders of common stock, par
    value $0.001 per share, of Ashford.com, Inc. in the proposed merger of Ruby
    Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Global Sports, Inc., with
    and into Ashford.com, Inc. The amount of Global Sports, Inc. common stock
    to be registered has been determined by multiplying the exchange ratio
    (0.0076 of a share of Global Sports, Inc. common stock for each share of
    Ashford.com, Inc. common stock) by 67,357,142 shares, the maximum aggregate
    number of shares of Ashford.com, Inc. common stock that would be
    outstanding prior to the merger, assuming the exercise of all outstanding
    Ashford.com, Inc. options and warrants (whether or not currently
    exercisable).
(2) The registration fee was calculated pursuant to Rule 457(f) as 0.00025
    multiplied by $11.195 (the average of the high and low prices of Global
    Sports, Inc. common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on October 2,
    2001), multiplied by 511,914 shares.

   The Registrant hereby amends this Registration Statement on such date or
dates as may be necessary to delay its effective date until the Registrant
shall file a further amendment which specifically states that this Registration
Statement shall thereafter become effective in accordance with Section 8(a)
under the Securities Act of 1933, or until the Registration Statement shall
become effective on such date as the Securities and Exchange Commission, acting
pursuant to said Section 8(a), may determine.

0.0076 of a share of Global Sports common stock for each share of Ashford
common stock they hold.

   Ashford's board of directors has fixed [       ], 2001 as the record date
for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at,
the special meeting of Ashford stockholders and any adjournment or postponement
thereof. Only holders of record of shares of Ashford common stock at the close
of business on the record date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the

the merger agreement. If you do attend the special meeting of Ashford
stockholders and wish to vote in person, you may withdraw your proxy and vote

                    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q: As an Ashford stockholder, what will I receive in the merger? (see page 44)

A: You will receive a combination of $0.125 in cash and 0.0076 of a share of
   Global Sports common stock, the combination of which is collectively
   referred to in this prospectus/proxy statement as the "merger
   consideration," for each share of Ashford common stock that you own, except
   that you will receive a cash payment in lieu of any fractional share of
   Global Sports common stock you would otherwise be entitled to receive. For
   example, if you own 1,000 shares of Ashford common stock at the time the
   merger is completed, you will receive in exchange for your Ashford shares
   $125 in cash, seven shares of Global Sports common stock and a cash payment
   equal to the value of 0.6 of a share of Global Sports common stock, based on
   the closing price of Global Sports common stock on the Nasdaq National
   Market on the date the merger is completed.

   The 0.0076 of a share of Global Sports common stock that you will have the
   right to receive in the merger in exchange for each of your shares of
   Ashford common stock is a fixed ratio and will not be adjusted based upon
   changes in the value of Ashford or Global Sports common stock. As a result,
   the value of the Global Sports shares you will receive in the merger, and
   thus the value of the aggregate merger consideration you will receive in the
   merger, will not be known before the completion of the merger and will go up
   or down as the market price of Global Sports common stock goes up or down.
   You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations of Ashford and Global
   Sports common stock.

Q: What do I need to do now? (see page 41)

A: You should read this prospectus/proxy statement carefully, including its
   annexes, and consider how the merger will affect you. You should then mail
   your signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible
   as described in this prospectus/proxy statement, so that your shares can be
   voted at the special meeting of Ashford stockholders.

Q: What happens if I do not return a proxy card? (see page 42)

A: The failure to return your proxy card or vote in person will have the same
   effect as voting AGAINST adoption of the merger agreement.

Q: What happens if I return a signed and dated proxy card but do not indicate
   how to vote my proxy? (see page 41)

A: If you do not include instructions on how to vote your properly signed and
   dated proxy, your shares will be voted FOR adoption of the merger agreement.

Q: May I vote in person? (see page 41)

A: Yes. You may attend the special meeting of Ashford stockholders and vote
   your shares in person, rather than signing, dating and returning your proxy
   card.

Q: May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
   (see page 41)

A: Yes. You may change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
   special meeting of Ashford stockholders. You can do this in one of three
   ways. First, you can send a written, dated notice stating that you would
   like to revoke your proxy. Second, you can complete, date and submit a new
   proxy card. Third, you can attend the special meeting and vote in person.
   Your attendance alone will not revoke your proxy. If you have instructed a
   broker to vote your shares, you must follow directions received from your
   broker to change those instructions.

                                      iv

Q: If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker
   automatically vote my shares for me? (see page 42)

A: No. Your broker will not be able to vote your shares without instructions
   from you. You should instruct your broker to vote your shares, following the
   procedure provided by your broker. The failure to provide such voting
   instructions to your broker will have the same effect as voting AGAINST
   adoption of the merger agreement.

Q: What does Ashford's board of directors recommend? (see page 43)

A: Ashford's board of directors has approved the merger agreement and the
   merger and recommends that you vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement.

Q: Should I send in my Ashford stock certificates now? (see page 61)

A: No. If you are an Ashford stockholder, after the merger is completed, you
   will receive written instructions for exchanging the certificates
   representing your shares of Ashford common stock for the cash consideration,
   certificates representing shares of Global Sports common stock and a cash
   payment in lieu of any fractional share of Global Sports common stock you
   would otherwise be entitled to receive.

Q: When do the parties expect to complete the merger? (see page 61)

A: The parties are working towards completing the merger as quickly as possible
   and hope to do so promptly after the special meeting of Ashford
   stockholders.

Q: Will the merger trigger the recognition of gain or loss for federal income
   tax purposes? (see page 58)

A: Yes. You will generally recognize capital gain or loss, measured by the
   amount of cash you receive in the merger plus the fair market value, as of
   the effective date of the merger, of the shares of Global Sports common
   stock you receive in the merger, less your adjusted tax basis in your shares
   of Ashford common stock exchanged. This gain or loss will be long term
   capital gain or loss if you have held your Ashford shares more than one year
   on the effective date of the merger.

   Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences of the merger to
   you will depend on the facts of your own situation. You should consult your
   own tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the
   merger to you.

   Global Sports is a leading outsource solution provider for e-commerce that
develops and operates e-commerce businesses for retailers, media companies and
professional sports organizations. Global Sports enables its partners to
capitalize on their existing assets in order to exploit online opportunities in
their respective industries. Global Sports' scalable business model takes
advantage of its proprietary technology and product database, customer service
capabilities, fulfillment capabilities, relationships with vendors and
centralized inventory management. Global Sports enables its partners to remain
focused on their core businesses and to avoid making substantial investments in
e-commerce infrastructure and personnel. Depending on the specific needs of the
partner, Global Sports can undertake either a complete outsourcing of a
partner's online activities or a more customized "back-end" operation. Global
Sports benefits from the traffic generated by its partners' established brand
franchises, extensive advertising, retail traffic and vendor relationships to
achieve operational efficiencies, lower customer acquisition costs and
economies of scale. Global Sports maintains a site on the Internet at

   Ashford is a Web-based retailer focused on luxury and premium products,
including new and vintage watches, clocks, diamonds, jewelry, leather goods,
writing instruments, fragrances and sunglasses, altogether offering more than
12,000 products from over 300 leading luxury brands. Since late 1999, Ashford
has rapidly expanded its primary product focus from offering only new watches
to offering 11 different product categories. Ashford's strategy has been to add
complementary products to create a portfolio that combines items purchased
frequently, such as leather goods and sunglasses, with higher-priced items
purchased less frequently, such as watches and diamonds. In March 2000, Ashford
launched its corporate gifts business, which offers an additional 800 luxury
products in new categories such as crystal, silver and pewter that are targeted
to the corporate market. By combining its expertise in luxury products and its
commitment to excellent customer service with the benefits of Internet
retailing, Ashford is able to deliver a unique shopping experience to
consumers. Ashford believes that its current luxury and premium product
offerings are well suited for online commerce given brand recognition,
generally high average sales prices and relatively low average distribution and
shipping costs. Ashford is a Delaware corporation initially incorporated as a
Texas corporation in March 1998 under the name "NewWatch Corporation." It
changed its name to Ashford.com, Inc. and reincorporated in Delaware in July
1999. Ashford maintains a site on the Internet at www.ashford.com. Information
found at Ashford's Web site is not a part of this prospectus/proxy statement.

Merger Structure; Merger Consideration (Page 61)

   If the merger is completed, a subsidiary of Global Sports will merge into
Ashford and Ashford will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Global Sports.
Upon completion of the merger, you will become entitled to receive a
combination of $0.125 in cash and 0.0076 of a share of Global Sports common
stock, the combination of which is collectively referred to in this
prospectus/proxy statement as the "merger consideration," in exchange for each
share of Ashford common stock that you own at the time of the completion of the
merger, except that you will receive cash in lieu of any fractional share of
Global Sports common stock you would otherwise be entitled to receive.

   The cash and fraction of a share of Global Sports common stock constituting
the merger consideration are fixed. Regardless of fluctuations in the market
prices of Global Sports or Ashford common stock, such amounts will not change
between now and the date that the merger is completed, but the value of the
merger consideration will fluctuate as the value of Global Sports common stock
fluctuates. Neither Ashford nor Global Sports has the right to terminate the
merger agreement or renegotiate the merger consideration solely as a result of
market price fluctuations. You are encouraged to obtain current market
quotations of Global Sports and Ashford common stock.

this means that each Ashford stockholder will recognize taxable gain or loss
equal to the cash the stockholder receives in the merger plus the fair market
value, as of the effective date of the merger, of the shares of Global Sports
common stock the stockholder receives in the merger, less the stockholder's
adjusted tax basis in the stockholder's shares of Ashford common stock.

Reasons for the Merger (Page 46)

Global Sports (Page 46)

   Global Sports' primary reasons for seeking to complete the merger with
Ashford are the beliefs of the board of directors and management of Global
Sports that the merger could result in a number of benefits to Global Sports,
including the following:

  .  Ashford's merchandising and fulfillment expertise in the luxury products
     category could serve as a platform for Global Sports to extend its
     outsource business model into the luxury products category;

  .  Ashford's sales force, merchandising expertise and clientele in the
     corporate gift category could serve as a platform for Global Sports to
     extend its outsource business model to the corporate gift category; and

  .  the merger could enable Global Sports to expand its business and realize
     greater operational efficiencies, including higher purchase volumes for
     online marketing and greater economies of scale in its customer service
     center and technology operations.

Ashford (Page 48)

   Ashford's board of directors believes that the merger could be beneficial to
Ashford and its stockholders for the following reasons, as well as the access
to greater resources and the opportunity for Ashford stockholders to
participate in the broader scope of consumer groups served by Global Sports
after the merger and the potential growth of Global Sports after the merger:

  .  the merger would provide Ashford stockholders with cash and shares of
     Global Sports common stock at an implied premium over the closing price
     for Ashford common stock on the last trading day prior to the time the
     merger agreement was entered into;

  .  the potential synergies created from combining the procurement,
     distribution and other strengths developed by Global Sports with the
     brand, consumer relationships, luxury goods inventory and other strengths
     built by Ashford; and

  .  the availability following the merger of Global Sports' greater resources
     to establish and support Ashford's products and sales.

Recommendation to Ashford Stockholders (Page 43)

   Ashford's board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement
and the merger and has determined that the merger agreement and the merger are
advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Ashford and its
stockholders, and recommends that Ashford stockholders vote FOR the adoption of
the merger agreement.

Opinion of Ashford's Financial Advisor (Page 50)

   In connection with the merger, Ashford's board of directors received an
opinion from U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc. as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of Ashford common stock (other than
Global Sports) of the merger consideration provided for in the merger
agreement. The full text of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc.'s written opinion
dated September 12, 2001 is attached as Annex C to this prospectus/proxy
statement. You are encouraged to read this opinion carefully in its entirety
for a description of the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations
on the review undertaken. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc.'s opinion is
addressed to Ashford's board of directors and relates only to the fairness of
the merger consideration from a financial point of view as of the date of the
opinion. The opinion does not address any other aspect of the proposed merger
and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to any matters
relating to the proposed merger.

The Special Meeting of Ashford Stockholders (Page 41)

   Time, Date and Place. A special meeting of Ashford stockholders will be held
on [  ], 2001, at [  a.m.], local time, at the Renaissance Hotel, 6 Greenway
Plaza East, Suite 1809, Houston, Texas 77046, to vote on a proposal to adopt
the merger agreement.

   Record Date and Voting Power. You are entitled to vote at the special
meeting of Ashford stockholders if you owned shares of Ashford common stock at
the close of business on [   ], 2001, the record date for the special meeting.
You will have one vote at the special meeting for each share of Ashford common
stock you owned at the close of business on the record date. At the close of
business on the record date, there were [   ] outstanding shares of Ashford
common stock.

   Ashford Required Vote. The adoption of the merger agreement requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Ashford common stock
outstanding at the close of business on the record date.

   Share Ownership of Management. At the close of business on the record date,
the directors and executive officers of Ashford and their affiliates owned
approximately [  ]% of the shares entitled to vote at the special meeting of
Ashford stockholders. A number of the directors and officers of Ashford,
together with affiliated entities, have agreed to vote their shares, which
represent approximately [     ] shares, equaling [    %] of the shares entitled
to vote at the special meeting, in favor of adoption of the merger agreement.

Interests of Ashford's Officers and Directors in the Merger (Page 56)

   When considering the recommendation by Ashford's board of directors that
Ashford stockholders vote for the adoption of the merger agreement, you should
be aware that a number of Ashford's directors may have interests in the merger
that are different from, or in addition to, those of other Ashford stockholders
generally. Among other things, Global Sports has agreed to continue for a
number of years following the completion of the merger certain insurance and
indemnification arrangements in favor of the current officers and directors of
Ashford.

Conditions to the Merger (Page 68)

   The obligation of each of Global Sports and Ashford to complete the merger
is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including the
condition that Ashford stockholders adopt the merger agreement. Either Global
Sports or Ashford may choose to waive the conditions to its obligation to
complete the merger, as long as the law allows it to do so.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (Page 71)

   Each of Global Sports and Ashford is entitled to terminate the merger
agreement under designated circumstances. If the merger agreement is
terminated, Ashford may become obligated to pay to Global Sports a fee equal to
$750,000, plus expenses.

Limitation on Ashford's Ability to Consider Other Acquisition Proposals (Page
66)

   Ashford has agreed not to discuss or negotiate a business combination or
other similar transaction with another party while the merger is pending unless
the other party has made an unsolicited, bona fide written offer to Ashford to
purchase, by merger, tender offer or otherwise, all or substantially all of the
outstanding shares of Ashford common stock or all or substantially all of the
assets of Ashford on terms that Ashford's board of directors determines to be
more favorable to its stockholders than the terms of the merger agreement with
Global Sports. The offer will not be deemed to be a superior offer if any
financing required to complete the transaction is not reasonably capable of
being obtained by the other party.

Expenses and Termination Fee (Page 72)

   The merger agreement provides that regardless of whether the merger is
completed, all expenses incurred by the parties shall be borne by the party
incurring such expenses, except in certain circumstances where the expenses are
to be shared. The merger agreement requires, however, that Ashford pay Global
Sports an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all fees and expenses that
have been paid or that may become payable by or on behalf of Global Sports in
connection with the preparation and negotiation of the merger agreement and
otherwise in connection with the merger, under certain circumstances where the
merger agreement is terminated because the merger is not completed by March 31,
2002, because Ashford stockholders fail to adopt the merger agreement, or as a
result of one or more "triggering events" described in the merger agreement.

   In addition, the merger agreement requires that Ashford pay Global Sports a
termination fee of $750,000, if:

  .  Ashford or Global Sports terminates the merger agreement because the
     merger is not completed by March 31, 2002, or because Ashford stockholders
     fail to adopt the merger agreement, provided in either case that, between
     the date of the merger agreement and the time of the termination of the
     merger agreement, another acquisition proposal has been disclosed,
     announced, commenced, submitted or made, and Ashford consummates or is
     subject to another acquisition transaction within one year of the
     termination of the merger agreement or Ashford or any of its
     representatives signs a definitive agreement or letter of intent within
     one year of the termination of the merger agreement providing for another
     acquisition transaction; or

  .  the merger agreement is terminated by Global Sports as a result of one or
     more "triggering events" described in the merger agreement.

Accounting Treatment (Page 59)

   The merger will be accounted for as a "purchase" for financial reporting
purposes.

Regulatory Approvals (Page 59)

   Global Sports and Ashford believe that the merger is not subject to the
reporting obligations, statutory waiting periods or other approvals of any
governmental agency.

   As of the record date, there were approximately [   ] record holders of
Global Sports common stock, and there were approximately [   ] record holders
of Ashford common stock. Neither Global Sports nor Ashford has ever paid cash
dividends on its common stock. Following the merger, Global Sports intends to
retain earnings, if any, to support the development of its business and does
not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Following
completion of the merger, Global Sports common stock will continue to be listed
on the Nasdaq National Market, and there will be no further market for Ashford
common stock.

   The following table sets forth the per share closing sale prices of Global
Sports common stock and Ashford common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National
Market and the estimated equivalent per share price, as explained below, of
Ashford common stock on September 10, 2001, the last full trading day before
the public announcement of the proposed merger, and on [       ], 2001, the
last full trading day before the printing of this prospectus/proxy statement:

                                                     Estimated Equivalent
                          Global Sports   Ashford          Ashford
                          Common Stock  Common Stock   Per Share Price
                          ------------- ------------ --------------------

       September 10, 2001    $16.51        $0.17            $0.25
       [       ], 2001...    $  [  ]       $ [  ]           $ [  ]

   The estimated equivalent per share closing price of Ashford common stock
equals the exchange ratio of 0.0076 multiplied by the closing price of a share
of Global Sports common stock on the applicable date, plus the cash component
of the merger consideration. If the merger had occurred on [   ], 2001, Ashford
stockholders would have had the right to receive cash in the amount of $0.125
and a fraction of a share of Global Sports common stock worth $[   ] for each
share of Ashford common stock they owned. The actual value of the fraction of a
share of Global Sports common stock that Ashford stockholders will have the
right to receive if the merger is completed may be different from this price
because the per share price of Global Sports common stock on the Nasdaq
National Market fluctuates continuously.

            SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

   The following selected consolidated financial and operating data should be
read in conjunction with Ashford's consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus/proxy statement and the section
of this prospectus/proxy statement entitled "Ashford Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

   The selected consolidated financial data reflect that prior to March 31,
1998, Ashford had no operations or activities. The following selected
consolidated financial data for the period from inception through March 31,
1999 and the years ended March 31, 2000 and 2001, respectively, were derived
from Ashford's audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
this prospectus/proxy statement. Ashford's independent public accountant's
report on the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2001 included
an explanatory fourth paragraph expressing substantial doubt as to Ashford's
ability to continue as a going concern. The following selected consolidated
financial data for the three months ended June 30, 2000 and 2001, respectively,
were derived from Ashford's unaudited financial statements included elsewhere
in this prospectus/proxy statement and include all adjustments, consisting of
only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the
information when read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and
the notes thereto. Ashford was incorporated in March 1998, and did not commence
operations or activities until April 1998.

                SUMMARY SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED
                        COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

   The following selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information for Global Sports has been derived from the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements which are included elsewhere in this
prospectus/proxy statement, which give effect to the proposed merger of a
subsidiary of Global Sports and Ashford, as well as Global Sports' acquisition
of Fogdog, Inc. ("Fogdog") which was completed on December 28, 2000, and should
be read in conjunction with the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements and the related notes. For pro forma purposes, (1) Global
Sports' audited consolidated statement of operations for the year ended
December 30, 2000 has been combined with Fogdog's unaudited consolidated
statement of operations for the period January 1, 2000 through December 27,
2000, and Ashford's audited consolidated statement of operations for the year
ended March 31, 2001 as if the Fogdog acquisition and the Ashford merger had
occurred on January 2, 2000, (2) Global Sports' unaudited consolidated
statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2001 has been
combined with Ashford's unaudited statement of operations for the six months
ended June 30, 2001, as if the Ashford merger had occurred on January 2, 2000,
and (3) Global Sports' unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2001
has been combined with Ashford's unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of
June 30, 2001 as if the Ashford merger had occurred on June 30, 2001. The
results of operations of Ashford for the three months ended March 31, 2001,
which included net revenues of $14.3 million and a loss from continuing
operations of $17.0 million, have been included in the results of operations
for the six months ended June 30, 2001 as well as for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2001. The pro forma information is presented for illustrative
purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results or
financial position that would have occurred if the merger had been completed on
January 2, 2000 or June 30, 2001, respectively, nor is it necessarily
indicative of the future operating results or financial position of Global
Sports following the completion of the Ashford merger.

                                 RISK FACTORS

   Ashford stockholders should consider the following risk factors in
evaluating whether to vote for the adoption of the merger agreement. These
factors should be considered in conjunction with the other information included
in this prospectus/proxy statement.

Risks Relating to the Merger

If Global Sports does not realize the expected benefits of the merger, Global
Sports' financial results, including earnings per share, could be adversely
affected.

   Achieving the benefits of the merger will depend in part on the successful
integration of Ashford's operations, technology, vendors, suppliers and
personnel with those of Global Sports in a timely and efficient manner, and
maintaining Ashford's relationships with key brand manufacturers. Integration
efforts may be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural
conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions, strategic plans and
other decisions. Global Sports does not know whether it will be successful in
these integration efforts and cannot give assurance that it will realize the
expected benefits of the merger. If Global Sports cannot successfully integrate
Ashford's operations, technology, vendors, suppliers and personnel, or maintain
Ashford's relationships with key brand manufacturers, it may not realize the
expected benefits of the merger and its business results of operations may be
seriously harmed.

If Global Sports does not successfully integrate the business of Ashford and
realize the expected benefits of the merger, it will have incurred significant
costs, which may harm its business.

   Global Sports expects to incur costs and commit significant management time
integrating Ashford's operations, technology, development programs, products
and personnel. These costs may be substantial and may include costs for:

  .  employee severance;

  .  integration of operations; and

  .  fees and expenses of professionals and consultants involved in completing
     the integration process.

Integrating the business of Ashford may divert management's attention away from
operations.

   Successful integration of Ashford's operations, technology and personnel may
place a significant burden on the management and internal resources of Global
Sports and Ashford. The diversion of management's attention and any
difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a
material adverse effect on the future business, financial condition and
operating results of Global Sports.

Failure to retain key employees could diminish the benefits of the merger.

   One of the expected benefits of the merger is the addition of Ashford's key
personnel. Global Sports has not entered into employment agreements with these
individuals and therefore, cannot give assurance that it will be able to retain
key personnel, or that the anticipated benefits of their expertise, experience
and capabilities will be realized.

Because Ashford stockholders will receive a fixed amount of cash and a fixed
number of shares of Global Sports common stock in the merger, if the market
price of Global Sports common stock declines, the value of the merger
consideration received by Ashford stockholders will be reduced.

   Upon completion of the merger, each Ashford stockholder will have the right
to receive a combination of $0.125 in cash and 0.0076 of a share of Global
Sports common stock in exchange for each share of Ashford common stock that the
stockholder owns. No fractional shares of Global Sports common stock will be
issued,

and Ashford stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional share of
Global Sports common stock that they would otherwise be entitled to receive in
the merger. Each of the components of the merger consideration is fixed and
will not be adjusted based upon changes in the value of Global Sports common
stock or changes in the value of Ashford common stock.

   The value of the Global Sports shares that Ashford stockholders will receive
in the merger will not be known until the time of completion of the merger, and
will change as the market price of Global Sports common stock goes up or down
prior to that time. In recent years, and particularly in recent months, the
stock market in general, and the securities of technology and e-commerce
companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume
fluctuations. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price
of Global Sports common stock. In addition, events or circumstances specific to
Global Sports could cause the price of its common stock to decline. See "Risk
Factors--Risks Relating to Global Sports." The market price of Global Sports
common stock upon and after completion of the merger could be lower than the
market price on the date of the merger agreement, the current market price
and/or the market price on the date of the special meeting of Ashford
stockholders or the date on which an Ashford stockholder votes on the adoption
of the merger agreement. Ashford stockholders should obtain recent market
quotations of Global Sports common stock and Ashford common stock before they
vote on adoption of the merger agreement.

Failure to complete the merger could adversely affect Ashford's stock price,
future business and operations.

   If the merger is not completed for any reason, Ashford may be subject to a
number of material risks, including the following:

  .  the price of Ashford common stock may decline to the extent that the
     market price prior to such termination reflects a market assumption that
     the merger will be completed;

  .  costs related to the merger, such as legal, accounting and financial
     advisor fees, must be paid even if the merger is not completed; and

  .  Ashford may be required under certain circumstances to pay Global Sports a
     termination fee of $750,000, plus expenses.

   Further, if the merger were terminated and Ashford's board of directors
sought another merger or business combination, there would be no assurance that
it would be able to find a partner willing to pay an equivalent or more
attractive price than the price Global Sports is offering in the merger. In
addition, while the merger agreement is in effect, subject to very narrowly
defined exceptions, Ashford is prohibited from soliciting, initiating,
encouraging or entering into transactions such as a merger, sale of assets or
other business combination with any party other than Global Sports.

   Global Sports' or Ashford's partners, vendors, suppliers, including key
brand manufacturers, or customers, in response to the announcement or pendency
of the merger, may delay or defer decisions concerning the relevant company.
Any delay or deferral of those decisions by partners, vendors, suppliers or
customers, or a decision by any of these parties to discontinue its
relationship with Ashford or Global Sports, could have a material adverse
effect on the business of the relevant company. Similarly, current and
prospective Global Sports or Ashford employees may experience uncertainty about
their future roles with Global Sports until Global Sports' plans with regard to
Ashford are announced or fully executed. For example, Ashford and Global Sports
have discussed terminating a significant number of Ashford employees in certain
functional areas if the merger is completed. This may adversely affect Global
Sports' or Ashford's ability to attract and retain key personnel.

The market price of Global Sports common stock may decline as a result of the
merger.

   The market price of Global Sports common stock may decline as a result of
the merger if:

  .  the integration of Ashford's business is unsuccessful;

  .  Global Sports does not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as
     rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors;
     or

  .  the effect of the merger on financial results is not consistent with the
     expectations of financial analysts or investors.

Ashford's directors have conflicts of interest that may have influenced them to
recommend the adoption of the merger agreement, and Ashford's officers may have
differing interests in the merger than the interests of Ashford stockholders
generally.

   The directors and officers of Ashford participate in arrangements and have
continuing indemnification against liabilities that provide them with interests
in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of
Ashford stockholders generally, including the following:

  .  The executive officers of Ashford have outstanding, as of September 30,
     2001, stock options to purchase an aggregate of 4,431,250 shares of
     Ashford common stock. Vesting of these options accelerates in full upon
     completion of the merger.

  .  The non-employee members of Ashford's board of directors have outstanding,
     as of September 30, 2001, stock options to purchase an aggregate of
     788,269 shares of Ashford common stock. Vesting of these options
     accelerates in full upon completion of the merger.

  .  Global Sports has agreed to keep in place all rights to indemnification
     existing in favor of the directors and officers of Ashford for their acts
     and omissions occurring prior to the effective time of the merger, as
     provided in Ashford's bylaws and in the indemnification agreements between
     Ashford and its directors and officers, for a period of six years from the
     effective time of the merger.

  .  Global Sports has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to maintain
     officers' and directors' liability insurance in specified amounts and for
     specified periods following the effective time of the merger, covering the
     directors and officers of Ashford for their acts and omissions occurring
     prior to the effective time of the merger.

   For the above reasons, the directors of Ashford could be more likely to vote
to approve the merger agreement and recommend its adoption by Ashford
stockholders, than if they did not hold these interests. Ashford stockholders
should consider whether these interests may have influenced Ashford's directors
to recommend, or Ashford's directors and officers to support, adoption of the
merger agreement.

Risks Relating to Global Sports

Global Sports' future success cannot be predicted based upon its limited
e-commerce operating history.

   Although Global Sports commenced operations in 1987, it did not initiate its
e-commerce business until the first quarter of 1999 and did not begin operating
its e-commerce business until the fourth quarter of 1999. Prior to the fourth
quarter of 1999, when it launched the e-commerce businesses it operates for its
partners, 100% of Global Sports' revenues had been generated by its
discontinued operations. The sale of the discontinued operations was completed
in May 2000. Accordingly, 100% of Global Sports' revenues are currently
generated through its e-commerce business. Based on Global Sports' limited
experience with its e-commerce business, it is difficult to predict whether
Global Sports will be successful. Thus, Global Sports' chances of financial and
operational success should be evaluated in light of the risks, uncertainties,
expenses, delays and difficulties associated with operating a business in a
relatively new and unproven market, many of which may be beyond its control.
Global Sports' failure to address these issues could have a material adverse
effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.

   Although Global Sports refers to the retailers, media companies and
professional sports organizations for which it develops and operates e-commerce
businesses as its "partners," Global Sports does not act as an agent or

legal representative for any of its partners. Global Sports does not have the
power or authority to legally bind any of its partners. Similarly, its partners
do not have the power or authority to legally bind Global Sports. In addition,
Global Sports does not have the types of liabilities for its partners that a
general partner of a partnership would have.

Global Sports expects increases in its operating expenses and continuing
losses.

   Global Sports incurred substantial losses in fiscal 1999, fiscal 2000 and
during the first six months of fiscal 2001, and as of June 30, 2001, it had an
accumulated deficit of $117.4 million. Global Sports has not achieved
profitability from its continuing operations. Global Sports may not obtain
enough customer traffic or a high enough volume of purchases from its partners'
e-commerce businesses to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability.
Global Sports could continue to incur operating and net losses. There can be no
assurances that Global Sports will be able to achieve profitability from its
continuing operations.

   Global Sports will continue to incur significant operating expenses and
capital expenditures as it:

  .  enhances its distribution and order fulfillment capabilities;

  .  further improves its order processing systems and capabilities;

  .  develops enhanced technologies and features to improve its partners'
     e-commerce businesses;

  .  enhances its customer service capabilities to better serve its customers'
     needs;

  .  increases its general and administrative functions to support its growing
     operations; and

  .  continues its sales and marketing activities.

   Because Global Sports will incur many of these expenses before it receives
any revenues from its efforts, its losses will be greater than the losses it
would incur if it developed its business more slowly. In addition, Global
Sports may find that these efforts are more expensive than it currently
anticipates, which would further increase its losses. Also, the timing of these
expenses may contribute to fluctuations in Global Sports' quarterly operating
results.

Prior to the recent expansion of Global Sports' relationship with
Bluelight.com, Global Sports' business had been limited to the sporting goods
industry. Through the proposed acquisition of Ashford, Global Sports intends to
expand its operations into the luxury goods industry. Global Sports may not be
able to successfully expand its operations into new industries.

   Until recently, Global Sports' business had been limited to the sporting
goods industry. Through the recent expansion of Global Sports' relationship
with Bluelight.com, Global Sports has begun to expand its operations into other
industries, including electronics and home products. Through the proposed
acquisition of Ashford, Global Sports intends to further expand its business
into the luxury goods industry. In order to successfully expand its business
into these industries, Global Sports must develop and maintain relationships
with manufacturers in these industries and hire and retain skilled personnel to
help manage these areas of its business. Global Sports' failure to successfully
expand its business into these industries could adversely affect its business,
results of operations and financial condition.

Global Sports' success is tied to the success of the retail industry and its
partners for which it operates e-commerce businesses.

   Global Sports' future success is substantially dependent upon the success of
the retail industry and its partners for which it operates e-commerce
businesses. From time to time, the retail industry has experienced downturns.
Any downturn in the retail industry could adversely affect Global Sports'
business. In addition, if Global Sports' partners were to have financial
difficulties or seek protection from their creditors, or if Global

Sports is unable to replace its partners or obtain new partners, it could
adversely affect Global Sports' business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Global Sports enters into contracts with its partners. If Global Sports does
not maintain good working relationships with its partners or perform as
required under these agreements it could adversely affect Global Sports'
business.

   The contracts between Global Sports and its partners establish new and
complex relationships between Global Sports and its partners. Global Sports
spends a significant amount of time and effort to maintain its relationships
with its partners and address the issues that from time to time may arise from
these new and complex relationships. If Global Sports does not maintain a good
working relationship with its partners or perform as required under these
agreements, its partners could seek to terminate the agreements prior to the
end of the term or they could decide not to renew the contracts at the end of
the term. This could adversely affect Global Sports' business, financial
condition and results of operations. Moreover, Global Sports' partners could
decide not to renew these contracts for reasons not related to Global Sports'
performance.

Global Sports' operating results are difficult to predict. If Global Sports
fails to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the
market price of its common stock may decline significantly.

   Global Sports' annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate
significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are
outside of Global Sports' control. Because Global Sports' operating results may
be volatile and difficult to predict, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of its
operating results may not be a good indication of its future performance. In
some future quarter, Global Sports' operating results may fall below the
expectations of securities analysts and investors. In this event, the trading
price of Global Sports common stock may decline significantly.

   Factors that may harm Global Sports' business or cause its operating results
to fluctuate include the following:

  .  its inability to retain existing partners or to obtain new partners;

  .  its inability to obtain new customers at a reasonable cost, retain
     existing customers or encourage repeat purchases;

  .  decreases in the number of visitors to the e-commerce businesses operated
     by Global Sports or the inability to convert these visitors into
     customers;

  .  its failure to offer an appealing mix of products, including sporting
     goods, apparel and footwear;

  .  its inability to adequately maintain, upgrade and develop its partners'
     Web sites, the systems used to process customers' orders and payments or
     its computer network;

  .  the ability of its competitors to offer new or superior e-commerce
     businesses, services or products;

  .  price competition that results in lower profit margins or losses;

  .  its inability to obtain specific products and brands or unwillingness of
     vendors to sell their products to Global Sports;

  .  unanticipated fluctuations in the amount of consumer spending on various
     products that Global Sports sells, which tend to be discretionary spending
     items;

  .  increases in the cost of advertising;

  .  increases in the amount and timing of operating costs and capital
     expenditures relating to expansion of Global Sports operations;

  .  unexpected increases in shipping costs or delivery times, particularly
     during the holiday season;

  .  technical difficulties, system security breaches, system downtime or
     Internet slowdowns;

  .  seasonality;

  .  its inability to manage inventory levels or control inventory theft;

  .  its inability to manage distribution operations or provide adequate levels
     of customer service;

  .  an increase in the level of Global Sports' product returns;

  .  government regulations related to use of the Internet for commerce; and

  .  unfavorable economic conditions specific to the Internet, e-commerce or
     the industries in which Global Sports operates.

Seasonal fluctuations in sales could cause wide fluctuations in Global Sports'
quarterly results.

   Global Sports expects to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenues.
These seasonal patterns will cause quarterly fluctuations in its operating
results. In particular, Global Sports expects that its fourth fiscal quarter
will account for a disproportionate percentage of its total annual revenues. In
anticipation of increased sales activity during its fourth fiscal quarter,
Global Sports may hire a significant number of temporary employees to bolster
its permanent staff and significantly increase its inventory levels. For this
reason, if Global Sports' revenues were below seasonal expectations during the
fourth fiscal quarter, its annual operating results could be below the
expectations of securities analysts and investors.

   Due to the limited operating history of its e-commerce business, it is
difficult to predict the seasonal pattern of Global Sports' sales and the
impact of this seasonality on its business and financial results. In the
future, Global Sports' seasonal sales patterns may become more pronounced, may
strain its personnel, product distribution and shipment activities and may
cause a shortfall in revenues as compared to expenses in a given period.

Global Sports has been unable to fund its e-commerce operations with the cash
generated from its business. If Global Sports does not generate cash sufficient
to fund its operations, Global Sports may in the future need additional
financing to continue its growth or its growth may be limited.

   Because Global Sports has not generated sufficient cash from operations to
date, it has funded its e-commerce operations primarily from the sale of equity
securities. Cash from revenues must increase significantly for Global Sports to
fund anticipated operating expenses internally. If Global Sports' cash flows
are insufficient to fund these expenses, Global Sports may in the future need
to fund its growth through additional debt or equity financings or reduce
costs. Further, Global Sports may not be able to obtain financing on
satisfactory terms. Its inability to finance its growth, either internally or
externally, may limit Global Sports' growth potential and its ability to
execute its business strategy. If Global Sports issues securities to raise
capital, its existing stockholders may experience additional dilution or the
new securities may have rights senior to those of its common stock.

Global Sports must develop and maintain relationships with key brand
manufacturers to obtain a sufficient assortment and quantity of quality
merchandise on acceptable commercial terms. If Global Sports is unable to do
so, it could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial
condition.

   Global Sports primarily purchases the products it offers directly from the
manufacturers of the products. If Global Sports is unable to develop and
maintain relationships with these manufacturers, Global Sports may be unable to
obtain or continue to carry a sufficient assortment and quantity of quality
merchandise on acceptable commercial terms and its business could be adversely
impacted. Global Sports does not have written contracts with most of its
manufacturers. Manufacturers could stop selling products to Global Sports and
may ask it to remove their products or logos from its partners' Web sites. In
some circumstances, Global Sports' partners

purchase products directly from manufacturers for sale on their Web sites. If
Global Sports or its partners are unable to obtain products directly from
manufacturers, especially popular brand manufacturers, Global Sports may not be
able to obtain the same or comparable merchandise in a timely manner or on
acceptable commercial terms. For example, Global Sports is currently not
authorized to offer some popular brands of sporting goods, such as Nike,
although Global Sports is authorized to sell the remaining Nike inventory held
by Fogdog, Inc. on the fogdog.com Web site. There can be no assurance that
Global Sports will be able to offer these brands in the future or that Global
Sports will continue to be able to offer brands it currently offers. If Global
Sports is unable to offer a sufficient assortment and quantity of quality
products at acceptable prices, Global Sports may lose sales and market share.

Capacity constraints or system failures could materially and adversely affect
Global Sports' business, results of operations and financial condition.

   Any system failure, including network, software or hardware failure, that
causes interruption of the availability of Global Sports' partners' Web sites
could result in decreased usage of these Web sites. If these failures are
sustained or repeated, they could reduce the attractiveness of Global Sports'
partners' Web sites to customers, vendors and advertisers. Global Sports'
operations are subject to damage or interruption from:

  .  fire, flood, earthquake or other natural disasters;

  .  power losses, interruptions or brown-outs;

  .  Internet, telecommunications or data network failures;

  .  physical and electronic break-ins or security breaches;

  .  computer viruses; and

  .  other similar events.

   Global Sports launched its first partners' e-commerce businesses in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1999. The limited time during which Global Sports has
been operating these businesses, as well as the inherent unpredictability of
the events described above, makes it difficult to predict whether the
occurrence of any of these events is likely. If any of these events do occur,
they could result in interruptions, delays or cessations in service to users of
Global Sports' partners' Web sites, which could have a material adverse effect
on Global Sports' business, results of operations and financial condition.

   In addition, Global Sports maintains its computers on which it operates its
partners' Web sites at the facility of a third-party hosting company. Global
Sports cannot control the maintenance and operation of this facility, which is
also susceptible to similar disasters and problems. Global Sports' insurance
policies may not adequately compensate it for any losses that it may incur. Any
system failure that causes an interruption in Global Sports' service or a
decrease in responsiveness could harm its relationships with its customers and
result in reduced revenues.

Global Sports may be unable to protect its proprietary technology or keep up
with that of its competitors.

   Global Sports' success depends to a significant degree upon the protection
of its software and other proprietary intellectual property rights. Global
Sports may be unable to deter misappropriation of its proprietary information,
detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce its intellectual
property rights. In addition, Global Sports' competitors could, without
violating its proprietary rights, develop technologies that are as good as or
better than Global Sports' technology.

   Global Sports' failure to protect its software and other proprietary
intellectual property rights or to develop technologies that are as good as its
competitors' could put it at a disadvantage to its competitors. In addition,
the failure of Global Sports' partners to protect their intellectual property
rights, including their domain names, could

impair its operations. These failures could have a material adverse effect on
Global Sports' business, results of operations and financial condition.

If Global Sports does not respond to rapid technological changes, its services
could become obsolete and it could lose customers.

   Global Sports may face material delays in introducing new services, products
and enhancements. If this happens, Global Sports' customers may forgo the use
of its partners' e-commerce businesses and use those of its competitors. To
remain competitive, Global Sports must continue to enhance and improve the
functionality and features of its partners' e-commerce businesses. The Internet
and the online commerce industry are rapidly changing. If competitors introduce
new products and services using new technologies or if new industry standards
and practices emerge, Global Sports' partners' existing Web sites and its
proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete.

   Developing Global Sports' partners' e-commerce businesses and other
proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks. Global
Sports may use new technologies ineffectively or it may fail to adapt its
partners' Web sites, its order processing systems and its computer network to
meet customer requirements or emerging industry standards.

Global Sports may be subject to intellectual property claims or competition or
trade practices claims that could be costly and could disrupt its business.

   Third parties may assert that Global Sports' business or technologies
infringe their intellectual property rights. From time to time, Global Sports
may receive notices from third parties questioning its right to present
specific images or logos on its partners' Web sites, or stating that Global
Sports has infringed their trademarks or copyrights. Global Sports may in the
future receive claims that it is engaging in unfair competition or other
illegal trade practices. Global Sports may be unsuccessful in defending against
these claims, which could result in substantial damages, fines or other
penalties. The resolution of a claim could also require Global Sports to change
how it does business, redesign its partners' Web sites and other systems or
enter into burdensome royalty or licensing agreements. These license or royalty
agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all,
in the event of a successful claim of infringement. Global Sports' insurance
coverage may not be adequate to cover every claim that third parties could
assert against it. Even unsuccessful claims could result in significant legal
fees and other expenses, diversion of management's time and disruptions in
Global Sports' business. Any of these claims could also harm Global Sports'
reputation.

Global Sports relies on its developing relationships with online services,
search engines, directories and other Web sites and e-commerce businesses to
drive traffic to the e-commerce businesses it operates. If Global Sports is
unable to develop or maintain these relationships, its business, financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

   Global Sports has relationships with online services, search engines,
directories and other Web sites and e-commerce businesses to provide content,
advertising banners and other links that link to its partners' Web sites.
Global Sports expects to rely on these relationships as significant sources of
traffic to its partners' Web sites and to generate new customers. If Global
Sports is unable to develop satisfactory relationships on acceptable terms,
Global Sports' ability to attract new customers could be harmed. Further, many
of the parties with which Global Sports may have online advertising
arrangements could provide advertising services for other marketers of goods
Global Sports provides. As a result, these parties may be reluctant to enter
into or maintain relationships with Global Sports. Failure to achieve
sufficient traffic or generate sufficient revenue from purchases originating
from third-parties may result in termination of these types of relationships.
Without these relationships, Global Sports may not be able to sufficiently
increase its market share and its business, financial condition and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

Global Sports' success is dependent upon its executive officers and other key
personnel.

   Global Sports' success depends to a significant degree upon the contribution
of its executive officers and other key personnel, particularly Michael G.
Rubin, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Global Sports has
employment agreements with some of its executive officers and key personnel.
Global Sports cannot be sure, however, that it will be able to retain or
attract executive, managerial and other key personnel. Global Sports has
obtained key person life insurance for Mr. Rubin in the amount of $9.0 million.
Global Sports has not obtained key person life insurance for any of its other
executive officers or key personnel.

Global Sports may be unable to hire and retain the skilled personnel necessary
to develop its business.

   Global Sports intends to continue to hire a number of skilled personnel.
Competition for these individuals is intense, and Global Sports may not be able
to attract, assimilate or retain highly qualified personnel in the future.
Global Sports' failure to attract and retain the highly trained personnel that
are integral to its business may limit its growth rate, which would harm its
business.

Global Sports may not be able to compete successfully against current and
future competitors, which could harm its margins and its business.

   The e-commerce market is rapidly evolving and extremely competitive.
Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced gross margins
and loss of market share, any of which could seriously harm Global Sports'
business, financial condition and results of operations. Global Sports competes
with a variety of companies, including:

  .  e-commerce businesses of specialty retailers and catalogs such as
     Footlocker.com and REI.com;

  .  e-commerce businesses of traditional general merchandise retailers such as
     Target.com and WalMart.com;

  .  e-commerce businesses of specialty manufacturers such as adidas.com and
     Nike.com; and

  .  e-commerce businesses that are associated with full-line sporting goods
     stores such as Shopsports.com.

   In addition, Global Sports competes with companies that may be able to
provide solutions to companies that wish to establish e-commerce businesses,
including:

  .  third party providers, such as Amazon.com and USA Networks; and

  .  third-party fulfillment and customer services providers, such as
     Fingerhut, Keystone Internet Services and ClientLogic.

   Finally, Global Sports competes with traditional channels of distribution
for its specialty goods, including full-line retailers, specialty retailers,
general merchandise retailers, catalogs and manufacturers' direct stores.

If Global Sports experiences problems in its fulfillment, warehouse and
distribution operations, it could lose customers.

   Although Global Sports operates its own fulfillment center, Global Sports
relies upon multiple third parties for the shipment of its products. Global
Sports also relies upon certain vendors to ship products directly to its
customers. As a result, Global Sports is subject to the risks associated with
the ability of these vendors to successfully and timely fulfill and ship
customer orders and to successfully handle its inventory delivery services to
meet its shipping needs. The failure of these vendors to provide these
services, or the termination or interruption of these services, could adversely
affect Global Sports' business, results of operations and financial condition.

Sporting goods and apparel are subject to changing consumer preferences. If
Global Sports fails to anticipate these changes, it could experience lower
sales, higher inventory markdowns and lower margins.

   Global Sports' success depends, in part, upon its ability to anticipate and
respond to trends in sporting goods merchandise and consumers' participation in
sports. Consumers' tastes in apparel and sporting goods equipment are subject
to frequent and significant changes, due in part to manufacturers' efforts to
incorporate advanced technologies into some types of sporting goods. In
addition, the level of consumer interest in a given sport can fluctuate
dramatically. If Global Sports fails to identify and respond to changes in
sporting goods merchandising and recreational sports participation, its sales
could suffer and it could be required to mark down unsold inventory. This would
depress Global Sports' profit margins. In addition, any failure to keep pace
with changes in consumers' recreational sports habits could result in lost
opportunities which could have an adverse effect on Global Sports' business,
results of operations and financial condition.

High merchandise returns could adversely affect Global Sports' business,
financial condition and results of operations.

   Global Sports' policy for allowing its customers to return products is
generally consistent with the policies of each of Global Sports' partners for
which it operates e-commerce businesses. If merchandise returns are
significant, Global Sports' business, financial condition and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

Global Sports may be subject to product liability claims that could be costly
and time-consuming.

   Global Sports sells products manufactured by third parties, some of which
may be defective. If any product that Global Sports sells were to cause
physical injury or injury to property, the injured party or parties could bring
claims against Global Sports as the retailer of the product. Global Sports'
insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover every claim that could be
asserted. Similarly, Global Sports could be subject to claims that users of its
partners' Web sites were harmed due to their reliance on its product
information, product selection guides, advice or instructions. If a successful
claim were brought against Global Sports in excess of its insurance coverage,
it could adversely affect Global Sports' business. Even unsuccessful claims
could result in the expenditure of funds and management time and could have a
negative impact on Global Sports' business.

Global Sports may be liable if third parties misappropriate its customers'
personal information.

   If third parties are able to penetrate Global Sports' network security or
otherwise misappropriate its customers' personal information or credit card
information or if Global Sports gives third parties improper access to its
customers' personal information or credit card information, Global Sports could
be subject to liability. This liability could include claims for unauthorized
purchases with credit card information, impersonation or other similar fraud
claims. They could also include claims for other misuses of personal
information, including unauthorized marketing purposes. These claims could
result in litigation. Liability for misappropriation of this information could
adversely affect Global Sports' business. In addition, the Federal Trade
Commission and state agencies have been investigating various Internet
companies regarding their use of personal information. Global Sports could
incur additional expenses if new regulations regarding the use of personal
information are introduced or if government agencies investigate Global Sports'
privacy practices.

Global Sports is controlled by certain principal stockholders.

   As of September 1, 2001, Michael G. Rubin, Global Sports' Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned 19.1%, funds
affiliated with SOFTBANK America Inc., or SOFTBANK, beneficially owned 23.4%
and Interactive Technology Holdings, LLC, or ITH, a joint venture company
formed by Comcast Corporation and QVC, Inc., beneficially owned 24.3% of Global
Sports' outstanding common stock. Should they decide to act together, Mr.
Rubin, SOFTBANK and ITH would be in a position to exercise control over most
matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election or removal of
directors, approval of significant

corporate transactions and the ability generally to direct Global Sports'
affairs. Furthermore, the stock purchase agreements pursuant to which SOFTBANK
and ITH acquired their shares of Global Sports common stock provide that
SOFTBANK and ITH each have the right to designate up to two members of Global
Sports' board of directors. This concentration of ownership and SOFTBANK's and
ITH's right to designate members to Global Sports' board of directors may have
the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Global Sports,
including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium
over current market prices for their shares.

From time to time, Global Sports may acquire or invest in other companies.
There are risks associated with potential acquisitions and investments. As a
result, Global Sports may not achieve the expected benefits of potential
acquisitions.

   If Global Sports is presented with appropriate opportunities, it may make
investments in complementary companies, products or technologies or it may
purchase other companies. Global Sports may not realize the anticipated
benefits of any investment or acquisition. Global Sports may not be able to
successfully assimilate the additional personnel, operations, acquired
technology and products into its business. Any acquisition may further strain
its existing financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and
procedures. In addition, key personnel of the acquired company may decide not
to work for Global Sports. These difficulties could disrupt Global Sports'
ongoing business, distract its management and employees or increase its
expenses. Further, the physical expansion in facilities that would occur as a
result of any acquisition may result in disruptions that seriously impair
Global Sports' business. Finally, Global Sports may have to incur debt or issue
equity securities to pay for any acquisitions or investments, the issuance of
which could be dilutive to its stockholders.

Global Sports may expand its business internationally, causing its business to
become increasingly susceptible to numerous international business risks and
challenges that could affect its profitability.

   Global Sports believes that the current globalization of the economy
requires businesses to consider pursuing international expansion. In the
future, Global Sports may expand into international markets. International
sales are subject to inherent risks and challenges that could adversely affect
Global Sports' profitability, including:

  .  the need to develop new supplier and manufacturer relationships,
     particularly because major manufacturers may require that Global Sports'
     international operations deal with local distributors;

  .  unexpected changes in international regulatory requirements and tariffs;

  .  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;

  .  longer payment cycles from credit card companies;

  .  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection;

  .  potential adverse tax consequences;

  .  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currency; and

  .  difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses.

   To the extent Global Sports generates international sales in the future, any
negative impact on its international business could negatively impact its
business, operating results and financial condition as a whole. In particular,
gains and losses on the conversion of foreign payments into United States
dollars may contribute to fluctuations in Global Sports' results of operations
and fluctuating exchange rates could cause reduced gross revenues and/or gross
margins from non-dollar-denominated international sales.

Global Sports' success is tied to the continued growth in the use of the
Internet and the adequacy of the Internet infrastructure.

   Global Sports' future success is substantially dependent upon continued
growth in the use of the Internet. The number of users and advertisers on the
Internet may not increase and commerce over the Internet may not become more
accepted and widespread for a number of reasons, including:

  .  actual or perceived lack of security of information or privacy protection;

  .  lack of access and ease of use;

  .  congestion of traffic on the Internet;

  .  inconsistent quality of service and lack of availability of
     cost-effective, high-speed service;

  .  possible disruptions, computer viruses or other damage to the Internet
     servers or to users' computers;

  .  excessive governmental regulation;

  .  uncertainty regarding intellectual property ownership; and

  .  lack of high-speed modems and other communications equipment.

   Published reports have also indicated that growth in the use of the Internet
has resulted in users experiencing delays, transmission errors and other
difficulties. As currently configured, the Internet may not support an increase
in the number or requirements of users. In addition, there have been outages
and delays on the Internet as a result of damage to the current infrastructure.
The amount of traffic on Global Sports' partners' Web sites could be materially
affected if there are outages or delays in the future. The use of the Internet
may also decline if there are delays in the development or adoption of
modifications by third parties that are required to support increased levels of
activity on the Internet. If any of the foregoing occurs, or if the Internet
does not become a viable commercial medium, Global Sports' business, results of
operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In
addition, Global Sports may be required to spend significant capital to adapt
its operations to any new or emerging technologies relating to the Internet.

The technology of the Internet is changing rapidly and could render the Web
sites which Global Sports operates obsolete.

   The technology of the Internet and e-commerce is evolving rapidly for many
reasons, including:

  .  customers frequently changing their requirements and preferences;

  .  competitors frequently introducing new products and services; and

  .  industry associations and others creating new industry standards and
     practices.

   These changes could render the Web sites that Global Sports operates
obsolete. Global Sports' ability to attract customers could be seriously
impaired if it does not accomplish the following tasks:

  .  continually enhance and improve its partners' Web sites;

  .  identify, select and obtain leading technologies useful in its business;
     and

  .  respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards in a
     cost-effective and timely manner.

Customers may be unwilling to use the Internet to purchase goods.

   Global Sports' long-term future depends heavily upon the general public's
willingness to use the Internet as a means to purchase goods. The failure of
the Internet to develop into an effective commercial tool would seriously
damage Global Sports' future operations. E-commerce is a relatively new
concept, and large numbers

of customers may not begin or continue to use the Internet to purchase goods.
The demand for and acceptance of products sold over the Internet are highly
uncertain, and most e-commerce businesses have a short track record. If
consumers are unwilling to use the Internet to conduct business, Global Sports'
business may not develop profitably. The Internet may not succeed as a medium
of commerce because of delays in developing elements of the needed Internet
infrastructure, such as a reliable network, high-speed modems, high-speed
communication lines and other enabling technologies.

The security risks of e-commerce may discourage customers from purchasing goods
from Global Sports.

   In order for the e-commerce market to develop successfully, Global Sports
and other market participants must be able to transmit confidential information
securely over public networks. Third parties may have the technology or
know-how to breach the security of customer transaction data. Any breach could
cause customers to lose confidence in the security of Global Sports' partners'
Web sites and choose not to purchase from those Web sites. If someone is able
to circumvent Global Sports' security measures, he or she could destroy or
steal valuable information or disrupt the operation of Global Sports' partners'
Web sites. Concerns about the security and privacy of transactions over the
Internet could inhibit the growth of the Internet and e-commerce. Global
Sports' security measures may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining
improper access to the information on its partners' Web sites. Any security
breach could expose Global Sports to risks of loss, litigation and liability
and could seriously disrupt its operations.

Credit card fraud could adversely affect Global Sports' business.

   Global Sports does not carry insurance against the risk of credit card
fraud, so the failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions
could increase Global Sports' general and administrative expenses. Global
Sports has put in place technology to help it detect the fraudulent use of
credit card information. To date, Global Sports has not suffered material
losses related to credit card fraud. However, Global Sports may in the future
suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data
even though the associated financial institution approved payment of the
orders. Under current credit card practices, Global Sports is liable for
fraudulent credit card transactions because it does not obtain a cardholder's
signature.

If one or more states successfully assert that Global Sports should collect
sales or other taxes on the sale of Global Sports' merchandise, its business
could be harmed.

   Global Sports does not currently collect sales or other similar taxes for
physical shipments of goods into states other than Kentucky and Pennsylvania.
One or more local, state or foreign jurisdictions may seek to impose sales tax
collection obligations on Global Sports and other out-of-state companies that
engage in online commerce. Global Sports' business could be adversely affected
if one or more states or any foreign country successfully asserts that Global
Sports should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of its merchandise.

Existing or future government regulation could harm Global Sports' business.

   Global Sports is subject to the same federal, state and local laws as other
companies conducting business on the Internet. Today there are relatively few
laws specifically directed towards conducting business on the Internet.
However, due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet, many laws
and regulations relating to the Internet are being debated at the state and
federal levels. These laws and regulations could cover issues such as user
privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, fraud, quality of products and
services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights and information
security. Applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing issues such
as property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual property issues,
taxation, libel, obscenity and personal privacy could also harm Global Sports'
business. For example, United States and foreign laws regulate Global Sports'
ability to use customer information and to develop, buy and sell mailing lists.
The vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the
Internet, and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised thereby.
Those laws that do reference the Internet, such as the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act, are only

beginning to be interpreted by the courts and their applicability and reach are
therefore uncertain. These current and future laws and regulations could
adversely affect Global Sports' future business, results of operation and
financial condition.

Laws or regulations relating to user information and online privacy may
adversely affect the growth of Global Sports' Internet business or its
marketing efforts.

   Global Sports is subject to increasing regulation at the federal and state
levels relating to online privacy and the use of personal user information.
Several states have proposed legislation that would limit the uses of personal
user information gathered online or require online services to establish
privacy policies. The Federal Trade Commission has adopted regulations
regarding the collection and use of personal identifying information obtained
from children under 13. In addition, bills pending in Congress would extend
online privacy protections to adults. Laws and regulations of this kind may
include requirements that Global Sports establish procedures to disclose and
notify users of privacy and security policies, obtain consent from users for
collection and use of information, or provide users with the ability to access,
correct and delete personal information stored by Global Sports. Even in the
absence of those regulations, the Federal Trade Commission has settled several
proceedings resulting in consent decrees in which Internet companies have been
required to establish programs regarding the manner in which personal
information is collected from users and provided to third parties. Global
Sports could become a party to a similar enforcement proceeding. These
regulatory and enforcement efforts could also harm Global Sports' ability to
collect demographic and personal information from users, which could be costly
or adversely affect its marketing efforts.

Global Sports has never paid dividends on its common stock and does not
anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.

   Global Sports has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and does not
anticipate that any cash dividends will be declared or paid in the foreseeable
future.

It may be difficult for a third party to acquire Global Sports and this could
depress Global Sports' stock price.

   Pursuant to Global Sports' amended and restated certificate of
incorporation, Global Sports has authorized a class of 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, which Global Sports' board of directors may issue with terms,
rights, preferences and designations as the board may determine and without any
vote of the stockholders, unless otherwise required by law. Issuing the
preferred stock, depending upon the terms, rights, preferences and designations
set by Global Sports' board, may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of
Global Sports. Issuing additional shares of common stock could result in
dilution of the voting power of the current holders of Global Sports common
stock. In addition, "anti-takeover" provisions of Delaware law may restrict the
ability of the stockholders to approve a merger or business combination or
obtain control of Global Sports.

There are limitations on the liabilities of Global Sports' directors.

   Pursuant to Global Sports' amended and restated certificate of incorporation
and under Delaware law, Global Sports' directors are not liable to Global
Sports or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty,
except for liability for breach of a director's duty of loyalty, acts or
omissions by a director not in good faith or which involve intentional
misconduct or a knowing violation of law, for dividend payments or stock
repurchases that are unlawful under Delaware law or any transaction in which a
director has derived an improper personal benefit. In addition, Global Sports
has entered into indemnification agreements with each of its directors. These
agreements, among other things, require Global Sports to indemnify each
director for certain expenses including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and
settlement amounts incurred by any such person in any action or proceeding,
including any action by Global Sports or in Global Sports' right, arising out
of the person's services as one of Global Sports' directors.

Risks Relating to Ashford

Ashford may be unable to meet its future capital requirements.

   If Ashford's current cash and cash that may be generated from future
operations are insufficient to satisfy its liquidity requirements, Ashford may
seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain additional
credit facilities from lenders. Ashford cannot be certain that financing will
be available to Ashford on favorable terms when required, or at all. If Ashford
raises funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities,
the securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of
the rights of Ashford common stock and its stockholders may experience
dilution. Ashford requires substantial working capital to fund its business.
Since its inception, Ashford has experienced negative cash flow from operations
and expects to experience negative cash flow from operations in the future.
Accordingly, there is substantial doubt as to Ashford's ability to continue as
a going concern. Ashford believes it has sufficient funds for its anticipated
needs for working capital and capital expenditures through at least the end of
the next fiscal year. After that, Ashford may need to raise additional funds.

Ashford's limited operating history makes forecasting difficult. Because most
of Ashford's expenses are fixed based on planned operating results, failure to
accurately forecast revenue could cause net losses in a given quarter to be
greater than expected.

   Ashford was incorporated in March 1998 and began selling products on its Web
site in April 1998. Accordingly, Ashford has an extremely limited operating
history upon which to base an evaluation of its business and prospects.
Ashford's business and prospects must be considered in light of the risks,
expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early
stage of development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving
markets such as online commerce. As a result of its limited operating history,
it is difficult to accurately forecast Ashford's net sales and Ashford has
limited meaningful historical financial data upon which to base planned
operating expenses. Ashford bases its current and future expense levels on its
operating plans and estimates of future net sales, and its expenses are to a
large extent fixed. Sales and operating results are difficult to forecast
because they generally depend on the volume and timing of the orders Ashford
receives, which is uncertain. As a result, Ashford may be unable to adjust its
spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall.
This inability could cause Ashford's net losses in a given quarter to be
greater than expected.

Ashford anticipates future losses and negative cash flow, which may limit or
delay Ashford's ability to become profitable.

   Since its formation, Ashford has made significant expenditures on its
technology, Web site development, advertising, hiring of personnel and startup
costs. As a result, Ashford has incurred losses since its inception and expects
to experience negative cash flow during future periods. Ashford expects to
incur additional costs and expenses related to:

  .  brand development, marketing and other promotional activities;

  .  the continued maintenance and development of its Web site, the systems and
     staff that process customer orders and payments and its computer network;

  .  the expansion of its product offerings and Web site content; and

  .  development of relationships with strategic business partners.

   Ashford's ability to become profitable depends on its ability to generate
and sustain substantially higher net sales while maintaining reasonable expense
levels, both of which are uncertain. If Ashford does achieve profitability,
Ashford cannot be certain that it would be able to sustain or increase
profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. See "Ashford
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations."

Ashford's operating results are volatile and difficult to predict. If Ashford
fails to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the
market price of Ashford common stock may decline significantly.

   Ashford's quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past, and
Ashford expects both its quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate
significantly in the future. Because its operating results are volatile and
difficult to predict, Ashford believes that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of
its operating results are not a good indication of its future performance. In
some future quarter, Ashford's operating results may fall below the
expectations of securities analysts and investors. In this event, the trading
price of Ashford common stock may decline significantly. The following are
material factors that may harm Ashford's business or cause its operating
results to fluctuate:

  .  its inability to obtain new customers at reasonable cost, retain existing
     customers or encourage repeat purchases;

  .  seasonality;

  .  its inability to manage inventory levels or control inventory theft;

  .  its inability to manage its fulfillment operations;

  .  its inability to adequately maintain, upgrade and develop its Web site,
     the systems that Ashford uses to process customer orders and payments or
     its computer network;

  .  the ability of its competitors to offer new or enhanced Web sites,
     services or products;

  .  its inability to obtain product lines from its suppliers;

  .  the availability and pricing of merchandise from vendors; and

  .  increases in the cost of online or offline advertising.

   A number of factors will cause Ashford's gross margins to fluctuate in
future periods, including the mix of corporate sales to traditional retail
sales, the mix of products Ashford sells, inventory management, marketing and
supply decisions, inbound and outbound shipping and handling costs, the level
of product returns and the level of discount pricing and promotional coupon
usage. Any change in one or more of these factors could reduce Ashford's gross
margins in future periods. See "Ashford Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

Ashford common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market.

   On April 9, 2001, Ashford received notice from Nasdaq that its common stock
had failed to maintain Nasdaq's minimum bid price closing requirement of $1.00
and that such failure had continued beyond the 90 day probationary period
allowed under the Nasdaq National Marketplace Rules. The letter specified that,
as a result of Ashford's failure to maintain the minimum bid price closing
requirement, its common stock would be delisted at the close of business on
July 18, 2001. However, Ashford appealed the decision, and the delisting was
stayed pending a hearing before the Nasdaq Qualifications Panel.

   On September 11, 2001, Ashford received notice from Nasdaq that Ashford did
not comply with the market value of the public float requirement set forth in
the Nasdaq National Marketplace Rules.

   On September 27, 2001, Nasdaq announced that in response to the
extraordinary market conditions following the events of September 11, 2001,
Nasdaq was implementing a moratorium on the minimum bid and public float
requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq. These requirements were suspended
until January 2, 2002.

   On August 27, 2001 Ashford held its annual meeting, in which its
stockholders approved a 1-for-10 reverse stock split that was to be implemented
on October 15, 2001. As the meeting was held prior to the moratorium

announced by Nasdaq, Ashford believed that the reverse stock split was the most
effective means to avoid a delisting of its common stock from Nasdaq.

   Ashford's board of directors has delayed implementing the reverse stock
split because of the proposed merger and Nasdaq's recent suspension of the
listing requirements. If the merger does not occur and Ashford's common stock
continues to trade on the Nasdaq National Market, Ashford may have to implement
the reverse stock split if the moratorium is revoked and the listing
requirements are reinstated.

   Ashford cannot predict whether the reverse stock split, if ultimately
implemented, would increase the market price for its common stock. The history
of similar stock split combinations for companies in like circumstances is
varied. There is no assurance that the market price per share of Ashford common
stock following the reverse stock split would either exceed or remain in excess
of the $1.00 minimum bid price as required by Nasdaq or that Ashford will
otherwise meet the requirements of Nasdaq for continued inclusion for trading
on Nasdaq. A reverse stock split could negatively impact the value of Ashford's
stock by allowing additional downward pressure on the stock price as its
relative value per share becomes greater following the reverse split. That is
to say, the stock, at its new, higher price, has farther to fall and therefore
more room for investors to short or otherwise trade the value of the stock
downward. Similarly, a delisting may negatively impact the value of the stock
as stocks trading on the over-the-counter market are typically less liquid and
trade with larger variations between the bid and ask price.

   The market price of Ashford common stock will also be based on Ashford's
performance and other factors, some of which are unrelated to the number of
shares outstanding. If the reverse stock split is effected and the market price
of Ashford common stock declines, the percentage decline as an absolute number
and as a percentage of Ashford's overall market capitalization may be greater
than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split. Furthermore,
liquidity of Ashford common stock could be adversely affected by the reduced
number of shares that would be outstanding after the reverse stock split.

Ashford expects to experience seasonal fluctuations in its net sales, which
will cause Ashford's quarterly results to fluctuate and could cause Ashford's
annual results to be below expectations.

   Ashford expects to experience significant seasonal fluctuations in its net
sales that will cause quarterly fluctuations in its operating results. In
particular, Ashford realized approximately 40%, 50% and 40% of its net sales
for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, during the fourth calendar
quarter, primarily due to gift purchases made during the holiday season.
Ashford expects this trend to continue in the future. However, given the
current economic environment and the potential negative impact this environment
may have on luxury goods sales, Ashford cannot be certain that sales during the
fourth calendar quarter of 2001 will meet or exceed sales in prior comparable
quarters.

   Due to its limited operating history, it is difficult to predict the
seasonal pattern of Ashford's sales and the impact of seasonality on its
business and financial results. In the future, Ashford's seasonal sales
patterns may become more pronounced, may strain its personnel and warehousing
and order shipment activities and may cause a shortfall in net sales as
compared to expenses in a given period. See "Ashford Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

If Ashford is unable to purchase or continue to purchase products directly from
the brand owners, Ashford's net sales could decrease.

   A significant portion of Ashford's units sold are purchased directly from
the brand owners. Ashford is negotiating with some of the remaining brand
owners to purchase those brands directly, in all product categories. Ashford
believes that purchasing directly from the brand owners will provide Ashford
with a more predictable supply of products, as well as a lower cost of goods.
As a result, Ashford believes that part of its success is contingent on
attaining or maintaining its ability to buy directly from the brand owners. If
Ashford loses or does not improve its ability to buy directly from the brand
owners, its net sales or margins may decrease.

Ashford's ability to meet consumer demand is in part dependent upon the
availability of products purchased indirectly from sources other than the brand
owners. If Ashford is unable to obtain popular products through indirect
sources, Ashford's net sales will decline.

   Ashford purchases brands indirectly from distributors and other third
parties that Ashford does not purchase directly from the brand owners. The
availability of products purchased indirectly depends on many factors,
including consumer demand, manufacturer production and fashion trends. Since
there are no guarantees that Ashford will be able to obtain a sufficient supply
of products indirectly from third-party distributors and other suppliers,
customer demand may, at times, exceed Ashford's supply of those products. If
this occurs, Ashford could lose customers and its net sales would decline. In
addition, the luxury goods brand owners could establish procedures to limit or
control Ashford's ability to purchase products indirectly and several brand
owners in the U.S. have distinctive legal rights rendering them the only legal
importer of their respective brands into the U.S. In the event Ashford acquires
such products indirectly from distributors and other third parties who may not
have complied with applicable customs laws and regulations, such goods can be
subject to seizure from Ashford's inventory by U.S. Customs, and the importer
may have a civil action for damages against Ashford. As it is often difficult
to ascertain the original circumstances of importation of certain goods offered
to Ashford by its distributors and other third parties, this could impact
Ashford's ability to obtain sufficient quantities of popular luxury goods, such
as watches, and cause customer dissatisfaction.

If Ashford is unable to obtain sufficient quantities of popular luxury and
premium products, Ashford's net sales could decrease.

   If Ashford is not able to offer its customers a sufficient supply and
selection of products in a timely manner, Ashford could lose customers and its
net sales could be below expectations. Ashford's success depends on its ability
to purchase products in sufficient quantities at competitive prices,
particularly for the holiday shopping season. As is common in the industry,
Ashford generally does not have long-term or exclusive arrangements with brand
owners, distributors or brokers that guarantee the availability of products for
resale.

   In the luxury goods market, a product or fashion style periodically becomes
intensely popular. From time to time, Ashford may have trouble obtaining
sufficient product allocations of particularly popular brands. In addition,
Ashford believes that some of its suppliers may establish their own online
retailing efforts, which may impact Ashford's ability to get sufficient product
allocations from suppliers. In several cases, the brands that Ashford wishes to
carry have delayed establishing a relationship with Ashford until they have
their own Web site up and running. In other cases, the brand owners distribute
only a small amount of product and rely partially on the scarcity of that
product to provide a merchandising mystique. It is unlikely that Ashford will
obtain products for its Web site from brands who follow the scarcity mystique,
and there is no assurance that Ashford will actually obtain relationships
within all sectors that Ashford has planned to offer. Therefore, Ashford does
not have a predictable or guaranteed supply of products.

Because Ashford carries almost all of the products it sells in inventory, if it
is unable to accurately predict and plan for changes in consumer demand, its
net sales and gross margins may decrease.

   At June 30, 2001, Ashford held approximately $18.4 million of products in
inventory. The rapidly changing trends in consumer tastes in the market for
luxury and premium products subjects Ashford to significant inventory risks. It
is critical to Ashford's success that it accurately predicts these trends and
does not overstock unpopular products. The demand for specific products can
change between the time the products are ordered and the date of receipt.
Ashford is particularly exposed to this risk because Ashford derives a majority
of its net sales in the fourth calendar quarter of each year. Ashford's failure
to sufficiently stock popular products in advance of the fourth calendar
quarter would harm its operating results for the entire fiscal year. In the
event that one or more products do not achieve widespread consumer acceptance,
Ashford may be required to take significant inventory markdowns, which could
reduce its net sales and gross margins. This risk may be greatest in the first
calendar quarter of each year, after Ashford has significantly increased
inventory levels for the holiday season. Ashford

believes that this risk will increase as it begins to offer additional luxury
items due to its lack of experience in purchasing these items. In addition, to
the extent that demand for Ashford's products increases over time, Ashford may
be forced to increase inventory levels. Any increase would subject Ashford to
additional inventory risks.

If Ashford experiences significant inventory theft, its gross profit margin
would decrease.

   Although immaterial to date, in the past Ashford has experienced theft of
merchandise shipments in route from its facility to its customers. In the
future, Ashford expects that it may also experience theft of merchandise while
it is being held in Ashford's fulfillment facility. Ashford has worked with its
shipping carriers and has taken steps aimed at preventing theft. If these steps
are inadequate or if security measures fail at Ashford's fulfillment facility,
Ashford could incur significant inventory theft, which could cause gross profit
margins and results of operations to decrease significantly.

Sales of luxury goods are particularly susceptible to general economic
downturns. If general economic conditions deteriorate, Ashford's sales could
suffer.

   Purchases of luxury products are typically discretionary for consumers and
may be particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy. The
success of Ashford's operations depends to a significant extent on a number of
factors relating to discretionary consumer spending and affecting disposable
consumer income, such as employment, wages and salaries, business conditions,
interest rates, exchange rates, availability of credit and taxation. In
addition, because the purchase of luxury products is relatively discretionary,
any reduction in disposable income in general, and the current economic climate
in particular, may affect Ashford more significantly than companies in other
industries.

To manage Ashford's growth and expansion, Ashford needs to improve and
implement financial and managerial controls and improve Ashford's reporting
systems and procedures. If Ashford is unable to do so successfully, Ashford may
not be able to manage growth effectively and Ashford's operating results would
be harmed.

   Ashford's rapid growth in personnel and operations has placed, and will
continue to place, a significant strain on its management, information systems
and resources. In order to manage this growth effectively, Ashford needs to
continue to improve Ashford's financial and managerial controls and reporting
systems and procedures. Any inability of its management to integrate additional
companies, employees, customer databases, merchandise lines, categories of
merchandise, technology advances, fulfillment systems and customer service into
operations and to eliminate unnecessary duplication, may have a materially
adverse effect on Ashford's business, financial condition and results of
operations.

If Ashford is unable to successfully expand its accounting and financial
reporting systems, its stock price could decline.

   Ashford continues to expand its financial and management information systems
to accommodate new data. If Ashford fails to successfully implement and
integrate its new financial reporting and management information systems with
its existing systems, or if Ashford is not able to expand these systems to
accommodate its growth, Ashford may not have adequate, accurate or timely
financial information. Ashford's failure to have adequate, accurate or timely
financial information would hinder its ability to manage its business and
operating results. If Ashford continues to grow rapidly, Ashford will face
additional challenges in upgrading and maintaining its financial and reporting
systems.

Ashford may not be able to compete successfully against current and future
competitors.

   Ashford expects competition in the online sale of luxury and premium
products to intensify in the future. Increased competition is likely to result
in price pressure, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of

which could seriously harm Ashford's net sales and operating results. In
addition, the luxury goods industry is intensely competitive. Ashford currently
or potentially competes with a variety of other companies, including:

  .  traditional retailers of luxury and premium products;

  .  brand owners of the products Ashford sells;

  .  other online retailers of luxury and premium products; and

  .  catalog retailers.

   Many of Ashford's competitors have advantages over it, including longer
operating histories, greater brand recognition and significantly greater
financial, sales and marketing and other resources. In addition, traditional
store-based retailers offer customers benefits that are not obtainable over the
Internet, such as enabling customers to physically inspect a product before
purchase and not incurring costs associated with maintaining a Web site.

If Ashford is unable to build awareness of the Ashford.com brand, it may not be
able to compete effectively against competitors with greater name recognition
and its sales could be adversely affected.

   If Ashford is unable to economically achieve or maintain a leading position
in online commerce or to promote and maintain its brand, its business, results
of operations and financial condition could suffer. Ashford believes that the
importance of brand recognition will increase as more companies engage in
commerce over the Internet. Development and awareness of Ashford's brand will
depend largely on its success in increasing its customer base. If the leading
brand owners do not perceive Ashford as an effective marketing and sales
channel for their merchandise, or consumers do not perceive Ashford as offering
a desirable way to purchase merchandise, Ashford may be unsuccessful in
promoting and maintaining its brand.

If Ashford enters new business categories that do not achieve market
acceptance, Ashford's brand and reputation could be damaged and Ashford could
fail to attract new customers.

   If Ashford launches or acquires a new department or product category that is
not favorably received by consumers, its brand or reputation could be damaged.
This damage could impair Ashford's ability to attract new customers, which
could cause its net sales to fall below expectations. An expansion of Ashford's
business to include other luxury goods will require significant additional
expenses, and strain Ashford's management, financial and operational resources.
This type of expansion would also subject Ashford to increased inventory risk.
Ashford may choose to expand its operations by developing other new departments
or product categories, promoting new or complementary products, expanding the
breadth and depth of products and services offered or expanding its market
presence through relationships with third parties. In addition, Ashford may
pursue the acquisition of other new or complementary businesses, products or
technologies.

If Ashford's strategy to sell products outside of the United States is not
successful, Ashford's increases in operating expenses may not be offset by
increased sales.

   If Ashford is not able to successfully market, sell and distribute its
products in foreign markets, or if certain risks and uncertainties of doing
business in foreign markets prove insurmountable, then these factors could have
a material adverse effect on Ashford's future global operations, and
consequently, on its operating margins. Ashford does not currently have any
overseas fulfillment or distribution facility or arrangement or any Web site
content localized for foreign markets, and Ashford cannot be certain that it
will be able to establish a global presence. In addition, there are certain
risks inherent in doing business on a global level, including:

  .  regulatory requirements;

  .  export restrictions;

  .  tariffs and other trade barriers;

  .  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;

  .  difficulties in protecting intellectual property rights;

  .  longer payment cycles;

  .  problems in collecting accounts receivable;

  .  political instability;

  .  fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and

  .  potentially adverse tax consequences.

If Ashford experiences problems with its third-party shipping services, Ashford
could lose customers.

   Ashford relies upon third-party carriers, primarily Federal Express and UPS,
for product shipments, including shipments to and from its warehouse. Ashford
is therefore subject to the risks, including employee strikes and inclement
weather, associated with these carriers' ability to provide delivery services
to meet its shipping needs. In addition, failure to deliver products to
Ashford's customers in a timely manner would damage its reputation and brand.

Ashford's operating results depend on Ashford's internally developed Web site,
network infrastructure and transaction-processing systems. If Ashford does not
successfully maintain Ashford's Web site and the systems that process customer
orders, Ashford could lose customers and net sales could be reduced.

   The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of Ashford's Web
site, transaction-processing systems and network infrastructure are critical to
its operating results, as well as to Ashford's ability to attract and retain
customers and maintain adequate customer service levels. Any system
interruptions that result in the unavailability of Ashford's Web site or
reduced performance of the transaction systems would reduce the volume of sales
and the attractiveness of Ashford's service offerings. This would seriously
harm Ashford's business, operating results and financial condition.

   Ashford uses internally developed systems for its Web site and substantially
all aspects of transaction processing, including customer profiling and order
verifications. Ashford has experienced periodic systems interruptions due to
server failure, which it believes will continue to occur from time to time. If
the volume of traffic on Ashford's Web site or the number of purchases made by
customers increases by more than two times its current holiday sales levels,
Ashford will need to further expand and upgrade its technology, transaction
processing systems and network infrastructure. Ashford has experienced and
expects to continue to experience temporary capacity constraints due to sharply
increased traffic during sales or other promotions, which cause unanticipated
system disruptions, slower response times, degradation in levels of customer
service, impaired quality and delays in reporting accurate financial
information.

   If Ashford fails to maintain its Web site or toll-free call center in order
to accommodate increased traffic, Ashford may lose customers, which would
reduce its net sales. Furthermore, if Ashford fails to maintain the computer
systems that Ashford uses to process and ship customer orders and process
payments, Ashford may not be able to successfully fulfill customer orders. As a
result, Ashford could lose customers and its net sales could be reduced. In
addition, Ashford's failure to maintain or upgrade its Web site or these
computer systems without system downtime would further reduce its net sales.
Ashford may experience difficulty in improving and maintaining its systems if
its employees or contractors that develop or maintain its computer systems
become unavailable to Ashford. Ashford has experienced periodic systems
interruptions, which Ashford believes will continue to occur, while enhancing
and expanding these computer systems.

Ashford's facilities and systems are vulnerable to natural disasters and other
unexpected problems. The occurrence of a natural disaster or other unexpected
problem could damage Ashford's reputation and brand and reduce Ashford's net
sales.

   The occurrence of a natural disaster or unanticipated problems at Ashford's
leased or offsite hosting facilities that house substantially all of its
computer and communications hardware systems could cause

interruptions or delays in Ashford's business, destroy data or render Ashford
unable to accept and fulfill customer orders. Any of these interruptions or
delays at these facilities would reduce Ashford's net sales. In addition,
Ashford's systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from
fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, earthquake and
similar events. Ashford has not established specific procedures for handling
damage or interruptions caused by these events and its business interruption
insurance may not adequately compensate Ashford for losses that may occur. In
addition, the failure by the third-party facility to provide the data
communications capacity required by Ashford, as a result of human error,
natural disaster or other operational disruptions, could interrupt its service.
The occurrence of any or all of these events could damage Ashford's reputation
and brand and impair its business.

Ashford's net sales could decrease if Ashford's online security measures fail.

   Ashford's relationships with its customers may be adversely affected if the
security measures that Ashford uses to protect their personal information, such
as credit card numbers, are ineffective. If, as a result, Ashford loses many
customers, its net sales could decrease. Ashford relies on security and
authentication technology that Ashford licenses from third parties. With this
technology, Ashford performs real-time credit card authorization and
verification with its bank. Ashford cannot predict whether events or
developments will result in a compromise or breach of the technology Ashford
uses to protect a customer's personal information. Furthermore, Ashford's
servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins
and similar disruptions. Ashford may need to expend significant additional
capital and other resources to protect against a security breach or to
alleviate problems caused by any breaches. Ashford cannot assure that it can
prevent all security breaches.

Ashford's net sales and gross margins would decrease if Ashford experiences
significant credit card fraud.

   A failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would
reduce Ashford's net sales and its gross margins because Ashford does not carry
insurance against this risk. Ashford has developed procedures to help it detect
the fraudulent use of credit card information. Under current credit card
practices, Ashford is liable for fraudulent credit card transactions because it
does not obtain a cardholder's signature.

If Ashford does not respond to rapid technological changes, its services could
become obsolete and Ashford could lose customers.

   If Ashford faces material delays in introducing new services, products and
enhancements, its customers may forego the use of its services and use those of
its competitors. To remain competitive, Ashford must continue to enhance and
improve the functionality and features of its online store. The Internet and
the online commerce industry are rapidly changing. If competitors introduce new
products and services, or if new industry standards and practices emerge,
Ashford's existing Web site and proprietary technology and systems may become
obsolete. To develop Ashford's Web site and technology entails significant
technical and business risks. Ashford may use new technologies ineffectively or
it may fail to adapt its technology to meet customer requirements or emerging
industry standards.

Intellectual property claims against Ashford can be costly and could impair
Ashford's business.

   Other parties may assert infringement or unfair competition claims against
Ashford. Ashford cannot predict whether they will do so, or whether any future
assertions or prosecutions will harm its business. If Ashford is forced to
defend against any infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit
or are determined in Ashford's favor, then Ashford may face costly litigation,
diversion of technical and management personnel, or product shipment delays.
Further, the outcome of a dispute may be that Ashford would need to develop
non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may be unavailable on terms
acceptable to Ashford, or at all.

If the protection of Ashford's trademarks and proprietary rights is inadequate,
Ashford's brand and reputation could be impaired and Ashford could lose
customers.

   The steps Ashford takes to protect its proprietary rights may be inadequate.
Ashford regards its copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade dress, trade
secrets and similar intellectual property as critical to its success. Ashford
relies on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and
confidentiality or license agreements with its employees, customers, partners
and others to protect its proprietary rights. Ashford currently has
applications for registration in the United States Patent and Trademark Office,
as well as various foreign trademark offices, of several of the company's
trademarks. In some instances, these applications span a variety of goods and
services. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret
protection may not be available in every country in which Ashford will sell its
products and services online. Furthermore, the relationship between regulations
governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary
rights is unclear. Therefore, Ashford may be unable to prevent third parties
from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise
decrease the value of its trademarks and other proprietary rights.

The loss of the services of one or more of Ashford's key personnel, or
Ashford's failure to attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified
personnel in the future, could disrupt Ashford's operations and result in loss
of net sales.

   Ashford's future performance will depend on the continued services of its
management and key personnel and the ability to attract additional management
and key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of Ashford's key
personnel could seriously interrupt its business. Ashford depends on the
continued services and performance of its senior management and other key
personnel. Ashford's future success also depends upon the continued service of
its executive officers and other key sales, marketing and support personnel.
Ashford's relationships with officers and key employees are at will and none of
its officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any
specific term. Ashford currently has a key person life insurance policy
covering James H. Whitcomb, Jr. While the proceeds of this policy might assist
Ashford in recruiting executive officers, the proceeds would not address the
potential disruption to its business of recruiting and integrating new senior
management.

Executive officers, directors and entities affiliated with them have
substantial control over Ashford which could delay or prevent a change in
Ashford's corporate control favored by Ashford's other stockholders.

   Executive officers, directors and entities affiliated with them, if acting
together, would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring
approval by Ashford stockholders, including the election of directors and the
approval of mergers or other business combination transactions.

It may be difficult for a third party to acquire Ashford even if doing so would
be beneficial to Ashford stockholders.

   Provisions of Ashford's certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware
law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Ashford, even if
doing so would be beneficial to Ashford stockholders. In particular, Ashford's
certificate of incorporation provides for a board of directors that is divided
into three classes which may issue preferred stock without any stockholder
action. Ashford's certificate of incorporation also does not allow stockholders
to act by written consent or for cumulative voting in the election of
directors. Only one class of directors is up for reelection at each annual
meeting. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
places restrictions on business combinations with interested stockholders.

Ashford depends on increasing use of the Internet and on the growth of online
commerce.

   Ashford's future revenues substantially depend upon the increased acceptance
and use of the Internet and other online services as a medium of commerce.
Rapid growth in the use of the Internet, the Web and online services is a
recent phenomenon. As a result, acceptance and use may not continue to develop
at historical rates and a sufficiently broad base of customers may not adopt,
and/or continue to use, the Internet and other online

services as a medium of commerce. Demand and market acceptance for recently
introduced services and products over the Internet are subject to a high level
of uncertainty and there exist few proven services and products.

   In addition, the Internet may not be accepted as a viable long-term
commercial marketplace for a number of reasons, including potentially
inadequate development of the necessary network infrastructure or delayed
development of enabling technologies and performance improvements. If the
Internet continues to experience significant expansion in the number of users,
frequency of use or bandwidth requirements, the infrastructure for the Internet
may be unable to support the demands placed upon it. In addition, the Internet
could lose its viability as a commercial medium due to delays in the
development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle
increased levels of Internet activity, or due to increased governmental
regulation. Changes in, or insufficient availability of, telecommunications
services to support the Internet also could result in slower response times and
adversely affect usage of the Internet generally.

   Ashford's business, financial condition and results of operations would be
seriously harmed if:

  .  use of the Internet, the Web and other online services does not continue
     to increase or increases more slowly than expected;

  .  the infrastructure for the Internet, the Web and other online services
     does not effectively support expansion that may occur; the Internet, the
     Web and other online services do not become a viable commercial
     marketplace; or

  .  traffic to Ashford's Web site decreases or fails to increase as expected
     or if Ashford spend more than it expects to attract visitors to its Web
     site.

If Ashford is unable to acquire the necessary Web domain names, Ashford's brand
and reputation could be damaged and Ashford could lose customers.

   Ashford may be unable to acquire or maintain Web domain names relating to
its brand in the United States and other countries in which Ashford may conduct
business. As a result, Ashford may be unable to prevent third parties from
acquiring and using domain names relating to its brand, which could damage its
brand and reputation and take customers away from its Web site. Ashford
currently holds, among others, the "Ashford.com," "newwatch.com,"
"sunglasses.com," "Jasmin.com" and "Ashfordcorporategifts.com" domain names and
may seek to acquire additional domain names. Governmental agencies and their
designees generally regulate the acquisition and maintenance of domain names.
The regulation of domain names in the United States and in foreign countries is
subject to change in the near future. The changes in the United States are
expected to include a transition from the current system to a system that is
controlled by a non-profit corporation and the creation of additional top-level
domains. Governing bodies may establish additional top-level domains, appoint
additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain
names.

Ashford may need to change the manner in which it conducts its business if
government regulation increases.

   The adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the Internet
could adversely affect the manner in which Ashford currently conducts its
business. In addition, the growth and development of the market for online
commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, both in the
United States and abroad, that may impose additional burdens on Ashford. Laws
and regulations directly applicable to communications or commerce over the
Internet are becoming more prevalent. The United States Congress recently
enacted Internet laws regarding children's privacy, copyrights, taxation and
the transmission of sexually explicit material. The European Union recently
enacted its own privacy regulations. Laws regulating the Internet, however,
remain largely unsettled, even in areas where there has been some legislative
action. It may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as
those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation apply to the
Internet. In order to comply with new or existing laws regulating online
commerce, Ashford may need to modify the manner in which it does business,
which may result in additional expenses. For instance, Ashford may need to
spend time and money revising the process by which Ashford fulfills customer
orders to ensure that each shipment complies with

applicable laws. Ashford may need to hire additional personnel to monitor its
compliance with applicable laws. Ashford may also need to modify its software
to further protect its customers' personal information.

Ashford may be subject to liability for the Internet content that Ashford
publishes.

   As a publisher of online content, Ashford faces potential liability for
defamation, negligence, copyright, patent or trademark infringement, or other
claims based on the nature and content of materials that Ashford publishes or
distributes. If Ashford faces liability, then its reputation and its business
may suffer. In the past, plaintiffs have brought these types of claims and
sometimes successfully litigated them against online companies. In addition,
Ashford could be exposed to liability with respect to the unauthorized
duplication of content or unauthorized use of other parties' proprietary
technology. Although Ashford carries general liability insurance, its insurance
currently does not cover claims of these types. Ashford cannot be certain that
it will be able to obtain insurance to cover the claims on reasonable terms or
that it will be adequate to indemnify itself for all liability that may be
imposed on it. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by Ashford's
insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could increase Ashford's
expenses.

Ashford's net sales could decrease if Ashford becomes subject to sales or other
taxes.

   If one or more states or any foreign country successfully asserts that
Ashford should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of its products, its
net sales and results of operations could be harmed. One or more local, state
or foreign jurisdictions may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on
Ashford. In addition, any new operation could subject Ashford's shipments in
other states to state sales taxes under current or future laws. If Ashford
becomes obligated to collect sales taxes, Ashford will need to update its
system that processes customer orders to calculate the appropriate sales tax
for each customer order and to remit the collected sales taxes to the
appropriate authorities. These upgrades will increase Ashford's operating
expenses. In addition, Ashford's customers may be discouraged from purchasing
products from Ashford because they have to pay sales tax, causing Ashford's net
sales to decrease. As a result, Ashford may need to lower prices to retain
these customers.

Ashford common stock price is volatile, which could result in substantial
losses for individual stockholders.

   The trading price of Ashford common stock fluctuates significantly. For
example, from its initial public offering through September 30, 2001, the
reported sale price of Ashford common stock on the Nasdaq National Market was
as high as $24.88 and as low as $0.06. Trading prices of Ashford common stock
may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as:

  .  actual or anticipated variations in its quarterly operating results;

  .  announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by
     Ashford or its competitors;

  .  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;

  .  conditions or trends in the Internet and/or online commerce industries;

  .  changes in the economic performance and/or market valuations of other
     Internet, online commerce or retail companies;

  .  announcements by Ashford or its competitors of significant acquisitions,
     strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;

  .  additions or departures of key personnel;

  .  release of transfer restrictions on its outstanding shares of common stock
     or sales of additional shares of common stock; and

  .  potential litigation.

   In addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme
price and volume fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations may adversely
affect the market price of Ashford common stock.

General

   Ashford is furnishing this prospectus/proxy statement to holders of Ashford
common stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies by Ashford's board
of directors for use at the special meeting of Ashford stockholders to be held
on [       ], 2001, and any adjournment or postponement thereof.

   This prospectus/proxy statement is being mailed to Ashford stockholders on
or about [       ], 2001. This prospectus/proxy statement is also being
furnished to Ashford stockholders as a prospectus in connection with the
issuance by Global Sports of shares of Global Sports common stock as
contemplated by the merger agreement.

Date, Time and Place

   The special meeting of Ashford stockholders will be held on [       ], 2001,
at [   a.m.], local time, at the Renaissance Hotel, 6 Greenway Plaza East,
Suite 1809, Houston, Texas 77046.

Matters to be Considered at the Special Meeting of Ashford Stockholders

   At the special meeting of Ashford stockholders, and any adjournment or
postponement thereof, Ashford stockholders will be asked to consider and vote
upon a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, pursuant to which a subsidiary
of Global Sports will merge with and into Ashford, Ashford will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Global Sports and each outstanding share of Ashford common
stock will be converted into the right to receive a combination of $0.125 in
cash and 0.0076 of a share of Global Sports common stock, with cash in lieu of
any fractional share.

Record Date

   Ashford's board of directors has fixed [       ], 2001, as the record date
for determination of Ashford stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at
the special meeting of Ashford stockholders.

Voting of Proxies

   Ashford requests that its stockholders complete, date and sign the proxy
card and promptly return it by mail in the accompanying envelope in accordance
with the instructions accompanying the proxy card. Brokers holding shares in
"street name" may vote the shares only if the stockholder provides instructions
on how to vote. Brokers will provide directions on how to instruct the broker
to vote the shares. All properly signed and dated proxies that Ashford receives
prior to the vote at the special meeting of Ashford stockholders, and that are
not revoked, will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on the
proxies or, if no direction is indicated, for adoption of the merger agreement.

   Stockholders may revoke their proxies at any time prior to their use:

  .  by delivering to the Secretary of Ashford a signed notice of revocation or
     a later-dated, signed proxy; or

  .  by attending the special meeting of Ashford stockholders and voting in
     person.

   Attendance at the special meeting of Ashford stockholders does not in itself
constitute the revocation of a proxy.

Votes Required

   As of the close of business on [       ], 2001, the record date for the
special meeting of Ashford stockholders, there were [   ] shares of Ashford
common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, held by approximately [   ]
holders of record. The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Ashford common stock entitled to vote thereon must vote to adopt the merger
agreement. Ashford stockholders have one vote per share of Ashford common stock
owned on the record date.

   As of the record date for the special meeting of Ashford stockholders, the
directors and executive officers of Ashford and their affiliates owned
approximately [   ] shares of Ashford common stock, which represented
approximately [   ]% of the outstanding shares of Ashford common stock entitled
to vote at the special meeting of Ashford stockholders. David Gow, Chief
Executive Officer and a director of Ashford, James H. Whitcomb, President and a
director of Ashford, J. Robert Shaw, Chairman of Ashford's board of directors,
Robert Cohn and Kevin Harvey, directors of Ashford, and Benchmark Capital
Partners II, L.P., Benchmark Capital Partners III, L.P. and Benchmark Capital
Partners IV, L.P. have each entered into a voting agreement with Global Sports
dated as of September 13, 2001, pursuant to which they have agreed to vote all
shares of Ashford common stock owned by them as of the record date in favor of
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Each of these parties has also
granted Global Sports an irrevocable proxy to vote his or its shares of Ashford
common stock in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
Approximately [      ] shares of Ashford common stock, which represents
approximately [   ]% of the outstanding shares of Ashford common stock as of
the record date, are subject to the voting agreements. See "Voting Agreements."

Quorum; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

   The required quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting
of Ashford stockholders is holders, present in person or by proxy, of a
majority of the shares of Ashford common stock issued and outstanding on the
record date. Abstentions and broker non-votes each will be included in
determining the number of shares present and voting at the special meeting of
Ashford stockholders for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.
Because adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Ashford common stock entitled to vote,
abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes against the
adoption of the merger agreement. In addition, the failure of an Ashford
stockholder to return a proxy or to vote in person will have the effect of a
vote against the adoption of the merger agreement. Brokers holding shares for
beneficial owners cannot vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement
without the owners' specific instructions. Accordingly, Ashford stockholders
are encouraged to return the enclosed proxy card marked to indicate their vote
as described in the instructions accompanying the proxy card.

Solicitation of Proxies and Expenses

   Ashford has retained the services of Mellon Investor Services LLC to assist
in the solicitation of proxies from Ashford stockholders. The fees to be paid
to the firm by Ashford for these services are not expected to exceed $10,000
plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Ashford will bear its own expenses in
connection with the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting of Ashford
stockholders.

   In addition to solicitation by mail, the directors, officers and employees
of Ashford may solicit proxies from stockholders by telephone, email, facsimile
or in person. Brokerage houses, nominees, fiduciaries and other custodians will
be requested to forward soliciting materials to beneficial owners and will be
reimbursed for their reasonable expenses incurred in sending proxy materials to
beneficial owners.

Other Matters

   No other matters may be brought before the special meeting of Ashford
stockholders. Under Ashford's bylaws, business transacted at the special
meeting of Ashford stockholders will be limited to the purpose stated in

the notice accompanying this prospectus/proxy statement. No other purpose has
been stated in the notice accompanying this prospectus/proxy statement.

Stockholder Proposals for the Ashford 2002 Annual Meeting

   If the merger is not completed, proposals of Ashford stockholders that are
intended to be presented at Ashford's 2002 Annual Meeting must be timely
delivered or received by Ashford. Under Ashford's bylaws, in order to be deemed
properly presented, notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received by,
Ashford not later than June 25, 2002. The stockholder's notice must set forth,
(1) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or
reelection as a director, all information relating to such person that is
required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors,
or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (including such person's written consent to
being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if
elected); (2) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring
before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought
before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and
any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial
owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (3) as to the
stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf
the nomination or proposal is made (a) the name and address of such
stockholder, and of such beneficial owner and (b) the class and number of
shares which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such
beneficial owner. If the presiding officer of the meeting determines that such
business has not been properly brought before the meeting, then such business
shall not be transacted.

Board Recommendation

   Ashford's board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement
and the merger and has determined that the merger agreement and the merger are
advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Ashford and its
stockholders, and recommends that Ashford stockholders vote FOR adoption of the
merger agreement. In considering such recommendation, Ashford stockholders
should be aware that some Ashford directors and officers may have interests in
the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of other Ashford
stockholders generally. Among other things, Global Sports has agreed to
continue certain indemnification and insurance arrangements in favor of
directors and officers of Ashford. See "The Merger--Interests of Ashford's
Officers and Directors in the Merger."

   The matter to be considered at the special meeting of Ashford stockholders
is of great importance to Ashford stockholders. Accordingly, Ashford
stockholders are encouraged to read and carefully consider the information
presented in this prospectus/proxy statement, and to complete, date, sign and
promptly return the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope,
as described in the instructions accompanying the proxy card.

   Ashford stockholders should not send any stock certificates with their proxy
cards. A transmittal form with instructions for the surrender of Ashford common
stock certificates will be mailed to Ashford stockholders promptly after
completion of the merger. For more information regarding the procedures for
exchanging Ashford stock certificates for the merger consideration, see
"Certain Terms of the Merger Agreement--Manner and Basis of Converting Shares."

                                  THE MERGER

General

   This section of this prospectus/proxy statement describes aspects of the
proposed merger that are considered to be important. The discussion of the
merger in this prospectus/proxy statement and the description of the principal
terms of the merger agreement are only summaries of the material features of
the proposed merger. Ashford stockholders can obtain a more complete
understanding of the merger by reading the merger agreement, a copy of which is
attached to this prospectus/proxy statement as Annex A. Ashford stockholders
are encouraged to read the merger agreement and the other annexes to this
prospectus/proxy statement in their entirety.

General Description of the Merger

   At the effective time of the merger, Ruby Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Global Sports, will be merged with and into Ashford. Ashford will
be the surviving corporation and will continue as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Global Sports. In the merger, each share of Ashford common stock outstanding at
the effective time of the merger will automatically be converted into the right
to receive a combination of $0.125 in cash and 0.0076 of a share of Global
Sports common stock, with cash in lieu of any fractional share.

   Based on the number of shares of Global Sports common stock and Ashford
common stock outstanding as of the record date, approximately [$   ] in cash
will be payable pursuant to the merger agreement in exchange for outstanding
shares of Ashford common stock, and approximately [       ] shares of Global
Sports common stock will be issuable pursuant to the merger agreement in
exchange for outstanding shares of Ashford common stock, representing
approximately [   ]% of the total Global Sports common stock to be outstanding
immediately after such issuance. This assumes that no Ashford or Global Sports
stock options or warrants are exercised after the record date and before the
effective time of the merger.

Background of the Merger

   The terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the merger are the
result of arm's-length negotiations between representatives of Global Sports
and representatives of Ashford. Set forth below is a summary of the background
of these negotiations.

   On August 21, 2001, Michael G. Rubin, Global Sports' Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer, telephoned Kevin Harvey, a member of the board of
directors of Ashford, and expressed Global Sports' possible interest in
acquiring Ashford. On August 22, 2001, Mr. Rubin spoke by telephone with David
Gow, Chief Executive Officer of Ashford, and discussed Global Sports' possible
interest in acquiring Ashford. Following and as a result of these
communications, a meeting was scheduled for August 26, 2001 at Ashford's
headquarters in Houston, Texas between members of the executive teams of Global
Sports and Ashford.

   On August 26, 2001, Mr. Rubin, Arthur H. Miller, Executive Vice President
and General Counsel of Global Sports, and Michael R. Conn, Senior Vice
President, Business Development of Global Sports, met with Mr. Gow, James
Whitcomb, President of Ashford, Brian Bergeron, Chief Financial Officer of
Ashford, and Kim Richard, Senior Vice President, Marketing and Corporate
Strategy of Ashford, and discussed Global Sports' possible interest in
acquiring Ashford. Global Sports' management presented information regarding
Global Sports' business and answered questions from the Ashford team. Ashford's
management presented information regarding Ashford's business and answered
questions from the Global Sports team. The Global Sports representatives
indicated that based on what they had heard so far, Global Sports was
interested in continuing the process with a view to acquiring all of the stock
of Ashford for Global Sports common stock at an implied valuation of between
$9.0 million and $12.0 million. Mr. Rubin indicated that Global Sports'
preference was to acquire the Ashford stock in exchange for Global Sports
common stock, but that Global Sports would consider paying cash or a
combination of cash and Global Sports common stock. Global Sports' management
stated that

any acquisition would be subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence,
approval of its board of directors and completion of a definitive merger
agreement. Mr. Gow indicated that he would advise Ashford's board of directors
of Global Sports' interest at a telephonic meeting scheduled for August 27,
2001 and that he would advise Mr. Rubin of their response on August 28, 2001.

   On August 27, 2001, Mr. Gow advised Ashford's board of directors of Global
Sports' possible interest in acquiring Ashford.

   On August 28, 2001, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Gow spoke by telephone. Mr. Gow
advised Mr. Rubin that Ashford's board of directors was interested in pursuing
a possible transaction but that the $9.0 million to $12.0 million range of
implied value was less than the board was willing to accept. Mr. Gow also
informed Mr. Rubin that Ashford's board of directors preferred a cash
transaction. Mr. Gow and Mr. Rubin agreed to speak again in two days.

   On August 29, 2001, Mr. Gow had further conversations with members of
Ashford's board of directors.

   On August 30, 2001, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Gow spoke by telephone. Mr. Gow
indicated that Ashford's board of directors was prepared to move forward with
Global Sports toward a possible acquisition of Ashford for cash at an implied
valuation of $14.0 million. Mr. Rubin and Mr. Gow agreed to speak again later
that day.

   Later on August 30, 2001, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Gow again spoke by telephone.
Mr. Rubin stated that Global Sports would accept an implied valuation of $14.0
million but only if the purchase price consisted of Global Sports common stock.
Mr. Rubin and Mr. Gow agreed to speak again later that day.

   Still later on August 30, 2001, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Gow again spoke by
telephone. Mr. Gow indicated that Ashford's board of directors would consider a
partial cash, partial stock offer with an implied value of $14.0 million,
subject to learning more about Global Sports, and requested that Mr. Rubin
address Ashford's board of directors at a meeting scheduled for September 6,
2001. Mr. Rubin agreed to make this presentation. Mr. Rubin and Mr. Gow agreed
to continue to move forward with the process.

   On August 31, 2001, Global Sports retained CIBC World Markets as its
financial advisor and Cooley Godward LLP as its legal advisor, and Ashford
retained Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian, LLP as its
legal advisor.

   On September 4, 2001, Ashford began discussions with U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray regarding U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's interest in providing a fairness
opinion for the proposed transaction. Also on September 4, 2001, Global Sports
and Ashford entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement and an exclusivity
agreement, and Cooley Godward delivered the initial draft of the merger
agreement to Ashford and its legal advisors.

   On September 5, 2001, Mr. Miller, Mr. Conn, Paul D. Cataldo, Assistant
General Counsel of Global Sports, and representatives of CIBC World Markets and
Cooley Godward commenced meetings in Houston, Texas with Ashford's senior
management and legal advisors to negotiate the merger agreement and conduct due
diligence.

   On September 6, 2001, Global Sports and Ashford continued negotiating the
merger agreement and conducting due diligence, and Jordan M. Copland, Executive
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Global Sports, joined the
meetings in Houston. Also on September 6, 2001, Ashford's board of directors
held a telephonic meeting to discuss the transaction. Messrs. Rubin, Miller and
Conn were present for a portion of the meeting to present an overview of Global
Sports and answer questions from Ashford's board of directors. Mr. Rubin and
Mr. Gow spoke by telephone following Ashford's board of directors meeting, and
Mr. Gow indicated that the board of directors needed to deliberate further on
the proposed transaction the next morning.

   On September 7, 2001, Global Sports and Ashford continued negotiating the
merger agreement and conducting due diligence. Mr. Rubin and Mr. Gow spoke by
telephone, and Mr. Gow indicated that Ashford was prepared to move forward with
the proposed transaction at an implied valuation of $14.0 million if the
purchase price were paid 50% in cash and 50% in Global Sports stock. Mr. Rubin
stated that Global Sports was prepared to move forward on that basis, subject
to satisfactory completion of its due diligence, approval of its board of
directors and completion of a definitive merger agreement. Later on September
7, 2001, Mr. Rubin and Robert Liewald, Executive Vice President, Merchandising
of Global Sports, joined the meetings in Houston.

   On September 8 and 9, 2001, Global Sports continued conducting due diligence
and met with management of Ashford. Mr. Rubin and Mr. Gow discussed the implied
valuation of $14.0 million for the transaction and agreed that Global Sports
would exchange 0.0076 of a share of Global Sports common stock and pay $0.125
in cash for each outstanding share of Ashford stock.

   On September 10, 2001, Ashford engaged U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray to provide
an opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the
stockholders of Ashford (other than Global Sports) of the consideration to be
received pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. Also on September 10,
2001, Global Sports and Ashford continued conducting due diligence, and U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray visited Global Sports headquarters and Ashford
headquarters. Global Sports' board of directors convened a telephonic meeting
to discuss the proposed transaction and gave Mr. Rubin approval to continue to
move forward with the proposed transaction along the terms outlined, subject to
satisfactory completion of due diligence, completion of a definitive merger
agreement and final approval from the board of directors.

   On September 11 and 12, 2001, Global Sports and Ashford continued
negotiating the merger agreement and conducting due diligence. On September 12,
Global Sports convened a telephonic meeting of its board of directors in which
the board approved the merger transaction, subject to there being no material
changes to the terms outlined in the meeting.

   Ashford also convened a meeting of its board of directors on September 12,
2001. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray presented its opinion to Ashford's board of
directors that the merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the stockholders of Ashford (other than Global Sports). Ashford's
board of directors approved the merger transaction, subject to there being no
material changes to the terms outlined in the meeting.

   On September 13, 2001, the parties finalized the merger agreement and
related documentation, and the definitive merger agreement was executed by
Global Sports, Ruby Acquisition Corp. and Ashford.

   On September 14, 2001, Global Sports and Ashford publicly announced the
proposed merger.

risks and uncertainties. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from
the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements.
Cautionary statements that identify important factors that could cause or

Global Sports' Reasons for the Merger

   At a meeting held on September 12, 2001, Global Sports' board of directors
determined that the terms of the merger and the merger agreement were fair to,
and in the best interests of, Global Sports and its stockholders. Global
Sports' board of directors consulted with Global Sports' senior management, as
well as its legal counsel

and financial advisors in reaching its decision to approve the merger and the
merger agreement. Global Sports' primary reasons for seeking to complete the
merger with Ashford are the beliefs of Global Sports' board of directors and
management that the merger could result in a number of benefits, including the
following:

  .  Ashford's merchandising and fulfillment expertise in the luxury products
     category could serve as a platform for Global Sports to extend its
     outsource business model into the luxury products category;

  .  Ashford's sales force, merchandising expertise and clientele in the
     corporate gift category could serve as a platform for Global Sports to
     extend its outsource business model to the corporate gift category; and

  .  the merger could enable Global Sports to expand its business and realize
     greater operational efficiencies, including higher purchase volumes for
     online marketing and greater economies of scale in its customer service
     center and technology operations.

   In reaching its determination that the merger was in the best interests of
Global Sports and its stockholders, Global Sports' board of directors
considered a number of factors, including the factors discussed above and
listed below. The conclusions reached by Global Sports' board of directors with
respect to these factors supported its determination that the merger and the
issuance of shares of Global Sports common stock in the merger were fair to,
and in the best interests of, Global Sports:

  .  the judgment, advice and analyses of Global Sports' management with
     respect to the potential strategic, financial and operational benefits of
     the merger, including Global Sports' management's favorable recommendation
     of the merger, based in part on the business, operational, financial,
     accounting and legal due diligence investigations performed with respect
     to Ashford;

  .  the terms of the merger agreement and related agreements, including price
     and structure, which were considered by both the board of directors and
     management of Global Sports to provide a fair and equitable basis for the
     merger; and

  .  the cash position and balance sheet liquidity of Global Sports following
     completion of the merger, especially during periods of volatility in the
     financial markets.

   Global Sports' board of directors also considered a number of potentially
negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger. The potentially
negative factors considered by Global Sports' board of directors included:

  .  the risk that the merger might not be completed in a timely manner or at
     all;

  .  the potential negative impact of any vendor or partner confusion after
     announcement of the proposed merger;

  .  the potential negative reaction of the financial community after
     announcement of the proposed merger;

  .  the risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized,
     including Global Sports inability to retain the merchandising, fulfillment
     or corporate gift employees of Ashford;

  .  the costs associated with the merger, including merger related transaction
     costs and costs associated with renegotiating or terminating marketing and
     other agreements; and

  .  the other risks and uncertainties discussed above under "Risk Factors."

   The foregoing discussion of information and factors considered by Global
Sports' board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to
include all material factors considered by the board. In view of the wide
variety of factors it considered, Global Sports' board of directors did not
find it practicable to quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the
specific factors considered. In addition, Global Sports' board of directors did
not reach any specific conclusion on each factor considered, or any aspect of
any particular factor, but conducted an overall analysis of these factors.
Individual members of Global Sports' board of directors may have

given different weights to different factors. After taking into account all of
the factors set forth above, however, Global Sports' board of directors
unanimously agreed that the merger agreement and the merger were fair to, and
in the best interests of, Global Sports and its stockholders and that Global
Sports should proceed with the merger.

   There can be no assurance that the benefits of the potential growth,
synergies or opportunities considered by Global Sports' board of directors will
be achieved through completion of the merger. See "Risk Factors."

Ashford's Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of Ashford's Board of
Directors

   Ashford's board of directors has determined that the terms of the merger and
the merger agreement are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of,
Ashford and its stockholders, and determined to recommend that the stockholders
of Ashford adopt the merger agreement. In its evaluation of the merger and the
merger agreement, Ashford's board of directors consulted with Ashford's senior
management, as well as its legal and financial advisors. The decision of
Ashford's board of directors to approve the merger and the merger agreement was
based upon, among other things, several potential benefits of the merger to
Ashford and its stockholders compared to Ashford continuing to operate as an
independent business. Ashford's management has also considered a number of
alternatives for enhancing its business, including raising new capital and
remaining an independent entity.

   In addition to the potential benefits described under "Global Sports'
Reasons for the Merger" that would be applicable to Ashford stockholders,
Ashford's board of directors believes that the merger could be beneficial to
Ashford and its stockholders for the following reasons, as well as the access
to greater resources and the opportunity for Ashford stockholders to
participate in the broader scope of consumer groups served by Global Sports
after the merger and the potential growth of Global Sports after the merger:

  .  the merger would provide Ashford stockholders with cash and shares of
     Global Sports common stock at an implied premium over the closing price
     for Ashford common stock on the last trading day prior to the time the
     merger agreement was entered into;

  .  the potential synergies created from combining the procurement,
     distribution and other strengths developed by Global Sports with the
     brand, consumer relationships, luxury goods inventory and other strengths
     built by Ashford; and

  .  the availability following the merger of Global Sports' greater resources
     to establish and support Ashford's products and sales.

   Ashford's board of directors reviewed a number of factors in evaluating the
merger, including but not limited to the following:

  .  information concerning the financial performance and condition, results of
     operations, competitive position, management and business of Global Sports
     and Ashford before and after giving effect to the merger;

  .  current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
     volatility and trading information with respect to Global Sports common
     stock and Ashford common stock;

  .  the consideration Global Sports will pay or issue in the merger in light
     of comparable merger transactions;

  .  the belief that the terms of the merger agreement and related agreements
     are reasonable;

  .  the impact of the merger on the customers and employees of Ashford and
     Global Sports;

  .  the market conditions affecting e-retailers;

  .  the ability of Ashford to obtain additional financing as a stand-alone
     entity;

  .  results of the due diligence investigation conducted by Ashford's
     management, accountants and legal and financial advisors; and

  .  the financial presentation of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, including its
     opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the
     date of the opinion, to the stockholders of Ashford (other than Global
     Sports) of the merger consideration provided for in the merger agreement.
     Please see "Opinion of Ashford's Financial Advisor" for more information
     on U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's fairness opinion, including the underlying
     assumptions and methodologies, matters considered and limitations on the
     review undertaken. This opinion is included as Annex C to this
     prospectus/proxy statement.

   Ashford's board of directors also considered the terms of the merger
agreement regarding Ashford's rights and limits on its ability to consider and
negotiate other acquisition proposals, as well as the possible effects of the
provisions regarding termination and termination fees.

   Ashford's board of directors also identified and considered a number of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger and the
merger agreement, including the following:

  .  the risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized;

  .  the fact that the proposed exchange ratio is fixed and will not change
     with increases or decreases in the market price of either company's stock
     before completion of the merger, and the possibility that the dollar value
     of a share of Global Sports stock at the closing of the merger may be more
     or less than the dollar value of a share of Global Sports stock at the
     time of the signing of the merger agreement;

  .  the risk that the merger may not be completed, notwithstanding the voting
     agreements obtained from holders representing beneficial ownership,
     excluding any shares issuable upon the exercise of options or warrants, of
     approximately 34.7% of Ashford common stock as of September 13, 2001;

  .  the effect of the public announcement of the merger on Ashford's sales,
     customer relations and operating results;

  .  the risk of management and employee disruption associated with the merger,
     including employee layoffs and the fact that some key technical, sales and
     management personnel would likely not be employed by Global Sports
     following the merger;

  .  the fact that the merger agreement requires Ashford to obtain Global
     Sports' consent in order to take a variety of actions;

  .  the challenges of integrating Ashford's operations with those of Global
     Sports; and

  .  other applicable risks described in this prospectus/proxy statement under
     "Risk Factors."

   Ashford's board of directors concluded, however, that these risks could be
managed or mitigated and that on balance, the merger's potential benefits to
Ashford and its stockholders outweighed the associated risks. This discussion
of the information and factors considered by Ashford's board of directors is
not exhaustive. In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with
its evaluation of the merger, Ashford's board of directors did not find it
practicable to, and did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to,
the specific factors considered in reaching the determination.

   For the reasons discussed above, Ashford's board of directors has approved
the merger agreement and the merger and has determined that the merger
agreement and the merger are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests
of, Ashford and its stockholders, and recommends that Ashford stockholders vote
FOR adoption of the merger agreement.

   In considering the recommendation of Ashford's board of directors with
respect to the merger agreement, Ashford stockholders should be aware that
certain directors and officers of Ashford have interests in the merger

that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of other Ashford
stockholders and that Global Sports has agreed to continue certain
indemnification and insurance arrangements in favor of directors and officers
of Ashford. Please see "The Merger--Interests of Ashford's Officers and
Directors in the Merger."

Opinion of Ashford's Financial Advisor

   Ashford's board of directors retained U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray to render
an opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Ashford
stockholders of the consideration to be received by these stockholders in
connection with the merger. On September 12, 2001, Ashford's board of directors
met to review the proposed merger. During this meeting, U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray reviewed with Ashford's board of directors certain financial analyses,
which are summarized below. Also at this meeting, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
rendered its opinion to Ashford's board of directors that, as of September 12,
2001 and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its
opinion, the merger consideration to be received by holders (other than Global
Sports) of Ashford common stock in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement
was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

   The full text of the U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray written opinion dated
September 12, 2001, which sets forth, among other things, assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the scope of the
review undertaken by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in rendering its opinion, is
attached as Annex C to this prospectus/proxy statement and is herein
incorporated by reference in its entirety. Ashford stockholders are urged to,
and should, read the U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray opinion carefully in its
entirety. The U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray opinion addresses only the fairness,
from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the merger
consideration to be received by holders (other than Global Sports) of Ashford
common stock in the merger. The U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray opinion was directed
to Ashford's board of directors and was not intended to be and does not
constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder
should vote or act on any matter relating to the proposed merger. The summary
of the U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray opinion in this prospectus/proxy statement is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray opinion.

   In connection with its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, among other
things:

  .  reviewed the financial terms of a draft of the merger agreement dated
     September 12, 2001;

  .  reviewed and analyzed certain publicly available business and financial
     information relating to Ashford and Global Sports;

  .  reviewed and analyzed certain other financial and other information
     relating to Ashford and Global Sports furnished to it by or discussed with
     Ashford and Global Sports, including financial forecasts furnished to it
     by Ashford, and met with the managements of Ashford and Global Sports to
     discuss the businesses and prospects of Ashford and Global Sports;

  .  considered certain financial and stock market data of Ashford and Global
     Sports and compared that data with similar data for other publicly held
     companies in businesses similar to those of Ashford and Global Sports;

  .  considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of
     certain other business combinations and other transactions which have
     recently been effected or announced; and

  .  considered such other information, financial studies and analyses and
     investigations and financial, economic and market criteria which U.S.
     Bancorp Piper Jaffray deemed relevant.

   U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of the financial statements and other information provided by
management of Ashford and Global Sports or otherwise made available to it and
did not assume the responsibility independently to verify such information.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray further relied upon the statements of Ashford's and
Global Sports' management that the information

provided by each of them, respectively, had been prepared on a reasonable basis
in accordance with industry practice, and, with respect to Ashford's financial
forecasts, statements of Ashford's management that such forecasts reflected the
best currently available estimates and judgment of Ashford's management. U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray assumed that the liquidation analysis furnished by
Ashford's management was correct and accurate in all respects. U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray assumed that neither Ashford nor Global Sports was a party to any
pending material transaction, including external financing, recapitalizations,
acquisitions or merger discussions, other than the proposed merger or in the
ordinary course of business. In arriving at its opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray assumed that all necessary regulatory approvals and consents required
for the proposed merger would be attained in a manner that would not change the
consideration to be received by Ashford stockholders and that the merger would
be completed on substantially the terms set forth in the draft merger agreement
dated September 12, 2001 reviewed by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, without
modification of material terms or conditions. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's
opinion was necessarily based on the information available to it and facts and
circumstances as they existed and were subject to evaluation as of the date of
the opinion.

   U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray was not asked to, and did not, advise Ashford in
the negotiation of the consideration to be received by its stockholders, any
other terms of the proposed merger, or with respect to alternatives to the
proposed merger that may have been, or may be, available. In addition,
Ashford's board of directors did not request that U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
solicit, and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray did not solicit, any indications of
interest from any third party that may be interested in purchasing all or any
part of Ashford's shares or assets.

   U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray did not undertake any independent analysis of any
pending or threatened litigation to which Ashford or any of its affiliates is a
party or may be subject or the existing investigation by the staff of the
Securities and Exchange Commission concerning Ashford. U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray also did not undertake any independent analysis of any other
governmental investigation or possible unasserted claims or other contingent
liabilities to which Ashford, Global Sports or any of their respective
affiliates is a party or may be subject. At the direction of Ashford's board of
directors and with its consent, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's opinion made no
assumption concerning, and therefore did not consider, the potential effects of
such litigation, investigations, or possible assertions of claims, or the
outcomes or damages arising out of any such matters.

   The following is a summary of selected analyses performed by U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray in connection with the preparation of its opinion and reviewed
with Ashford's board of directors at a meeting of the board held on September
12, 2001. It does not purport to be a complete statement of the analyses
performed by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray or a complete description of its

   Challenges Facing Ashford. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray noted various capital
and other challenges faced by Ashford, including the following:

  .  As of August 31, 2001, Ashford had an aggregate of $6.1 million in cash,
     including $4.6 million of unrestricted cash and $1.5 million of restricted
     cash.

  .  Ashford's management estimated continued quarterly deficits of earnings
     before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, referred to below
     as "EBITDA," for the foreseeable future.

  .  In August 2001, Ashford's borrowing capacity with its bank was effectively
     reduced as a result of a significant reduction in the liquidation value of
     its inventory, as estimated by a third party appraisal firm.

  .  Ashford recently borrowed approximately $3.5 million against its line of
     credit with its bank, representing substantially all of its borrowing
     capacity.

  .  According to Ashford's management, Ashford faced substantial challenges in
     obtaining additional capital and has restricted access to credit
     facilities and other forms of funding.

  .  According to Ashford's management, certain of Ashford's suppliers had
     recently imposed payment terms that were less favorable to Ashford after
     reviewing its financial condition and Ashford's management believed that
     the potential existed for suppliers to continue to reduce payment terms as
     Ashford's unrestricted cash balance continues to decrease.

  .  A cash flow analysis, using Ashford's internal estimates, indicated that
     Ashford would not have enough cash and cash equivalents to continue
     operations beyond the end of June 2002 without making use of external
     sources of funds.

  .  Ashford common stock had failed to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00
     over 30 consecutive trading days as required by the Nasdaq National Market
     for continued listing.

  .  Ashford is a party to multiple class action stockholder lawsuits.

  .  Ashford is a party to a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation
     regarding its accounting practices.

   Summary of Proposal. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed the terms of the
proposed transaction, including the cash consideration per share, the exchange
ratio and the aggregate transaction value. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed
the implied value of the consideration offered based upon the closing share
price of Global Sports common stock on September 10, 2001. This analysis showed
that the implied value of the consideration to be received in the merger was
approximately $0.25 per share of Ashford common stock. Based on 55.173 million
fully diluted Ashford shares outstanding, this implied an equity value of $13.8
million and a company value of $10.7 million for Ashford.

   Liquidation Analysis. Ashford's management provided a liquidation analysis
to U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray that indicated a range of values for the net
liquidation equity per share available to stockholders. This analysis included
Ashford's management's estimates of the book values of Ashford's assets and
liabilities as of September 30, 2001. These book value estimates were
discounted by Ashford's management to reflect various liquidation adjustments,
based on internal estimates provided by Ashford's management. The liquidation
value of Ashford's inventory was estimated by Ashford's management based on an
appraisal performed by an independent third party appraisal firm. The resulting
values were then further adjusted by Ashford's management to reflect
termination of leases, contingencies and other costs associated with wrap-up
and liquidation of the business, including salaries, severance, fees and
expenses of advisors and D&O insurance, as estimated by Ashford's management.
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray observed that based on this analysis the net
liquidation equity value available to Ashford stockholders would range from
$0.11 to $0.15 per share. These values compared to the offer price of the
proposed transaction of $0.25 per share. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's review of
this analysis made no assumptions and did not consider the possible assertions
of claims, outcomes or damages arising out of any pending or threatened
litigation, possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities, to
which Ashford

or any of its affiliates was a party or could have been subject. The following
table summarizes the results of this analysis, all values except for per share
values are in millions:

                                                   Low    High

Net Liquidation Equity per Share.................  $0.11  $0.15

   Cash Flow Analysis. A cash flow analysis, using Ashford's internal
estimates, indicated that Ashford would not have enough cash and cash
equivalents to continue operations beyond the end of June 2002 without making
use of external sources of funds, and, as a result, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
noted that a discounted cash flow analysis would not be meaningful.

   Comparable Companies Analysis. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed selected
financial data and ratios for Ashford and compared them to corresponding data
for the following publicly traded companies that it deemed comparable to
Ashford:

  .  Beyond.com Corp.

  .  Bluefly, Inc.

  .  iParty Corp.

  .  Mcglen Internet Group, Inc.

  .  Varsity Group, Inc.

   U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray calculated and analyzed the ratio of company
value of Ashford and each comparable company to its revenue and gross profit
for the last 12 months, referred to below as "LTM revenue" and "LTM gross
profit," respectively, and the ratio of fully diluted market value of equity,
using the treasury method, to book value for Ashford and each comparable
company, with values for LTM revenue, LTM gross profit and book value for
Ashford as of June 30, 2001. The analysis indicated the following multiples:

   The "company value" for each company was obtained by adding its short-term
and long-term debt to the sum of the market value of its common equity and the
value of any preferred stock (at liquidation value) and subtracting its cash
and cash equivalents.

   Comparable Transactions Analysis. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray reviewed and
analyzed certain financial information involving transactions in which the

      Bertelsmann AG (acquiror)/CDnow, Inc. (target)

   U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray calculated the ratio of company value to LTM
revenue, company value to LTM gross profit and equity value to book value of
the targets in each transaction and compared the results of these calculations
with such calculations for the proposed transaction, with values for LTM
revenue, LTM gross profit and book value for Ashford as of June 30, 2001. This
analysis indicated the following multiples:

   Premium Analysis. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray compared the premium of the
implied price per share of the merger consideration over the last sale price of
the common stock of Ashford on September 10, 2001, September 4, 2001, and
August 13, 2001 to similar premiums for the 16 comparable transactions
described above at announcement date. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray observed that
such premiums were as follows:

                                                     Comparable Premium (%)

   The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without

considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the
processes underlying U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's opinion. In arriving at its
opinion, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray considered the results of all of its
analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis
considered by it Instead, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray made its determination as
to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after
considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used
in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Ashford or the
contemplated transaction.

   The analyses were prepared solely for purposes of U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray's providing its opinion to Ashford's board of directors that the merger
consideration to be received by holders of Ashford common stock in the proposed
merger pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders, other than Global Sports and its affiliates, as of
September 12, 2001 and do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect
the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses
based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual
future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by these analyses. These analyses are inherently subject to
uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of
the parties or their respective advisors. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray does not
assume responsibility if future results are materially different from those
forecasted.

   As described above, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's opinion to Ashford's board
of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by Ashford's
board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement.
The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses performed by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in connection with the opinion
and is qualified by reference to the written opinion of U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray set forth in Appendix C.

   U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, as a customary part of its investment banking
business, is engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, underwriting and secondary
distributions of securities, private placements and valuations for estate,
corporate and other purposes. Ashford's board of directors selected U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray to render its fairness opinion in connection with the
proposed merger on the basis of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's experience and
reputation in valuing securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions.
In the ordinary course of its business, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and its
affiliates may actively trade securities of Ashford and Global Sports for its
own account or the account of its customers and, accordingly, it may at any
time hold a long or short position in such securities.

   U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray was retained pursuant to an engagement letter
dated September 10, 2001 to render a fairness opinion to Ashford's board of
directors in connection with the proposed merger. Under the terms of the U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray engagement letter, Ashford will pay U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray a fee for providing the opinion that is not contingent upon
consummation of the proposed merger. Such fees are customary amounts for
transactions of this type. In addition, Ashford has agreed to reimburse U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including
attorney's fees, and to indemnify U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray against certain
liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

Interests of Ashford's Officers and Directors in the Merger

   Upon completion of the merger, based on the number of shares of common stock
of Global Sports and Ashford outstanding on September 30, 2001, it is
anticipated that the directors and executive officers of Ashford and their
affiliates will beneficially own less than one percent of the then outstanding
shares of Global Sports common stock, calculated on the basis set forth under
the heading "Security Ownership by Certain Beneficial Owners of Ashford."

   As of September 30, 2001, the executive officers of Ashford held outstanding
stock options to purchase an aggregate of 4,431,250 shares of Ashford common
stock. In addition, the non-employee members of Ashford's board of directors
have received option grants as follows:

Non-employee Director Option Shares
--------------------- -------------

  J. Robert Shaw.....     14,250
  Kevin R. Harvey....     14,250
  J. Terry Manning...    252,375
  Robert Cohn........    152,750
  Gordon Mayer.......    125,144
  Colombe Nicholas...    229,500
                         -------
     Total...........    788,269
                         =======

   Upon completion of the merger, all of the then-unvested options granted to
the non-employee members of Ashford's board of directors shall automatically
vest. See "Certain Terms of the Merger Agreement--Ashford Stock Options and
Warrants" for a description of the treatment of outstanding Ashford stock
options and warrants upon completion of the merger.

   Under Ashford's 1999 Equity Incentive Plan and 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, if
a change in control of Ashford occurs, an option or other award will become
fully exercisable and fully vested if the option or award is not assumed by the
surviving corporation or its parent or if the surviving corporation or its
parent does not substitute comparable awards for the awards granted under such
plans.

   Ashford has granted Mr. Gow options to purchase a total of 2,108,500 shares
of common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the various options and option plans,
if Ashford is subject to a change of control and the acquiring company does not
assume the options, the vesting of the options will fully accelerate. Global
Sports is not assuming any Ashford options and therefore all of Mr. Gow's
options will be fully vested upon the consummation of the merger.

   Ashford entered into a stock restriction agreement, dated December 4, 1998,
with Mr. Whitcomb, Ashford's President and a director. Pursuant to that
agreement, if a change in control occurs and Ashford's repurchase right that
applies to his shares is not assigned to the successor corporation, then Mr.
Whitcomb's shares will become fully vested. Pursuant to an employment
agreement, all shares vest upon termination with or without cause and would no
longer be subject to the stock restriction agreement upon such termination.

   In addition, Ashford entered into an employment agreement with William
Hensler, dated February 3, 2000, pursuant to which Mr. Hensler received an
option for 360,000 shares of Ashford common stock that vests in monthly equal
installments over 48 months. Pursuant to this agreement, Mr. Hensler would
receive six months acceleration of vesting and six months of salary and
benefits if Ashford is subject to a change of control.

   Ashford has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and
executive officers containing provisions that may require Ashford to, among
other things:

  .  indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by
     reason of their status or service as directors or officers, other than
     liabilities arising from willful misconduct of a culpable nature;

  .  advance their expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them
     as to which they could be indemnified; and

  .  maintain directors' and officers' insurance if available on reasonable
     terms.

   In addition, Global Sports has agreed to cause Ashford to continue to honor
and maintain certain indemnification arrangements in favor of the current
officers and directors of Ashford for a period of six years.

The current officers and directors of Ashford will also be covered by
directors' and officers' insurance to be obtained by Ashford, with aggregate
premiums not to exceed $900,000.

   As a result of the foregoing, the directors and executive officers of
Ashford may be more likely to vote for the adoption of the merger agreement
than Ashford stockholders generally.

Material Federal Income Tax Consequences

   The following summary is a general discussion of the material United States
federal income tax consequences to Ashford stockholders upon the conversion of
their shares of Ashford common stock into cash and shares of Global Sports
common stock in the merger. This summary is based on the current provisions of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which is referred to in this
prospectus/proxy statement as the "Code," applicable Treasury Regulations,
judicial authority and administrative rulings, all of which are subject to
change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could alter the tax
consequences to Ashford stockholders as described herein. No ruling from the
Internal Revenue Service or opinion of counsel has been or will be sought with
respect to any aspect of the transactions described herein. No assurance can be
given that the Internal Revenue Service will not successfully assert a position
contrary to that described in this discussion. This summary is for Ashford
stockholders' general information only and does not purport to be a complete
analysis of all potential tax effects of the merger. For example, it does not
consider the effect of any applicable state, local or foreign tax laws nor does
it consider the tax consequences of transactions effectuated before, after or
concurrently with the merger (whether or not any such transactions are
undertaken in connection with the merger) including any transaction in which
Ashford common stock is acquired or Global Sports common stock is disposed of.
Moreover, it does not consider the tax consequences to holders of options,
warrants, or similar rights to acquire Ashford common stock, including the
assumption by Global Sports of outstanding warrants to acquire Ashford common
stock. In addition, it does not address all aspects of federal income taxation
that may affect particular stockholders in light of their particular
circumstances, including:

  .  stockholders that are insurance companies;

  .  stockholders that are tax-exempt organizations;

  .  stockholders that are financial institutions, broker or dealers in
     securities or foreign currency;

  .  stockholders who hold their Ashford shares as a hedge or as part of an
     integrated investment such as a hedge, straddle, constructive sale or
     other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction;

  .  stockholders that hold shares of Ashford common stock which constitutes
     qualified small business stock for purposes of Section 1202 of the Code or
     "Section 1244 Stock" for purposes of Section 1244 of the Code;

  .  stockholders who acquired their common stock pursuant to the exercise of
     an employee stock option or otherwise as compensation;

  .  stockholders who are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of
     the Code;

  .  stockholders who do not hold their shares of Ashford common stock as
     "capital assets," generally meaning property held for investment; or

  .  stockholders who are not citizens or residents of the United States or
     that are foreign corporations, foreign partnerships or foreign estates or
     trusts with respect to the United States.

   For U.S. federal income tax purposes, income earned through a foreign or
domestic partnership or similar entity is generally attributed to its owners.

  Treatment of Holders of Ashford Common Stock

   The conversion of shares of Ashford common stock into cash and shares of
Global Sports common stock in the merger will be a taxable transaction.
Generally, this means that an Ashford stockholder will recognize a capital gain
or loss equal to the difference between (1) the amount of cash received in the
merger plus the fair market value, as of the effective date of the merger, of
the shares of Global Sports common stock received in the merger, and (2) the
Ashford stockholder's tax basis in its shares of Ashford common stock. If the
Ashford stockholder is an individual, capital gain or loss will be taxable at a
maximum federal capital gains rate of 20% if the Ashford common stock has been
held for more than one year at the time of the merger. If the Ashford
stockholder is a corporation, the maximum federal tax rate applicable to its
capital gains is 35%. Capital losses are subject to limitations on
deductibility for both corporations and individuals.

   The aggregate tax basis of the shares of Global Sports common stock an
Ashford stockholder receives in the merger, including any fractional share
deemed received as described below, generally should be equal to the fair
market value of such Global Sports common stock, measured on the effective date
of the merger. The holding period, for capital gain purposes, for each share of
Global Sports common stock received in the merger will begin the day after the
effective date of the merger.

   A fractional share of Global Sports common stock not actually issued
pursuant to the merger but for which cash is received in lieu thereof should be
treated as a fractional share of Global Sports common stock that is issued in
the merger and then redeemed by Global Sports. An Ashford stockholder receiving
cash in lieu of a fractional share generally should recognize gain or loss upon
the payment thereof equal to the difference, if any, between such stockholder's
adjusted tax basis in the fractional share and the amount of cash received.
Such gain or loss should be a long-term capital gain or loss if, on the date of
the merger, the shares of Ashford common stock were held for more than one
year.

  Backup Withholding

   Ashford stockholders may be subject to backup withholding at the rate of
30.5% with respect to the gross proceeds they receive in the merger unless (1)
the stockholder is a corporation or other exempt recipient and, when required,
it establishes this exemption or (2) the stockholder provides his or her
correct taxpayer identification number to Global Sports, certifying that he or
she is not currently subject to backup withholding and otherwise complying with
applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Any amount withheld
under these rules will be creditable against the Ashford stockholder's federal
income tax liability.

   Global Sports will report to stockholders and to the IRS the amount of any
reportable payments, including payments made to stockholders pursuant to the
merger, and any amount withheld pursuant to the merger.

   The foregoing discussion of the United States federal income tax
consequences of the merger is for Ashford stockholders' general information
only and is not tax advice. Accordingly, each Ashford stockholder should
consult its own tax advisor with respect to the particular tax consequences to
the Ashford stockholder of the merger, including the applicable federal, state,
local and foreign tax consequences.

Accounting Treatment

   For purposes of financial reporting, the merger will be accounted for as a
"purchase."

Regulatory Approvals

   Global Sports and Ashford believe that the merger is not subject to the
reporting obligations and statutory waiting period applicable to transactions
falling within the jurisdiction of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust

Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. However, at any time before or after the
completion of the merger, either the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice or the Federal Trade Commission could take any action under U.S.
antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable, including seeking to enjoin
the completion of the merger or seeking the divestiture of substantial assets
of Global Sports or Ashford. Private parties and state attorneys general may
also bring actions under U.S. antitrust laws depending on the circumstances.

Restrictions on Resales by Affiliates

   The shares of Global Sports common stock to be received by Ashford
stockholders in the merger will have been registered under the Securities Act
of 1933 and, except as described in this paragraph, may be freely traded
without restriction. The shares of Global Sports common stock to be issued in
the merger and received by persons who may be considered to be "affiliates," as
that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, of Ashford
before the merger may be resold by them only in transactions permitted by the
resale provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, or as otherwise
permitted under the Securities Act of 1933. The merger agreement provides that
Ashford will use all reasonable efforts to obtain a signed affiliate agreement
in favor of and for the benefit of Global Sports from all persons who may be
considered affiliates of Ashford. The affiliate agreements will provide that
these persons will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of
Global Sports common stock at any time in violation of the Securities Act of
1933, or the rules and regulations promulgated under the Securities Act of
1933, including Rule 145.

Absence of Appraisal Rights

   Under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders of a
Delaware corporation are not entitled to appraisal rights, even if they do not
vote in favor of or consent to a merger, if the stock subject to such merger is
designated as a national market system security on an interdealer quotation
system by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and the
consideration to be received in such merger consists of any combination of cash
and shares of stock listed on a national securities exchange or designated as a
national market system security on an interdealer quotation system by the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Because the Nasdaq National
Market is designated as such a system and Ashford common stock and Global
Sports common stock are quoted on the Nasdaq National Market, holders of
Ashford common stock are not entitled to appraisal rights with respect to the
merger.

                     CERTAIN TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

   The following description of the merger agreement describes certain material
terms of the merger agreement. The full text of the merger agreement is
attached as Annex A to this prospectus/proxy statement and is incorporated
herein by reference. Ashford stockholders are encouraged to read the entire
merger agreement.

The Merger

   At the effective time of the merger, Global Sports' wholly owned subsidiary,
Ruby Acquisition Corp., will be merged with and into Ashford. Upon completion
of the merger, Ashford will continue as the surviving corporation and will be a
wholly owned subsidiary of Global Sports, and the directors and officers of
Ruby Acquisition Corp. immediately prior to the merger will become the
directors and officers of Ashford.

Effective Time of the Merger

   The merger agreement provides that the merger will become effective when a
certificate of merger executed by Ashford is delivered to and filed with the
Delaware Secretary of State. The consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement will take place no later than the tenth business day
after all of the conditions to the merger contained in the merger agreement are
satisfied or waived, and it is anticipated that the effective time of the
merger will occur as soon as practicable following the special meeting of
Ashford stockholders.

Manner and Basis of Converting Shares

   The merger agreement provides that, at the effective time of the merger,
each outstanding share of Ashford common stock will automatically be converted
into the right to receive a combination of cash consideration in the amount of
$0.125, and 0.0076 of a share of Global Sports common stock. No fractional
shares of Global Sports common stock will be issued in the merger. Instead,
each Ashford stockholder otherwise entitled to a fractional share will receive
a cash amount, rounded to the nearest whole cent, without interest, based on
the closing price of Global Sports common stock on the Nasdaq National Market
on the date the merger becomes effective.

   If, between the date of the merger agreement and the effective time of the
merger, the outstanding shares of Ashford common stock are changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
each component of the merger consideration shall be appropriately adjusted. If,
between the date of the merger agreement and the effective time of the merger,
the outstanding shares of Global Sports common stock are changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the exchange ratio applicable to the stock component of the merger
consideration shall be appropriately adjusted, but the cash component of the
merger consideration would not be adjusted.

   Under the terms of the merger agreement, following the effective time of the
merger, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, which has been selected by
Global Sports to act as exchange agent, will mail to each record holder of
Ashford common stock a letter indicating that the merger has been completed.
Record holders of Ashford common stock will also be provided with a letter of
transmittal and instructions for use, which record holders will use to exchange
Ashford common stock certificates for the merger consideration and cash for any
fractional share of Global Sports common stock. Ashford common stock
certificates should not be surrendered for exchange by Ashford stockholders
before the effective time of the merger.

   After the effective time of the merger, transfers of Ashford common stock
will not be registered on the stock transfer books of Ashford, and each
certificate that previously evidenced Ashford common stock will be deemed

to evidence the right to receive the merger consideration and the right to
receive cash instead of any fractional share of Global Sports common stock.
Global Sports will not pay dividends or other distributions on any shares of
Global Sports common stock to be issued in exchange for any Ashford common
stock certificate that is not surrendered until the Ashford common stock
certificate is surrendered as provided in the merger agreement. No interest
will be payable on the cash component of the merger consideration.

Ashford Stock Options and Warrants

   Global Sports will not assume any Ashford stock options as a result of the
merger, and all outstanding Ashford stock options will terminate immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger.

   At the effective time of the merger, Global Sports will assume each
outstanding and unexercised Ashford warrant that does not, by its terms,
terminate at the effective time of the merger, or otherwise as a result of the
merger. Each outstanding warrant assumed by Global Sports will become a warrant
to purchase a combination of cash and shares of Global Sports common stock. The
amount of cash payable upon the exercise of the assumed warrant will be equal
to the number of shares of Ashford common stock issuable upon the exercise of
the warrant immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, multiplied
by the per-share cash consideration of $0.125, rounding down to the nearest
whole cent. The number of shares of Global Sports common stock issuable upon
the exercise of the assumed warrant will be equal to the number of shares of
Ashford common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrant immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger, multiplied by the exchange ratio of
0.0076 of a share of Global Sports common stock, rounding to the nearest whole
share. Any restriction on the exercise of any Ashford warrant assumed by Global
Sports will remain in full force and effect, and the term, exercisability and
other provisions of the warrant will remain unchanged.

   Based on the number of Ashford warrants outstanding at the record date that
do not by their terms terminate at the effective time of the merger, or
otherwise as a result of the merger, and assuming that these warrants are not
exercised before the effective time of the merger, Global Sports will be
required at the effective time to reserve approximately [   ] shares of Global
Sports common stock for issuance upon the exercise of the Ashford warrants
assumed by Global Sports in connection with the merger.

Ashford Employee Stock Purchase Plan

   The merger agreement provides that Ashford's 1999 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan will be terminated immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
The last business day before the effective time will be treated as the last day
of any offering period then underway under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
Pro-rata adjustments may be required under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan to
reflect this shortened offering period, but the offering period will otherwise
be treated as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes
of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Representations and Warranties

   The merger agreement contains customary representations and warranties of
Ashford, Global Sports and Ruby Acquisition Corp. relating to, among other
things, certain aspects of the respective businesses and assets of the parties
and other matters. The representations and warranties expire at the effective
time of the merger.

Covenants; Conduct of Business Prior to the Merger

   Affirmative Covenants of Ashford. Under the terms of the merger agreement,
Ashford has agreed that before the effective time of the merger it will, among
other things, and subject to specified exceptions:

  .  ensure that Ashford and each of its subsidiaries conducts its business and
     operations in the ordinary course, prudently and in accordance with past
     practices and in compliance with all applicable legal requirements and the
     requirements of all material contracts;

  .  except as expressly contemplated by the merger agreement, use all
     reasonable efforts to preserve intact its current business organization,
     keep available the services of its current officers and employees and
     maintain its relations and goodwill with all suppliers, customers,
     landlords, creditors, licensors, licensees, employees and other persons
     having business relationships with it and its subsidiaries;

  .  promptly notify Global Sports in writing of the discovery by Ashford of
     any event, condition, fact or circumstance that occurred or existed on or
     prior to the date of the merger agreement and that caused or constitutes a
     material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by Ashford in
     the merger agreement;

  .  promptly notify Global Sports in writing of any event, condition, fact or
     circumstance that occurs, arises or exists after the date of the merger
     agreement and that would cause or constitute a material inaccuracy in any
     representation or warranty made by Ashford in the merger agreement if the
     representation or warranty had been made as of the time of the occurrence,
     existence or discovery of the event, condition, fact or circumstance, or
     the event, condition, fact or circumstance had occurred, arisen or existed
     on or prior to the date of the merger agreement;

  .  promptly notify Global Sports in writing of any material breach of any
     covenant or obligation of Ashford under the merger agreement;

  .  promptly notify Global Sports in writing of any event, condition, fact or
     circumstance that would make the timely satisfaction of any of the
     conditions set forth in the merger agreement impossible or unlikely or
     that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
     effect on Ashford and its subsidiaries;

  .  use all reasonable efforts to file all notices, reports and other
     documents required to be filed with any governmental body with respect to
     the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
     agreement, and to submit promptly any additional information requested by
     any such governmental body; and

  .  use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
     necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the merger and make effective
     the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including (1)
     making all filings and giving all notices, if any, required to be made and
     given by Ashford in connection with the merger and the other transactions
     contemplated by the merger agreement, (2) using all reasonable efforts to
     obtain each consent, if any, required to be obtained by Ashford in
     connection with the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
     by the merger agreement, and (3) using all reasonable efforts to lift any
     restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the merger.

   Under the terms of the merger agreement, Ashford has also agreed that its
board of directors will recommend that Ashford stockholders vote to adopt the
merger agreement. However, at any time before the special meeting of Ashford
stockholders, Ashford's board of directors is entitled to withdraw or modify
its recommendation that Ashford stockholders vote for adoption of the merger
agreement if certain requirements, including the following, are satisfied:

  .  an unsolicited, bona fide written offer to purchase all or substantially
     all of the outstanding shares of Ashford common stock or all or
     substantially all of the assets of Ashford is made to Ashford and is not
     withdrawn;

  .  Ashford provides Global Sports with at least five business days prior
     notice of any meeting of Ashford's board or directors at which Ashford's
     board of directors will determine whether the offer constitutes a superior
     offer as defined below;

  .  Ashford's board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
     with an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation,
     that the offer constitutes a superior offer;

  .  Ashford's board of directors determines in good faith, after having
     consulted with Ashford's outside legal counsel, that, in light of the
     superior offer, withdrawal or modification of its recommendation is
     required for the board of directors to comply with its fiduciary
     obligations to Ashford stockholders;

  .  Ashford's board of directors' recommendation that Ashford stockholders
     vote for adoption of the merger agreement is not withdrawn or modified in
     a manner adverse to Global Sports at any time within two business days
     after Global Sports receives written notice from Ashford confirming that
     its board of directors has determined that the offer constitutes a
     superior offer; and

  .  neither Ashford nor any of its representatives has violated its covenant
     under the terms of the merger agreement not to solicit or encourage, or
     participate in discussions or negotiations with respect to, acquisition
     proposals from or with parties other than Global Sports.

   For purposes of the merger agreement, the term "superior offer" means an
unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by a third party to purchase all or
substantially all of the outstanding shares of Ashford common stock or all or
substantially all of the assets of Ashford on terms that Ashford's board of
directors determines, in its reasonable judgment, after consultation with an
independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, to be more
favorable to Ashford stockholders than the terms of the merger. An offer will
not, however, be deemed to be a superior offer if any financing required to
consummate the transaction contemplated by the offer is not reasonably capable
of being obtained by the third party.

   Under the terms of the merger agreement, Ashford's obligation to call, give
notice of and hold the special meeting of Ashford stockholders will not be
affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of a
superior offer or acquisition proposal, or by any withdrawal or modification of
the recommendation by Ashford's board of directors that Ashford stockholders
vote for adoption of the merger agreement.

   The merger agreement provides that, if Ashford's board of directors
withdraws or modifies its recommendation that Ashford stockholders vote for
adoption of the merger agreement, Ashford may be required to pay Global Sports
a fee in the amount of $750,000, and to pay Global Sports' fees and expenses
associated with the preparation of the merger agreement and otherwise in
connection with the merger. See "Certain Terms of the Merger
Agreement--Expenses and Termination Fee."

   Negative Covenants of Ashford. Under the terms of the merger agreement,
Ashford has agreed that before the effective time of the merger, without the
prior written consent of Global Sports and subject to specified exceptions, it
will not and will not permit any of its subsidiaries to:

     distribution in respect of any shares of capital stock, or repurchase,
     redeem or otherwise reacquire any shares of capital stock or other
     securities;

  .  sell, issue, grant or authorize the issuance or grant of any capital stock

     used by Ashford to become bound by, any material contract, or amend or
     terminate, or waive or exercise any material right or remedy under, any
     material contract;

  .  enter into, renew or become bound by, or permit any of the assets owned or
     used by it to become bound by, any insurance policy, or amend or
     terminate, or waive or exercise any material right or remedy under, any
     insurance policy;

  .  enter into or become bound by any new marketing agreements, other than
     marketing agreements under which the payments for which Ashford and its
     subsidiaries are obligated, are solely performance-based and do not
     involve revenue guarantees or revenue sharing arrangements requiring
     Ashford and its subsidiaries to share over 15% of the applicable revenues
     with third parties;

     applicable to the purchase of the products sold by Ashford or its

     policies, personnel policies or other business policies or any of its
     methods of accounting or accounting practices in any respect;

  .  make any tax election;

  .  commence any legal proceeding or enter into any settlement agreement with
     respect to any legal proceeding;

  .  cause or permit Ashford or any of its subsidiaries to fail to comply with
     any term of any employee plan;

  .  enter into any transaction or take any other action outside the ordinary
     course of business or inconsistent with past practices; or

  .  make any disclosure regarding the merger or any of the other transactions
     contemplated by the merger agreement unless Global Sports will have
     approved of the disclosure or Ashford will have been advised by outside
     legal counsel that the disclosure is required by applicable law.

   Affirmative Covenants of Global Sports. Under the terms of the merger
agreement, Global Sports has agreed that, before the effective time of the
merger, it will, among other things, and subject to specified exceptions:

  .  register under the Securities Act of 1933 the issuance of the shares of

to dispose of or transfer or cause any of its subsidiaries to dispose of or
transfer any assets, or to commit to cause Ashford or any of Ashford's
subsidiaries to dispose of any assets; (2) to discontinue or cause any of its
subsidiaries to discontinue offering any product or service, or to commit to

Limitation on Ashford's Ability to Consider Other Acquisition Proposals

   Under the terms of the merger agreement, Ashford has agreed that it will not
directly or indirectly, and that it will not authorize or permit any of its
representatives, subsidiaries or subsidiaries' representatives directly or
indirectly, to:

  .  solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or facilitate the making, submission
     or announcement of any acquisition proposal, as defined below, or take any
     action that could reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition
     proposal;

  .  furnish any information regarding Ashford or any of its subsidiaries to
     any person in connection with or in response to an acquisition proposal or
     an inquiry or indication of interest that could lead to an acquisition
     proposal;

  .  engage in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to any
     acquisition proposal;

  .  approve, endorse or recommend any acquisition proposal; or

  .  enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract
     contemplating or relating to any acquisition transaction, as defined
     below.

   For purposes of the merger agreement, the term "acquisition proposal" means
any offer, proposal, inquiry or indication of interest, other than by Global
Sports, contemplating or otherwise relating to any acquisition transaction.

   For purposes of the merger agreement, the term "acquisition transaction"
means:

  .  any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, share exchange, business
     combination, issuance of securities, acquisition of securities,
     recapitalization, tender offer, exchange offer or other similar
     transaction (1) in

     which Ashford or any of its subsidiaries is a constituent corporation, (2)
     in which a person or group of persons directly or indirectly acquires
     ownership of securities representing more than 15% of the outstanding
     securities of any class of voting securities of Ashford or any of its
     subsidiaries or (3) in which Ashford or any of its subsidiaries issues
     securities representing more than 15% of the outstanding securities of any
     class of voting securities of Ashford or any of its subsidiaries;

  .  any sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license, acquisition or disposition
     of any business or businesses or assets that constitute or account for 15%
     or more of the consolidated net revenues, net incomes or assets of Ashford
     or any of its subsidiaries; or

  .  any liquidation or dissolution of Ashford or any of its subsidiaries.

   However, these restrictions will not be deemed to prevent Ashford or its
board of directors from complying with its legal obligations under Rules 14d-9
and 14c-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with regard to an acquisition
proposal.

   Furthermore, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by the required
vote of Ashford stockholders, these restrictions will not prohibit Ashford from
furnishing nonpublic information regarding Ashford or any of its subsidiaries
to, or entering into discussions with, any person in response to a superior
offer, as defined above, that is submitted to Ashford by that person if:

  .  neither Ashford, nor any of its representatives, subsidiaries or
     subsidiaries' representatives have breached or taken any action
     inconsistent with these restrictions;

  .  Ashford's board of directors concludes in good faith, after having
     consulted with Ashford's outside legal counsel, that the action is
     required in order for the board of directors to comply with its fiduciary
     obligations to Ashford stockholders under applicable law;

  .  at least two business days prior to furnishing any of the nonpublic
     information to, or entering into discussions with, that person, Ashford
     gives Global Sports written notice of the identity of that person and of
     Ashford's intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into
     discussions or negotiations with, that person, and Ashford receives from
     that person an executed confidentiality agreement containing customary
     limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral
     information furnished to that person by or on behalf of Ashford; and

  .  at least two business days prior to furnishing any of the nonpublic
     information to that person, Ashford furnishes the nonpublic information to
     Global Sports, to the extent the nonpublic information has not been
     previously furnished by Ashford to Global Sports.

   Under the terms of the merger agreement, if Ashford's board of directors
receives an acquisition proposal, any inquiry or indication of interest that
could reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal or any request
for nonpublic information then Ashford must, within 24 hours of receipt of such
acquisition proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request, advise Global
Sports orally and in writing of the matter, including the identity of the
person making or submitting the acquisition proposal, inquiry, indication of
interest that could reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal
or request, and the terms thereof. Ashford must keep Global Sports fully
informed with respect to the status of any acquisition proposal, inquiry,
indication of interest or request and any modification or proposed modification
to the acquisition proposal. Ashford must immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions with any person that relate to any
acquisition proposal.

   Under the terms of the merger agreement, Ashford has agreed not to release
or permit the release of any person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of
any provision of, any confidentiality, "standstill," nonsolicitation or similar
agreement to which Ashford or any of its subsidiaries is a party or under which
Ashford or any of its subsidiaries has any rights, and will use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced each of
these agreements at the request of Global Sports. Ashford has also agreed to
promptly request each person that has executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of a

possible acquisition transaction or equity investment to return all
confidential information furnished to that person by or on behalf of Ashford or
any of its subsidiaries.

   Additional Conditions to the Obligation of Ashford. The merger agreement

satisfaction, at or prior to the closing of the merger, of the following
conditions, in addition to the conditions set forth above under "Conditions to
the Obligations of Each Party":

  .  the representations and warranties made by Global Sports and Ruby
     Acquisition Corp. that are qualified by "material adverse effect" or
     otherwise qualified as to materiality must have been accurate in all
     respects as of the

     warranties made as of a specific date, which must have been accurate in
     all respects as of that date;

  .  the representations and warranties made by Global Sports and Ruby
     Acquisition Corp. that are not qualified by "material adverse effect" or
     otherwise qualified as to materiality must have been accurate in all
     material respects as of the date of the merger agreement, except for those
     representations and warranties made as of a specific date, which must have
     been accurate in all material respects as of that date;

  .  the representations and warranties of Global Sports and Ruby Acquisition
     Corp. will be accurate in all respects as of the closing date as if made
     on and as of the closing date, except for those representations and
     warranties made as of a specific date, which must have been accurate in
     all respects as of that date, and except that any inaccuracies in such
     representations and warranties as of the closing date will be disregarded
     if, after aggregating all inaccuracies of the representations and
     warranties as of the closing date, the inaccuracies and the circumstances
     giving rise to all of the inaccuracies do not constitute a "material
     adverse effect" on Global Sports determined as of the date on which the
     merger is completed, provided that, for purposes of determining the
     accuracy of the representations and warranties, all materiality
     qualifications contained in the representations and warranties will be
     disregarded;

  .  Global Sports and Ruby Acquisition Corp. will have complied with and
     performed in all material respects each covenant or obligation that either
     of them is required to comply with or to perform at or prior to the

     have been approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market; and

  .  Ashford will have received a certificate executed by an executive officer
     of Global Sports confirming that certain closing conditions have been
     satisfied.

   As used with respect to Ashford in the merger agreement, "material adverse
effect" means any event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or other matter
that, when considered together with all other matters that would constitute
exceptions to the representations and warranties of Ashford, disregarding any
"material adverse effect" or other materiality qualifications, or any similar
qualifications, in the representations and warranties, had or could reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on (1) the business, financial
condition, capitalization, assets, liabilities, operations or financial
performance of Ashford and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, (2) the ability
of Ashford to consummate the merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, or to perform any of its obligations
under the merger agreement, or (3) Global Sports' ability to vote, receive
dividends with respect to or otherwise exercise ownership rights with respect
to the stock of Ashford following consummation of the merger.

   However, any adverse effect that results from general economic, business or
industry conditions, the taking by Ashford of any action permitted or required
by the merger agreement, or the announcement or pendency of the merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, will not, in
and of itself, constitute a "material adverse effect," and will not be
considered in determining whether there has been or would be a "material
adverse effect," on Ashford and its subsidiaries. In addition, the failure of
Ashford to meet published or internal earnings or revenue estimates or
projections will not, in and of itself, constitute a "material adverse effect,"
and will not be considered in determining whether there has been or would be a
"material adverse effect," on Ashford and its subsidiaries. Moreover, a decline
in Ashford's stock price will not, in and of itself, constitute a "material
adverse effect," and will not be considered in determining whether there has
been or would be a "material adverse effect," on Ashford and its subsidiaries.

   As used with respect to Global Sports in the merger agreement, "material
adverse effect" means any event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or other
matter, that when considered together with all other matters that would
constitute exceptions to the representations and warranties of Global Sports,
disregarding any "material adverse effect" or other materiality qualifications,
or any similar qualifications, in the representations and

warranties, had or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on (1) the business, financial condition, capitalization, assets,
liabilities, operations or financial performance of Global Sports and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (2) the ability of Global Sports to
consummate the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, or to perform any of its obligations under the merger
agreement.

   However, any adverse effect that results from general economic, business or
industry conditions, the taking by Global Sports of any action permitted or
required by the merger agreement, or the announcement or pendency of the merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, will
not, in and of itself, constitute a "material adverse effect," and will not be
considered in determining whether there has been or would be a "material
adverse effect," on Global Sports. In addition, the failure of Global Sports to
meet published or internal earnings or revenue estimates or projections will
not, in and of itself, constitute a "material adverse effect," and will not be
considered in determining whether there has been or would be a "material
adverse effect," on Global Sports. Moreover, a decline in Global Sports' stock
price will not, in and of itself, constitute a "material adverse effect," and
will not be considered in determining whether there has been or would be a
"material adverse effect," on Global Sports.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

   The merger agreement provides that Global Sports and Ashford can agree by
mutual written consent to terminate the merger agreement at any time before the
consummation of the merger. In addition, either Global Sports or Ashford may
terminate the merger agreement if:

  .  the merger is not completed on or before March 31, 2002, unless the
     failure to consummate the merger by March 31, 2002 is attributable to a
     failure on the part of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement
     to perform any covenant required to be performed by that party before
     consummation of the merger;

  .  a court or other governmental body issues a final and nonappealable order,
     decree or ruling permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
     prohibiting the merger, provided that the party seeking termination of the
     merger agreement has used commercially reasonable efforts to have the
     order, decree or ruling vacated;

  .  Ashford stockholders fail to adopt the merger agreement; or

  .  the representations and warranties of the other party in the merger
     agreement are or become inaccurate, or the other party breaches its
     covenants, so that a condition to the obligation of the party to which the
     representations and warranties or covenants are made would not be
     satisfied and the inaccuracy or breach is not curable through the exercise
     of reasonable efforts or the other party is not using reasonable efforts
     to cure the breach.

   In addition, the merger agreement provides that Global Sports may terminate
the merger agreement, before the adoption of the merger agreement by Ashford
stockholders, if any of the following "triggering events" occurs:

  .  Ashford's board of directors fails to recommend that Ashford stockholders
     vote to adopt the merger agreement, or withdraws or adversely modifies its
     recommendation that Ashford stockholders vote for adoption of the merger
     agreement;

  .  Ashford fails to include in this prospectus/proxy statement the
     recommendation by Ashford's board of directors that Ashford stockholders
     vote for adoption of the merger agreement or a statement to the effect
     that Ashford's board of directors has determined and believes the merger
     is in the best interests of Ashford stockholders;

  .  Ashford's board of directors fails to reaffirm its recommendation that
     Ashford stockholders vote for adoption of the merger agreement, or its
     determination that the merger is in the best interests of Ashford

     stockholders, within five business days after Global Sports requests in
     writing that the recommendation or determination be reaffirmed;

  .  Ashford's board of directors approves, endorses or recommends another
     acquisition proposal;

  .  Ashford enters into a letter of intent or similar document, or any other
     contract relating to another acquisition proposal, other than a
     confidentiality agreement permitted by the merger agreement;

  .  Ashford fails to hold the special meeting of Ashford stockholders within
     45 days after the registration statement which includes this
     prospectus/proxy statement is declared effective;

  .  a tender or exchange offer relating to securities of Ashford is commenced,
     and Ashford does not send to its securityholders, within 10 business days
     after the commencement of the tender or exchange offer, a statement
     disclosing that Ashford recommends rejection of the tender or exchange
     offer;

  .  another acquisition proposal is publicly announced and Ashford fails to
     issue a press release announcing its opposition to the acquisition
     proposal within five business days after the acquisition proposal is
     announced or otherwise fails to actively oppose the acquisition proposal;

  .  any person or group of persons directly or indirectly acquires or agrees
     to acquire from Ashford securities representing more than 10% of the
     outstanding securities of any class of voting securities of Ashford; or

  .  Ashford or any of its representatives breaches its agreement not to
     solicit or encourage, or participate in discussions or negotiations with
     respect to, acquisition proposals from or with parties other than Global
     Sports.

   If the merger agreement is terminated, then it will be of no further effect,
there will be no liability on the part of Global Sports or Ashford to the
other, and all rights and obligations of the parties will cease other than
liabilities relating to payment of termination fees and breaches of
representations and warranties and covenants contained in the merger agreement.

Expenses and Termination Fee

   The merger agreement provides that, regardless of whether Global Sports and
Ashford consummate the merger, each of Ashford and Global Sports will pay its
own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, except that Global Sports
and Ashford have agreed to share equally all fees and expenses, other than
attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing
of the registration statement of which this prospectus/proxy statement is a
part, this prospectus/proxy statement, and any amendments or supplements to
either of them.

   Under the terms of the merger agreement, Ashford has agreed to pay Global
Sports a termination fee in the amount of $750,000 if the merger agreement is
terminated by Global Sports because one of the "triggering events" described
above occurs. In such event, the termination fee would be payable promptly
following termination of the merger agreement. In addition, Ashford has agreed
to pay Global Sports a termination fee in the amount of $750,000 if the merger
agreement is terminated by either Ashford or Global Sports because the merger
is not consummated by March 31, 2002, or because Ashford stockholders fail to
adopt the merger agreement, provided in either case that, between the date of
the merger agreement and the time of the termination of the merger agreement,
an acquisition proposal has been disclosed, announced, commenced, submitted or
made, and Ashford consummates or is subject to an acquisition transaction
within one year of the termination of the merger agreement or Ashford or any of
its representatives signs a definitive agreement or letter of intent within one
year of the termination of the merger agreement providing for an acquisition
transaction. In such event, the termination fee would be payable upon or prior
to the consummation of such acquisition transaction.

   In addition, the merger agreement provides that, if (a) the merger agreement
is terminated by Global Sports because one of the "triggering events" described
above occurs, (b) the merger agreement is terminated by either

Ashford or Global Sports because the merger is not consummated by March 31,
2002 and between the date of the merger agreement and the time of the
termination of the merger agreement, an acquisition proposal has been
disclosed, announced, commenced, submitted or made, or (c) the merger agreement
is terminated by either Ashford or Global Sports because Ashford stockholders
fail to adopt the merger agreement, then Ashford will be obligated to make a
nonrefundable cash payment to Global Sports, upon or promptly following the
termination of the merger agreement, in an amount equal to the aggregate amount
of all fees and expenses that have been paid or that may become payable by or
on behalf of Global Sports in connection with the preparation and negotiation
of the merger agreement and otherwise in connection with the merger.

Amendment

   The merger agreement may be amended at any time, whether before or after the
adoption of the merger agreement by Ashford stockholders, with the approval of
Global Sports' board of directors and Ashford's board of directors. However,
after the adoption of the merger agreement by Ashford stockholders, no
amendment which by law requires the approval of Ashford stockholders will be
effective until approved by Ashford stockholders.

Overview of Ashford

   Ashford is a Web-based retailer focused on luxury and premium products,
including new and vintage watches, clocks, diamonds, jewelry, leather goods,
writing instruments, fragrances, and sunglasses, altogether offering more than
12,000 styles of products from over 300 leading luxury brands. Since late 1999,
Ashford has rapidly expanded its primary product focus from offering only new
watches to offering 11 different product categories. Ashford's strategy has
been to add complementary products to create a portfolio that combines items
purchased frequently, such as leather and sunglasses, with higher priced items
purchased less frequently, such as watches and diamonds. In March 2000, Ashford
launched its corporate gift business, which offers an additional 800 luxury
products in new categories such as crystal, silver and pewter that are targeted
to the corporate market. By combining its expertise in luxury products and its
commitment to excellent customer service with the benefits of Internet
retailing, Ashford is able to deliver a unique shopping experience to its
retail and corporate consumers. Ashford believes that its current luxury and
premium product offerings are well suited for online commerce given its brand
recognition, generally high average sales prices and relatively low average
distribution and shipping costs.

   Ashford's Web site features detailed product information, helpful and useful
shopping services and innovative merchandising through easy-to-navigate Web
pages. Ashford offers customers the convenience and flexibility of shopping 24
hours a day, seven days a week, from their homes, offices or other locations.
In addition, with the exception of diamonds, Ashford carries almost all of the
products it sells in inventory, which enables it to ship most products to its
customers within 24 hours. Ashford's customer service representatives are
available through phone and e-mail and are trained to answer a broad array of
questions regarding product styles, features and technical specifications, as
well as provide product recommendations. This informative and high-quality
shopping experience provides luxury brand owners a Web-based retail channel
consistent with the luxury character and premium quality of their products.

Industry Overview

  Growth of the Internet and Online Commerce

   Internet usage and online commerce continue to grow worldwide. International
Data Corporation, or IDC, estimates that there were 142 million Web users
worldwide at the end of 1998. IDC anticipates that number will grow to
approximately 502 million users by the end of 2003. IDC also estimates that
revenue generated worldwide from online commerce will exceed $1.3 trillion by
2003, although growth rates for online commerce for luxury and premium products
and the growth rate for its business may differ significantly from the growth
of online commerce generally. These projected growth rates can be attributed to
many factors, including:

  .  a large and growing installed base of personal computers and other
     Internet-connected devices in the workplace and home;

  .  advances in performance and speed of personal computers and modems;

  .  improvements in network security, infrastructure and bandwidth;

  .  easier and cheaper access to the Internet; and

  .  the rapidly expanding availability of online content and commerce sites.

   The growth in online commerce can also be attributed to a number of
advantages the Internet provides to online retailers. Online retailers can
display a larger number of products at a lower cost than traditional
store-based or catalog retailers. In addition, online retailers can rapidly
adjust their selections, editorial content and pricing, providing significant
merchandising flexibility. Online retailers also benefit from the minimal cost
to publish on the Web, the ability to reach a large group of customers from a
central location, and the potential for low-cost customer interaction. Unlike
traditional retail channels, online retailers do not have the cost of managing
and maintaining a retail store infrastructure or the significant printing and
mailing costs of catalogs. Online retailers can also easily obtain demographic
and behavioral data about customers, increasing opportunities for direct
marketing and personalized services. The benefits of online retailing should be
viewed in the context of the inherent challenges of online retailing, such as
the expenses of establishing and maintaining a Web site, reliance on newly
developed Internet technology, coordinating new distribution channels, and the
difficulty of converting a Web site visitor to a purchaser given limitations
such as a customer's inability to physically inspect, try on or use a product.

  Traditional Luxury Goods Market

   The luxury goods market includes a broad selection of product categories.
Based on data from Global Industry Analysts and DataMonitor, leading
independent market research companies, and Ashford's own internal research,
Ashford estimates the worldwide market for luxury and premium lifestyle
products to be greater than $130 billion. This market includes fine watches and
other luxury and premium product categories, such as sunglasses, fragrances,
leather goods, ties and scarves, jewelry and corporate gifts. Ashford believes
that its current luxury and premium product categories represent a significant
online commerce opportunity.

   Traditional retail channels for luxury and premium products. Ashford
believes that the traditional retailers for luxury and premium products in the
United States today can be grouped as follows:

  .  high-end department stores and jewelry stores that often strive to provide
     a high level of customer service and a knowledgeable sales staff, but
     typically offer a limited selection of mid-range to high-end products;

  .  national department stores that tend to carry broad selections of low-end
     to mid-range products from brands that are complementary to the stores'
     other offerings, but typically offer limited product-specific customer
     service;

  .  specialty and single-brand stores, which are retail locations that carry a
     broad selection of specific product categories, but are limited to the
     geographic region in which the few physical stores are located; and

  .  boutiques, which are small stores, often located in malls that generally
     carry a selection of the latest trends in lower-priced fashion products
     and accessories.

   Challenges in traditional luxury goods retailing. Ashford believes that
traditional store-based retailers face a number of challenges in providing a
satisfactory shopping experience for buyers of luxury and premium products.

  .  Selection is limited because physical retail space constrains the number
     of styles and the amount of product inventory that may be carried by any
     one store. In addition, the significant carrying costs of physical
     inventory in multiple store locations require traditional store-based
     retailers to focus their product selection on the most popular products
     that produce the highest inventory turns, further limiting consumer
     selection.

  .  Traditional store-based retailers have a high cost structure. Most of the
     leading luxury and premium product retailers are located either in the
     most exclusive and expensive shopping locales or in high-cost retail
     outlets or malls, both of which must be in close proximity to the target
     buyers. This is because their sales are dependent on serving customers who
     are willing to physically visit their stores.

  .  Traditional retailers sell luxury products often at a significantly higher
     price than wholesale to cover high operating costs. As a result, consumers
     ultimately pay for the high cost structure of the retail store.

  .  The needs of luxury goods customers are changing. Increasingly, luxury
     goods brands are appealing to a broader, time-constrained customer base
     that is not willing or able to spend the time necessary to shop in
     traditional store-based retail locations.

  .  In many cases, customers are served by employees with limited knowledge
     regarding the features of the products they sell, whether due to high
     employee turnover, limited training or other factors.

  .  Traditional store-based retailers can only serve those customers who have
     convenient access to their stores. These store-based retailers must open
     new stores to serve additional geographic areas, resulting in significant
     investments in inventory, physical space, leasehold improvements and the
     hiring and training of store personnel.

   Ashford believes that these challenges facing traditional store-based
retailers limit their ability to offer an extensive selection of luxury and
premium products, broad geographic coverage and convenient access, and staff
that is sufficiently knowledgeable to assist with significant customer
decisions typically involving purchases of several hundred dollars. As a
result, Ashford believes customers often do not find shopping for luxury and
premium products to be a convenient or enjoyable experience.

  The Ashford.com Solution

   Ashford's online store is designed to provide consumers with a convenient
and enjoyable shopping experience in a Web-based retail environment. Ashford
provides an extensive selection, detailed product information that enables
consumers to make informed decisions, competitive pricing compared to
traditional retail channels, a commitment to the highest level of customer
service and the convenience of online shopping. The key components of the
Ashford.com experience include:

   Extensive product selection. Ashford offers a broad selection of luxury and
premium products that would be economically and physically difficult to offer
in a traditional store, together with the unique environment of the Internet
that enables Ashford to dynamically adjust its product mix and merchandising
strategy. Ashford's online store offers over 12,000 styles of products from
over 300 leading luxury brands across 11 product categories. Additionally, some
of the brands Ashford offers lack a U.S. distribution network, making them hard
to find in traditional retail outlets. Ashford believes that its extensive
selection increases the likelihood that the consumer will find the product they
would like to purchase.

   Compelling content and detailed product information. Ashford's Web site
includes significant content and detailed product information to provide its
customers with a convenient and enjoyable shopping experience. Ashford's Web
site displays detailed product descriptions and product photos. For certain
brands, Ashford is dedicated pages to communicating specific brand histories
and key messages. Ashford also employs specialists with product expertise, such
as master watchmakers and a certified gemologist, who are available to address
detailed customer questions by phone or e-mail. Ashford's goal is to provide
its customers with the product information they need to make educated and
highly satisfactory purchase decisions.

   Competitive prices and compelling value. Ashford offers its customers
products at competitive prices and, combined with its high-quality shopping
experience, provides compelling value.

   Commitment to excellent customer service. Luxury and premium goods consumers
expect the highest level of personalized customer service, which Ashford is
committed to providing. Ashford's customer service

representatives are available through phone and e-mail and are trained to
answer a broad array of questions regarding product styles, features and
technical specifications, as well as provide product recommendations. Before
shipping, Ashford inspects each product, and in the case of watches, sets the
time and date for the customer. In addition, Ashford offers gift-wrapping and
same-day shipping on orders placed before 4:00 p.m. CST (2:00 p.m. CST for
items in the diamonds and bridal department) and standard overnight shipping in
the United States. Ashford also offers a 30-day return policy on all products
to ensure customer satisfaction. Ashford also offers its watch customers a
certification of authenticity, repair and battery replacement services and an
Ashford.com warranty for the length of the manufacturer's warranty.

   Personalized shopping experience. Ashford provides a convenient and
enjoyable shopping experience that addresses the dynamic needs of the luxury
goods customer. These services are designed to help consumers search through
Ashford's product offerings and make informed selections. Ashford's services
include:

  .  Search capability. Ashford's site offers search capabilities making it
     easy for customers to find products on the site. Search criteria include

  .  Real-time customer interaction. Using real-time, online customer
     interaction software, Ashford's customer service representatives are able
     to answer specific questions about its products and services. This feature
     allows customers shopping from home with just one phone line to
     communicate in real-time with a customer service representative without
     losing their Internet connection and leaving Ashford's online store.

  .  In-stock notification. With the exception of diamonds, Ashford carries
     almost all of its products in inventory. For items in stock, Ashford
     clearly indicates to the customer on its Web site that Ashford can ship
     the product generally within 24 hours. For an item not currently in stock,
     Ashford indicates on its Web site that the customer can expect a longer
     delivery time.

  .  Gifts and wish list. Ashford provides a variety of gift suggestions and
     feature product suggestions for particular holidays. Ashford also provides
     a wish list service that customers can use to provide friends and
     relatives with gift ideas by e-mail. Customers buying gifts can choose
     among a variety of gift-wrap styles at the time of order.

  .  Shopping hours. Ashford's online store provides consumers the opportunity
     to shop from their homes, offices or other locations 24 hours a day, seven
     days a week.

   Geographic coverage. By selling online, Ashford is able to sell products
throughout the U.S. and worldwide where the products might not otherwise be
available. In addition, consumers are able to go to one location and find an
extensive selection as opposed to visiting several stores with limited product
offerings.

Business Strategy

   Ashford's objective is to be one of the leading online retailers of luxury
and premium products. Key elements of its strategy include:

   Focus on the premium retail watch market. Ashford has become what it
believes to be one of the leading sellers of watches on the Internet by
providing thousands of styles of new and vintage watches from premium brands at
competitive prices. Ashford intends to capitalize on its online market position
in watches to become the primary destination for consumers to purchase premium
watches. Ashford's objective is to grow its market position and expand its
customer base through superior execution and strong relationships with luxury
and premium brand owners.

   Extend leadership position in fine watches to other product categories.
Ashford believes that there are excellent online market opportunities for a
variety of luxury and premium products, including leather goods, sunglasses,
fragrances, diamonds and jewelry. Over the past two years Ashford has enhanced
its product offerings by expanding into these luxury and premium product
categories, which has enabled it to leverage its

customer base, brand name, merchandising expertise and distribution
capabilities. Ashford believes that offering a broad selection of luxury goods
will enable it to increase sales per customer visit, encourage repeat purchases
and expand its customer base.

   Leverage leadership position in luxury and premium products to the corporate
gifts market. Ashford believes that there are excellent online opportunities
targeted to the business market for corporate gifts. Ashford believes that the
combination of its extensive selection, hands-on customer service and the
efficiencies of the Internet allow it to offer corporate accounts a more
convenient, customized and value added service. Ashford's objective is to grow
its market position in the corporate gift category by adding a regionalized
sales force to provide personalized service and access to premium brands more
conveniently via the Internet.

   Build Ashford.com experience and brand. Ashford intends to establish a brand
identity that will support the creation of an Internet luxury community and
provide luxury brand owners a powerful new distribution channel consistent with
their luxury identities. Ashford will focus its brand campaign on convenience,
value, selection, trust and service. Ashford intends to create an environment
where its shoppers are confident that they have found a smarter, easier and
more compelling way to buy luxury goods. Ashford believes this approach will
support an ongoing relationship with and sales to its target customers who are
more likely to purchase its products.

   Expand relationships with leading luxury brands. Ashford's intent is to be
the Internet retailer of choice for luxury and premium brands. Direct
relationships enable Ashford to purchase products more efficiently. Ashford
believes that its merchandising history and well-established relationships with
brand owners enable it to provide its customers with compelling product
offerings, while giving it access to additional sources of merchandise.

   Pursue ways to increase Ashford's sales. Ashford intends to pursue new
opportunities to increase its sales by:

  .  continuing to take steps to add new customers and to promote repeat
     purchases;

  .  establishing advantageous relationships with distributors and brand
     owners; and

  .  acquiring complementary businesses, products and technologies.

   Expand Ashford's operational and systems infrastructure. Ashford plans to

infrastructure to handle increased volume, enhance its service offerings and
take advantage of the unique characteristics of online luxury goods retailing.
Ashford has developed technologies and implemented systems to support secure

pencils and stationery from leading brands, with prices generally ranging from
$20 to over $2,000. The collection includes over 700 styles from over 35
leading brands.

   Sunglasses. This department offers Ashford's growing collection of
sunglasses, with prices generally ranging from $50 to over $350. The collection
includes over 500 styles from 35 brands.

   Fragrances. The fragrance department offers a broad selection of over 200
fragrances. Ashford's prices in this department generally range from $30 to
$75.

   Leather goods and handbags. This department offers over 500 styles of
leather goods products from 25 brands. Ashford's prices in this department
generally range from $25 to $1,200.

   In March 2000, Ashford launched its corporate gift business offering an
additional 800 luxury products in new categories such as crystal, silver and
pewter that are targeted for the corporate market. Ashford believes that the
corporate gift market complements its retail offerings because it is less
seasonal and offers the opportunity for higher margins. In addition to offering
thematically organized corporate gifts, Ashford.com offers custom engraving,
etching and embossing to its corporate customers.

Merchandising

   Ashford believes that the breadth and depth of its product selection,
together with the flexibility of its online store and its range of helpful and
useful shopping services, enable it to pursue a unique merchandising strategy.
Unlike store-based retail formats, Ashford's online store provides it with
significant flexibility with regard to the organization and presentation of its
product selection. To encourage purchases, Ashford features various promotions
on a rotating basis throughout the store and continually updates its online
recommendations. Ashford also actively creates and maintains pages that are
designed to highlight certain products and brands. The following are examples
of some of its specific merchandising strategies.

   Featured products. Ashford frequently gives a product prominent placement on
the site, describes its key features and potentially highlights it as its
"collector's choice." Products that receive this merchandising focus generally
receive a boost in sales.

   Product bundling. To promote purchases of higher value items, Ashford
combines products from its large selection to offer bundling promotions.

   Special promotions. Ashford offers certain products on promotion and provide
special pricing. The technological advantages of online retailing, compared to
traditional store-based retailing, allow Ashford to adjust its promotions
rapidly to promote targeted sales.

   Ashford employs a dedicated team of buyers and merchandisers that
continually monitor the consistency and quality of Ashford's merchandising
efforts. This team, combined with its technology, is able to pursue a
merchandising strategy in which Ashford dynamically changes its product
offerings to enhance the consumer's shopping experience.

Marketing and Promotion

   Ashford has designed its marketing and promotion strategy to build the
Ashford.com brand, increase customer traffic, promote the sales of new
products, maximize repeat purchases and build strong customer loyalty.
Ashford's marketing and promotional activities primarily target a customer
demographic that is more likely to buy its luxury and premium products. These
activities include both offline and online advertising. In fiscal 2001, Ashford
spent approximately $11.9 million on advertising, of which approximately 50%
was spent online.

   Online advertising. Ashford has agreements with significant Internet
destinations under which its advertisement banner will appear on the screen
each time one of over several hundred watches or fashion accessory-related
words is entered as a search term by a user. Ashford also has month-to-month
banner advertising agreements with a broad range of online sites, including
major online portals. These agreements typically provide for minimum
impressions and Ashford renews these agreements on a month-to-month basis
depending on results. Ashford also advertises its site in conjunction with
other major online portals, Internet service providers and luxury and premium
market-related Web sites to build its brand and increase Ashford's reach on the
Internet. In addition, Ashford is an affiliate program and other initiatives
aimed at increasing traffic and supporting its brand development. Under its
affiliate program, Ashford pays its registered affiliates referral fees for
sales generated via their links to its Web site.

   Online direct marketing. As its customer base grows, Ashford continues to
collect significant data about its customers' buying preferences and habits in
an effort to increase repeat purchases. Ashford intends to maximize the value
of this information by delivering meaningful information and special offers to
its customers via e-mail and other means. In addition, Ashford publishes a
weekly, online newsletter delivered by e-mail to subscribers in which Ashford
highlights important developments and special promotions.

   Offline advertising. Ashford has used offline advertising to promote both
its brand and specific merchandising opportunities. Ashford's offline
advertising has primarily consisted of television advertisements and print
advertisements in magazines and newspapers. During fiscal 2001, Ashford shifted
its primary marketing focus from traditional print and broadcast media to
Internet and online media. Ashford believes Internet and online media provides
a more efficient and economical means of attracting new customers.

   Other promotional activities. During April 2000, Ashford gave away the
Ashford Diamond, a 15-carat, colorless, internally flawless, pear-shaped
diamond worth an estimated $1.5 million as part of the Ashford.com Million
Dollar Diamond Giveaway contest. The promotion ran for several months during
the year and as part of the promotion Ashford made donations to designated
charities.

Fulfillment Operations

   Ashford obtains its products from brands and a diverse network of
distributors, brokers and retailers. Ashford has ongoing efforts to continue to
expand the number of direct relationships with brand owners in all its

product categories. For brands where Ashford does not have direct
relationships, Ashford buys products from a network of distributors, brokers
and retailers.

   With the exception of diamonds, Ashford carries inventory on almost all of
the products available for sale on its site. Ashford stores its products and
conducts its fulfillment operations in its headquarters facility located in
Houston, Texas. When Ashford receives an order, Ashford immediately begins the
packaging and shipping operation. Most orders are shipped on the date of order
entry. Ashford's inventory management system tracks the quantities of all stock
keeping units, which enables it to display information about the availability
of the products on Ashford's Web site.

   Ashford offers overnight shipping on all orders and next-day delivery on
orders placed before 4:00 p.m. CST (2:00 p.m. CST for items in the diamonds and
bridal department) along with a variety of other convenient delivery options.
Ashford has developed relationships with both United Parcel Service and Federal
Express to maximize its overall service level to all 50 states. The ability to
provide overnight delivery is an important ongoing service for its customers.

Customer Service

   Ashford believes that its ability to establish and maintain long-term
relationships with its customers, earn their trust and encourage repeat visits
and purchases, largely depends on the strength of its customer support and
fulfillment operations and staff. Ashford is committed to providing the high
level of personalized customer service that luxury and premium goods consumers
expect. Ashford has a high-quality customer service staff with a broad range of
experience and knowledge enabling it to quickly respond to customer phone calls
and e-mails. Ashford provides extensive training to its customer service
representatives, including on-site training from manufacturers, to allow its
representatives to answer a broad array of questions regarding product styles,
features and technical specifications, as well as provide product
recommendations.

   Ashford's customer service representatives are available through phone and
e-mail 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Before shipment, Ashford inspects
each product, and in the case of watches, adjusts the date and sets the time
for the customer. With the exception of diamonds, Ashford ships almost all of
its products on the date of order entry. Once shipment is made, Ashford
immediately sends e-mail confirmation to the customer. Ashford offers a 30-day
return policy on all products. Ashford also offers its watch customers a
certification of authenticity, repair and battery replacement services and an
extended warranty.

Operations and Technology

   Ashford has implemented a broad array of site management, search, customer
interaction and distribution services and systems that Ashford uses to process
customer orders and payments. These services and systems use a combination of
Ashford's own and commercially available, licensed technologies. These
applications also manage the process of accepting, authorizing and charging
customer credit card orders with an address verification and approval system.
Ashford focuses its internal development efforts on creating, implementing and
enhancing specialized software that it uses to:

  .  accept and validate customer orders;

  .  enable customer service representatives to engage in real-time, online
     interaction with multiple customers simultaneously;

  .  organize, place and manage orders with vendors;

  .  receive product and assign it to customer orders; and

  .  manage shipment of products to customers based on various ordering
     criteria.

   Ashford's systems are based on industry-standard architectures and have been
designed to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic
occurrences. Ashford's Web site is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Ashford's system hardware is hosted at a third-party facility in Houston,
Texas, which provides redundant communications lines and emergency power
backup. Ashford has implemented load balancing systems and redundant servers to
provide fault tolerant service.

   The market in which Ashford competes is characterized by rapidly changing
technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new service and product
announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. Accordingly,
Ashford's future success will depend on its ability to:

  .  adapt to rapidly changing technologies;

  .  adapt its services to evolving industry standards; and

  .  continually improve the performance, features and reliability of its
     service in response to competitive service and product offerings and
     evolving demands of the marketplace.

   Ashford's failure to adapt to market changes could harm its business. In
addition, the widespread adoption of new Internet, networking or
telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require
substantial expenditures by Ashford to modify or adapt its services or
infrastructure. This could have a material adverse effect on Ashford's
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Government Regulation

   Ashford is not currently subject to direct federal, state or local
regulation other than regulations applicable to businesses generally and
directly applicable to online commerce, as well as the secondhand watch
statutes enacted in several states, as discussed below. However, as Internet
use gains popularity, it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may
be adopted with respect to the Internet. These laws may cover issues such as
user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, content and quality of products
and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights and
information security. Furthermore, the growth of online commerce may prompt
calls for more stringent consumer protection laws. Several states have proposed
legislation to limit the uses of personal user information gathered online or
require online services to establish privacy policies. The Federal Trade
Commission has also initiated action against at least one online service
regarding the manner in which personal information is collected from users and
provided to third parties. Ashford does not currently provide personal
information regarding its users to third parties. However, the adoption of
additional consumer protection laws could create uncertainty in Web usage and
reduce the demand for Ashford's products and services.

   Ashford is not certain how its business may be affected by the application
of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, copyrights,
encryption and other intellectual property issues, taxation, libel, obscenity
and export or import matters. The vast majority of these laws were adopted
prior to the advent of the Internet. As a result, they do not contemplate or
address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies. Changes in
laws that are intended to address these issues could create uncertainty in the
Internet market place. This uncertainty could reduce demand for Ashford's
services or its cost of doing business may increase as a result of litigation
costs or increased service delivery costs.

   In addition, because Ashford's services are available over the Internet in
multiple states and foreign countries, other jurisdictions may claim that
Ashford is required to qualify to do business in that state or foreign country.
Ashford's failure to qualify in a jurisdiction where it is required to do so
could subject it to taxes and penalties. It could also hamper Ashford's ability
to enforce contracts in these jurisdictions. The application of laws or
regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to Ashford's
business could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of
operations and financial condition.

   Several states have laws regulating the sale of secondhand watches. For
example, California, New York and Texas prohibit anyone from representing as
"new" any watch that has had its serial number removed. Pursuant to

these laws, a watch with a serial number removed must clearly be labeled as
"secondhand" even if it has never been worn. Ashford has implemented procedures
whereby all of its buyers explicitly communicate to suppliers that Ashford will
only buy a watch if its serial number has not been removed. In addition,
Ashford inspects each watch it sells that is manufactured with a serial number
to ensure that the watch has a serial number prior to shipment. If a court were
to find, however, that Ashford is violated these statutes, it could be subject
to civil or criminal penalties.

Competition

   The online commerce market is new, rapidly evolving and intensely
competitive. Since the introduction of online commerce, the number of online
commerce Web sites competing for customer attention has increased rapidly.
Ashford expects future competition to intensify given the relative ease with
which new Web sites can be developed.

   Ashford currently competes or potentially will compete with a variety of
competitors, including the following:

  .  traditional retailers of luxury and premium products, which may compete
     with both an online and offline presence, including high-end department
     stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, jewelers such as Zales
     and national department stores such as Macy's;

  .  manufacturers of Ashford's products that decide to sell directly to
     end-customers, either through physical retail outlets or through an online
     store;

  .  other online retailers of luxury and premium products, including online
     service providers that feature shopping services; and

  .  catalog retailers of luxury and premium products.

   Ashford believes that the following are the principal competitive factors in
its market:

  .  brand recognition;

  .  selection;

  .  convenience;

  .  order delivery performance;

  .  customer service;

  .  site features and content; and

  .  price.

   Many of Ashford's current and potential traditional store-based and online
competitors, particularly the traditional store-based retailers and the brand
owners of products Ashford sells, have longer operating histories, larger
customer or user bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater
financial, marketing and other resources than Ashford does. Many of these
current and potential competitors can devote substantially more resources to
Web site and systems development than Ashford can. In addition, larger,
well-established and well-financed entities may acquire, invest in or form
joint ventures with online competitors.

   Ashford's competitors may be able to secure products from vendors on more
favorable terms, fulfill customer orders more efficiently and adopt more
aggressive pricing or inventory availability policies than Ashford can.
Traditional store-based retailers also enable customers to see and feel
products in a manner that is not possible over the Internet. Given Ashford's
limited operating history, many of its competitors have significantly greater
experience selling luxury and premium products. For example, established
catalog retailers may have greater experience than Ashford does in marketing
and selling goods with in-person customer interaction.

   Ashford's online competitors are particularly able to use the Internet as a
marketing medium to reach significant numbers of potential customers. Finally,
new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies,

such as price comparison programs that select specific titles from a variety of
Web sites and may direct customers to other online retailers, may increase
competition.

Intellectual Property

   Ashford relies on various intellectual property laws and contractual
restrictions to protect its proprietary rights in products and services. These
include confidentiality, invention assignment and nondisclosure agreements with
Ashford's employees, contractors, vendors and strategic partners. Despite these
precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain
and use Ashford's intellectual property without Ashford's authorization. In
addition, Ashford pursues the registration of its trademarks and service marks
in the U.S. and internationally. However, effective intellectual property
protection may not be available in every country in which Ashford's services
are made available online.

   Ashford relies on technologies that it licenses from third parties. These
licenses may not continue to be available to Ashford on commercially reasonable
terms in the future. As a result, Ashford may be required to obtain substitute
technology of lower quality or at greater cost, which could materially
adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.

   As of the date of this filing, Ashford is not been notified that its
technologies infringe the proprietary rights of any third party. However, there
can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by Ashford
with respect to its current or future technologies. Ashford expects that
participants in its markets will be increasingly subject to infringement claims
as the number of services and competitors in its industry segment grows. Any
infringement claim, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in
costly litigation, cause service upgrade delays or require Ashford to enter
into royalty or licensing agreements. These royalty or licensing agreements
might not be available on terms acceptable to Ashford or at all. As a result,
any claim of infringement against Ashford could have a material adverse effect
upon its business.

Employees

   As of September 30, 2001, Ashford had 170 full-time and part-time employees.
Ashford also employs independent contractors to perform duties in various
departments. None of Ashford's employees is represented by a labor union.
Ashford has not had any work stoppages and consider its employee relations to
be good. Ashford believes that its success is dependent on its ability to
attract and retain qualified personnel in numerous areas.

Properties

   Ashford's corporate offices and fulfillment operations are located in
Houston, Texas, where Ashford leases approximately 76,000 square feet under a
lease that provides for aggregate annual lease payments through the term of the
lease expiring in April 2003.

Legal Proceedings

   Since July 11, 2001, several stockholder class action complaints have been
filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
against Ashford, several of Ashford's officers and directors, and various
underwriters of Ashford's initial public offering. The purported class actions
have all been brought on behalf of purchasers of Ashford common stock during
various periods beginning on September 22, 1999, the date of Ashford's initial
public offering. The plaintiffs allege that Ashford's prospectus, incorporated
in Ashford's Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, was materially false and misleading because it failed to
disclose, among other things, certain fees and commissions collected by the
underwriters or arrangements designed to inflate the price of the common stock.
The plaintiffs further allege that because of these purchases, Ashford's
post-initial public offering stock price was artificially inflated. As a result
of the alleged omissions in the prospectus and the purported inflation of the
stock price, the plaintiffs claim violations of Sections 11 and 15 of the
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. The complaints have been consolidated into a single action. Ashford
believes that it has meritorious defenses against these actions and intends to
vigorously defend them. Ashford is also subject to various other claims and
legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of
Ashford's management, after consultation with legal counsel, the ultimate
disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on
Ashford's business, financial condition or results of operations.

           ASHFORD MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
                      CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

   The discussion in this prospectus/proxy statement contains forward-looking
statements (as such term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that involve risks
and uncertainties. Ashford's actual results could differ materially from those
discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences
include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this section and in the
"Risk Factors" section included in this prospectus/proxy statement.

Overview

   Ashford was incorporated on March 6, 1998 and commenced operations and began
offering products for sale on its Web site in April 1998. Ashford initially
focused exclusively on the sale of new and vintage watches. Since inception,
Ashford has focused on broadening its product offerings, establishing
relationships with luxury and premium brand owners, generating sales momentum
and expanding its operational and customer service capabilities. Ashford has
grown rapidly since launching its site in April 1998 and has experienced
significant increases in its net sales and corresponding cost of sales since
inception. Ashford currently offers more than 12,000 styles of products from
over 300 leading luxury brands. Ashford is currently focusing its efforts on
continuing to increase net sales while maintaining or decreasing current
expense levels. Ashford plans to continue the growth of its corporate gift
business, which generally generates higher margin sales and is less seasonal in
nature than its traditional retail sales, and its newer, higher margin product
categories, such as its Ashford Collection jewelry. As part of a larger effort
to improve overall operating efficiencies and lower total operating costs as a
percentage of sales, Ashford has specifically reduced its traditional print and
media marketing activities and has focused on Internet and online media, which
Ashford believes to be a more efficient and economical means of attracting new
customers. Other specific initiatives designed to improve financial performance
and liquidity management include reducing the scope of product offerings,
decreasing Ashford's investment in inventory and eliminating certain operating
costs, including personnel costs.

   As stated above, Ashford plans to continue the growth of its corporate gift
business, which was introduced in March 2000. Ashford's corporate gift business
offers over 800 products such as crystal, silver and pewter that appeal to the
corporate market. These products usually generate higher margin sales and are
less seasonal in nature than its traditional retail sales. Also, many corporate
gift products are finished with custom engraving, etching or embossing, which
further increases Ashford's margin.

   The market for luxury and premium products is highly seasonal, with a
disproportionate amount of net sales occurring during the fourth calendar
quarter. Therefore, Ashford increases its purchases of inventory during and in
advance of that quarter. Although less significant, seasonal sales periods
occur in February due to Valentine's Day and in May and June due to graduation
gift giving, Mother's Day and Father's Day. Ashford expects that these trends
will continue in future periods.

   Ashford's gross margin will fluctuate in future periods based on factors
such as:

  .  product sales mix;

  .  the mix of direct and indirect sources of inventory;

  .  pricing strategy;

  .  promotional activities;

  .  inventory management; and

  .  inbound and outbound shipping costs.

   Ashford has incurred net losses since inception and expects to generate
negative cash flows during future periods. Ashford's ability to become
profitable depends on its ability to generate and sustain substantially higher

net sales while maintaining reasonable expense levels, both of which are
uncertain. If Ashford does achieve profitability, it cannot be certain that it
would be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual
basis in the future.

   Ashford has a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of
its business and prospects. As a result of Ashford's limited operating history,
it is difficult to accurately forecast Ashford's net sales, and Ashford has
limited meaningful historical financial data upon which to base projected
operating expenses. Ashford bases its current and future expense levels on its
operating plans and estimates of future net sales, and its expenses are fixed
to a large extent. Sales and operating results are difficult to forecast
because they generally depend on the volume and timing of the orders Ashford
receives. As a result, Ashford may be unable to adjust its spending in a timely
manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. This inability could
cause Ashford's net losses in a given quarter to be greater than expected and
could significantly limit or delay its ability to generate net profits in any
future period.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an investigation
concerning Ashford's accounting and disclosures relating to certain marketing
activities during fiscal years 2000 and 2001. Ashford has been cooperating with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Ashford will continue to do so.
Ashford's audit committee also has completed an internal review of certain
matters related to the Securities and Exchange Commission review. Ashford does
not believe that any of the accounting issues raised by the Securities and
Exchange Commission will have a material effect on its financial statements.

Results of Operations

  Comparison of the Three-Month Period Ended June 30, 2001 and the Three-Month
  Period Ended June 30, 2000:

   Net Sales

   Net sales consist of product sales and are net of product returns, coupons
and promotional discounts. Net sales decreased from $13.1 million for quarter
ended June 30, 2000 to $12.1 million for quarter ended June 30, 2001. The
decrease in net sales was affected by a general decline in retail spending and
reduced marketing and sales efforts net of an increase in corporate gift
activity attributed to the addition of new salespeople and a business
acquisition during the quarter ended December 2000.

   Cost of Sales

   Cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of products sold, free product
and service incentives delivered to customers at the time of sale, inbound and
outbound shipping costs and warranty and inventory obsolescence costs. Cost of
sales decreased as net sales decreased. Gross profit decreased from $2.4
million for quarter ended June 30, 2000 to $2.0 million for quarter ended June
30, 2001. Gross margin decreased from 19% for the quarter ended June 30, 2000
to 17% for the quarter ended June 30, 2001. Gross margin was affected by a
targeted promotional offer implemented with one of Ashford's corporate
marketing partners during the June 2001 quarter and by its actions to narrow
product assortment and reduce its overall investment in merchandise inventory
net of increased sales from corporate gifts which generally generate higher
gross margin. Ashford anticipates gross margin improvements in future periods
as Ashford continues to grow its corporate gift business, develop its newer
higher-margin product categories such as home and lifestyle products and its
Ashford Collection jewelry, and complete its activities to reduce product
assortment and to reduce its overall investment in merchandise inventory.
Ashford also expects gross margin improvements in future periods as a result of
its efforts to reduce certain expenses such as outbound shipping costs which
now are paid by the customer on most orders.

   Operating Expenses

   Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of
advertising costs, credit card fees, fulfillment activities and related
employee salary and benefit expenses and amortization of related deferred

compensation. Fulfillment activities include receiving of goods, picking of
goods for shipment and packaging of goods for shipment. Fulfillment costs,
including the cost of operating and staffing distribution centers, are included
in marketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses decreased from
approximately $32.8 million for quarter ended June 30, 2000 to $3.1 million for
quarter ended June 30, 2001. The decrease in marketing and sales is
attributable to a decrease in non-cash amortization from $26.0 million for
quarter ended June 30, 2000 to $0.3 million for quarter ended June 30, 2001
primarily relating to a marketing contract entered into with another online
retailer during the latter part of fiscal 2000 that expired in fiscal 2001.
Excluding non-cash amortization, the decrease in marketing and sales is
primarily attributable to a reduction in traditional print and media marketing
activities and implementation of new and modified agreements with Internet and
online media providers at improved advertising rates or with
pay-for-performance provisions. During fiscal 2001, Ashford shifted its primary
marketing focus from traditional print and broadcast media to Internet and
online media. Ashford believes Internet and online media provides a more
efficient and economical means of attracting new customers. Ashford's
advertising and promotional expenditures are generally intended to build brand
awareness, generate site traffic and increase overall sales. Ashford expects
its marketing and sales expense to continue to decline as a percentage of sales
in future periods as Ashford continues its focus of becoming more efficient and
economical at acquiring customers. See also "Recent Accounting Pronouncements."

   General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses include
executive, finance and administrative employee salaries and benefits,
amortization of related deferred compensation, professional fees, Web site
maintenance, office lease expenses and other general corporate expenses.
General and administrative expenses decreased from $6.7 million for quarter
ended June 30, 2000 to $5.5 million for quarter ended June 30, 2001. Ashford's
general and administrative expenses have decreased primarily due to costs
associated with decreased headcount as a result of its restructuring activities
during January 2001 and May 2001 and decreased amortization of related deferred
compensation. Ashford expects its general and administrative expenses to
continue to decline in future periods as Ashford realizes a full period of
benefit from restructuring activities during May 2001, and as it implements
further operating cost efficiencies.

   Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense
includes depreciation related to property and equipment and amortization
related to intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization expense increased
from $2.7 million for quarter ended June 30, 2000 to $3.9 million for quarter
ended June 30, 2001. The increase is primarily due to depreciation and
amortization expense related to Internet domain and other intangible asset
purchases.

   Interest Income. Interest income consists of earnings on cash and cash
equivalents. The decrease in interest income for quarter ended June 30, 2001 is
due to lower cash balances during the quarter. See also "Liquidity and Capital
Resources."

   Interest Expense. Interest expense consists of interest costs on borrowings.
The increase in interest expense for quarter ended June 30, 2001 is due to
borrowings on its revolving credit facility entered into during September 2000.

  Comparison of Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000:

   Net Sales

   Net sales consist of product sales and are net of product returns, coupons
and promotional discounts. Net sales increased from $39.9 million for fiscal
2000 to $67.2 million for fiscal 2001. The growth in net sales is primarily
related to an increase in units sold due to the growth of Ashford's customer
base and the growth of its corporate gift business, including a business
acquisition. The growth in the rate of repeat purchases from existing customers
and the introduction of new product lines during the latter part of fiscal 2000
also contributed to Ashford's net sales growth. Net sales were adversely
affected during the latter part of fiscal 2001 by a general decline in retail
spending and reduced marketing and sales efforts.

   Cost of Sales

Cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of products sold, free product and
service incentives delivered to customers at the time of sale, inbound and
outbound shipping costs and warranty and inventory obsolescence costs. Cost of
sales increased as net sales increased. Gross profit increased from $6.4
million for fiscal 2000 to $10.8 million for fiscal 2001. The increase in gross
profit is due to several factors. The primary factor is the continued growth of
Ashford's corporate gift business, including a recent acquisition, which has
generated higher-margin sales to date than its traditional retail sales. In
addition, Ashford has reduced the amount of free product and service incentives
offered to customers at the time of purchase. See also "Recent Accounting
Pronouncements." Finally, Ashford continues to see a favorable shift in the mix
of products sold from lower-margin products to higher-margin products due to
the addition and continued expansion of new product categories. Gross margin
was adversely affected by an inventory obsolescence charge of approximately
$1.8 million recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 as a result of
Ashford's focus on reducing inventory levels. Ashford anticipates continued
gross margin improvements in future periods as it continues to grow its
corporate gift business and its newer higher-margin product categories such as
home and lifestyle products and its Ashford Collection jewelry. Ashford also
expects gross margin improvements in future periods as a result of its efforts
to reduce certain expenses such as outbound shipping costs which now are paid
by the customer on most orders.

   Operating Expenses

   Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of
advertising costs, credit card fees, fulfillment activities and related
employee salary and benefit expenses and amortization of related deferred
compensation. Fulfillment activities include receiving of goods, picking of
goods for shipment and packaging of goods for shipment. Fulfillment costs,
including the cost of operating and staffing distribution centers, are included
in marketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses increased from
approximately $60.8 million for fiscal 2000 to $105.9 million for fiscal 2001.
The increase in marketing and sales is attributable to an increase in non-cash
amortization from $27.5 million for fiscal 2000 to $79.7 million for fiscal
2001 primarily relating to a marketing contract entered into with another
online retailer during the latter part of fiscal 2000 that expired in fiscal
2001. Excluding non-cash amortization, the decrease in marketing and sales is
primarily attributable to a reduction in traditional print and media marketing
activities. During fiscal 2001, Ashford shifted its primary marketing focus
from traditional print and broadcast media to Internet and online media.
Ashford believes Internet and online media provides a more efficient and
economical means of attracting new customers. Ashford's advertising and
promotional expenditures are generally intended to build brand awareness,
generate site traffic and increase overall sales. Ashford expects its marketing
and sales expense to continue to decline as a percentage of sales in future
periods as it continues its focus of becoming more efficient and economical at
acquiring customers. See also "Recent Accounting Pronouncements."

   General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses include
executive, finance and administrative employee salaries and benefits,
amortization of related deferred compensation, professional fees, Web site
maintenance, office lease expenses and other general corporate expenses.
General and administrative expenses increased from $17.1 million for fiscal
2000 to $27.9 million for fiscal 2001. Ashford's general and administrative
expenses have increased primarily as a result of costs associated with
increased headcount, property and franchise taxes and legal costs related to
its overall growth and expanded activities. In the future, Ashford expects its
general and administrative expenses to decrease as a result of its
restructuring activities during January 2001 and May 2001.

   Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense
includes depreciation related to property and equipment and amortization
related to intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization expense increased
from $3.3 million for fiscal 2000 to $13.5 million for fiscal 2001. The
increase is primarily due to depreciation and amortization expense related to
Internet domain and other intangible asset purchases as well as Web site
development costs and technology equipment purchases beginning in the latter
half of fiscal 1999 and continuing through the latter part of fiscal 2001.

   Interest Income. Interest income consists of earnings on cash and cash
equivalents. Interest income decreased from $2.7 million for fiscal 2000 to
$1.6 million for fiscal 2001. The decrease is due to lower cash balances during
the current year. See also "Liquidity and Capital Resources."

   Interest Expense. Interest expense consists of interest costs on borrowings.
The increase in interest expense for fiscal 2001 is due to borrowings on
Ashford's revolving credit facility entered into during September 2000.

  Comparison of Fiscal 2000 and Fiscal 1999:

   Net Sales

   Net sales consist of product sales and are net of product returns, coupons
and promotional discounts. Net sales increased from $5.9 million for fiscal
1999 to $39.9 million for fiscal 2000. The growth in net sales reflects a
significant increase in units sold principally due to the growth in Ashford's
customer base and repeat purchases from its existing customers, in addition to
the introduction of new product lines during fiscal 2000. The increase in site
traffic and awareness results primarily from advertising expenditures and
additional product offerings and availability that were financed through
Ashford's convertible preferred and common stock offerings.

   Cost of Sales

   Cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of products sold, free product
and service incentives delivered to customers at the time of sale, inbound and
outbound shipping costs and warranty and inventory obsolescence costs. Cost of
sales increased as net sales increased. Gross profit increased from $828,000
for fiscal 1999 to $6.4 million for fiscal 2000. Gross margin increased from
14% during fiscal 1999 to 16% during fiscal 2000. The increase in gross margin
is principally due to the addition of new product categories, the mix of
products sold and abnormally low margins during the prior year resulting from
start-up activities.

   Operating Expenses

   Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of
advertising costs, credit card fees, fulfillment activities and related
employee salary and benefit expenses and amortization of related deferred
compensation. Fulfillment activities include receiving of goods, picking of
goods for shipment and packaging of goods for shipment. Fulfillment costs,
including the cost of operating and staffing distribution centers, are included
in marketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses increased from
approximately $1.0 million for fiscal 1999 to $60.8 million for fiscal 2000.
The increase in marketing and sales is partially attributable to an increase in
non-cash amortization from $0 for fiscal 1999 to $27.5 million for fiscal 2000
primarily relating to a marketing contract entered into with another online
retailer during the latter part of fiscal 2000 which expired in fiscal 2001.
The remaining increase during fiscal 2000 is primarily due to increased
advertising and promotional expenditures, amortization of deferred
compensation, and increased payroll and related costs associated with
fulfilling customer demand. Ashford's advertising and promotional expenditures
are intended to build brand awareness, generate site traffic and increase
overall sales.

   General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses include
executive, finance and administrative employee salaries and benefits,
amortization of related deferred compensation, professional fees, Web site
maintenance, office lease expenses and other general corporate expenses.
General and administrative expenses increased to $17.1 million for fiscal 2000
compared to $1.0 million for fiscal 1999. The increase in general and
administrative expenses was primarily a result of expenses associated with
increased headcount, new office space and professional fees related to
Ashford's growth and expanded activities.

   Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense
includes depreciation related to property and equipment as well as amortization
related to purchased intangibles and other assets. Depreciation

and amortization expense was $3.3 million for fiscal 2000 compared to $67,000
in fiscal 1999. The increase relates to Internet domain names and other
intangible assets purchased during fiscal 2000 and technology and other
equipment purchased in the latter half of fiscal 1999 and continuing through
fiscal 2000. Internet domain names and related intangible assets purchased in
connection with business acquisitions are amortized over their estimated useful
lives, which is deemed to be two years.

   Interest Income. Interest income consists of earnings on cash and cash
equivalents. The increase during fiscal 2000 relates to interest earned on cash
balances resulting from Ashford's Series B and Series C convertible preferred
stock offerings in April 1999 and July 1999, respectively, and interest earned
on cash balances resulting from its initial public offering in late September
1999. Interest income was $2.7 million during fiscal 2000 compared to $13,000
during fiscal 1999.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

   General. Ashford has financed its operations primarily through private sales
of convertible preferred stock, an initial public offering and the private sale
of its common stock. The proceeds from these offerings have been used primarily
to fund Ashford's operations, including inventory purchases, marketing and
advertising campaigns, employee salaries and equipment purchases.

   Operating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities decreased from
$5.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2000 to $5.0 million for the
quarter ended June 30, 2001. Ashford's net operating cash outflow for the
quarter ended June 30, 2000 was primarily a result of prepaid marketing
agreements, inventory purchases and, to a lesser extent, operating losses,
exclusive of non-cash depreciation and amortization. Ashford's operating cash
outflow during the quarter ended June 30, 2001 was primarily a result of
operating losses, exclusive of non-cash depreciation and amortization,
restructuring charge, settlement loss, and loss on sale of assets and decreases
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and merchandise inventory. Ashford
anticipates its net cash used in operating activities to continue to decline in
future periods in connection with its efforts to improve overall operating
efficiencies, lower total operating costs as a percentage of sales and improve
inventory management practices and procedures.

   Investing Activities. Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $7.2
million for the quarter ended June 30, 2001 compared to net cash used in
investing activities of $2.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2000. Net
cash provided by investing activities during the quarter ended June 30, 2001
primarily consisted of $7.3 million related to a merger agreement with an
online art retailer and $100,000 related to property and equipment purchases.
Net cash used in investing activities during the quarter ended June 30, 2000
consisted of approximately $2.8 million related to the purchase of computer and
office equipment and Web site enhancements as well as leasehold improvements
associated with leased office and warehouse facilities.

   Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $4.7
million during quarter ended June 30, 2001. Financing activities related to
payments on Ashford's revolving credit facility.

   Commitments. As of June 30, 2001, Ashford's principal commitments consisted
of obligations outstanding under non-cancelable operating leases. Ashford has
no material commitments for capital expenditures.

   Credit Facility. During September 2000, Ashford executed a three-year
revolving credit facility with a maximum available credit of $25 million with
Congress Financial Corporation, a unit of First Union National Bank. The credit
facility is to be used for working capital needs and is secured by Ashford's
assets. Availability under the credit facility is determined pursuant to a
borrowing base as defined in the agreement, and was $8.9 million on June 30,
2001. Amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at the prime
rate or LIBOR plus 250 basis points, as elected by Ashford. There were no
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of June 30, 2001.

   During the quarter ended September 30, 2001, an independent appraisal firm
completed a periodic appraisal of Ashford's inventory as required under the
revolving credit facility. This appraisal resulted in a decrease in Ashford's
borrowing base from approximately 42% to 31% of eligible inventory, as defined
in the revolving credit facility. The primary reasons cited by the appraiser
for this decrease were a general oversupply of inventory in the wholesale
marketplace, resulting in a lower rate of recovery and, to a lesser extent, a
shift in Ashford's inventory mix away from loose diamonds (the highest recovery
inventory category). This decrease in availability will result in a reduced
amount of liquidity available under the revolving credit facility during future
periods.

   Financial Condition. Ashford has suffered significant losses from operations
since its inception. Management is implementing a strategy to significantly
reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies. Management believes that
Ashford's current cash balances and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to
meet anticipated needs through at least the end of the next fiscal year,
assuming it executes according to its restructured operating plans. However,
any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial
uncertainty. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt as to Ashford's ability to
continue as a going concern. If current cash and cash that may be generated
from future operations are insufficient to satisfy Ashford's liquidity
requirements, management may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities
or to obtain additional credit facilities from lenders. There can be no
assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on the terms
acceptable to Ashford, if at all. Ashford's ability to raise cash through the
sales of additional equity or convertible debt securities may be difficult
depending on market conditions and other factors, and if available could result
in additional dilution to Ashford stockholders. In addition, management will,
from time to time, consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary
businesses, products, services and technologies, which might impact Ashford's
liquidity requirements or cause Ashford to issue additional equity or debt
securities.

   Restructuring and Other Matters. During the fourth quarter ended March 31,
2001, in connection with management's plan to reduce costs and improve
operating efficiencies, Ashford recorded restructuring charges of approximately
$0.7 million, consisting of approximately $0.5 million for headcount reductions
and approximately $0.2 million for contract cancellations. Headcount reductions
consisted of approximately 40 employees, or about 17% of Ashford's workforce,
across all areas of Ashford.

   During the first quarter ended June 30, 2001, Ashford initiated a review of
its lines of business, cost structure and general activities. The objective of
this review was to identify opportunities for improved financial performance
and liquidity management. Specific initiatives resulting from this review
include reducing the scope of product offerings, decreasing Ashford's
investment in inventory and eliminating certain operating costs, including
costs associated with personnel. In connection with this review, Ashford
recorded charges of approximately $0.5 million for headcount reductions.
Headcount reductions consisted of approximately 46 employees, or about 19% of
Ashford's workforce, across all areas of Ashford.

   Total cash outlays during the quarter ended June 30, 2001 were approximately
$0.2 million. The restructuring accrual was reduced by an additional $0.2
million through the issuance of options to purchase Ashford common stock.
Previously recorded allowances for contract cancellations of approximately $0.1
million were reversed during the quarter ended June 30, 2001 upon determination
that the associated cost would not be incurred. The remaining $0.1 million of
restructuring costs is expected to be paid through December 31, 2001.

   In February 2001, Ashford entered into a merger agreement with an online
watch retailer. During June 2001, as a result of certain business difficulties
that arose in the relationship between Ashford and the former principals of the
online watch retailer and to resolve litigation between them, the parties began
negotiating a dissolution of that relationship. Ashford and the online watch
retailer agreed to a settlement whereby the online watch retailer and certain
of the online watch retailer's management will receive aggregate consideration
of approximately $0.8 million representing $0.2 million of inventory, $0.1
million of severance pay and 1,500,000 shares of Ashford common stock to settle
all potential future claims and obligations. Ashford recorded a charge of
approximately $2.3 million in connection with this settlement during the
quarter ended June 30, 2001.

   In May 2001, Ashford closed a merger agreement with an online art retailer.
In connection with the agreement, Ashford issued approximately 7.1 million
shares of Ashford common stock and options and warrants to purchase
approximately 1.6 million shares of Ashford common stock, in exchange for all
of the fully diluted shares of the online art retailer's capital stock. The
purchase price was approximately $4.3 million, consisting of $3.3 million of
Ashford common stock, $0.7 million of options and warrants to purchase shares
of Ashford common stock and $0.3 million of business combination costs. The
principle assets received include $7.3 million of cash, an Internet domain name
and related trademarks and other tangible and intangible assets related to
Internet retail operations. The total value of net tangible assets acquired
exceeded the $4.3 million purchase price.

   In connection with the May 2001 review, Ashford concluded that the operating
cost structure of the online art retailer was inconsistent with the level of
sales activity and overall objectives of Ashford. In June 2001, the prior
management of the online art retailer made a proposal to Ashford, which Ashford
accepted, to assume the prospective operations of the online art retailer as a
separately capitalized entity. Pursuant to this agreement, Ashford contributed
assets of approximately $0.5 million, including $0.4 million of cash, an
Internet domain name and related trademarks and other intangible assets in
return for 5% ownership interest in the new entity. In addition, Ashford and
the new entity entered into a revenue sharing agreement whereby Ashford offers
the new entity's product on its Web site in return for half of the gross profit
from sales of the new entity's products generated by Ashford's Web site.
Ashford will not assume any future operating costs or obligations. Further,
substantially all Ashford's employees previously employed by the online art
retailer became employees of the new entity or were terminated.

   Activity related to art operations during the period was recorded in
accordance with APB No. 30 "Reporting the Results of Operations--Reporting the
Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and
Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions" and EITF 85-36 "Discontinued
Operations with Expected Gain and Interim Operating Losses." Accordingly,
losses from the acquisition closing date, May 3, 2001, through the measurement
date, June 13, 2001, have been reflected as net loss from discontinued
operations in the accompanying financial statements. Losses from the
measurement date through the separation date, July 31, 2001, have been deferred
as there is reasonable assurance that a net gain on disposal will be realized.
For the quarter ended June 30, 2001, net loss on discontinued operations
included net sales commissions of approximately $125,000 and operating expenses
of approximately $792,000. For the period from the measurement date through
June 30, 2001, net losses of approximately $109,000 representing net sales
commissions of approximately $53,000 and operating expenses of $162,000 were
deferred. Total net assets acquired in excess of purchase price related to
discontinued operations was approximately $2.9 million at June 30, 2001.
Ashford expects to recognize a net gain on disposal of discontinued operations
of approximately $2.0 million during the quarter ending September 30, 2001.

   During June 2001, Ashford sold two Internet domain names and related
trademarks related to a product information Internet site in exchange for $0.4
million cash. The majority of the cash proceeds were received during the
quarter ending September 2001. Ashford recorded a loss on sale of approximately
$0.5 million during the quarter ending June 2001.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

   In July 2001, the FASB issued Statements No. 141, Business Combinations and
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets requiring the nonamortization
approach to account for purchased goodwill. Under the nonamortization approach,
goodwill would be tested for impairment based on fair values, rather than
amortized to earnings. Under the new statements, Ashford's purchased
intangibles would continue to be amortized consistent with its current policy.
Although Ashford has not made a final determination, upon adoption of these
standards, Ashford expects to record any goodwill as income or expense.

   In July 2000, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF 00-10, "Accounting for
Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs." This consensus requires that all amounts
billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping and handling, if
any, represent revenue and should be classified as revenue. Ashford
historically has classified shipping charges to customers as revenue. In
September 2000, the EITF concluded that the classification of shipping and
handling costs should be disclosed pursuant to Accounting Principles Board
(APB) Opinion No. 22, "Disclosure of Accounting Policies." If shipping and
handling costs are significant and are not included in cost of sales, companies
should disclose both the amount of such costs and which line item on the income
statement includes that amount. Shipping and handling costs cannot be netted
against sales. Ashford classifies inbound and outbound shipping costs as costs
of sales. Ashford generally does not impose separate handling charges on
customers. However, during fiscal year 2001, Ashford began charging for
shipping costs. Ashford began charging for packaging costs during fiscal 2002.
Costs attributable to receiving, inspecting and warehousing inventories and
picking, packaging and preparing customers' orders for shipment are classified
as marketing and sales expense and totaled $0.8 million during both quarters
ended June 30, 2001 and 2000.

   In May 2000, the EITF issued EITF 00-14 "Accounting for Certain Sales
Incentives," which provides guidance on the accounting for certain sales
incentives offered by companies to their customers such as discounts, coupons,
rebates and products or services. EITF 00-14 addresses the recognition,
measurement and income statement classification for sales incentives offered
voluntarily by a vendor without charge to customers that can be used in, or
that are exercisable by a customer as a result of a single exchange
transaction. The accompanying financial statements include the reclassification
of free product and service incentives delivered to customers at the time of
sale, from marketing and sales expense to cost of sales, related to the
adoption of EITF 00-14. All periods presented have been reclassified for
consistent presentation.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

   Ashford has assessed its vulnerability to certain market risks, including
interest rate risk associated with financial instruments included in cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments. Due to the short-term nature of these
investments and Ashford's investment policies and procedures, Ashford has
determined that the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations related to
these financial instruments does not pose a material risk to Ashford.

          SECURITY OWNERSHIP BY CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF ASHFORD

   The following table sets forth, as of September 30, 2001, certain
information known to Ashford regarding the beneficial ownership of Ashford
common stock by (a) each person who is known by Ashford to be the beneficial
owner of more than five percent of Ashford's outstanding shares of common
stock, (b) the directors of Ashford, (c) the executive officers of Ashford
named in the Summary Compensation Table in Ashford's 2001 Proxy Statement and
(d) the directors and executive officers as a group. Beneficial ownership has
been determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. Under this rule, certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned
by more than one person, if, for example, persons share the power to vote or
the power to dispose of the shares. In addition, shares are deemed to be
beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares,
for example, upon exercise of an option or warrant, within 60 days of September
30, 2001. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of
shares is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such
person, and only such person, by reason of such acquisition rights. As a
result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the
following table does not necessarily reflect the person's actual voting power
at any particular date. The percentage of beneficial ownership for the
following table is based on 54,208,488 shares of common stock outstanding as of
September 30, 2001. Unless otherwise indicated, the address for each listed
stockholder is: c/o Ashford.com, Inc., 3800 Buffalo Speedway, Suite 400,
Houston, Texas 77098. To Ashford's knowledge, except as otherwise indicated in
the footnotes to this table and pursuant to applicable community property laws,
the persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with
respect to all shares of common stock.

   On December 28, 2000, Global Sports completed its acquisition of Fogdog,

Fogdog's results of operations commencing upon the December 28, 2000
acquisition date. The effect of incorporating Fogdog's results of operations
for the three days ended December 30, 2000 was not significant.

   The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Operations for the
six months ended June 30, 2001 gives effect to the Ashford merger as if it had

accounting.

   The pro forma financial information has been prepared on the basis of

                NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED
                             FINANCIAL INFORMATION

   The pro forma financial information gives effect to the following pro forma
adjustments:

1. In accordance with the Ashford merger agreement:

   The Ashford merger will be accounted for as a purchase. The purchase price
   of $14.6 million is based on cash consideration of $6.7 million and the
   issuance of Global Sports common stock with a value of $16.00 per share,
   which is the average closing price of Global Sports common stock for the
   period from September 6 to 18, 2001, plus acquisition related expenses of
   approximately $1.4 million.

   All vested Ashford stock warrants are deemed to have been assumed by Global
   Sports upon consummation of the merger for purposes of these pro forma
   statements. These stock warrants are included as part of the purchase price
   based on their fair value as of the date of the merger agreement.

   The pro forma financial information has been prepared on the basis of
   assumptions described in these notes, and include assumptions relating to
   the allocation of the consideration paid for the assets and liabilities of
   Ashford, based on preliminary estimates of their fair value. The actual
   allocation of such consideration may differ from that reflected in the pro
   forma financial information, after valuations and other procedures to be
   performed after the closing of the Ashford acquisition.

   Tangible assets of Ashford acquired in the merger principally include
   inventory and cash and cash equivalents. Liabilities of Ashford assumed in
   the merger principally include accounts payable and accrued expenses.

   The pro forma financial information does not reflect cost savings that may
   result from the elimination of duplicate functions, expenditures, and
   activities. Although Global Sports' management expects that cost savings
   will result from the merger, there can be no assurance that cost savings
   will be achieved.

2. On December 28, 2000, Global Sports completed its acquisition of Fogdog
   pursuant to a definitive merger agreement executed on October 24, 2000. The
   Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Operations for the
   fiscal year ended December 30, 2000 includes Fogdog's unaudited historical
   results of operations for the period January 1, 2000 through December 27,
   2000.

   The Fogdog merger has been accounted for under the purchase method and the
   acquisition costs of $44.7 million have been allocated to the assets
   acquired and the liabilities assumed based upon estimates of their
   respective fair values. A total of $14.4 million, representing the excess of
   the purchase price over fair value of the net tangible assets acquired, has
   been allocated to goodwill and is being amortized by the straight-line
   method over twenty years.

   Global Sports' consolidated results of operations for the fiscal year ended
   December 30, 2000 incorporates Fogdog's results of operations commencing
   upon the December 28, 2000 acquisition date. The effect of incorporating
   Fogdog's results of operations for the three days ended December 30, 2000
   was not significant.

3. The pro forma adjustment eliminates Fogdog's amortization relating to a
   warrant based on the adjustment of the warrant to fair market value as of
   the date of the merger, and the assumption of the warrant by Global Sports.

4. The pro forma adjustment eliminates Fogdog's amortization of goodwill
   relating to Fogdog's merger with Sports Universe, Inc which was effective on
   September 3, 1999.

5. The pro forma adjustment reduces Fogdog's depreciation expense based on the
   write-down of Fogdog's property and equipment.

6. The pro forma adjustment is for the amortization of goodwill resulting from
   the Fogdog acquisition.

                NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED
                      FINANCIAL INFORMATION--(Continued)

 7. The pro forma adjustment eliminates Ashford's depreciation expense based on
    the write-down of Ashford's property and equipment.

 8. The pro forma adjustment eliminates Ashford's amortization expense based on
    the write-down of Ashford's purchased intangibles.

 9. The pro forma adjustment reflects the impact of the cash consideration and
    acquisition-related expenses paid in connection with the Ashford merger.

10. The pro forma adjustment is to write down Ashford's non-current assets
    acquired due to the excess of the fair value of Ashford's net assets over
    the purchase price.

11. The pro forma adjustment is to write off Ashford's net assets acquired in
    excess of purchase price attributed to discontinued operations.

12. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.
    141, Business Combinations, the pro forma adjustment reflects the
    extraordinary gain of $8.6 million due to the excess of the fair market
    value of Ashford's net assets over the purchase price remaining after the
    write-down of Ashford's non-current assets to zero.

13. The pro forma adjustment to stockholders' equity reflects the elimination
    of Ashford stockholders' equity ($33.4 million) and the impact of the
    issuance of Global Sports common stock ($6.6 million) in connection with
    the Ashford merger.

                      COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHTS

   Both Ashford and Global Sports are Delaware corporations and are governed by
the Delaware General Corporation Law. In addition, the rights of Ashford
stockholders are currently governed by the Ashford third amended and restated
certificate of incorporation and the Ashford amended and restated bylaws, and
the rights of Global Sports stockholders are governed by the Global Sports
amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the Global Sports bylaws.
After the effective time of the merger, the rights of holders of Ashford
capital stock who become holders of Global Sports common stock will be governed
by the Global Sports amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the
Global Sports bylaws and Delaware law. In most respects, the rights of holders
of Ashford capital stock are similar to the rights of holders of Global Sports
common stock. The following is a summary of the material differences between
such rights. This summary does not purport to be a complete discussion of, and
is qualified in its entirety by reference to, Delaware law as well as to the
Ashford third amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the Ashford
amended and restated bylaws, the Global Sports amended and restated certificate
of incorporation and the Global Sports bylaws.

Authorized Capital Stock

   Global Sports. The authorized capital stock of Global Sports consists of
90,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock.

   Ashford. The authorized capital stock of Ashford consists of 100,000,000
shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock.

Number of Directors

   Global Sports. Global Sports' board of directors currently consists of seven
members.

   Ashford. Ashford's board of directors currently consists of six members.

Changes in the Number of Directors

   Global Sports. The Global Sports bylaws provide that the setting of the
authorized number of directors and any changes to the authorized number of
directors may be effected only by resolution of Global Sports' board of
directors.

   Ashford. Ashford's third amended and restated certificate of incorporation
provides that the number of directors shall be such number, as shall be fixed
from time to time, by a bylaw or amendment thereof duly approved and adopted by
the board of directors. Ashford's amended and restated bylaws provide that the
number of directors shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by Ashford's
board of directors pursuant to a resolution approved and adopted by a vote of
75% of the total number of authorized directors (whether or not there exist any
vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any such
resolution is presented to Ashford's board of directors for approval and
adoption). Ashford's amended and restated bylaws further provide that the
directors shall hold office until the expiration of term for which elected, and
until their respective successors are elected and qualified, except in the case
of the death, resignation or removal of any director.

Election of Directors

   Global Sports. Global Sports' board of directors is not divided into
classes. As a result, the entire board of directors is elected each year by a
majority vote of outstanding stock.

   Ashford. All members of Ashford's board of directors serve on a staggered
board that is divided into three classes, with each class serving a three-year
term. As a result, a portion of the board of directors is elected each year by
a majority vote of outstanding stock.

Special Meeting of Stockholders

   Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a special meeting of
stockholders may be called by the board of directors or any other person
authorized to do so in the corporation's certificate of incorporation or
bylaws.

   Global Sports. The Global Sports bylaws state that a special meeting of the
stockholders may be called for any purpose or purposes by the Chairman of the
board of directors, the President, a majority of the board of directors or the
holders of not less than 10% of the shares of capital stock of Global Sports
issued and outstanding and entitled to vote.

   Ashford. Ashford's amended and restated bylaws provide that special meetings
of Ashford stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise
prescribed by statute or by the third amended and restated c
