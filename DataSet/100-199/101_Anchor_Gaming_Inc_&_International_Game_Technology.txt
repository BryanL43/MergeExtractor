SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED AUGUST

MERGER PROPOSED — YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT!

Dear Stockholder:

     I am pleased to report that on July 6, 2001, the board of directors of
International Game Technology (“IGT”) and on July 8, 2001, the board of
directors of Anchor Gaming (“Anchor”) each approved a merger agreement that
provides for the combination of the two companies.

     Upon completion of the merger, each share of Anchor common stock then
outstanding will be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of
IGT common stock calculated in accordance with the following formula (the
“Exchange Ratio”). If the IGT Share Value, which is defined as the average
per-share closing price of IGT common stock on the New York Stock Exchange
during the twenty consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day
before the Anchor stockholders’ meeting or, if the closing of the merger is
more than five trading days after the meeting, the third trading day before the
closing date, is:

•

between $50.00 per share and $75.00 per share, inclusive, IGT
will exchange each share of Anchor common stock for one share of IGT
common stock.

•

less than $50.00 per share, and

-

Anchor does not notify IGT in writing of its intention
to terminate the merger agreement, IGT will exchange each share
of Anchor common stock for one share of IGT common stock; or

-

Anchor notifies IGT in writing of its intention to
terminate the merger agreement and IGT, in its sole and absolute
discretion, elects to adjust the Exchange Ratio rather than allow
the merger agreement to terminate, IGT will exchange each share
of Anchor common stock for the number of shares of IGT common
stock equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is $50.00 and
the denominator of which is the IGT Share Value.

•

greater than $75.00 per share, and

-

IGT does not notify Anchor in writing of its intention
to terminate the merger agreement, IGT will exchange each share
of Anchor common stock for one share of IGT common stock; or

-

IGT notifies Anchor in writing of its intention to
terminate the merger agreement and Anchor, in its sole and
absolute discretion, elects to adjust the Exchange Ratio rather
than allow the merger agreement to terminate, IGT will exchange
each share of Anchor common stock for the number of shares of IGT
common stock equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is
$75.00 and the denominator of which is the IGT Share Value.

     Based on the number of shares of Anchor common stock outstanding at the
time we signed the merger agreement and assuming an Exchange Ratio of
one-for-one, we expect to issue approximately 14.9 million shares of IGT common
stock to Anchor’s stockholders. As a result, Anchor shareholders would hold
approximately 16.6% (18.7% on a fully diluted basis assuming the exercise of
all 2.4 million vested and unvested Anchor stock options, which will become
options to purchase IGT common stock upon completion of the merger) of the
outstanding shares of IGT common stock immediately after the completion of the
merger.

     The merger agreement contains several conditions, which must be satisfied
before we can complete the merger. One such condition requires that IGT’s
stockholders approve the issuance of IGT common stock to Anchor stockholders in
the merger.

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains important information that
you should consider in determining your vote. 
In particular, please see “Risk
Factors” beginning on page 20 for a discussion of some of the risks that you
should consider in evaluating the proposed merger
.

     As part of the proposed merger, we agreed to grant at the time of closing
of the merger 600,000 IGT stock options, including 500,000 IGT stock options to
Thomas J. Matthews, who will continue as President and Chief Executive Officer
of Anchor and also become Chief Operating Officer of IGT. The IGT Board has
also unanimously approved an amendment to the International Game Technology
1993 Stock Option Plan to increase by 900,000 the number of shares of IGT
common stock available for issuance under the plan to accommodate the grant of
options we committed to as part of the proposed merger. We are also seeking
your approval of the plan amendment and it is described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

     IGT will hold a special stockholders’ meeting for the purpose of voting on
the issuance of shares to Anchor stockholders and the plan amendment. We are
furnishing you with this joint proxy statement/prospectus in connection with
the solicitation by the board of directors of IGT of your vote at this meeting.
The date, time and place of the meeting is:

     [Date]

     [Time]

     [Place]

     The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares voted at the special
meeting, in person or by proxy, is required to approve the issuance of IGT
common stock to Anchor stockholders in the merger and to approve the plan
amendment.

     The board of directors of IGT believes that the merger and the plan
amendment are both in the best interests of IGT stockholders, and recommends
that you vote “FOR” both of these proposals.

     Please read this joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully.

[date]

page 66 for a more

detailed
explanation of the merger consideration.

Q:

When will the final Exchange Ratio be calculated and announced?

A:

The companies will calculate the final Exchange Ratio based on the
average per-share closing price of IGT common stock on the New York
Stock Exchange composite transactions reporting system during the
twenty consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day before
the Anchor stockholders’ meeting or, if the closing of the merger
occurs more than five days after the Anchor stockholders’ meeting, the
third trading day before the closing date. IGT and Anchor intend to
issue a press release announcing the final Exchange Ratio for the
merger promptly after it is determined. The following toll-free
number is also available for stockholders of IGT and Anchor to obtain
a daily closing price for IGT common stock: 800-__________.

Q:

Will the merger dilute the ownership of IGT stockholders?

A:

Yes. The issuance of shares of IGT common stock to Anchor
stockholders will dilute the ownership of existing IGT stockholders.
After consummation of the merger and assuming an Exchange Ratio of
one-for-one, former Anchor stockholders will own approximately 16.6%
(18.7% on a fully diluted basis assuming the exercise of all 2.4
million vested and unvested Anchor stock options which will become
options to purchase IGT common stock upon completion of the merger) of
the outstanding shares of IGT common stock, and existing IGT
stockholders will own approximately 83.4% of the outstanding shares of
IGT common stock.

Q:

What are the tax consequences of the merger to Anchor and IGT
stockholders?

A:

The exchange of shares of Anchor stockholders will be tax-free to the
Anchor stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except for
taxes payable on any gain recognized as a result of receiving cash in
lieu of fractional shares of IGT common stock. The merger will have
no tax consequences to IGT stockholders. A summary of the material
federal income tax consequences of the merger is included in the
section “The Merger — U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” on page
60. We urge you to consult with your own tax advisor to determine your
particular tax consequences.

Q:

When do the companies expect to complete the merger?

A:

The companies intend to complete the merger as soon as possible after
the stockholders’ meetings. Currently, the companies expect to
complete the merger by January 31, 2002. However, the companies
cannot complete the merger until they satisfy additional conditions,
including the receipt of all required gaming authority and other
governmental approvals. The companies are unable to predict when they
will complete the merger since they do not know when they will satisfy
all of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement. However,
either company can terminate the merger agreement if the merger is not
completed by January 30, 2002, unless the reason the merger has not
been completed by that date is that the companies are still awaiting
approval from a governmental authority, in which event either IGT or
Anchor can extend the date of termination from January 30, 2002 to
April 30, 2002. Please see “Terms of the Merger Agreement and Related
Agreements — Conditions to the Merger” on page 76 and “— Termination”
on page 78 for a more detailed explanation of the conditions to and
termination of the merger.

Q:

What am I being asked to vote on?

A:

IGT stockholders: You are being asked to vote on the following two
proposals:

•

to approve the issuance of IGT common stock to Anchor
stockholders in connection with the merger; and

•

to approve an amendment to the International Game Technology
1993 Stock Option Plan to increase by 900,000 the number of shares
of IGT common stock available for issuance under the plan. Please
see “Proposal — Amendment to the

Stock Option Plan” on page 91 for a more detailed explanation of the
plan amendment.

      Anchor stockholders: You are being asked to vote on the proposal to approve
      and adopt the merger agreement.

Q:

What vote is required to complete the merger?

A:

In order to complete the merger,

    •

holders of a majority of the votes cast at the IGT
stockholders’ meeting in person or by proxy must approve the
issuance of IGT common stock in connection with the merger; and

    •

holders of a majority of the Anchor common stock outstanding
on [record date] must approve the merger agreement at the Anchor
stockholders’ meeting, either in person or by proxy.

Q:

What vote is required by IGT stockholders to approve the plan
amendment?

A:

Holders of a majority of the votes cast at the IGT stockholders’
meeting in person or by proxy must approve the proposed amendment to
the International Game Technology 1993 Stock Option Plan.

Q:

Do the boards of directors of IGT and Anchor recommend voting in favor
of the merger?

A:

Yes. After careful consideration, the boards of directors of both IGT
and Anchor recommend voting in favor of the merger. See “The Merger —
IGT Board Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the IGT Board” on
page 43 and “The Merger — Anchor Board Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the Anchor Board” on page 44.

Q:

How do I vote?

A:

If you hold shares of IGT or Anchor common stock, mail your signed
proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible. You
may also attend the respective special stockholders’ meeting in person
instead of submitting a proxy. If your shares are held by your broker
as your nominee, your broker will vote your shares only if you provide
instructions on how to vote. You should follow the directions
provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your broker to vote
your shares. Unless you instruct your broker how to vote, your shares
will not be voted at the special meeting.

Q:

How will my shares be voted if I return a blank proxy card?

A:

IGT Stockholders: If you sign and send in your proxy card and do not
indicate how you want to vote, IGT will count your proxy as a vote FOR
the merger and plan amendment proposals submitted at the special
meeting.

Anchor stockholders: If you sign and send in your proxy card and do not
indicate how you want to vote, Anchor will count your proxy as a vote FOR
the merger proposal submitted at the special meeting.

Q:

How can I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy?

A:

You may change your vote by delivering a signed revocation or a
subsequently dated, signed proxy card to the corporate Secretary of
either IGT or Anchor, as applicable, before the stockholder meeting,
or by attending the stockholder meeting and voting in person.
However, if you have delivered a valid proxy, your mere presence at
the stockholder meeting will not, by itself, revoke that proxy.

Q:

Are there risks I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the
merger?

A:

Yes. The companies have set out under the heading “Risk Factors”
beginning on page 20 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus a number
of risk factors that you should carefully consider before voting.

Q:

Should I send in my stock certificates now?

A:

IGT stockholders: No. You will continue to own your shares of IGT
common stock after

the merger and should continue to hold your stock
certificates.

Anchor stockholders: No. IGT will appoint an exchange agent to
coordinate the exchange of your shares of Anchor common stock for
shares of IGT common stock after the merger is completed. The
exchange agent will send you written instructions on how to exchange
your stock certificates.

Q:

When may Anchor stockholders sell the shares of IGT common stock they
receive in the merger?

A:

Anchor stockholders will generally be permitted to resell the IGT
common stock they receive in the merger. See “The Merger — Resales of IGT Common Stock” on page
65.

Q:

Do Anchor stockholders have dissenters’ rights of appraisal?

A:

No. Under the corporation laws of the State of Nevada, Anchor’s state
of incorporation, Anchor stockholders do not have any appraisal or
dissenters’ rights in connection with the merger.

Q:

How can I find out whether the merger proposals were approved by the
stockholders of IGT and Anchor?

A:

IGT and Anchor each intend to issue a press release announcing the
voting results for the respective merger proposals at their respective
meetings promptly after each meeting is held.

Opinions of Financial Advisors

(see page 45)

     In deciding to approve the merger, the IGT board of directors considered
an opinion from its financial advisor as to the fairness of the consideration
to be received by IGT in connection with the merger from a financial point of
view. In deciding to approve the merger, the Anchor board of directors
considered an opinion from its financial advisor as to the fairness of the
Exchange Ratio from a financial point of view to the Anchor stockholders. IGT
received an opinion from Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin Financial Advisors,
Inc., attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Anchor
received an opinion from Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, Inc., attached as
Annex C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The companies encourage you
to read and consider the opinions in their entirety before voting on the merger
proposals.

Interests of Key Persons

in the Merger (see page 57)

     When considering the recommendation of the board of directors of Anchor
regarding the merger, you should be aware of the interests that key executive
officers and directors of Anchor have in the merger that are different from
your and their interests as stockholders generally. These interests include,
among other things, employment agreements that two of Anchor’s executive
officers have entered into, which will become effective upon completion of the
merger, terms of existing stock option and restricted stock agreements, which
provide for acceleration of the vesting of underlying options and restricted
stock upon the merger, and provisions in the merger agreement relating to
indemnification and insurance. Thomas J. Matthews, Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer of Anchor, will become the Chief Operating Officer of
IGT as promptly as practicable following completion of the merger and will
remain President and Chief Executive Officer of Anchor. In addition, Mr.

Matthews and a person to be mutually agreed upon by IGT and Anchor will each
become a director of IGT, filling two newly created seats on the IGT board of
directors. Joseph Murphy will remain Chief Operating Officer-Gaming Operations
of Anchor following completion of the merger. Messrs. Matthews and Murphy will
be granted 500,000 and 100,000 IGT stock options, respectively, at the time of
completion of the merger.

Risks Related to the Merger

(see page 20)

     In considering whether to approve the issuance of shares pursuant to the
merger agreement or the merger, as applicable, the respective stockholders of
IGT and Anchor should carefully review and consider the information discussed
in the section “Risk Factors” on pages 20 through 31. These risks include:

•

Risks relating to the merger. 
These include, among others,
the possibility that the merger may not occur, fluctuations in the
value of IGT common stock, and dilution of the ownership position of
current IGT stockholders.

•

Risks relating to the combined company after the merger
.
These include, among others, potential harm to third-party
relationships, uncertainties regarding the integration of the
business of Anchor and IGT and retaining the services of key
personnel.

•

Risks relating to IGT
. These include, among others, the
impact that slow future growth in the gaming industry could have on
IGT’s profits, the competitive nature of the gaming industry and the
need to continually develop innovative products and systems, the
extensive governmental regulation of the gaming industry, the
importance of developing and defending IGT’s intellectual property,
and IGT’s significant international operations.

•

Risks relating to Anchor
. These include, among others, the
competitive nature of the gaming industry and the need to
continually develop innovative products and systems, the importance
of Anchor’s joint venture with IGT, the extensive governmental
regulation of the gaming industry, reliance on third-party suppliers
and manufacturers, the importance of developing and defending
Anchor’s intellectual property, the stringent performance
requirements of Anchor’s lottery contracts, joint venture and
sovereign immunity risks associated with Anchor’s agreements with
the Pala Band of Mission Indians, the potential for adverse
determinations in pending litigation, seasonality of Anchor’s
operations, the impact of Anchor’s significant debt obligations and
customary covenants in the merger agreement that limit Anchor’s
conduct of the business while the merger agreement is in effect.

IGT Stockholder Approval

(see pages 33 and 35)

     Approval of the issuance of IGT common stock to Anchor stockholders
pursuant to the merger agreement and approval of the plan amendment each
require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast at
the IGT stockholders’ meeting in person or by proxy.

     On August 8, 2001, directors and executive officers of IGT and their
affiliates beneficially owned approximately 3.4% of the outstanding shares of
IGT common stock, excluding shares issuable pursuant to options.

Anchor Stockholder Approval

(see pages 33 and 35)

     Approval of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote at the
Anchor stockholders’ meeting either in person or by proxy of the holders of a
majority of the shares of Anchor common stock outstanding on the record date,_________.

     On August 8, 2001, directors and executive officers of Anchor and their
affiliates beneficially owned approximately 1.6% of the outstanding shares of Anchor
common stock, excluding shares issuable pursuant to options.

     As part of the execution of the merger agreement, Anchor stockholders
Thomas J. Matthews and Joseph Murphy, who, as of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, beneficially own an aggregate of approximately
1.5% of the
outstanding Anchor common stock, excluding shares issuable pursuant to
options, entered into voting agreements with IGT to vote all Anchor common
stock that they are entitled to vote in favor of approving the merger proposal.

Our Recommendations to Stockholders

(see pages 43–44 and 97)

To IGT Stockholders:

merger and to amend IGT’s stock option plan.

To Anchor Stockholders:

The Anchor board of directors believes that the merger is advisable and is
in your best interests and unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the

The Merger

The merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The companies encourage you to read the merger agreement
because it is the legal document that governs the merger.

Anchor Stockholders Will Receive Shares of IGT Common Stock

(see page 66)

     IGT and Anchor are proposing a transaction in which IGT will acquire
Anchor in a merger of Anchor with NAC Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
IGT (“IGT Merger Sub”). Anchor will survive the merger and will continue as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of IGT. Subject to receipt of approval of both IGT and
Anchor stockholders, regulatory approvals and other matters, IGT and Anchor
expect to complete the merger before January 30, 2002.

     Upon completion of the merger, by virtue of the merger and without any
additional action on the part of the stockholders of Anchor, IGT or IGT Merger
Sub, each share of Anchor common stock then outstanding will be converted into
the right to receive the number of shares of IGT common stock calculated in
accordance with the following formula for calculating the Exchange Ratio. If
the IGT Share Value, which is defined as the average per-share closing price of
IGT common stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the twenty consecutive
trading days ending on the third trading day before the Anchor stockholders’
meeting or, if the closing of the merger is more than five trading days after
the meeting, the third trading day before the closing date, is:

•

between $50.00 per share and $75.00 per share,
      inclusive, IGT will exchange each share of Anchor common stock for one share
      of IGT common stock.

•

less than $50.00 per share, and

-

Anchor does not notify IGT in writing of
        its intention to terminate the merger agreement, IGT will exchange each
        share of Anchor common stock for one share of IGT common stock; or

-

Anchor notifies IGT in writing of its intention
        to terminate the merger agreement and IGT, in its sole and absolute discretion,
        elects to adjust the Exchange Ratio rather than allow the merger agreement
        to terminate, IGT will exchange each share of Anchor common stock for
        the number of shares of IGT common stock equal to a fraction, the numerator
        of which is $50.00 and the denominator of which is the IGT Share Value.

For example,
      if the IGT Share Value was $48.00, and Anchor delivered its termination
      notice to IGT under the terms of the merger agreement, IGT could, at its
      sole option, adjust the Exchange Ratio to 1.0417 ($50.00/$48.00), and Anchor
      stockholders would receive 1.0417 shares of IGT common stock for each share
      of Anchor common stock held by them.

•

greater than $75.00 per share, and

-

IGT does not notify Anchor in writing of its
intention to terminate the merger agreement, IGT will exchange
each share of Anchor common stock for one share of IGT common
stock; or

-

IGT notifies Anchor in writing of its intention
to terminate the merger agreement and Anchor, in its sole and
absolute discretion, elects to adjust the Exchange Ratio
rather than allow the merger agreement to terminate, IGT will
exchange each share of Anchor common stock for the number of
shares of IGT common stock equal to a fraction, the numerator
of which is $75.00 and the denominator of which is the IGT
Share Value.

For example,
      if the IGT Share Value was $77.00 and IGT delivered its termination notice
      to Anchor under the terms of the merger agreement, Anchor could, at its
      sole

option, adjust the Exchange Ratio to 0.9740
      ($75.00/$77.00), and Anchor stockholders would receive 0.9740 shares of
      IGT common stock for each share of Anchor common stock held by them.

     IGT and Anchor encourage you to obtain current stock price quotations for
IGT common stock from a newspaper, the Internet or your broker. IGT common
stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “IGT.” The final
calculation of the Exchange Ratio in the merger will be determined before
completion of the merger. IGT intends to issue a press release announcing the
Exchange Ratio promptly after it is determined. The following toll-free number
is also available for stockholders of IGT and Anchor to obtain a daily closing
price for IGT common stock: 800-__________. IGT will pay Anchor stockholders
the value of any fractional shares in cash rather than issuing any fractional
shares of IGT common stock in the merger.

     Upon completion of the merger, by virtue of the merger and without any
additional action on the part of stockholders of Anchor, IGT or IGT Merger Sub:

•

the Anchor common stock converted as described above will no
longer be outstanding, will automatically be canceled and retired,
and will cease to exist;

•

each holder of Anchor common stock will cease to have any
rights in Anchor common stock, except the right to receive the
appropriate number of shares of IGT common stock, cash in lieu of
fractional shares and dividends, if any, declared with a record date
after the effective time of the merger; and

•

each share of common stock of IGT Merger Sub outstanding
immediately before the effective time of the merger will become one
share of common stock of the surviving corporation.

     IGT stockholders will not have to surrender their stock certificates.
Anchor stockholders will have to surrender their Anchor common stock
certificates to receive new stock certificates representing IGT common stock.
PLEASE DO NOT SEND ANY CERTIFICATES NOW. IGT’s exchange agent will send you
written instructions on how to surrender your Anchor common stock certificates
for new IGT common stock certificates after the merger is completed.

     Shares of Anchor common stock owned by Anchor, IGT, or their wholly-owned
subsidiaries will be cancelled in the merger and will not be exchanged for
shares of IGT common stock.

The Merger Will Generally Be Tax-Free to Stockholders

(see page 60)

     IGT will not be obligated to complete the merger unless it receives an
opinion from its counsel, O’Melveny & Myers LLP, and Anchor will not be
obligated to complete the merger unless it receives an opinion from its
counsel, Hughes & Luce, LLP, in each case to the effect that the merger will be
treated as a “reorganization” under the Internal Revenue Code, which is a
transaction that is generally tax-free for United States federal income tax
purposes. Assuming that the merger constitutes a “reorganization” under the
Internal Revenue Code, the exchange by Anchor stockholders of shares of Anchor
common stock for shares of IGT common stock generally will not cause either IGT
stockholders or Anchor stockholders to recognize any gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Anchor stockholders, however, will have to
recognize income or gain or loss in connection with any cash received in lieu
of fractional shares.

This tax treatment may not apply to all Anchor stockholders. Determining
the actual tax consequences of the merger to you can be complicated. The
actual tax consequences will depend on your specific situation and on variables
not within the control of IGT or Anchor. You should consult with your own tax
advisor for a full understanding of the merger’s tax consequences to you.

Conditions to the Merger

(see page 76)

     The companies will not complete the merger until they have satisfied
numerous conditions. Some of the conditions are listed below:

•

the Anchor stockholders and IGT stockholders have each
approved their respective merger proposals;

•

the shares of IGT common stock to be issued in the merger
have been authorized for trading on the New York Stock Exchange;

•

no law or court order has prohibited the merger;

•

the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this joint
proxy statement/prospectus forms a part has been declared effective
under the Securities Act of 1933 and no stop order has been issued
or sought;

•

all applicable waiting periods under United States federal antitrust laws have expired;

•

all necessary gaming approvals from any gaming authorities have been received;

•

each party has received an opinion of its respective tax
counsel that the merger will be treated as a tax-free
reorganization; and

•

the representations and warranties of the parties contained
in the merger agreement are true and correct in all material
respects (except that where any statement in a representation or
warranty expressly includes a standard of materiality, the
representation or warranty shall be true and correct in all respects
after giving effect to that standard) and the parties have performed
or complied in all material respects with all agreements and
covenants required under the merger agreement.

     Where the law permits, either IGT or Anchor can elect to waive a condition
to its obligation to complete the merger. IGT and Anchor cannot be certain
when or if the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived or that the
merger will be completed.

Regulatory Approvals

(see page 62)

     Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, the
companies must furnish information and materials relating to the business of
each of the companies to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission and wait a specified period of time before the companies can
complete the merger. The Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission
has the authority to challenge the merger on antitrust grounds before the
companies complete the merger.

     As a result of the merger, IGT will own Anchor’s gaming activities in a
number of jurisdictions, each of which is subject to various licensing and
other regulatory requirements administered by various governmental entities.
Some of these laws and regulations require that the applicable gaming
regulatory authorities approve the merger. IGT and Anchor have filed or will
file applications in each jurisdiction in which they conduct gaming activities
with appropriate gaming authorities. The companies cannot complete the merger
unless all applicable gaming regulatory requirements are complied with and all
requisite gaming approvals are obtained.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

(see page 78)

     The boards of directors of both companies can jointly agree to terminate
the merger agreement at any time without completing the merger. In addition,
either company can individually terminate the merger agreement if the
stockholders of either IGT or Anchor fail to approve the merger proposal, or if
the companies do not complete the merger by January 30, 2002, unless the reason
the merger has not been completed by that date is that the companies

are still awaiting approval from a governmental authority, in which event either IGT or
Anchor can extend the date of termination from January 30, 2002 to April 30,
2002.

     Anchor also has termination rights if it receives a superior proposal,
which is defined as a proposal relating to a business combination that the
Anchor board determines, in good faith and after consulting with outside legal
counsel, it must accept to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Anchor
stockholders under applicable laws. Anchor also may elect to terminate the
merger agreement if the IGT Share Value (which is defined as the average
per-share closing price of IGT common stock on the New York Stock Exchange
during the twenty consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day
before the Anchor stockholders’ meeting or, if the closing date is more than
five trading days after the Anchor stockholders’ meeting, the third trading
day before the closing date) falls below $50.00, subject to IGT’s right, in
its sole discretion, to adjust the Exchange Ratio according to a specified
formula instead of allowing the merger agreement to terminate.

     In addition, if the IGT Share Value exceeds $75.00, IGT may elect to
terminate the merger agreement, subject to Anchor’s right, in its sole
discretion, to adjust the Exchange Ratio according to a specified formula
instead of allowing the merger agreement to terminate. Both companies have
additional termination rights more specifically described in “Terms of the
Merger Agreement and Related Agreements — Termination” on
page 78.

     Anchor must pay IGT a termination fee of $30,000,000 if the merger agreement is terminated:

•

by Anchor because it receives a superior proposal;

•

by IGT because the Anchor board withdraws or modifies its
recommendation to stockholders, recommends a takeover proposal made
by a third party to the Anchor stockholders, or fails to call or
hold the Anchor stockholders’ meeting following receipt of a
takeover proposal; or

•

by IGT because Anchor willfully and materially breached its
covenant not to solicit, initiate, encourage or participate in a
takeover proposal except to the extent required for the Anchor board
to comply with its fiduciary duties as more specifically described
in “Terms of the Merger Agreement and Related Agreements — No
Inconsistent Activities” on page 72.

     Anchor must also pay the fee if:

•

a takeover proposal was made before the Anchor stockholders’
meeting (whether or not rejected or withdrawn);

•

the Anchor stockholders did not approve the Anchor merger
proposal; and

•

within twelve months after the termination of the merger
agreement Anchor enters into an agreement for, and, within
twenty-four months after the termination of the merger agreement,
has completed a transaction that would constitute a takeover
proposal (whether or not with the party who made the initial
takeover proposal).

Discretion of IGT and Anchor Boards With Respect to the Merger

     If the IGT Share Value, which is defined as the average per-share closing
price of IGT common stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the twenty
consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day before either the
Anchor stockholders’ meeting or, if the closing date is more than five trading
days after the Anchor stockholders’ meeting, the third trading day before the
closing date, falls below $50.00, the board of directors of Anchor, without any
further vote of its stockholders, may elect to either proceed with the merger
with an Exchange Ratio equal to one-for-one without any adjustment or elect to
terminate the merger agreement, in which event the merger agreement would be
terminated unless IGT elects at its sole option to adjust the Exchange Ratio to
provide the Anchor stockholders at least $50.00 in value (based on the IGT
Share Value) per share of Anchor common stock. If the IGT Share Value during
the applicable period exceeds $75.00, the board of directors of IGT, without
any further vote of its stockholders, may elect to either proceed with the
merger with an Exchange Ratio equal to one-for-one without any adjustment or
elect to terminate the merger agreement, in which event the merger

agreement would be terminated unless Anchor elects at its sole option to adjust the
Exchange Ratio to provide the Anchor stockholders $75.00 in value (based on the
IGT Share Value) per share of Anchor common stock. See “Risk Factors—Risks
Related to the Merger— Stockholder approval confers broad discretion on Anchor
board and IGT board with respect to the merger” on page 21.

Accounting Treatment

     The merger will be accounted for as a purchase for financial reporting and
accounting purposes, under the newly issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141 “Business Combinations” and SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets.” SFAS No. 141 requires the use of the purchase
method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after June 30,
2001. The purchase price will be allocated to Anchor’s assets and liabilities
based upon the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001, will be subject
immediately to SFAS No. 142 which changes the accounting for goodwill and
 intangible assets with indefinite lives from an amortization method to an
impairment-only approach. A portion of the purchase price will be allocated to
identifiable intangible assets. Any excess of the cost over the fair values of
the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired from Anchor will
be recorded as goodwill. Goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite lives acquired from Anchor will not be amortized. Amortization will be required for
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives. We have included unaudited
pro forma financial information in this proxy statement under the caption
“Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial
Statements” on page 81. The
pro forma adjustments and the resulting unaudited pro forma combined condensed
financial statements were prepared based on available information and assumptions
and estimates described in notes to the unaudited pro forma
combined condensed financial statements. IGT has not made a
final determination of required
purchase accounting adjustments, including the allocation of the purchase price
to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and you should consider the
allocation reflected in the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial
statements preliminary. After the completion of the
merger, IGT will include the results of operations of Anchor in the
consolidated financial statements of IGT.

Anchor Stockholders Do Not Have Appraisal Rights

(see page 65)

     Under the corporation laws of the State of Nevada, Anchor’s state of
incorporation, Anchor stockholders do not have any appraisal or dissenters’
rights in connection with the merger.

International Game Technology

Selected Historical Financial Data

     The following selected consolidated financial data as of and for the five
years in the period ended September 30, 2000 have been derived from the audited
consolidated financial statements of IGT, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. The selected historical consolidated financial data for the nine
months ended July 1, 2000 and June 30, 2001 and as of June 30, 2001 have been
derived from the unaudited consolidated financial statements of IGT. These
unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis
consistent with the audited financial statements. The unaudited consolidated
financial statements include, in the opinion of IGT, all normal recurring
adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information. Operating
results for the nine months ended June 30, 2001 are not necessarily indicative
of the results that will be achieved for future periods, including
the fiscal year ending September 29, 2001. In March 1998, IGT purchased Barcrest Limited
and Olympic Amusements Pty. Limited. In September 1999, IGT completed the
purchase of Sodak Gaming, Inc., and in March 2001, IGT completed the purchase
of Silicon Gaming, Inc. The operating results of these acquired entities have
been included in the consolidated financial statements of IGT since the
respective acquisition dates. This selected historical data is only a summary
and should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial
statements and related notes to those financial statements contained in IGT’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended on Form 10-K/A for the year ended
September 30, 2000, IGT’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended
December 30, 2000 and March 31, 2001, each as amended on Form 10-Q/A and IGT’s
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2001, which are
incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See

Certain impairment and restructuring charges are included in the
operating costs and expenses for the fiscal 1999 period.

IGT-Australia

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, IGT incurred an impairment charge of
$86.8 million and restructuring costs of $6.0 million related to its March
1998 acquisition of Olympic Amusements Pty. Ltd. During fiscal 2000, IGT
recorded additional restructuring charges of $1.9 million related to
employee terminations associated with Olympic Amusements Pty. Ltd.

IGT-Brazil

In the fourth quarter of
fiscal 1999, the government of Brazil rescinded the law allowing
gaming devices in bingo halls. At that time, IGT recorded impairment
charges of $5.3 million relating to its assessment of the recoverability
of inventories and receivables in Brazil.

(2)

In the first quarter of fiscal 2000, IGT recorded a legal settlement gain
of $27.0 million ($17.3 million net of tax) from the resolution of legal
actions between IGT and WMS Gaming, Inc.
related to infringement claims involving IGT’s Telnaes patent for virtual
reel technology.

(3)

Senior Notes

In May 1999, IGT completed the private placement of $1.0 billion in
aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act of 1933. The Senior Notes were issued in two tranches:
$400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.875% Senior Notes, due May
15, 2004, priced at 99.053%; and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount
of 8.375% Senior Notes, due May 15, 2009, priced at 98.974%. In August
1999, IGT exchanged all outstanding Senior Notes for identical registered
notes. A portion of the proceeds was used to redeem previously outstanding
7.84% Senior Notes due 2004, which resulted in a prepayment penalty of $3.3
million (net of tax) reflected as an extraordinary item in fiscal 1999.
Additionally, IGT repaid outstanding borrowings under both IGT’s
U.S. and
Australian credit facilities. The remaining net proceeds from the offering
were used to fund IGT’s acquisition of Sodak, working capital, and share
repurchases. We recorded interest expense on the Senior Notes of $31.2
million and $83.6 million for the fiscal years ended October 2, 1999 and
September 30, 2000, and $62.6 million and $63.0 million for the prior and
current nine month periods.

Anchor Gaming

Selected Historical Financial Data

     The following selected consolidated financial data as of and for the five
years in the period ended June 30, 2000 have been derived from the audited
consolidated financial statements of Anchor, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. The selected historical consolidated financial data for the nine
months ended March 31, 2000 and 2001 and as of March 31, 2001 have been derived
from the unaudited consolidated financial statements of Anchor. These
unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis
consistent with the audited financial statements. The unaudited consolidated
financial statements include, in the opinion of Anchor, all normal recurring
adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information. Operating
results for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 are not necessarily indicative
of the results that will be achieved for future periods. The
closing of Anchor’s acquisition of Powerhouse
Technologies, Inc. occurred concurrent with the end of the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1999, and, as a result, the financial statements for the years ended
June 30, 1999 and earlier do not include any Powerhouse results of operations,
with the exception of the acquired in-process research and development charge
recorded for the year ended June 30, 1999 and per-share data. This selected
historical data is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes to
those financial statements contained in Anchor’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as
twice amended on Form 10-K/A, for the year ended June 30, 2000 and Anchor’s
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2000,
December 31, 2000 and March 31, 2001, which are incorporated by reference in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See “Incorporation of Documents by
Reference.” All share amounts and per-share data have been adjusted to reflect
the 2 for 1 stock split effected on November 15, 2000. Certain amounts have
been reclassified from those previously reported to conform to IGT’s current
presentation.

Summary Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Data

     The following summary unaudited pro forma combined financial data give
effect to the merger, which IGT will account for as a purchase business
combination in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the

Sale prices through November 15, 2000 have been adjusted to reflect Anchor’s
2-for-1 stock split effected before the beginning of trading on November 16,
2000.

     On July 6, 2001, the last full trading day before the public announcement
of the merger agreement, the high and low sale prices of Anchor common stock as
reported on the Nasdaq National Market were $55.91 and $52.50, respectively,
and the high and low sale prices of IGT common stock as reported by the New
York Stock Exchange were $62.45 and $58.25, respectively. On
August 17, the last
full trading day before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the
closing price of Anchor common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market
was $52.49, and the closing price of IGT common stock as reported by the New
York Stock Exchange was $52.64.

     IGT and Anchor stockholders are encouraged to obtain current market
quotations for IGT and Anchor common stock from the newspaper, the Internet or
their brokers. The following toll-free number is available for stockholders of
IGT and Anchor to obtain a daily closing price for IGT common stock:
800-__________

     IGT paid cash dividends of $.12 per share in 1998 and $.03 per share in
1999. IGT paid no cash dividends in 2000 or to date in 2001. Anchor has paid
no cash dividends since its initial public offering in 1994.

RISK FACTORS

In making your determination as to how to vote on the merger proposals,
you should consider the following factors:

Risks Relating to the Merger

     Stockholders of IGT and Anchor should carefully consider the following
factors, in addition to those discussed elsewhere herein, in evaluating the
proposed merger and related transactions between the two companies.

The proposed merger may not occur.

     Although IGT and Anchor have signed an agreement to merge Anchor with a
wholly-owned subsidiary of IGT, the completion of the merger is subject to
stockholder and regulatory approvals, and there is no assurance that all of the
conditions will be met and that the merger will be consummated. In addition,
either party may unilaterally terminate the agreement if the merger has not
been consummated on or before January 30, 2002, provided that either party may
extend the time period to consummate the merger to April 30, 2002, if the
failure to consummate is due solely to a failure to obtain a regulatory
approval and the related approval is still being pursued. In addition, if the
IGT Share Value is less than $50.00, Anchor may terminate the merger agreement
subject to IGT’s right to adjust the Exchange Ratio and if the IGT Share Value
is more than $75.00, IGT may terminate the merger agreement subject to Anchor’s
right to adjust the Exchange Ratio, all as more fully described under “Terms of
the Merger Agreement and Related Agreements — Termination.”

     If the merger is not completed for any reason, IGT and Anchor may
experience a number of adverse consequences, including the following:

•

the price of IGT common stock and/or Anchor common
stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of
such stock reflects a market assumption that the merger will be
completed;

•

an adverse reaction from investors and potential
investors of both companies may reduce future financing
opportunities;

•

the pendency of the merger, as well as customary
covenants in the merger agreement that limit Anchor’s ability to
take certain actions without IGT’s consent, may cause Anchor to defer or potentially lose
business opportunities; and

•

the parties’ costs related to the merger, including
legal and accounting fees, must be paid even if the merger is not
completed.

The value of the IGT common stock to be issued in the merger will
fluctuate and will not be fixed at the date of the stockholder meetings at
which the merger is voted upon.

     Under the merger agreement, the Exchange Ratio used to determine the
number of shares of IGT common stock that Anchor stockholders will receive in
the merger is fixed at one-for-one, provided that the IGT Share Value, which is
defined as the average per-share closing price of IGT common stock on the New
York Stock Exchange during the twenty-day trading period ending on the third
trading day before the Anchor stockholders’ meeting or, if the closing date is
more than five trading days after the Anchor stockholders’ meeting, the third
trading day before the closing date, is between $50.00 and $75.00 per share.
See “Terms of the Merger Agreement and Related Agreements — Conversion of
Shares in the Merger.” Within this range, any increase in IGT Share Value will
result in a higher effective price being paid by IGT to Anchor stockholders for
their shares of Anchor common stock, and any decrease in the IGT Share Value
will result in a lower effective price being paid by IGT to Anchor stockholders
for their shares of Anchor common stock. It is possible that the merger will
not be completed until more than five trading days after the Anchor
stockholders’ meeting. If that occurs, then the twenty-day trading period will
not end until the third trading day before the closing date, and the IGT and
Anchor stockholders will not know the Exchange Ratio to be applied in the
merger at the time of their respective stockholders’ meetings or the exact
value of the

merger consideration to be received, because the value of IGT
common stock will fluctuate between the date of the stockholders’ meetings and
the end of the twenty-day trading period.

     Additionally, because the price protections in the merger agreement are
based on a twenty-day trading average per-share closing price of IGT common
stock that will be calculated during a specified time period before the
completion of the merger, IGT’s share price after the conclusion of the
twenty-day trading period through the closing date as well as after the closing
date could either fall significantly below $50.00 or rise significantly above
$75.00 for any period of time and would not trigger any price protections in
favor of either Anchor stockholders or IGT, respectively.

     Anchor common stock and IGT common stock have historically been subject to
substantial price volatility. No assurance can be given as to the market
prices of IGT common stock or Anchor common stock at any time before the
completion of the merger or the market prices of IGT common stock at any time
after the completion of the merger. Anchor and IGT stockholders are advised to
obtain recent market quotations for IGT common stock, and to be aware that the
market price of IGT common stock may, even during a short period of time,
fluctuate significantly in response to various factors, including without
limitation:

•

quarterly variations in operating results;

•

the introduction of new products or services by IGT or its competitors;

•

changes in estimates by securities analysts;

•

market conditions in the gaming industry;

•

announcements and actions by competitors;

•

announcements and actions by customers;

•

regulatory and judicial actions; and

•

general economic conditions.

The merger agreement may be terminated if the IGT Share Value falls or
rises substantially during the specified twenty-day trading period.

     Under the merger agreement, if the IGT Share Value, which is defined as
the average per-share closing price of IGT common stock on the New York Stock
Exchange during the twenty consecutive trading days ending on the third trading
day before the Anchor stockholders’ meeting or, if the closing date is more
than five trading days after the Anchor stockholders’ meeting, the third
trading day before the closing date, falls below $50.00, the board of directors
of Anchor may, without any further vote of its stockholders, either proceed
with the merger agreement and retain the Exchange Ratio of one-for-one or
terminate the merger agreement subject to IGT’s right to accept a higher
Exchange Ratio (greater than one-for-one), such that the value of the IGT
common stock received by Anchor’s stockholders in exchange for each share of
Anchor common stock equals $50.00 per share. If the IGT Share Value during the
applicable period exceeds $75.00, the IGT board of directors may, without any
further vote of its stockholders, either proceed with the merger and retain the
Exchange Ratio of one-for-one or terminate the merger agreement subject to
Anchor’s right to accept a lower Exchange Ratio (less than one-for-one), such
that the value of the IGT common stock received by Anchor’s stockholders in
exchange for each share of Anchor common stock equals $75.00 per share.

Stockholder approval confers broad discretion on Anchor board and IGT
board with respect to the merger.

     If the IGT Share Value falls below $50.00, the board of directors of
Anchor, without any further vote of its stockholders, may elect to either
proceed with the merger with an Exchange Ratio equal to one-for-one or

terminate the merger agreement, in which event the merger agreement would be
terminated unless IGT elects at its sole option to adjust the Exchange Ratio to
provide the Anchor stockholders at least $50.00 in value (based on the IGT
Share Value) per share of Anchor common stock. This discretion given to the
Anchor and IGT boards presents potential risks to Anchor and IGT stockholders.
For example, if the IGT Share Value is less than $50.00 per share and the
Anchor board determines it is in the best interest of Anchor and its
stockholders to proceed with the merger, Anchor stockholders could receive IGT
common stock in the merger with a fair market value that is less than $50.00
per share. Conversely, if the IGT Share Value falls below $50.00 per share,
the Anchor board elects to terminate the merger and IGT elects to adjust the
Exchange Ratio, the Exchange Ratio will be greater than one-for-one
and the number
of shares of IGT common stock issued in the merger will increase, resulting in
greater dilution to the IGT stockholders.

     If the IGT Share Value during the applicable period exceeds $75.00, the
board of directors of IGT, without any further vote of its stockholders, may
elect to either proceed with the merger with an Exchange Ratio equal to
one-for-one or terminate the merger agreement, in which event the
merger agreement would be terminated unless Anchor elects at its sole option to
adjust the Exchange Ratio to provide the Anchor stockholders $75.00 in value
(based on the IGT Share Value) per share of Anchor common stock. This
discretion given to the IGT and Anchor boards also presents potential risks to
IGT and Anchor stockholders. For example, if the IGT Share Value is greater
than $75.00 per share and the IGT board determines it is in the best interest
of IGT and its stockholders to proceed with the merger, IGT could provide
holders of Anchor common stock with IGT common stock having a fair market value
that is more than $75.00 per share of IGT common stock exchanged for each
share of Anchor common stock. Conversely, if the IGT Share Value exceeds
$75.00 per share, the IGT board elects to terminate the merger and Anchor
elects to adjust the Exchange Ratio, the Exchange Ratio will be less than
one-for-one and the percentage interest that the Anchor stockholders will
receive in the combined company will decrease.

Failure to complete the merger could negatively affect Anchor’s ability to
enter into alternative transactions.

     If the merger is terminated and Anchor determines to seek another merger
or business combination, there can be no assurance that it will be able to find
a partner at an attractive price. In addition, while the merger agreement is
in effect, Anchor and its subsidiaries are prohibited from directly or
indirectly soliciting, initiating or encouraging or entering into a merger,
consolidation, purchase of assets, tender offer or other business combination
with any party except where the Anchor board of directors determines in good
faith and after consultation with outside legal counsel, that it must engage in
discussions or negotiations regarding the transaction to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the Anchor stockholders under applicable law. As a result
of this prohibition, Anchor will be precluded from discussing alternative
takeover proposals during the term of the merger agreement, and may lose an
opportunity for a transaction with another potential partner at a favorable
price if the merger is not completed.

Officers and directors of Anchor have different interests from yours that
may influence them to support or approve the merger.

     Officers and directors of Anchor have interests in the merger and
participate in arrangements that are different from, or are in addition to,
those of Anchor stockholders generally. These include the following interests
that will arise if the merger occurs:

•

Thomas J. Matthews, Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer of Anchor, will remain President and Chief
Executive Officer of Anchor and will become Chief Operating
Officer of IGT, and Joseph Murphy will remain Chief Operating
Officer — Gaming Operations of Anchor.

•

Thomas J. Matthews and a person to be mutually agreed
upon by IGT and Anchor will become directors of IGT upon the
closing of the merger, filling two newly created seats on the IGT
board of directors.

•

Thomas J. Matthews, Joseph Murphy, and the three other
members of the Anchor board — Stuart Beath,
Richard Burt and Glen Hettinger — as well as Geoffrey Sage, Chief Financial Officer
of Anchor, David Johnson, General Counsel of Anchor, and Christer
Roman, Chief Operating 

Officer — Systems Division of Anchor, own
stock options to purchase an aggregate of 1,582,300 shares of
Anchor common stock at exercise prices ranging from $15.938 per
share to $50.625 per share. Of these, 1,309,800 shares will be
exercisable at the effective time of the merger, 656,000 of which
will have become exercisable as a result of the merger. See “The
Merger — Interests of Key Persons in the Merger — Treatment of
Options and Restricted Stock.”

•

Thomas J. Matthews, Joseph Murphy, Geoffrey Sage, and
David Johnson have been granted restricted shares of Anchor
common stock in an aggregate amount of 220,000 shares, all of
which will be vested at the time of the merger. Of these,
143,000 shares will vest as a result of the merger.
See “The Merger — Interests of Key Persons in the Merger —
Treatment of Options and Restricted Stock.”

•

Thomas J. Matthews and Joseph Murphy have entered into
voting agreements with IGT dated as of July 8, 2001 by which each
agrees with IGT to vote his outstanding shares of Anchor common
stock in favor of the merger.

     As a result, these officers and directors could be more likely to vote to
approve the merger agreement and the merger itself than if they did not hold
these interests. Anchor stockholders should consider whether these interests
may have influenced these officers and directors to support or recommend the
merger.

IGT stockholders will be diluted by the merger.

     The issuance of shares of IGT common stock to Anchor stockholders in the
merger will dilute the ownership position of the existing stockholders of IGT.
While the number of shares held by IGT stockholders will be unaffected by the
merger itself, after consummation of the merger, former Anchor stockholders
will own approximately 16.6% (18.7% on a fully diluted basis assuming the
exercise of all 2.4 million vested and unvested Anchor stock options which will
become options to purchase IGT common stock upon completion of the merger) of
the outstanding shares of IGT common stock, and existing IGT stockholders will
own approximately 83.4% of the outstanding shares of IGT common stock, assuming
an Exchange Ratio of one-for-one. However, IGT stockholders may be further
diluted if (1) the IGT Share Value falls below $50.00 per share, (2) the Anchor
board elects to terminate the merger and (3) IGT elects to adjust the Exchange
Ratio to be greater than one-for-one, which would increase the number of shares
of IGT common stock issued to Anchor stockholders in the merger.

Risks Relating to the Combined Company After the Merger

     The following factors, in addition to those discussed elsewhere herein,
should be carefully considered by the stockholders of both IGT and Anchor in
evaluating the proposed merger and related transactions between the two
companies.

The merger
could affect key third-party relationships.

     The present and potential relationships of
IGT and Anchor with customers
and other third parties with whom they have relationships may be
affected by the
proposed merger. IGT has casino customers and some of these customers may not favor
IGT acquiring, through the merger, operating casinos in Colorado and a participation interest in the Pala Tribe
casino. Any unfavorable change in its relationships with these customers may
adversely impact IGT. Anchor markets its products to some of
the same customers as does IGT and Anchor does not believe that its business
has been adversely affected by its ownership of casinos in Colorado or its interest in the Pala Tribe casino.
Anchor customers may, in response to the announcement of the merger, delay or
defer decisions concerning Anchor. Anchor could experience a decrease in
expected revenue as a consequence of customers’ uncertainties associated with
the merger. Any delay or deferral in those decisions by Anchor customers could have an adverse effect on Anchor’s business.

IGT may have
difficulties integrating parts of the operations of Anchor.

     To achieve the benefits of the merger, IGT must successfully combine its
business with Anchor’s business and integrate IGT’s and Anchor’s technologies,
products and services so that they operate effectively together. IGT may be
unable to integrate parts of Anchor’s technologies and
operations quickly or smoothly. In addition, integrating the two businesses will entail diversion of IGT
management’s time and attention and IGT may be required to spend
additional money and resources on integration issues that would otherwise be
spent in developing its business and services or other matters. IGT generally
has not engaged in the operation of casinos and it has limited experience doing
so. IGT will rely substantially on Anchor personnel to conduct Anchor’s
casino-operating business following the closing. IGT is evaluating its long
term plans for such business. If the difficulties described above occur, IGT’s
stock price could be negatively affected.

IGT’s success depends in part on its ability to retain key personnel after
the merger.

     IGT’s future success will depend upon, among other things, the continued
service of key IGT and Anchor personnel. Despite IGT’s efforts to hire and
retain quality employees, it might lose some of Anchor’s and its own key
employees following the merger. Competitors may recruit IGT or Anchor
employees before the merger and during integration, as is common in gaming
industry mergers. In addition, some Anchor employees will acquire significant
amounts of IGT common stock or vested stock options in the merger. As a
result, IGT may be required to provide significant incentives for some of
Anchor’s key employees to remain with IGT after the merger.

     In addition, IGT’s future performance depends on its continuing ability to
attract and retain highly qualified employees. IGT competes with other
potential employers for employees, and may not succeed in hiring and retaining
the executives and other employees that it needs. IGT’s loss of or inability
to hire key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition and results of operations.

The accounting
treatment of the merger will result in future non-cash charges
to IGT’s operations.

     IGT will account for the merger as a purchase for financial reporting and
accounting purposes, in accordance with the newly issued SFAS No. 141 “Business
Combinations.” After the completion of the merger, the results of operations
of Anchor will be included in the consolidated financial statements of IGT.
The purchase price will be allocated to Anchor’s assets and liabilities based
on the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. A
portion of the purchase price will also be allocated to identifiable intangible
assets with finite lives, which will be amortized by non-cash charges to operations
under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Any excess of the
cost over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of Anchor
acquired will be recorded as goodwill. In accordance with SFAS No. 142
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized but will
be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis. IGT will record a
non-cash charge to
operations if the goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives are
deemed to be impaired. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Statements.”

IGT’s pro forma accounting for the merger may change.

     Unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information is presented
for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the
combined condensed financial position or results of operations of future
periods or the results that actually would have been realized had Anchor’s
results been consolidated with IGT’s during this period. IGT has allocated the
total estimated purchase price for the merger on a preliminary basis to assets
and liabilities based on IGT’s best estimates of the fair value of these assets
and liabilities, with the excess costs over the fair value of the net tangible
and identifiable intangible assets acquired allocated to goodwill.
IGT's preliminary allocation of the purchase price does not include
an estimate for in-process research and development as it is not
estimated to be material. These allocations and the estimated lives of the assets are subject to change pending
a final analysis of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed and the estimated lives of the assets. The impact of these changes
could be material.

Issuance of additional shares of IGT common stock may reduce the IGT share
price.

     At the closing of the merger, based on the number of shares of Anchor
common stock outstanding at the time the companies signed the merger agreement
and assuming an Exchange Ratio of one-for-one, IGT expects to issue
approximately 14.9 million new shares of IGT common stock to current Anchor
stockholders (excluding approximately 2.4 million shares to be issued upon the
exercise of any currently outstanding Anchor stock options which will, as a
result of the merger, become options to purchase IGT common stock). The
issuance of this additional IGT common stock in the merger will reduce IGT’s
earnings per share. This dilution could reduce the market price of IGT common
stock unless and until the combined company achieves revenue growth or cost
savings and other business economies sufficient to offset the effect of this
issuance. There can be no assurance that IGT will achieve revenue growth, cost
savings or other business economies or that an Anchor stockholder will achieve
greater returns as an IGT stockholder.

IGT will assume significant additional debt.

     As of March 31, 2001, Anchor had total consolidated debt of $430.0
million, consisting of $180.0 million under its senior credit facility, $248.0
million under its 9-7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes, and $2.0 million in equipment
financing for one of its subsidiaries. Anchor also has a $100.0 million guarantee of a
credit facility for the Pala Band of Mission Indians. See “— Risks Relating to
Anchor” below in this section. Concurrently with the merger, IGT will
refinance Anchor’s obligations under its senior credit facility, which will be
repaid in full and terminated. The merger
will constitute a “change of control” of Anchor under the indenture
governing the 9-7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes. As a result, Anchor will be
required within ten days following the merger to make an offer to purchase the
notes in cash in an amount equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of
the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the repurchase. IGT
will be required to fund any repurchases of the notes required as a result of
note holders’ electing to have their notes purchased in the change of control
offer. IGT anticipates, however, that the 9-7/8% Senior Subordinated
Notes will remain outstanding following the merger as the notes are
currently trading at prices in excess of 101% of the
principal amount of the notes. The equipment financing and the Pala guarantee will also remain
outstanding. As of June 30, 2001, IGT had total consolidated
debt of $992.0 million. IGT’s ability to service the debt of the combined company will depend
on its ability to generate cash flow in the future. Any inability to generate
sufficient cash flow to service the debt of the combined company or to
refinance this debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on
the financial condition of the combined company.

Anchor and its subsidiaries will remain subject to covenant restrictions
in Anchor’s indenture
.

     The Indenture governing Anchor’s 9-7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes contains
a number of covenants restricting Anchor and its subsidiaries, including, among
other things, their ability to borrow money, pay dividends or distributions,
purchase or redeem stock, make investments and extend credit, engage in
transactions with affiliates, engage in sale-leaseback transactions, consummate
certain asset sales, effect a consolidation or merger or sell, transfer, lease,
or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets, and create
liens on their assets. Anchor and its subsidiaries will be required to
continue to comply with these covenants after the merger as long as the notes
remain outstanding. These covenants may restrict IGT’s and Anchor’s ability to
finance future operations or capital needs of the combined company.

Risks Relating to IGT

     By voting in favor of the merger, Anchor stockholders will be choosing to
invest in IGT. An investment in IGT common stock involves risk. As a
stockholder of Anchor, you should carefully consider the following risk factors
relating to an investment in IGT before you decide whether to vote to approve
and adopt the merger agreement. Some of these risks may be increased by a
merger between IGT and Anchor. You should also consider the other information
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the additional information in
IGT’s other reports on file with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find More
Information” on page 99.

Slow growth in new casinos or the rate of replacement of existing gaming
machines could impact future profits.

     Demand for IGT’s products is driven substantially by the replacement of
existing gaming machines and the establishment of new gaming jurisdictions and
the addition of new casinos or expansion of existing casinos within existing
gaming jurisdictions. The establishment or expansion of gaming in any
jurisdiction typically requires a public referendum or other legislative
action. As a result, gaming continues to be the subject of public debate, and
there are numerous active organizations that oppose gaming. Opposition to
gaming could cause gaming operations to be restricted or prohibited in any
jurisdiction. In addition, the rate of growth in the North American
marketplace has diminished since the substantial growth experienced in the
early 1990s. A continued reduction in growth or in the number of gaming
jurisdictions or delays in the opening of new or expanded casinos could have an
adverse impact on demand for IGT’s products and, consequently, IGT’s
operations. IGT has also experienced recently increased demand for replacement
machines. Any decrease in this trend would adversely affect IGT’s business.
IGT’s success in the competitive gaming industry depends on its ability to
develop innovative products and systems.

     A decline in the popularity of IGT’s gaming products with players, a lack
of success in developing new products or an increase in the popularity of
existing or new games of IGT’s competitors could have an adverse impact on
IGT’s operations.

     The popularity of any of IGT’s gaming products may decline over time as
consumer preferences change or as new, competing games are introduced by IGT’s
competitors. The gaming industry is intensely competitive, and many of IGT’s
competitors have substantial resources and specialize in the development and
marketing of their products. If IGT fails to develop games that achieve
customer acceptance or if IGT’s existing games become obsolete due to the
introduction of popular games by IGT’s competitors, the effects on IGT’s
operations could be material and adverse. In addition, the introduction of new
and innovative products by IGT’s competitors that are successful in meeting
consumer preferences could have a material and adverse effect on IGT.

     IGT places its
proprietary gaming machines in casinos at no cost to the
casinos under short-term arrangements, making these games susceptible to
replacement due to pressure from competitors, changes in economic conditions,
obsolescence and declining popularity. IGT intends to maintain and expand the
number of installed wide-area progressive systems through the enhancement of
existing games, the introduction of new games and enhancement of customer
service, but IGT cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful.

The gaming industry is highly regulated and these regulations may have an
impact on IGT’s operations.

     IGT is subject to extensive gaming regulations. Changes in these
regulations or findings of non-compliance could adversely affect IGT’s
operations.

     The manufacture, sale and distribution of gaming devices and operation of
gaming systems are subject to extensive state laws, regulations of the Nevada
Gaming Commission and various other gaming authorities as well as numerous
county and municipal ordinances. These laws, regulations and ordinances vary
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but primarily concern the responsibility,
financial stability and character of gaming equipment manufacturers,
distributors and operators, as well as persons financially interested or
involved in gaming operations. Changes in these laws, regulations and
procedures could have an adverse effect on IGT’s operations. Gaming
manufacturers are currently subject to significant state and local taxation.
Increases in applicable taxes in any jurisdiction in which IGT operates could
have an adverse effect on IGT.

     IGT and its licensed gaming subsidiaries are required to submit detailed
financial and operating reports to the various gaming authorities. If it were
determined that gaming laws were violated by a licensee, the gaming licenses it
holds could be limited, conditioned, suspended or revoked. In addition to the
licensee, IGT and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines
for each separate violation of the gaming laws at the discretion of each gaming
authority. The limitation, conditioning, suspension or revocation of any gaming
license could materially and adversely affect IGT’s operations and future
performance.

The failure to receive patents on new technology or the infringement of
existing patents could have a material adverse impact on IGT.

     IGT has obtained patents and copyrights with respect to various aspects of
IGT’s games and other products, including progressive systems and player
tracking systems. These patents include new game designs, bonus and secondary
game features, gaming device components, gaming systems and a variety of other
aspects of video and electronic slot machines and associated equipment. IGT
cannot provide any assurances that its patents will not be infringed or that
others will not develop similar technology that does not violate the patents.

IGT’s international operations could pose substantial risks.

     International jurisdictions accounted for approximately 27% of IGT’s total
revenue for fiscal 2000 and 19% of IGT’s total revenues for the first nine
months of fiscal 2001. IGT expects international revenues to continue to
represent a significant portion of total revenue. International product sales
are subject to inherent risks, including variation in local economies,
fluctuating exchange rates, greater difficulty in accounts receivable
collection, trade barriers and burdens of complying with a variety of
international laws. In addition, political and economic instability in foreign
countries may slow or limit the development of additional international markets
for IGT’s products. There can be no assurance that one or more of these factors
will not have a material and adverse effect on IGT’s operations.

Risks Relating to Anchor

     By voting in favor of the issuance of shares of IGT common stock to Anchor
stockholders, IGT stockholders will be approving IGT’s acquisition of Anchor.
As a stockholder of IGT, you should carefully consider the following risk
factors relating to the acquisition of Anchor before you decide whether to vote
to approve the issuance of shares of IGT common stock to Anchor stockholders.
Some of these risks may be increased by a merger between IGT and Anchor. You
should also consider the other information in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and the additional information in Anchor’s other reports
on file with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find More
Information” on page 99.

Anchor’s success in the gaming industry depends in large part on its
ability to develop innovative products and systems.

     The popularity of any of Anchor’s existing gaming machines may decline
over time as consumer preferences change or as Anchor’s competitors introduce
new games, and Anchor could fail to develop new games that achieve customer
acceptance. Anchor can give you no assurance that its existing and future games
will be able to successfully compete with those of its competitors.

     If Anchor is unable to develop innovative products or systems in the
future, or if its current products or systems become obsolete, Anchor’s ability
to sustain current revenues with existing customers or to generate revenue from
new customers would be affected. This could reduce Anchor’s current
profitability or potential growth.

     Anchor’s strategy of creating recurring revenues from its proprietary
games by placing them in casinos under a royalty, revenue participation, fixed
daily rental fee or similar arrangement involves a departure from casinos’
traditional practice of purchasing gaming machines. Because Anchor’s pricing
methodology includes revenue-sharing arrangements, Anchor is under pressure to
reduce the share of revenues it receives. Anchor believes this pressure will
increase if consolidation trends in the casino industry continue.

     If the popularity of any of Anchor’s gaming machines were to decline
relative to the popularity of competitors’ gaming machines, Anchor might be
unable to retain its revenue-sharing model. Additionally, if Anchor’s
competitors decide to pursue a revenue-sharing strategy and offer products or
terms that are more favorable than Anchor’s, Anchor might be unable to
successfully pursue its revenue-sharing strategy. If either one of these
conditions were to occur, Anchor’s operations and revenues would be materially
and adversely affected.

Anchor operates in a highly competitive industry.

     Anchor competes with domestic and foreign manufacturers of gaming
equipment and providers of traditional on-line lottery systems, many of whom
are larger than Anchor and have access to greater financial resources. Anchor’s
failure to continually adapt its products to consumer preferences could
negatively affect its ability to effectively compete in this industry.

     Anchor’s casinos in Colorado face increasing competition from existing,
new and planned casino properties in the immediate vicinity. In particular, in
the Black Hawk, Colorado area, a number of competitors have opened large
facilities in excellent locations with more available parking and a larger
number of gaming machines than Anchor operates, and several more large casinos
are in the planning stages. For example, the Black Hawk Hyatt is scheduled to
open in December 2001. Anchor expects that the increased competition will have
a continued negative effect on its revenues, as well as on costs of gaming
operations, such as promotions, and costs related to retaining and recruiting
employees. Additionally, the completion of a planned new road into Central
City, Colorado could negatively affect Anchor’s business in that area by
altering existing traffic patterns, thereby making the location of Anchor’s
casino less desirable.

     The Pala Casino,
which Anchor manages under an agreement with the Pala
Band of Mission Indians, operates in a very competitive
environment. There are nine operating casinos in the San
Diego area alone, many of which are expanding, upgrading or building
entirely new facilities.

     Anchor’s most significant route operations are in southern Nevada, an area
which has recently experienced significant population growth. Anchor cannot be
certain that this growth trend will continue. If it does not continue, or if
Anchor faces increased competition from expanding grocery store chains and
local casinos, the profitability of Anchor’s route operations could be
negatively affected.

     Anchor’s on-line lottery business faces competition from other on-line
lottery system providers, instant lottery ticket manufacturers and other
competitors, some of whom have substantially greater financial resources than
Anchor. On-line lottery business is acquired through contracts with state
lottery authorities, which are awarded through a competitive bidding process.
Anchor cannot guarantee that it will be successful in obtaining or maintaining
contracts with state lottery authorities.

Anchor’s gaming machine business segment depends on maintaining a strong
relationship with IGT.

     Anchor derives a large portion of its revenues and profits from the
Anchor-IGT joint venture. Because Anchor’s revenues and profits from the
Anchor-IGT joint venture are integral to the continued success of Anchor’s
business, any failure to complete the merger could have a negative impact on
its relationship with IGT and, as a result, have a material impact on Anchor’s
business.

Government regulation could have a negative effect on Anchor’s business.

     Anchor is subject to extensive gaming regulations. Changes in these
regulations or findings of non-compliance could adversely effect its
operations.

     The majority of gaming jurisdictions require the testing and approval of
the gaming machines that Anchor manufactures or supplies. Anchor can give you
no assurances that regulatory authorities will approve its new game submissions
or that games currently approved will continue to meet new standards imposed by
changes to any gaming laws or regulations.

     Anchor sometimes manufactures games pending regulatory approval, which
subjects Anchor to the risk of having to either retrofit or abandon games upon
noncompliance with or modification of gaming laws and regulations. If games do
not receive regulatory approval, costs incurred in their manufacture would
result in additional expense.

     In the United States and many other countries, wagering and lotteries must
be expressly authorized by law. Once authorized, the wagering industry and the
operations of lotteries are subject to extensive and evolving governmental
regulation. Anchor can give you no assurances that additional jurisdictions
will approve the operation of gaming machines, on-line lottery systems,
pari-mutuel wagering systems, video lottery or other forms of

 wagering or lottery systems or that those jurisdictions that currently
permit these wagering and lottery activities will continue to permit these
activities.

Anchor relies on third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers.

     The use of outside vendors, some of which are Anchor’s competitors, to
manufacture a significant portion of Anchor’s proprietary gaming machines and
parts may limit Anchor’s ability to develop machines at costs that will result
in acceptable operating margins. The inability to obtain gaming machines and
components, production parts and replacement parts on reasonable terms will
adversely affect Anchor’s operating margins. In addition, the inability to
obtain these components and parts on a timely basis may hinder Anchor’s ability
to introduce new gaming machines on schedule, which would delay the receipt of
revenue from the games.

Anchor’s business depends on the protection of its intellectual property
and proprietary information.

     Anchor’s success depends, in part, on protecting its intellectual
property, which includes patents and trademarks, as well as proprietary or
confidential information that is not subject to patent or similar protection.
Competitors may independently develop similar or superior products, software,
systems or business models. Such independent development may, in the case of
Anchor’s intellectual property that is not protected by an enforceable patent
or similar protection, result in a significant reduction in the value of
Anchor’s intellectual property.

     Anchor cannot assure you that it will be able to protect its intellectual
property or that unauthorized third parties will not try to copy Anchor’s
products, business models or systems or use Anchor’s confidential information
to develop competing products.

     Anchor also cannot assure you that its business activities and products
will not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, or that other parties
will not assert infringement claims against Anchor. Any such claims and any
resulting litigation, should it occur, could subject Anchor to significant
liability for damages and could result in invalidation of Anchor’s proprietary
rights, distract management, and require Anchor to enter into costly and
burdensome royalty and licensing agreements. Such royalty and licensing
agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to Anchor, or
may not be available at all. Anchor may also need to file lawsuits to defend
the validity of its intellectual property rights and trade secrets, or to
determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such
litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial
costs and diversion of resources.

     Anchor also relies on technologies that it licenses from third parties.
Anchor cannot assure you that these third-party licenses will continue to be
available to Anchor on commercially reasonable terms.

     Anchor also generally enters into confidentiality or license agreements
with its employees, consultants and corporate partners, and generally controls
access to, and the distribution of, Anchor product designs, documentation and
other proprietary information, as well as the designs, documentation and other
information Anchor licenses from others. Anchor also may take other steps to
protect these rights and information. Despite Anchor’s efforts to protect
these proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may copy, develop independently
or otherwise obtain and use Anchor’s products or technology.

Anchor’s lottery operations are dependent on renewable contracts with
performance requirements.

     Anchor conducts lottery operations under contracts with state lottery
authorities that are renewable at the option of the lottery authority. Upon the
expiration of a lottery contract, lottery authorities usually award the new
contract through a competitive bidding process. Contracts representing over
16% of Anchor’s revenues from on-line lottery operations for the nine months
ended March 31, 2001 are scheduled to expire or reach optional extension dates
during the next three years. Anchor cannot assure you that its current lottery
contracts will be extended or that it will be awarded new lottery contracts.
See also “— Anchor may be subject to adverse determinations in pending
litigation” for a discussion of litigation risks relating to Anchor’s lottery
operations.

     In addition, lottery contracts to which Anchor is a party frequently
contain exacting implementation schedules and performance requirements. If
Anchor fails to meet these schedules and requirements, Anchor could be subject
to substantial contractual liquidated damages claims, some as high as $1.0
million per day, as well as possible contract termination. Any such liquidated
damage claims are typically negotiated at the time of the alleged breach. Such
damages or contract terminations could have a material adverse effect on
Anchor’s financial performance. Anchor’s lottery contracts also generally
require Anchor to post performance bonds securing Anchor’s performance under
such contracts, which in some cases may be substantial. Any failure by Anchor
to perform under any of these contracts could result in an obligation to pay
significant damages, which would result in substantial costs and diversion of
resources and could have a negative effect on Anchor’s financial condition.

Anchor has obligations under agreements with the Pala Band of Mission
Indians that subject it to joint venture and sovereign immunity risks.

     In September 1999, Anchor entered into agreements with the Pala Band of
Mission Indians to develop and manage a casino in northern San Diego County,
California. As part of Anchor’s development and management agreements with the
Pala tribe, Anchor has agreed to guarantee the tribe’s $100.0 million credit
facility. If the casino is not successful, Anchor may incur substantial
expense in meeting this guarantee obligation. Anchor cannot predict the
long-term profitability of the Pala Casino.

     Anchor’s development and management agreements with regard to the Pala
Casino are with the sovereign nation of the Pala Band of Mission Indians. Thus,
the contract may not be an enforceable legal obligation, and in the event the
Pala tribe were to default under the development and management agreements,
Anchor’s legal recourse may be inadequate to cover its damages.

     The term of Anchor’s management agreement with the Pala tribe is seven
years from the opening date of the Pala Casino, which was April 3, 2001. Anchor
cannot give you any assurances that the management agreement will be extended
beyond its initial seven-year term.

Anchor may be subject to adverse determinations in pending litigation.

     At present, Anchor is a party to pending litigation matters with GTECH
Holdings Corporation (action by GTECH challenging the validity of Anchor’s
lottery contract with the State of Florida and the Florida Department of
Lottery) and Acres Gaming (action against Acres alleging infringement of
Anchor’s secondary-events patents and related counterclaim by Acres). These
matters are more fully described in the section “Legal Proceedings” in Anchor’s
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2001. Anchor can
give you no assurance that it will achieve favorable results in any existing or
future litigation.

Anchor’s gaming machines and gaming operations segments are subject to
seasonality and are affected by weather conditions.

     The second quarter of Anchor’s fiscal year, which includes the months of
October, November and December, generally produces lower levels of
profitability than other quarters, because of a lack of tourist traffic during
those months in most of the markets in which Anchor operates. Anchor’s business
during the winter months could also face the additional negative effects of
inclement weather and accompanying poor road conditions, which would make it
more difficult for customers to travel to Anchor’s Colorado casinos.

Leverage may impair Anchor’s financial condition and Anchor may incur
significant additional debt.

     Anchor has a significant amount of debt. As of March 31, 2001, Anchor’s
total consolidated debt was approximately $430.0 million.

     Anchor’s significant debt could have important consequences for Anchor, including:

•

increasing Anchor’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

limiting Anchor’s ability to obtain additional
financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions and other general corporate requirements;

•

requiring a substantial portion of Anchor’s cash flow
from operations for the payment of interest on Anchor’s debt and
reducing Anchor’s ability to use its cash flow to fund working
capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate
requirements;

•

limiting Anchor’s flexibility in planning for, or
reacting to, changes in its business and the industry; and

•

placing Anchor at a competitive disadvantage to other
less leveraged competitors.

     In addition, Anchor may incur significant additional debt. Subject to
specified limitations, the indenture governing Anchor’s 9-7/8% Senior
Subordinated Notes permits Anchor and its subsidiaries to incur substantial
additional debt and Anchor’s senior credit facility will permit additional
borrowings.

Servicing Anchor’s debt will require a significant amount of cash, and
Anchor’s ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of
which are beyond its control.

     Anchor’s ability to make payments on and refinance its debt and to fund
planned capital expenditures depends on Anchor’s ability to generate cash flow
in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial,
competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are
beyond Anchor’s control. In addition, the ability to borrow funds under
Anchor’s senior credit facility in the future will depend on Anchor’s meeting
the financial covenants in the agreements, including a minimum interest
coverage test and a maximum leverage ratio test. Anchor cannot assure you that
its business will generate cash flow from operations or that future borrowings
will be available to Anchor under its senior credit facility in an amount
sufficient to enable Anchor to pay its debt or to fund other liquidity needs.
As a result, Anchor may need to refinance all or a portion of its debt on or
before maturity. Anchor’s senior credit facility matures in June 2004. Anchor
cannot assure you that it will be able to refinance any of its debt on
favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or
refinance Anchor’s debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect
on Anchor’s financial condition.

Covenant restrictions under Anchor’s senior credit facility and the
indenture may limit Anchor’s ability to operate its business.

     Anchor’s senior credit facility and the indenture governing Anchor’s
9-7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes contain, and certain of Anchor’s other
agreements regarding debt contain, among other things, covenants that may
restrict Anchor’s and its subsidiary guarantors’ ability to finance future
operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. Anchor’s
senior credit facility and the indenture restrict, among other things, Anchor’s
and the guarantors’ ability to: borrow money; pay dividends or distributions;
purchase or redeem stock; make investments and extend credit; engage in
transactions with affiliates; engage in sale-leaseback transactions; consummate
certain asset sales; effect a consolidation or merger or sell, transfer, lease,
or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of Anchor’s assets; and create
liens on Anchor’s assets.

     In addition, Anchor’s senior credit facility requires it to maintain
specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests which
may require that Anchor take action to reduce its debt or act in a manner
contrary to Anchor’s business objectives. Events beyond Anchor’s control,
including changes in general economic and business conditions, may affect
Anchor’s ability to meet those financial ratios and financial condition tests.
Anchor cannot assure you that it will meet those tests or that the lenders will
waive any failure to meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants would
result in a default under Anchor’s senior credit facility and the indenture. If
an event of default under Anchor’s senior credit facility occurs, the lenders
could declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued
interest, to be immediately due and payable.

     In the third quarter of fiscal 2001, Anchor incurred $128.5 million of
impairment, restructuring and other charges. Because of these charges, Anchor
will not, under the terms of its Senior Subordinated Notes, have the
ability to repurchase stock, make certain investments or pay dividends
until Anchor exceeds certain cumulated profit thresholds. Anchor believes
these thresholds will be achieved around March of 2002.

Record Dates; Voting Rights

IGT. 
Only holders of IGT common stock at the close of business on
     are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the IGT special
meeting. At the close of business on      , there were      
shares of IGT common stock outstanding, held by approximately      holders of
record. Each holder of record, as of the record date, of shares of IGT common
stock is entitled to cast one vote per share at the IGT special meeting.

Anchor. 
Only holders of Anchor common stock at the close of business on
     are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special
meeting. At the close of business on      , there were      
shares of Anchor common stock outstanding, held by approximately      holders
of record. Each holder of record, as of the record date, of shares of Anchor
common stock is entitled to cast one vote per share at the Anchor special
meeting.

Quorum

IGT. 
The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of
the shares of IGT common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on      
will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting
in accordance with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. The shares of IGT
common stock present at the special meeting that abstain from voting or that
are the subject of broker non-votes will be included for the purpose of
determining a quorum. If a quorum is not present, the special meeting may be
adjourned from time to time without further notice, if the time and place of
the adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting, until a quorum is obtained.

Anchor. 
The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority
of the shares of Anchor common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on
     will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the
special meeting in accordance with Anchor’s bylaws. The shares of Anchor
common stock present at the special

 meeting that abstain from voting or that are the subject of broker
non-votes will be included for the purpose of determining a quorum. If a
quorum is not present, the special meeting may be adjourned from time to time
without further notice, if the time and place of the adjourned meeting are
announced at the meeting, until a quorum is obtained.

Vote Required

IGT. 
The rules governing companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange
require companies to obtain stockholder approval before issuing additional
shares of common stock in connection with an acquisition if the number of
additional shares proposed to be issued, including assumed stock options,
exceeds 20% of the shares outstanding before the issuance. The number of IGT
shares to be issued or issuable following the merger will exceed 20% of IGT’s
currently outstanding shares of common stock assuming an Exchange
Ratio of one-for-one. Consequently, IGT is seeking its
stockholders’ approval of the issuance of IGT common stock in the merger. The
rules of the New York Stock Exchange provide that the issuance must be approved
by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast at the
IGT stockholders’ meeting in person or by proxy. In addition, approval and
adoption of the plan amendment also requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the votes cast at the IGT stockholders’ meeting in
person or by proxy. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as votes
cast for purposes of determining whether either proposal has been approved. A
broker non-vote occurs when a nominee holding stock for a beneficial owner does
not vote on a particular matter because the nominee lacks discretionary voting
power with respect to the matter and has not received voting instructions from
the beneficial owner. Similarly, any shares of IGT common stock held by an IGT
stockholder who fails to return a proxy or attend the special meeting to vote
in person, will not count as having been voted for the purpose of determining
whether either proposal has been approved. The IGT board urges you to complete,
date and sign the accompanying proxy and return it promptly in the enclosed,
postage-paid envelope.

Anchor. 
Approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Anchor common
stock outstanding on the record date. Abstentions will have the same effect as
votes against the merger proposal. Broker non-votes are not counted as votes
cast for purposes of determining whether a proposal has been approved, but,
like abstentions, broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes against
the merger proposal. Similarly, the failure of an Anchor stockholder to return
a proxy or attend the special meeting to vote in person will have the effect of
a vote against the merger proposal. The Anchor board urges you to complete,
date and sign the accompanying proxy and return it promptly in the enclosed,
postage-paid envelope.

Proxies

IGT. 
The IGT board is soliciting proxies for the IGT special
stockholders’ meeting to enable its stockholders to vote upon the IGT merger
proposal, whether or not they attend the IGT special meeting. All shares of
IGT common stock represented by proxies properly received before or at the
special meeting and not revoked will be voted in accordance with the
instructions indicated on the proxies. If a signed proxy is delivered to IGT,
but no voting instructions are indicated on it, the shares represented by that
proxy will be voted in favor of the IGT merger proposal. Any proxy given on
the accompanying form may be revoked by the person giving it at any time before
it is voted. Proxies may be revoked, or the votes reflected in the proxy
changed, by:

•

submitting, including by telecopy, a written notice of
revocation bearing a later date than the date of the proxy to the
Secretary of IGT, before the vote is taken at the special
meeting;

•

submitting a properly executed later-dated proxy relating to the same shares; or

•

attending the special meeting and voting in person.

     To vote in person at the IGT special meeting, you must attend the meeting
and cast your votes in accordance with the voting procedures established for
the meeting. Attendance at the meeting will not in and of itself constitute a
revocation of a proxy. Any written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy
must be sent so as to be delivered at or before the vote is taken at the IGT
special meeting to:

     International Game Technology

     9295 Prototype Drive

     Reno, Nevada 89511-0580

IGT stockholders should not send in any stock certificates with their
proxy cards. IGT stockholders will continue to own their shares of IGT common
stock after the merger and should continue to hold their stock certificates.

Anchor. 
The Anchor board is soliciting proxies for the Anchor special
stockholders’ meeting to enable its stockholders to vote upon the Anchor merger
proposal, whether or not they attend the Anchor special meeting. All shares of
Anchor common stock represented by proxies properly received before or at the
special meeting and not revoked will be voted in accordance with the
instructions indicated on the proxies. If a signed proxy is delivered to
Anchor, but no voting instructions are indicated on it, the shares represented
by that proxy will be voted in favor of the Anchor merger proposal. Any proxy
given on the accompanying form may be revoked by the person giving it at any
time before it is voted. Proxies may be revoked, or the votes reflected in the
proxy changed, by:

•

submitting, including by telecopy, a written notice of
revocation bearing a later date than the date of the proxy to the
Secretary of Anchor, before the vote is taken at the special
meeting;

•

submitting a properly executed later-dated proxy relating to the same shares; or

•

attending the special meeting and voting in person.

     To vote in person at the Anchor special meeting, you must attend the
meeting and cast your votes in accordance with the voting procedures
established for the meeting. Attendance at the meeting will not in and of
itself constitute a revocation of a proxy. Any written notice of revocation or
subsequent proxy must be sent so as to be delivered at or before the vote is
taken at the Anchor special meeting to:

     Anchor Gaming

     815 Pilot Road, Suite G

     Las Vegas, Nevada 89119

     Facsimile: (702) 896-6992

     Phone: (702) 896-7568

     Attention: Secretary

     Stockholders who require assistance in changing or revoking a proxy should
contact Anchor’s Secretary at the address or phone number provided above.

Anchor stockholders should not send in any stock certificates with their
proxy cards. A letter of transmittal with instructions for the surrender of
certificates representing Anchor common stock will be mailed to Anchor
stockholders as soon as practicable after the effective time of the merger.

     Solicitation of Proxies

     IGT and Anchor will each bear the cost of proxy solicitation for their
respective stockholders’ meetings, including the reasonable expenses of
brokers, fiduciaries and other nominees in forwarding solicitation material to
beneficial owners. In addition to solicitation by mail, directors, officers
and employees of IGT and Anchor may solicit proxies personally or by telephone,
facsimile transmission or otherwise. IGT and Anchor will not pay additional
compensation to these directors, officers and employees for their solicitation
but may reimburse them for

 out-of-pocket expenses. IGT and Anchor expect to incur nominal expenses,
if any, to engage in such solicitation. IGT has retained                      at an
estimated cost of approximately $          , plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses, to assist in solicitation of proxies for both the IGT stockholders’
meeting and Anchor stockholders’ meeting. IGT and Anchor will make
arrangements with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees, fiduciaries
and stockholders of record to forward proxy solicitation materials to the
beneficial owners of the stock held of record by such persons. IGT may
reimburse the solicitor for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

THE MERGER

Background of the Merger

     IGT and Anchor have been joint venture partners in developing casino
games, most notably Wheel of Fortune® and I Dream of Jeannie™, since 1996. The
joint venture working relationship led to several discussions of strategic
transactions between senior management and executive officers of IGT and
Anchor. The material contacts and discussions between IGT and Anchor since
November 1998 with respect to a merger, consolidation, acquisition, tender
offer, election of directors or sale of substantial assets are summarized
below. All of the exchange ratios and share amounts discussed below have been
adjusted to give effect to the two-for-one stock split effected by Anchor in
November 2000.

     During early November 1998, Charles N. Mathewson, Chairman of the Board of
IGT, and Stanley E. Fulton, former Chairman of the Board of Anchor, discussed a
possible business combination between IGT and Anchor. On November 6, 1998, Mr.
Mathewson and a representative of O’Melveny & Myers LLP, IGT’s counsel, and Mr.
Fulton and a representative of Hughes & Luce, LLP, Anchor’s counsel, met in
Indian Wells, California to discuss a possible business combination of the two
companies. On November 9, 1998, IGT’s counsel sent a draft of a proposed
merger agreement to Anchor’s counsel. The agreement reflected a proposed
stock-for-stock merger with a fixed exchange ratio of one share of IGT stock
for each share of Anchor stock. Anchor’s counsel responded to IGT’s counsel
with written comments to the draft merger agreement on November 11, 1998, and
IGT’s counsel and Anchor’s counsel discussed the matters raised by the written
comments on the same day. On November 14, 1998, IGT’s counsel sent a revised
draft of the merger agreement to Anchor’s counsel. On November 16, 1998,
Anchor’s counsel provided IGT’s counsel with a memorandum commenting on the
revised draft of the merger agreement. Anchor’s counsel conveyed more detailed
written comments to the revised draft merger agreement to IGT’s counsel on
November 17, 1998.

     On November 17, 1998, IGT sent a list of items that IGT desired to review
in connection with its due diligence examination of Anchor. Shortly
thereafter, Anchor sent a list of items that Anchor desired to review in
connection with its due diligence examination of IGT. Materials in response to
the requests for information were exchanged.

     On November 18, 1998, IGT’s counsel and Anchor’s counsel held a conference
call to discuss IGT’s November 14, 1998 draft of the merger agreement and
Anchor’s comments conveyed on November 17, 1998. On November 19, 1998, Anchor
retained Merrill Lynch to act as its financial advisor in connection with the
proposed transaction.

     On November 19 and 20, 1998, Mr. Fulton and Mr. Mathewson met with
representatives of IGT’s counsel and Anchor’s counsel to discuss the terms of
the merger agreement. On November 20, 1998, Anchor and IGT executed mutual
confidentiality and standstill agreements.

     On November 23, 1998, Anchor held a board meeting at which the state of
negotiations between IGT and Anchor was discussed. On November 24, 1998, IGT’s
counsel and Anchor’s counsel held a conference call to discuss issues arising
out of the Anchor board meeting and IGT’s most recent draft of the merger
agreement. On November 24, 1998, IGT’s counsel sent to Anchor’s counsel a
revised draft of the merger agreement. On November 30, 1998, Anchor’s counsel
responded to the revised draft merger agreement in writing. Mr. Mathewson and
Mr. Fulton met shortly thereafter and Mr. Mathewson proposed that the exchange
ratio should be lowered to something less than one share of IGT stock for each
share of Anchor stock.

     On December 8, 1998, the IGT board of directors met and discussed the
status of discussions with Anchor. The board authorized the continuation of
negotiations. Anchor, after considering IGT’s proposal to lower the exchange
ratio, determined not to proceed and discussions terminated. IGT and Anchor
later confirmed to each other that they had destroyed all confidential
information that they had exchanged pursuant to the then existing
confidentiality agreements.

     In late December 1999 and January 2000, Mr. Mathewson and Mr. Fulton again
had discussions about the possibility of a business combination. In January of
2000, IGT and Anchor signed mutual confidentiality agreements. These
discussions terminated before a draft agreement was exchanged.

     In June 2000, Mr. Fulton contacted Mr. Mathewson to determine whether IGT
had any interest in a merger transaction that would have a cash component for
Anchor stockholders. Mr. Mathewson and Mr. Fulton had several conversations
over the next several days exploring the possibility of such a transaction. On
June 21, 2000, IGT and Anchor signed mutual confidentiality agreements and
began to exchange due diligence materials. IGT and Anchor commenced due
diligence reviews and Mr. Mathewson and Mr. Fulton continued to discuss the
terms of a possible business combination.

     On July 27, 2000, IGT’s counsel sent a draft merger agreement to Anchor’s
counsel. IGT proposed that Anchor consider a stock-for-stock transaction that
included a cash election feature. Under the proposed transaction, each share
of Anchor stock would be exchanged for one share of IGT stock or, at the
election of the stockholders of Anchor, $30.00 per share of Anchor common
stock, provided that the aggregate number of Anchor shares that could be
converted into cash could not exceed 49% of the outstanding shares of Anchor
common stock. On August 2, 2000, Anchor held a board meeting at which the
terms of the proposed transaction were discussed. On that same date, Mr.
Fulton, Thomas J. Matthews, then Chief Executive Officer of Anchor, and a
representative of Anchor’s counsel met with Mr. Mathewson to discuss the
proposed terms of the transaction. The results of that discussion were
reported to the board of directors of Anchor, and the board of directors
determined not to pursue a transaction with IGT at that time.

     In mid-August 2000, Anchor began discussions with Mr. Fulton about the
possibility of purchasing the Fulton family’s Anchor stock. Mr. Fulton and
members of his family owned at that time approximately 44% of the outstanding
shares of Anchor common stock. On August 29, 2000, Anchor retained Dresdner
Kleinwort Wasserstein (“DrKW”) to act as its financial advisor in connection
with the proposed transaction. On September 25, 2000, Anchor announced that it
had executed an agreement with Mr. Fulton and members of his family to acquire
9,192,400 shares of Anchor stock owned by the Fultons for a purchase price of
$33.30 per share. This transaction closed on October 17, 2000. In connection
with the transaction, Mr. Fulton retired from his position as Chairman of the
Board, and Mr. Fulton and his son and daughter resigned their positions on
Anchor’s board of directors. Also, in connection with the Fulton transaction,
Mr. Matthews was appointed Chairman of the Board.

     In early January 2001, G. Thomas Baker, IGT’s Chief Executive Officer,
contacted Mr. Matthews about the possibility of a business combination. On
January 12, 2001, IGT and Anchor signed mutual confidentiality agreements.
These discussions terminated when the parties could not reach an agreement on
the terms for a proposed transaction.

     On May 3, 2001, Mr. Baker again approached Mr. Matthews about the
possibility of a business combination involving a stock-for-stock merger. On
May 4, 2001, the board of directors of Anchor met and determined not to pursue
a transaction at that time, but encouraged Mr. Matthews to maintain the
dialogue with IGT.

     On June 21, 2001, Mr. Baker again approached Mr. Matthews about the
possibility of a business combination involving a stock-for-stock merger. On
the same date, IGT and Anchor signed mutual confidentiality agreements. Anchor
and IGT subsequently exchanged financial and legal due diligence materials.

     On June 28, 2001, Mr. Mathewson, Mr. Baker, Maureen Mullarkey, Senior Vice
President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer of IGT, and Eric Vetter,
Director of Finance for IGT, met with Mr. Matthews and Joseph Murphy, Anchor’s
Chief Operating Officer — Gaming Operations, and Geoff Sage, Anchor’s Chief
Financial Officer, to discuss the terms of a possible transaction. Mr.
Matthews told the representatives of IGT that price protection for Anchor
stockholders and representation on the IGT board of directors for Anchor would
be important factors in the negotiations. IGT proposed a stock-for-stock
merger with an exchange ratio of one share of IGT stock for each share of
Anchor stock. On that same date, June 28, IGT’s counsel and Anchor’s counsel
discussed the structure of the proposed transaction, and IGT proposed to send a
draft merger agreement to Anchor for its consideration. Also on that date, IGT
requested additional due diligence items from Anchor, and Anchor began to send
the requested items to IGT.

     On June 29, 2001, Anchor held a board meeting. Mr. Matthews presented to
the board the material terms of the IGT proposal. The board of directors of
Anchor authorized the executive officers of Anchor to pursue negotiation of a
transaction with IGT.

     On July 1, 2001, IGT sent Anchor a draft merger agreement for the proposed
transaction. The proposed agreement reflected a fixed exchange ratio. On
July 2, 2001, Anchor requested due diligence items from IGT, and IGT began to
send the requested items to Anchor. On July 3, 2001, Anchor held a board
meeting to discuss the draft of merger agreement. On July 3, 2001, Anchor’s
counsel sent written comments on the draft merger agreement to IGT’s counsel.

     On July 4, 2001, IGT sent Mr. Matthews and Mr. Murphy drafts of proposed
employment agreements. IGT advised Anchor that the execution of the employment
agreements by certain officers of Anchor would be a condition to the obligation
of IGT to close the transaction.

     On July 5, 2001, IGT sent Anchor a revised draft of the merger agreement.
On that date, the board of directors of Anchor met to discuss the status of the
merger negotiations, due diligence, and the fairness analysis being conducted
by DrKW, which continued to act as Anchor’s financial advisor in connection
with the proposed transaction. The parties had continued to discuss
alternatives to a fixed exchange ratio and the principal element discussed in
the board meeting was IGT’s proposal that the exchange ratio have a “collar,”
which would afford price protection to Anchor stockholders if there were a
decline in the price of IGT stock before the transaction closed but which
limited the amount of stock Anchor shareholders would receive if there were an
increase above a specified level in the price of IGT stock before the
transaction closed. Anchor’s counsel subsequently communicated with IGT’s
counsel, and they discussed the points of concern in the merger agreement.

     On July 6, 2001, Anchor held a board meeting. DrKW presented its
preliminary analysis on the fairness of a one-for-one exchange ratio from a
financial point of view. The board of directors of Anchor also heard a report
from Anchor’s counsel as to the status of negotiations on the merger agreement.

     On July 6, 2001, IGT held a board meeting. Representatives of IGT’s
counsel, Lionel Sawyer & Collins, IGT’s Nevada counsel, and Houlihan Lokey
Howard & Zukin Financial Advisors, Inc. (“Houlihan Lokey”) participated in the
meeting. At the meeting, IGT’s senior management outlined the terms and
structure of the proposed transaction, the accounting treatment of the proposed
transaction, the various business reasons for the proposed transaction and the
potential risks of such a transaction. IGT’s counsel summarized for IGT’s
board of directors its fiduciary duties in connection with considering the
proposed business combination and presented an overview of the proposed
transaction and the material terms of the proposed merger agreement. IGT’s
senior management and IGT’s counsel responded to questions regarding various
aspects of the proposed merger. At the meeting, Houlihan Lokey presented
written materials to IGT’s board of directors describing Houlihan Lokey’s
analysis of the fairness to IGT, from a financial point of view, of the
consideration to be received by IGT in the proposed transaction. At the
meeting, Houlihan Lokey rendered an oral opinion (which was subsequently
confirmed in writing) that the consideration to be received by IGT in the
proposed transaction was fair to IGT from a financial point of view. See
—“Opinion of Financial Advisor to International Game Technology’s Board” below.
IGT’s board of directors voted unanimously at the meeting to approve the
proposed merger, the completion of negotiations of the merger agreement and the
execution of the merger agreement by senior management.

     On July 7, 2001, Mr. Baker, Sara Beth Brown, IGT’s General Counsel, Ms.
Mullarkey and Ken Creighton of IGT, met with Mr. Matthews, Mr. Murphy, Mr.
Sage, and David Johnson, Anchor’s General Counsel, IGT’s counsel, Anchor’s
counsel and DrKW to further negotiate the merger agreement. The parties
discussed using a “collar” as part of the merger agreement with a $50.00 price
per share of IGT stock as a floor and $75.00 price per share of IGT stock as a
ceiling. This proposal became part of the final merger agreement. IGT’s
counsel and Anchor’s counsel negotiated other open points on the merger
agreement.

     On July 8, 2001, Anchor held a board meeting. Representatives of Anchor’s
counsel and DrKW participated in the meeting. At the meeting, Anchor’s senior
management outlined the terms and structure of the proposed transaction, the
accounting treatment of the proposed transaction, the various business reasons
for the proposed transaction and the potential risks of such a transaction.
Anchor’s counsel summarized for Anchor’s board of directors its fiduciary
duties in connection with considering the proposed transaction. Anchor’s
senior

management and Anchor’s counsel responded to questions regarding various
aspects of the proposed merger. DrKW presented written materials to Anchor’s
board of directors describing DrKW’s analysis of the fairness of the
transaction to Anchor and its stockholders from a financial point of view, and
updating its fairness analysis in light of the current proposal by IGT. DrKW
then presented its opinion, orally and in writing, as to the fairness of the
exchange ratio as set forth in the merger agreement from a financial point of
view. See “
—
Opinion of Financial Advisor to Anchor’s Board” below. Anchor’s
board of directors then voted unanimously to approve the proposed merger,
authorize the executive officers to enter into the merger agreement on the
terms presented to the board and authorize all related transactions. All
participants in this meeting then met with IGT and IGT’s counsel to negotiate
the final open points in the merger agreement. On the same date, IGT and
Anchor executed and delivered the merger agreement, and Mr. Matthews and Mr.
Murphy executed and delivered their voting agreements and employment
agreements.

IGT Board Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the IGT Board

     At an IGT board of directors meeting on July 6, 2001, the board determined
that the terms of the merger are fair to and in the best interests of IGT and
its stockholders and, by the unanimous vote of the directors, approved the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. In reaching its
decision, the board of directors consulted with IGT’s management, as well as
its financial and legal advisors, and considered a number of factors, including
the following:

•

Since 1996, IGT and Anchor have been partners in a
successful joint venture which has brought to the market numerous
successful casino games, including the spinning reel Wheel of

innovative products to the highly competitive casino game
business.

and Anchor and that there were no facts or information regarding IGT and Anchor
that would cause the information supplied to Houlihan Lokey to be incomplete or
misleading in any material respect. Houlihan Lokey did not independently verify
the accuracy or completeness of the information supplied to it with respect to
IGT and Anchor and does not assume responsibility for the accuracy or
completeness of such information.

     With respect to the financial projections and pro forma financial
statements and adjustments provided to Houlihan Lokey, all of which were
provided by the management of IGT and Anchor, Houlihan Lokey assumed that such
projections and pro forma financial statements and adjustments were reasonably
prepared on a basis consistent with actual historical experience, reflected the
best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management
of IGT and Anchor, and could reasonably be relied upon.

     Houlihan Lokey was not requested to consider, and Houlihan Lokey expressed
no opinion as to, (a) any other aspect of the merger, (b) the underlying
business decision of the IGT board of directors to proceed with the

 merger, or (c) the relative merits of the merger as compared to any
alternative business strategies that might exist for IGT or the effect of any
other transaction in which IGT might engage.

     Houlihan Lokey did not make an independent evaluation, appraisal or
valuation of any assets or liabilities of IGT or Anchor, nor was Houlihan Lokey
furnished with any such evaluations, appraisals or valuations. In its
analyses, Houlihan Lokey made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business and other conditions and matters, many of which
are beyond IGT’s and Anchor’s control and are not susceptible to accurate
prediction. While Houlihan Lokey believes that its review, as described herein,
is an adequate basis for the opinion it expressed, the opinion is necessarily
based upon market, economic and other conditions that exist and could be
evaluated as of the date of the opinion, and any change in such conditions
could require a re-evaluation of the opinion.

     The opinion addressed only the financial fairness, as of the date of the
opinion, of the consideration to be received by IGT in the merger and did not
address any other terms or conditions of the merger agreement or any related
documents, the tax or legal consequences of the merger, including the tax or
legal consequences to the stockholders of IGT, the fairness of any aspect of
the merger not expressly addressed in the opinion, the relative merits of the
merger or any alternatives to the merger, IGT’s decision to proceed with or the
effect of the merger, or any other aspect of the merger. No restrictions or
limitations were imposed by IGT upon Houlihan Lokey with respect to the
investigation made or the procedures followed in rendering its opinion.

     The board of directors retained Houlihan Lokey based upon Houlihan Lokey’s
experience in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection
with mergers, acquisitions, recapitalizations and similar transactions.
Houlihan Lokey is a nationally recognized investment banking firm that is
continually engaged in providing financial advisory services in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, business valuations for a variety
of regulatory and planning purposes, recapitalizations, financial
restructurings, and private placements of debt and equity securities.

     Houlihan Lokey has a prior relationship with IGT. During 2000 and 2001,
Houlihan Lokey provided solvency opinions to the board of directors of IGT in
connection with IGT’s repurchase of shares. Houlihan Lokey also has a prior
relationship with Anchor. In August of 2000, Houlihan Lokey was retained by
Anchor to render an opinion to a special committee of the board of directors of
Anchor regarding the fairness from a financial point of view to the public
stockholders of Anchor, other than the Fulton family, of the purchase of the
Fulton family’s interest in Anchor.

     IGT paid Houlihan Lokey a fee of $500,000 for rendering this opinion, no
portion of which was contingent upon the opinion being favorable or on the
closing of the merger. IGT also agreed to indemnify Houlihan Lokey and related
persons against certain liabilities, including liabilities under Federal
securities laws, arising out of the engagement of Houlihan Lokey, and to
reimburse Houlihan Lokey for certain expenses.

     The opinion did not constitute a recommendation to the board of directors
on whether or not to support the merger and recommend it to IGT’s stockholders
and does not constitute a recommendation to stockholders as to whether or not
to vote in favor of the merger.

     To determine the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger
to IGT, Houlihan Lokey performed several analyses, including the following:

•

determination of whether the value held by IGT’s
stockholders pre-merger exceeded their value post-merger;

•

determination of whether the consideration paid to
Anchor exceeded the fair market value of Anchor; and

•

analysis of the historical per share trading prices of
IGT relative to Anchor for the twelve months preceding the time
of the merger.

     The following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses
performed by Houlihan Lokey in connection with its oral opinion and the
preparation of its written opinion to the board of directors of IGT. These
summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular
format. To fully understand the financial analyses used by Houlihan Lokey, the
tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone
do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses.

Valuation of IGT Pre-Merger

The Public Market Approach. 
Because IGT is a publicly traded company,
Houlihan Lokey considered the per share value ascribed to IGT by the public
markets. Houlihan Lokey analyzed historical stock prices of IGT. For the
twenty trading days before July 4, 2001, the average closing price of IGT was
$63.25 per share. For the five trading days before July 4, 2001, the average
closing price for IGT was $62.46 per share. IGT’s closing stock price on July
3, 2001 was $64.11.

     Houlihan Lokey considered the range of these indications to be the most
relevant for purposes of its public market analysis. Based on this range of
per share value indications of IGT, Houlihan Lokey determined that the value of
IGT on a minority marketable basis was in the range of $4.760 billion to $4.890
billion.

The Market Multiple Approach
. The market multiple approach is a
widely-used valuation methodology in which the value of a company is determined
based upon the trading multiples of comparable publicly-traded companies. This
approach can involve the determination of a level of earnings, which are
considered to be representative of the future performance of the company, and
capitalizing these figures by a risk-adjusted multiple. Houlihan Lokey
reviewed certain financial information for a tier of public companies that it
deemed to be comparable to IGT. The tier of comparable companies included the
following publicly traded gaming companies: Acres Gaming, Inc., Alliance Gaming
Corp., Gtech Holdings, Corp., Mikohn Gaming Corp., Shuffle Master, Inc., and
WMS Industries, Inc. Houlihan Lokey also considered financial information for
Anchor and IGT.

     For each of the comparable companies, Houlihan Lokey calculated, reviewed
and analyzed numerous financial and operating performance ratios, as well as
numerous market capitalization ratios, such as the enterprise value as a
multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(“EBITDA”) and earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), and market value of
equity to earnings (“P/E”). Houlihan Lokey calculated and examined market
multiples based on the latest twelve month and projected next fiscal year
financial data for the comparable companies. The following table presents the
ranges and medians of these market multiples:

Low

     Houlihan Lokey selected ranges of EBITDA, EBIT and P/E multiples to apply
to the latest twelve months and projected next fiscal year financial data for
IGT from data supplied by IGT management. The selected ranges of latest twelve
months EBITDA, EBIT and P/E multiples were: (i) 13.5x to 14.5x; (ii) 14.0x to
16.0x; and (iii) 24.0x to 26.0x, respectively. The selected ranges of
projected next fiscal year EBITDA, EBIT and P/E multiples were: (i) 11.0x to
12.0x; (ii) 12.0 to 13.0x; and (iii) 20.0x to 22.0x, respectively. Applying
these valuation metrics, the market multiple approach guideline company
analysis resulted in an equity value range of IGT on a marketable minority
interest basis of approximately $4.830 billion to $5.320 billion, or $63.00 to
$70.00 per share.

     There are inherent differences between the businesses, operations, and
prospects of IGT and the comparable companies used in the market multiple
analysis. Accordingly, Houlihan Lokey believed that it was inappropriate to,
and therefore did not, rely solely on the above-described quantitative results
of the market multiple analysis, and accordingly also made qualitative
judgments concerning differences between the financial and operating
characteristics and prospects of IGT and the comparable companies that would,
in Houlihan Lokey’s opinion, affect the public market valuation of such
companies.

The Income Approach
. The income approach consisted of a discounted cash
flow analysis. The discounted cash flow analysis was based on five-year
projections provided by the management of IGT. In determining the value of IGT
from the discounted cash flow approach, Houlihan Lokey utilized a range of
multiples of terminal year EBITDA of 10.0x to 11.0x, and a range of discount
rates of 10.0 percent to 11.0 percent. This analysis resulted in a range of
values for the equity of IGT on a marketable minority interest basis of
approximately $4.850 billion to $5.540 billion, or approximately $63.60 to
$72.60 per share.

Valuation Summary. 
In arriving at a marketable minority equity value
range for IGT, Houlihan Lokey considered the valuation indications derived from
each of the approaches discussed above. Based upon these valuation
indications, Houlihan Lokey determined that a reasonable value range for IGT
was $4.810 billion to $5.250 billion, or approximately $63.10 to $68.80 per
share.

Fundamental Valuation of Anchor

The Public Market Approach
. Because Anchor is a publicly traded company,
Houlihan Lokey considered the valuation ascribed to Anchor by the public
markets. Houlihan Lokey analyzed historical stock prices of Anchor. For the
twenty trading days before July 4, 2001, the average closing price of Anchor
was $60.56 per share. For the five trading days before July 4, 2001, the
average closing price for Anchor was $58.79 per share. The Anchor closing
stock price on July 3, 2001 was $56.30.

     Houlihan Lokey considered the range of these indications to be the most
relevant for purposes of its public market analysis. A 10.0 percent control
premium was applied to these values to estimate the controlling interest value
of Anchor. The 10.0 percent control premium was selected based on a review and
analysis of premiums paid in transactions involving publicly traded companies,
including gaming companies, as well as the operational characteristics of
Anchor and the gaming industry in general. This approach resulted in an equity
value range of Anchor on a control basis in the range of $920.0 million to
$990.0 million.

The Market Multiple Approach
. As stated above, the market multiple
approach is a widely-used valuation methodology in which the value of a company
is determined based upon the trading multiples of comparable publicly-traded
companies. Houlihan Lokey reviewed certain financial information for a tier of
public companies that it deemed to be comparable to Anchor. The tier of
comparable companies was the same as indicated above under “Valuation of IGT
Pre-Merger.” Houlihan Lokey also considered financial information for Anchor
and IGT.

     For each of the comparable companies, Houlihan Lokey calculated, reviewed
and analyzed numerous financial and operating performance ratios, as well as
numerous market capitalization ratios, such as the enterprise value as a
multiple of EBITDA and EBIT, and P/E. Houlihan Lokey calculated and examined
market multiples based on the latest twelve month and projected next fiscal
year financial data for the comparable companies. The following table presents
the ranges and medians of the market multiples discussed above and is identical
to the table under “Valuation of IGT Pre-Merger” above:

     Houlihan Lokey selected ranges of EBITDA, EBIT and P/E multiples to apply
to the latest twelve months and projected next fiscal year financial data for
Anchor supplied by its management. The selected ranges of latest twelve months
EBITDA, EBIT and P/E multiples were: (i) 7.5x to 8.5x; (ii) 10.5x to 11.5x; and
(iii) 16.0x to 18.0x, respectively. The selected ranges of projected next
fiscal year EBITDA, EBIT and P/E multiples, respectively, were: (i) 6.0x to
7.0x; (ii) 8.0x to 9.0x; and (iii) 14.0x to 16.0x. Applying these valuation
metrics and a control premium of 10.0 percent, the market multiple approach
guideline company analysis resulted in an equity value range for Anchor on a
controlling interest basis of approximately $1.090 billion to $1.310 billion,
or $73.00 to $88.00 per share.

     There are inherent differences between the businesses, operations, and
prospects of Anchor and the comparable companies used in the market multiple
analysis. Accordingly, Houlihan Lokey believed that it was inappropriate to,
and therefore did not, rely solely on the above-described quantitative results
of the market multiple analysis and accordingly also made qualitative judgments
concerning differences between the financial and operating characteristics and
prospects of Anchor and the comparable companies that would, in Houlihan
Lokey’s opinion, affect the public market valuation of such companies.

The Transaction Approach
. The transaction approach is similar to the
market multiple approach in that the value of a company is based upon multiples
of other companies. A key difference between the transaction approach and the
market multiple approach is that the public company multiples used in the
transaction approach are based upon transaction values instead of
non-transaction trading prices.

     Houlihan Lokey analyzed certain financial performance measures for
numerous business combination transactions involving gaming companies.
Enterprise values for each of the representative transactions over $100.0
million was part of the screening criteria. No company or transaction used in
this analysis was directly comparable to Anchor or the proposed merger. The
transactions Houlihan Lokey considered representative were the following: (i)
Aristocrat Leisure’s acquisition of Casino Data Systems; (ii) Autotote’s
acquisition of Scientific Games; (iii) IGT’s acquisition of Sodak Gaming; and
(iv) Anchor’s acquisition of Powerhouse Technologies. For these transactions,
Houlihan Lokey observed enterprise value to latest twelve months EBITDA
multiples of 6.8x to 9.6x, with a mean and median of 8.3x and 8.4x,
respectively. Houlihan Lokey selected a range of EBITDA multiples of 8.0x to
9.0x to apply to latest twelve months financial data for Anchor. Application
of these metrics resulted in equity values for Anchor on a control basis of
$1.090 billion to $1.280 billion, or approximately $73.00 to $86.00 per share.

The Income Approach
. The income approach consisted of a discounted cash
flow analysis. The discounted cash flow was based on detailed four-year
projections provided by the management of Anchor. In determining the

value of
Anchor from the discounted cash flow approach, Houlihan Lokey utilized a
terminal EBITDA multiple range of 6.0x to 7.0x and a range of discount rates of
10.0 percent to 12.0 percent. Using this approach, the range of valuation
conclusions for Anchor on a controlling interest basis was $1.180 billion to
$1.490 billion, or approximately $79.00 to $100.00 per share.

Valuation Summary. 
In arriving at a control equity value range for
Anchor, Houlihan Lokey considered the indications derived from each of the
approaches discussed above. Based on these valuation indications, Houlihan
Lokey concluded on a value range for Anchor of $1.070 billion to $1.270
billion, or approximately $72.00 to $85.50 per share.

Pro Forma Valuation of IGT — Post-Merger

The Sum of the Parts Approach
. Houlihan Lokey considered the range of the
independent valuations of Anchor and IGT pre-transaction to determine a value
indication for the combined entity. The range of indications estimates a
minority interest value of the combined entity. Houlihan Lokey noted that this
approach resulted in implied equity values for the combined entity of
approximately $5.880 billion to $6.520 billion, or approximately $64.00 to
$71.00 per share.

The Market Multiple Approach
. The market multiple approach is a
widely-used valuation methodology in which the value of a company is determined
based upon the trading multiples of comparable publicly-traded companies. This
approach can involve the determination of a level of earnings, which are
considered to be representative of the future performance of the company, and
capitalizing these figures by a risk-adjusted multiple.

     Houlihan Lokey reviewed certain financial information for a tier of public
companies that it deemed to be comparable to IGT post-merger. The tier of
comparable companies included the same six companies mentioned above. Houlihan
Lokey also considered financial information for Anchor and IGT.

     For each of the comparable companies, Houlihan Lokey calculated, reviewed
and analyzed numerous financial and operating performance ratios, as well as
numerous market capitalization ratios, such as the enterprise value as a
multiple of EBITDA and EBIT, and P/E. Houlihan Lokey calculated and examined
market multiples based on projected next fiscal year financial data for the
comparable companies. The following table presents the ranges and medians of
the market multiples discussed above and is identical to the lower portion of
the tables presented earlier:

     Houlihan Lokey selected ranges of EBITDA, EBIT and P/E multiples to apply
to pro forma projected fiscal 2002 financial data for IGT post-merger supplied
by its management. The selected ranges of next fiscal year EBITDA, EBIT and
P/E multiples were: (i) 11.0x to 12.0x; (ii) 13.0x to 14.0x; and (iii) 20.0x to
22.0x, respectively. The market multiple approach guideline company analysis
resulted in an equity value range for IGT post-merger on a marketable minority
interest basis of approximately $6.430 billion to $7.260 billion, or
approximately $70.00 to $79.00 per share.

     There are inherent differences between the businesses, operations, and
prospects of the combined entity and the comparable companies used in the
market multiple
analysis. Accordingly, Houlihan Lokey believed that it was
inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the above-described
quantitative results of the market multiple

analysis and accordingly also made
qualitative judgments concerning differences between the financial and
operating characteristics and prospects of the combined entity and the
comparable companies that would, in Houlihan Lokey’s opinion, affect the public
market valuation of such companies.

The Income Approach
. The income approach consisted of a capitalization of
pro forma projected 2002 cash flow for IGT. In determining the value of the
combined entity from the income approach, Houlihan Lokey utilized a perpetual
growth rate in the range of 5.0 percent to 6.0 percent, and a range of discount
rates of 9.5 percent to 11.5 percent. This resulted in a range of values for
IGT post-merger on a marketable minority interest basis of approximately $5.080
billion to $6.470 billion, or approximately $55.00 to $70.00 per share.

Valuation Summary. 
In arriving at a pro forma marketable minority
interest equity value range for IGT post-merger, we considered the indications
derived from each of the approaches discussed above. Based on these
approaches, Houlihan Lokey concluded on a value range for IGT post-merger of
$5.800 billion to $6.750 billion, or approximately $63.00 to $73.30 per share.

Relative Historical Trading Prices

     Houlihan Lokey reviewed the implied relative historical trading prices for
the shares of common stock of each of IGT and Anchor determined by dividing the
price per share of IGT common stock by the price per share of Anchor common
stock over the twelve-month, six-month, and three-month periods before July 4,
2001. Over these twelve-month, six-month, and three-month periods, IGT’s stock
price ranged from 79% to 152%, 79% to 128%, and 90% to 114% of Anchor’s public
stock price, respectively.

Conclusion

     Houlihan Lokey concluded that IGT’s pre-merger share value was in the
range of $63.10 to $68.80 per share on a marketable minority interest basis.
Houlihan Lokey concluded that the value of IGT post-merger was in the range of
$63.00 to $73.30 per share. Accordingly, the post-merger value of IGT
was equal
to or greater than the pre-merger value of IGT.

     Houlihan Lokey concluded that the value of Anchor on a control basis was
in the range of $1.070 billion to $1.270 billion. Based on
its pro forma valuation analysis of IGT post merger, Houlihan Lokey
concluded that the consideration to be paid
by IGT in the merger was worth in the range of $994.0 million to $1.157 billion.
Accordingly, the value of the consideration to be paid to Anchor was no more
than the fair market value of the shares of Anchor being acquired by IGT.

     Based on the foregoing, Houlihan Lokey’s analyses indicated that the
consideration to be received by IGT in the merger was fair to IGT, from a
financial point of view.

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytical process
involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analysis and application of those methods to the
particular circumstances and is therefore not readily susceptible to summary
description. In arriving at its opinion, Houlihan Lokey did not attribute any
particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made
the qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis
and factor. Accordingly, Houlihan Lokey believes that its analyses and the
summary set forth herein must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions of its analyses, without considering all analyses, or portions of this
summary, without considering all factors and analyses, could create an
incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses undertaken by it in
connection with its opinion.

     The estimates contained in Houlihan Lokey’s analyses are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which
may be more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. The analyses do
not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which IGT common stock
actually will trade when issued pursuant to the merger or the prices at which
IGT common stock will trade after the merger.

Opinion of Financial Advisor to Anchor’s Board

DrKW’s Role
. DrKW has acted as financial advisor to Anchor in connection
with the merger and assisted the Anchor board of directors in its examination
of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Exchange Ratio of one
share of IGT common stock to be issued in the merger for each share of Anchor
common stock. On July 8, 2001, DrKW delivered its opinion to the effect that,
subject to the various assumptions and limitations stated in the opinion, as of
the date of the opinion, the Exchange Ratio provided for pursuant to the merger
agreement is fair to the stockholders of Anchor from a financial point of view.

     The terms of the merger were determined through negotiations between
Anchor and IGT and were approved by the Anchor board of directors. Although
DrKW provided advice to Anchor during the course of these negotiations, the
decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the Anchor board
of directors. DrKW’s opinion and its presentation to the Anchor board of
directors was only one of a number of factors taken into consideration by the
Anchor board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger.
DrKW’s opinion was provided to the Anchor board of directors to assist it in
connection with its consideration of the merger and does not constitute a
recommendation to any holder of Anchor common stock as to how to vote with
respect to the merger.

     We have attached as Annex C the full text of the written opinion of DrKW
dated July 8, 2001, which sets forth, among other things, the opinion
expressed, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
limits of the review undertaken by DrKW. We and DrKW urge you to read DrKW’s
opinion carefully in its entirety. DrKW’s opinion is directed to the Anchor
board of directors and addresses only the fairness of the Exchange Ratio to
Anchor’s stockholders from a financial point of view. It does not address any
other aspect of the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any
Anchor stockholder as to how to vote or otherwise act in respect of the merger
agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and should
not be relied upon by any holder. DrKW’s opinion was rendered to the Anchor
board of directors for its consideration in determining whether to approve the
merger agreement. The discussion of DrKW’s opinion in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by the full text of DrKW’s
opinion.

Matters Reviewed
. In connection with rendering its opinion, DrKW reviewed
a draft of the merger agreement and assumed that the final form of the merger
agreement would not differ in any material respect from that draft. DrKW also:

•

reviewed and analyzed certain publicly available
business and financial information relating to Anchor and IGT for
recent years and interim periods;

•

reviewed and analyzed certain internal financial and
operating information, including financial forecasts, analyses
and projections prepared by or on behalf of Anchor and IGT and
provided to it for purposes of its analysis; and

•

met with management of Anchor and IGT to review and
discuss the information described above and, among other matters,
Anchor’s and IGT’s business, operations, assets, financial
condition, and future prospects.

     DrKW also reviewed and considered:

•

certain financial and stock market data relating to
Anchor and IGT, and compared that data with similar data for
certain other publicly traded companies that it believed may have
been relevant or comparable in certain respects to Anchor or one
or more of its businesses or assets; and

•

the financial terms, to the extent publicly available,
of certain recent acquisitions and business combination
transactions in the gaming equipment industry and in other
industries that it believed to be reasonably comparable to the
merger or otherwise relevant to its inquiry.

     DrKW also performed such other financial studies, analyses, and
investigations and reviewed such other information as it considered appropriate
for purposes of its opinion.

Assumptions and Limitations
. In its review and analysis and in
formulating its opinion, DrKW:

•

assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness
of all of the financial and other information provided to or
discussed with it or that was publicly available and did not
assume any responsibility for independent verification of any of
that information;

•

assumed and relied upon the reasonableness and accuracy
of the financial projections, forecasts and analyses provided to
it, and assumed that such projections, forecasts and analyses
were reasonably prepared in good faith and on bases reflecting
the best currently available judgments and estimates of Anchor’s
and IGT’s respective management teams;

•

expressed no opinion with respect to the projections,
forecasts and analyses or the assumptions upon which they are
based;

•

did not review any of the books and records of Anchor
or IGT, or assume any responsibility for conducting a physical
inspection of the properties or facilities of Anchor or IGT, or
for making or obtaining an independent valuation or appraisal of
the assets or liabilities of either company;

•

placed significant reliance on the fact that Anchor
derives a substantial portion of its cash flow from its joint
venture with IGT;

•

noted that the merger is intended to qualify as a
tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax
purposes, and assumed that the merger will so qualify; and

•

assumed that the transactions described in the merger
agreement would be consummated without waiver or modification of
any material terms or conditions.

     DrKW’s opinion is based on economic and market conditions and other
circumstances as they existed and could be evaluated by it as of the date of
the opinion. In addition, DrKW did not express any opinion as to the price or
trading range at which IGT common stock or Anchor common stock will trade at
any time.

     The DrKW opinion did not address Anchor’s underlying business decision to
effect the merger. In addition, DrKW was not authorized to and did not solicit
any third party indications of interest in acquiring all or any part of Anchor
nor investigate any alternative transactions that may be available to Anchor.
Except as expressly set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, no
special instructions were given to DrKW relating to its review and no
limitations were imposed with respect to investigations made or procedures
followed by DrKW in rendering the DrKW opinion.

     In preparing its opinion for the Anchor board of directors, DrKW performed
a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including those summarized
below. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytic process
involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analyses and the application of those methods to the
particular circumstances. Therefore, such an opinion is not easily summarized.

     In rendering its opinion, DrKW considered, among other factors, the
condition of the U.S. equity and debt markets and the current level of economic
activity, particularly in the gaming industry. No company used in the analysis
of certain other publicly traded companies nor any transaction used in the
analysis of selected mergers and acquisitions summarized below is identical to
Anchor or the merger. In addition, DrKW believes that both the analysis of
certain other publicly traded companies and the analysis of selected mergers
and acquisitions are not simply mathematical. Rather, such analyses must take
into account differences in the financial and operating characteristics of
these companies and other factors, such as general economic and market
conditions in the

locations in which such companies compete and strategic and
operating plans for such companies, that could affect the public trading value
and acquisition value of these companies.

     In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do
not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses,
companies or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, such analyses and
estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

     In arriving at its opinion, DrKW did not attribute any relative weight to
the analysis or factors considered but rather made qualitative judgments as to
the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, DrKW
believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that consideration
of any portion of these analyses and of the factors considered, without
considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete
view of the process underlying the opinion.

Valuation Analyses
. The following is a brief summary of certain of the
quantitative analyses performed and factors considered by DrKW in connection
with rendering its opinion and reviewed with the Anchor board of directors at
its July 6, 2001 and July 8, 2001 meetings. While the foregoing summary
described the analyses and factors that DrKW deemed material in its
presentation to the Anchor board of directors, it is not a comprehensive
description of all analyses and factors considered by DrKW.

     In performing its analysis, DrKW used and reviewed with Anchor’s board of
directors three principal valuation methodologies: (1) comparable publicly
traded companies analysis, (2) comparable transaction analysis, and (3)
discounted cash flow analysis.

Comparable Publicly Traded Companies Analysis.

     DrKW compared certain financial information and the results of commonly
used valuation measurements for Anchor to corresponding information for a group
of seven publicly traded gaming equipment companies. These gaming equipment
companies were selected based upon the similarity of their businesses to those
of Anchor and include:

•

Alliance Gaming Corporation

•

Casino Data Systems

•

GTECH Holding Corporation

•

International Game Technology

•

Scientific Games

•

Shuffle Master, Inc.

•

WMS Industries, Inc.

     The gaming equipment companies were analyzed based upon financial
information, including a ratio of their Firm Value utilizing a twenty-day
average trading price ending July 6, 2001 to their EBITDA in order to imply a
range of multiples that were compared to the Merger Multiples. “Merger
Multiples” are defined as the Firm Value to EBITDA multiples implied for Anchor
assuming a Firm Value based on the Exchange Ratio and utilizing IGT’s 20 day
average trading price of $62.79 for the twenty-day period ending July 6, 2001.
“Firm Value” is defined as the market value of the applicable company’s common
equity as adjusted to include debt less cash.

     The financial information used in connection with the multiples provided
below was based on projected EBITDA and other estimated financial projections
derived from publicly available equity research analysis.

Includes control premium of 25%-30% on EBITDA not generated by the joint
venture between Anchor and IGT in which IGT has a 50% interest.

     Based on the foregoing comparison, DrKW noted that the Merger Multiples
and merger consideration implied in the merger were within the ranges of
trading multiples and equity values implied by the gaming equipment companies.
DrKW also noted that the Merger Multiples and merger consideration implied in
the Merger for fiscal 2002 were within the ranges of trading multiples and
equity values implied by the gaming equipment companies after including a
25%-30% control premium on the businesses in which IGT did not already have an
interest. DrKW noted that these facts supported a determination that the
Exchange Ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Anchor
stockholders.

Comparable Transaction Analysis.

     DrKW reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of
the following announced and/or completed mergers and acquisitions since 1995 in
the gaming equipment industry, which it deemed comparable to the merger based
upon the similarity of the transactions:

Announcement Date

Anchor Gaming

Alliance Gaming Corporation

Casino Data Systems

Scientific Games

Sodak Gaming Inc.

Powerhouse Technologies Inc.

Bally Gaming Inc.

     For each transaction DrKW calculated and analyzed various financial
multiples based on certain publicly available information, including Firm Value
as a multiple of EBITDA for the most recent twelve months available before the
announcement of the Merger and as a multiple of projected EBITDA for the next
fiscal year, and compared them to the Merger Multiples. DrKW noted that all
multiples for those transactions were based on information available at the
time of announcement of each of such transactions, without taking into account
differing market and other conditions during the period during which each of
such transaction occurred.

     DrKW noted that based on the foregoing comparisons, the Merger Multiples
and merger consideration were within the ranges of multiples and equity values
implied by the transactions listed above and that this fact
supported a
determination that the Exchange Ratio was fair, from a financial point of view,
to the Anchor stockholders.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
.

     DrKW performed discounted cash flow analyses for Anchor using, in part,
financial projections provided by the management of Anchor. In performing its
discounted cash flow analysis, DrKW made various assumptions and applied
valuation parameters that it deemed appropriate.

     Utilizing the projections provided by Anchor’s management, DrKW calculated
the theoretical discounted present value per share for Anchor common stock by
adding together (a) the projected future stream of unlevered free cash flow
through the fiscal year ending June 30, 2005 and (b) the projected continuing
value of Anchor, as a stand-alone entity, at the end of the fiscal year ending
June 30, 2005 defined as the terminal value. The terminal value was calculated
based on EBITDA multiples of 5.0x, 6.0x and 7.0x. The cash flow streams and
the terminal values were then discounted to present values using a range of
discount rates from 9.0% to 12.0% which were derived based on the weighted
average cost of capital of selected publicly traded gaming equipment companies
and arrived at terminal values based on its review of the trading
characteristics of the common stock of selected publicly traded gaming
equipment companies.

     The analysis described above generated the following theoretical equity
values per share for Anchor:

     In addition, DrKW analyzed a variation to the financial projections, which
was more conservative in 2003 through 2005. DrKW performed a similar discounted
cash flow analysis on this variation, which generated a range of
theoretical equity values per share for Anchor between $45.22 and $73.39.

     DrKW noted that the merger consideration was within the foregoing
valuation ranges and this fact supported a determination that the Exchange
Ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Anchor stockholders.

General Information
. DrKW is an internationally recognized investment
banking and advisory firm. DrKW, as part of its investment banking business,
is continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive
biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary
course of its business, it may actively trade the debt and equity securities of
Anchor and IGT for its own account and for the accounts of customers and,
accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in these securities.
DrKW has provided other financial advisory services to Anchor and IGT in the
past.

     DrKW has been engaged by Anchor to act as its financial advisor. Anchor
will pay or has paid DrKW for its services, (1) $500,000 upon execution of the
amended engagement letter, dated June 26, 2001, (2) $250,000 on
the date DrKW advised the Anchor board of directors that it was
prepared to render its fairness opinion, whether or not favorable, and (3) $5.5 million at the
effective time of the merger. Anchor has also agreed to reimburse DrKW for its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses related to its engagement, including the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, and to indemnify DrKW against various
liabilities and expenses in connection with its services, including various
liabilities under federal securities laws.

Interests of Key Persons in the Merger

     In considering the recommendations of the Anchor board of directors
regarding the merger, you should be aware that the directors and executive
officers of Anchor have interests in the merger in addition to their interests
as stockholders of Anchor, as described below. In addition, Anchor will pay
DrKW a fee and reimbursement of certain expenses incurred upon consummation of
the merger.

Employment Agreements with Thomas J. Matthews and Joseph Murphy

     Mr. Matthews and Mr. Murphy have entered into employment agreements with
IGT and Anchor, respectively, that will become effective upon consummation of
the merger and continue through October 16, 2004. These employment agreements
will supersede any previous employment agreements that either Mr. Matthews or
Mr. Murphy currently has with Anchor.

     Pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement, Mr. Matthews, who is
currently Anchor’s Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and
President, will become President and Chief Executive Officer of the surviving
corporation of the merger and Chief Operating Officer of IGT. Mr. Matthews’
base salary will remain at $450,000 per year, and he will be eligible to
participate in IGT’s management bonus program, with a bonus calculation that
will not exceed 200% of his then current base salary. Concurrently with the
effective date of the employment agreement, IGT will grant Mr. Matthews an
option to purchase 500,000 shares of IGT common stock at an exercise price
equal to the closing trading price of IGT common stock on the effective date.
The option grant will be governed by the provisions of IGT’s 1993 Stock Option
Plan, as amended. One-fifth (1/5) of the option will vest on each of the first
five anniversaries of the effective date.

     Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Murphy, who is currently
Anchor’s Vice President and Chief Operating Officer — Gaming Operations, will
continue as Chief Operating Officer — Gaming Operations of the surviving
corporation of the merger. Mr. Murphy’s base salary will remain at $360,000
per year, and he will be eligible to be paid an annual bonus in an amount to be
determined by, and subject to the sole discretion of, the chief executive
officer of IGT, up to a maximum of 125% of his then current base salary.
Concurrently with the effective date of the employment agreement, IGT will
grant Mr. Murphy an option to purchase 100,000 shares of IGT common stock at an
exercise price equal to the closing trading price of IGT common stock on the
effective date. The option grant will be governed by the provisions of IGT’s
1993 Stock Option Plan, as amended. One-fifth (1/5) of the option will vest on
each of the first five anniversaries of the effective date.

Treatment of Options and Restricted Stock

     Upon completion of the merger, all options to purchase shares of Anchor
common stock will be converted into options to purchase shares of IGT common
stock at the Exchange Ratio and price as described in “Terms of the Merger
Agreement and Related Agreements — Treatment of Stock Options and Restricted
Stock.” Under the terms of existing stock option agreements between Anchor and
its directors, executive officers and a number of other employees, if a change
of control were to occur in the fourth quarter of 2001, options to purchase an
aggregate of 859,900 shares of Anchor common stock would become immediately
exercisable. Anchor’s directors and executive officers hold 656,000 of these
options. The following table reflects (1) the total number of Anchor stock
options held by Anchor’s directors and executive officers, (2) the Anchor stock
options held by these directors and executive officers that will vest as a
result of the merger and (3) the Anchor stock options held by these directors
and executive officers that will be vested after giving effect to the merger.

The difference between the numbers presented in these two columns for any
individual represents the number of options held by the person that
will remain unvested upon completion of the merger.

     Anchor Gaming has granted 230,000 shares of restricted stock to certain
executive officers and other employees. Thomas J. Matthews, Joseph Murphy,
Geoffrey Sage, and David Johnson hold an aggregate of 220,000 of those shares.
All of the shares of restricted stock held by Messrs. Matthews, Murphy, Sage
and Johnson will be vested at the time of the merger, and 143,000 of these
shares will vest as a result of the merger. Upon completion of the merger,
these shares will be canceled and converted into the right to receive shares of
IGT common stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares. The following
table reflects the ownership of the restricted shares of Anchor common stock by
executive officers of Anchor.

     Should the value attributable to accelerating an Anchor employee’s options
and restricted stock, when combined with any other payments to the employee
that are contingent on a change in control, equal or exceed three
times the employee’s average compensation for the last five years (or for the
employee’s duration of employment with Anchor, if less than five years), then
the employee will become subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of
the Code. Pursuant to agreements with some of its employees, Anchor would be
obligated to reimburse the employees for any such excise tax, as well as the
taxes attributable to such reimbursement.

Indemnification

     The successor company’s articles of incorporation and bylaws will contain
provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation from liability no
less favorable than the provisions of Anchor’s articles of

incorporation or
bylaws as of the date of the merger agreement, which provisions will not be
modified, amended, repealed or otherwise modified in manner which would
adversely affect the current or former directors or officers of Anchor or its
subsidiaries for a period of not less than six years. IGT also guarantees the
successor company’s obligations to indemnify and provide insurance for
individuals identified in the merger agreement to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law for a period of not less than six years after the completion
of the merger.

     IGT will also provide, for a period of not less than six years after the
completion of the merger, Anchor’s current directors and officers an insurance
and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or
before the completion of the merger that is no less favorable than Anchor’s
existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policy provided that, (1) in lieu
of the purchase of such insurance by the surviving corporation or IGT, Anchor,
with IGT’s written consent, may purchase a five-year extended reporting period
endorsement under its existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
coverage and (2) if the cost of such insurance in any year during such six-year
period will exceed 150% of the premium cost for such policy during the year
ended June 30, 2000, then the surviving corporation will instead provide
coverage affording the same protection as that maintained by IGT as of such
date for its officers and directors. The Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”) advises that indemnification for securities law violations is
against public policy and may be unenforceable.

Fees Payable to Financial Advisors

     Pursuant to a letter agreement, IGT paid Houlihan Lokey a fee of $500,000
for rendering its fairness opinion, no portion of which was contingent upon the
opinion being favorable or on the closing of the merger. IGT also agreed to
indemnify Houlihan Lokey and related persons against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under federal securities laws, arising out of the
engagement of Houlihan Lokey, and to reimburse Houlihan Lokey for certain
expenses.

     Under DrKW’s engagement letter with Anchor, dated August 29, 2000 and
amended on June 29, 2001 and July 8, 2001, DrKW is entitled to receive a
transaction fee of up to $6.25 million, which has been paid, in part, and is
payable, in part, as follows: a first payment of $500,000 upon execution of an
amendment to the engagement letter on June 29, 2001, a second payment of
$250,000 on the date DrKW advised Anchor that it was prepared to render its
opinion, whether or not favorable, as to the fairness of the proposed merger to Anchor’s stockholders, and
a final payment of $5.5 million, contingent upon the consummation of the
proposed merger between Anchor and IGT, on the closing date of the proposed
merger. Anchor also agreed to indemnify DrKW and related persons against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under federal securities laws,
arising out of the engagement of DrKW, and to reimburse DrKW for certain
expenses. See “The Merger — Opinions of Financial Advisors.”

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences

     This tax discussion presents the material United States federal income tax
consequences of the merger, which merger in the opinion of O’Melveny & Myers
LLP, tax counsel to IGT, and in the opinion of Hughes & Luce, LLP, tax counsel
to Anchor, will be treated as a tax-free “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. These opinions will be provided to IGT and Anchor,
respectively, at closing and forms of these opinions have been filed with the
SEC as exhibits to the registration statement related to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. In rendering their opinions, tax counsel to each of IGT
and Anchor will rely upon the representations made by IGT and Anchor. Neither
the tax opinions nor this discussion will bind the Internal Revenue Service,
and the Internal Revenue Service is not precluded from asserting a contrary
position. The parties have not requested and will not request a ruling from
the Internal Revenue Service as to the tax consequences of the merger.

     The discussion addresses only stockholders who hold their shares as
capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. It is based
upon current provisions of the Code, existing regulations promulgated under the
Code and current rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to
change, possibly with retroactive effect. Tax consequences under state, local
and foreign laws are not addressed. The discussion does not address all
aspects of federal income taxation that may be important to stockholders who
are subject to special rules, such as:

•

financial institutions,

•

tax-exempt organizations,

•

insurance companies,

•

dealers in securities or foreign currencies,

•

traders in securities who elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting,

•

foreign holders,

•

persons who hold shares as a hedge against currency
risk or as part of a straddle, constructive sale or conversion
transaction, or

•

holders who acquired their shares upon the exercise of
warrants or other stock rights, or upon the exercise of employee
stock options or otherwise as compensation.

     As a result of the qualification of the merger as a “reorganization”
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, the tax implications will be
as follows:

U.S. Federal Income Tax Implications to Anchor Stockholders

     No gain or loss will be recognized for United States federal income tax
purposes by holders of Anchor common stock who exchange their Anchor common
stock for IGT common stock pursuant to the merger, except with respect to cash
received in lieu of fractional shares. The aggregate tax basis of the IGT
common stock to be received by an Anchor stockholder in the merger will be the
same as such stockholder’s aggregate tax basis in the Anchor common stock
surrendered in the exchange (reduced by any amount allocable to a fractional
share of Anchor common stock exercised for cash, as discussed below).

     The holding period of the IGT common stock to be received by an Anchor
stockholder as a result of the merger will include the period during which such
stockholder held the Anchor common stock exchanged. Cash received by a holder
of Anchor common stock instead of a fractional share of IGT common stock will
be treated as received in exchange for such fractional share interest, and gain
or loss will be recognized for federal income tax purposes, measured by the
difference between the amount of cash received and the portion of the basis of
the Anchor common stock allocable to the fractional share interest. Such gain
or loss will be capital gain or loss provided that the shares of Anchor common
stock were held as capital assets and will be long term capital gain or loss if
the Anchor common stock had been held for more than one year at the time of the
merger.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Implications of the Merger to IGT, Anchor and NAC
Corporation

     No gain or loss will be recognized for United States federal income tax
purposes by IGT, Anchor or NAC Corporation as a result of the merger.

Backup Withholding

     Under the Code, a holder of Anchor common stock may be subject to backup
withholding with respect to the amount of cash, if any, received unless the
holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or a correct taxpayer
identification number, and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of
the backup withholding rules. Under recent changes to federal income tax law,
the backup withholding rate is 30.5% for payments received after August 6,
2001. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not an
additional tax and may be refunded or credited against the holder’s federal
income tax liability, provided the required information is furnished to the
Internal Revenue Service.

The United States federal income tax discussion set forth above does not
address tax consequences which may vary with, or are contingent upon,
individual circumstances. Moreover, this discussion does not address any tax
consequences of the disposition of Anchor common stock before the merger or the
disposition of IGT common

stock after the merger. This discussion is directed
to investors who are United States citizens or residents or domestic
corporations. No attempt has been made to determine any tax that may be
imposed on a stockholder by the country, state or jurisdiction in which the
holder resides or is a citizen other than the material United States federal
income tax consequences discussed herein. Holders of Anchor common stock are
advised to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the federal income tax
consequences in light of their personal circumstances and the consequences
under applicable state, local and foreign tax laws.

Regulatory Approvals

Antitrust

     Transactions such as the merger are subject to review by the United States
Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the United States Federal Trade
Commission (the “FTC”) to determine whether they comply with applicable
antitrust laws. Under the provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act (the “HSR Act”) applicable to the merger, the merger may not
be completed until a waiting period following completion of the required
filings by IGT and Anchor has expired or been terminated. The merger agreement
provides that all waiting periods under the HSR Act must have expired or been
terminated in order to complete the merger.

     The HSR Act waiting period will expire thirty days after the required
filings by IGT and Anchor unless the DOJ or FTC issues a formal request for
additional information. If a request for additional information is issued to
IGT or Anchor, the HSR waiting period will expire thirty calendar days after
both IGT and Anchor substantially comply with the request, unless IGT and
Anchor agree to extend the period further.

     At any time before or after the merger, the DOJ or the FTC could take
action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the merger or
seeking divestiture of substantial assets of IGT or Anchor or their
subsidiaries. Private parties and state attorneys general may also bring an
action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.

     There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger will not be made
or that, if made, IGT and Anchor would prevail or would not be required to
accept certain conditions, including divestitures, in order to complete the
merger.

     IGT will not be obligated to take any action that (1) would require IGT to
surrender or terminate a gaming approval held by it or its subsidiaries, (2)
that is reasonably likely to be materially burdensome to IGT and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole or (3) that is reasonably likely to impact (A) in
a materially adverse manner the operations of IGT or (B) the economic or
business benefits of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement so
as to render completion of the merger inadvisable to IGT, in its good faith
judgment.

Gaming Regulation

     IGT and Anchor are subject to extensive gaming regulations. IGT, Anchor
and their subsidiaries hold registrations, approvals, gaming licenses or
permits (where required) in each jurisdiction in which they operate gaming
activities. In each of these jurisdictions, regulatory requirements must be
complied with in order for us to complete the merger. Generally, regulatory
authorities have broad discretion in granting, renewing and revoking gaming
licenses and granting approvals.

     The following is an abbreviated description of the gaming regulatory
requirements applicable to the merger. In addition, IGT and Anchor must comply
with regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction in which they conduct gaming
activities. For a more detailed description of these requirements, please see
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for IGT for the year ended September 30, 2000
and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for Anchor for the year ended June 30, 2000.

Nevada Gaming Regulations
. The manufacturing and distribution of gaming
devices and the ownership and operation of gaming machine routes in Nevada are
subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations of the Nevada
Gaming Commission and the Nevada State Gaming Control Board (collectively, the
“Nevada Act”) and various local ordinances and regulations.

     IGT’s and Anchor’s respective operations are subject to the licensing and
regulatory control of the Nevada Gaming Commission, the Nevada State Gaming
Control Board, and the various county and city licensing agencies
(collectively, the “Nevada Gaming Authorities”). Regulations of the Nevada
Gaming Commission provide that control of a registered publicly traded
corporation such as Anchor cannot be acquired through a tender offer, merger,
consolidation, acquisition of assets, management or consulting agreements or
any form of takeover whatsoever without the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming
Commission. IGT has filed applications seeking the necessary approvals with
the Nevada State Gaming Control Board and the Nevada Gaming Commission on
behalf of IGT. Anchor also has filed an application in connection with the
merger. The Nevada State Gaming Control Board reviews and investigates
applications for approval and makes recommendations on those applications to
the Nevada Gaming Commission for final action. IGT is currently registered by
the Nevada Gaming Commission as a publicly traded corporation and has been
found suitable to own the shares of its subsidiaries that have been licensed in
Nevada. Accordingly, IGT does not expect significant delays in obtaining
necessary approvals. However, there can be no assurance that these approvals
will be granted or will be granted on a timely basis or without burdensome
conditions. Furthermore, any such approval, if granted, does not constitute a
finding, recommendation or approval by the Nevada State Gaming Control Board or
the Nevada Gaming Commission as to the merits of the merger. Any representation
to the contrary is unlawful.

     In seeking approval to acquire control of Anchor, IGT must satisfy the
Nevada Gaming Commission as to a variety of stringent standards. The Nevada
State Gaming Control Board and the Nevada Gaming Commission will consider all
relevant material facts in determining whether to grant this approval, and may
consider not only the effects of the merger but also any other facts that are
deemed relevant. Such facts may include, among others,

•

the business history of the applicant, including its
record of financial stability, integrity and success of its
operations, as well as its current business activities;

•

the adequacy of the proposed financing; and

•

whether the merger will create a significant risk that
IGT, Anchor or their subsidiaries will not satisfy their
financial obligations as they become due or satisfy all financial
and regulatory requirements imposed by the Nevada Act.

     The Nevada Gaming Commission and Nevada Gaming Control Board will also
consider whether the acquisition of control of Anchor and its registered and
licensed subsidiaries is in the best interests of the State of Nevada under the
multiple licensing criteria in the Nevada Act. Among other factors set forth
in such multiple licensing criteria, they may consider whether there has been
an adequate period of performance by IGT, whether IGT has sufficient key
personnel so that there will not be a dilution of effective managerial capacity
and control of existing operations, whether the acquisition would pose problems
or create a monopoly, and what the result of the acquisition of control will be
in respect of the percentage of interest of IGT and Anchor to similarly
situated competitors on a statewide, countrywide and geographical basis in the
following categories: total number of slot machines operated, gross revenue,
percentage tax, number of employees hired and total payroll.

     Following receipt of the necessary approvals of the Nevada Gaming
Commission and completion of the merger, Anchor will be registered by the
Nevada Gaming Commission as a publicly-traded intermediary company of IGT. In
addition, certain officers, directors and key employees of Anchor at the time
of completion of the merger who will be actively and directly involved in
Anchor’s gaming activities may also be required to be found suitable or
licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. The Nevada Gaming Authorities may
deny an application for licensing, a finding of suitability or registration for
any cause that they deem reasonable. A finding of suitability is comparable to
licensing, and both require the submission of detailed personal and financial
information followed by a thorough investigation. All individuals required to
file applications for findings of suitability as officers and directors of
Anchor at the time of completion of the merger have filed applications with the
Nevada State Gaming Control Board and the Nevada Gaming Commission. There can
be no assurances that these approvals will be granted or will be granted within
a timely manner.

National Indian Gaming Commission Regulations. 
The National Indian Gaming
Commission requires a finding of suitability of a person who obtains a direct
or indirect interest in Anchor’s management agreement with the Pala Band of
Mission Indians.

Other Jurisdictions

     Additional jurisdictions will require prior approval of the merger by
their appropriate regulatory authorities, and may require the licensing or
finding of suitability of certain officers and directors of IGT in connection
therewith. These additional jurisdictions requiring prior approval include
Mississippi, Louisiana, Missouri, Michigan, West Virginia and Ontario, Canada.
Each of these jurisdictions has broad discretion in determining whether such
approval will be granted. There may be other jurisdictions that assert that
their prior consent or approval is required before the merger can be completed,
and we can give you no assurance that the above list of jurisdictions is
comprehensive.

     In some jurisdictions, IGT and Anchor will be required to file
transactional waivers or information for review before the completion of the
merger. The following jurisdictions may require notification,
submission of information relating to corporate changes resulting from
the merger and pre-filings of disclosure forms for new officers
and directors: New
Jersey, Illinois, Indiana, New Mexico and Montana in the United States; certain
Native American Tribal jurisdictions; the Province of Alberta, Canada; the
Province of Gauteng, South Africa; and Victoria, South Australia
and New South Wales in Australia. There may be other jurisdictions that assert
that submission of information to them is required before the merger can be completed, and we can
give you no assurance that the above list of jurisdictions is comprehensive.

Lottery Regulations

     To ensure the integrity of their lottery operations, most jurisdictions
require detailed background disclosure and investigation of vendors providing
goods and services under a contract awarded for a major procurement of lottery
services, which typically include: on-line computer systems and services,
instant ticket printing, ticket validation systems, gaming devices, drawing
equipment, and advertising services. Background investigations typically are
conducted on company subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors and
stockholders who own 5% or more of the outstanding capital stock of the vendor
to determine whether such persons satisfy the suitability standards defined
under statutes and regulations of each jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions
require notice in the event of a change in control, and reserve the right to
terminate the lottery contract upon their determination that the merger would
be contrary to the best interests of their jurisdiction.

Pari-Mutuel Wagering Regulations

     In certain jurisdictions, Anchor’s pari-mutuel wagering operations are
also subject to extensive state regulatory and licensing requirements similar
to those under which the on-line lottery, video lottery and gaming machine
operations are monitored.

Other Regulatory Matters

     Other gaming regulatory approvals may be required before the completion of
the merger. The merger cannot take place until the necessary regulatory
approvals have been received and any waiting periods required by law have
expired. IGT and Anchor have filed (or will promptly file) all of the required
applications or notices necessary to complete the merger with each of the
applicable regulatory authorities. We cannot be sure whether or when
regulatory approvals will be obtained or that the regulatory approvals will be
obtained without conditions that are detrimental to IGT or Anchor.

     In addition, the transaction may be subject to premerger antitrust review
by some foreign jurisdictions.

Percentage Ownership Interest of Anchor Stockholders After the Merger

     In the merger, Anchor stockholders will become stockholders of IGT. Based
on the number of shares of IGT and Anchor common stock outstanding as of July
8, 2001, we estimate that the IGT common stock to be issued to Anchor
stockholders will represent approximately 16.6% (18.7% on a fully diluted basis
assuming the exercise of all 2.4 million vested and unvested Anchor stock
options, which will become options to purchase IGT common stock upon completion
of the merger) of the outstanding shares of IGT common stock and existing IGT
stockholders will own approximately 83.4% of the outstanding shares of IGT
common stock.

Dissenters’ Rights of Appraisal

     Under Nevada law, IGT’s stockholders are not entitled to dissenters’
rights of appraisal with respect to IGT’s proposed issuance of common stock
in order to consummate the merger. The Anchor stockholders are also not
entitled to dissenters’ rights of appraisal with respect to the merger because
both IGT common stock and Anchor common stock are listed on national exchanges
and publicly traded.

New York Stock Exchange Listing

     As a condition to the merger, the New York Stock Exchange must authorize
the listing of the IGT common stock to be issued in the merger.

Consequences of the Merger

     Following the merger, Anchor common stock will no longer be traded on the
Nasdaq National Market and will no longer be publicly traded.

Management After the Merger

     Following completion of the merger, the directors of IGT Merger Sub will
become directors of the surviving corporation, and the officers of Anchor
immediately before the effective time will be the initial officers of the
surviving corporation. In addition, following completion of the merger, Thomas
J. Matthews and a person to be mutually agreed upon by IGT and Anchor will
become directors of IGT, filling two newly created seats on the IGT board of
directors, and Thomas J. Matthews will additionally become the Chief Operating
Officer of IGT.

Resales of IGT Common Stock

     All shares of IGT common stock to be issued in the merger will be freely
transferable, except for shares received by any person who may be deemed to be
an affiliate of Anchor under Rule 145 under the Securities Act of

1933 (the
“Securities Act”), such as directors and key executive officers of Anchor.
Under Rule 145, an affiliate of Anchor may not resell his or her shares of IGT
common stock received in the merger except in transactions permitted by Rule
145 or as otherwise permitted under the Securities Act, including selling such
shares pursuant to an effective registration statement. Anchor will deliver to
IGT a list setting forth the names of all persons who are, in Anchor’s
reasonable judgment, affiliates of Anchor. See “Terms of the Merger Agreement
and Related Agreements — Anchor Affiliate Agreements” for more information
regarding such restrictions.

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, IGT has agreed (a) to take all
reasonably necessary board action so that all IGT common stock issuable
pursuant to the merger to any executive officer or director of Anchor subject
to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) is
issued in a transaction exempted under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act and (b)
for a period of one year from the consummation of the merger, to cause to be
available current public information with respect to IGT within the meaning of
Rule 144(c) of the Securities Act.

TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND RELATED AGREEMENTS

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger
agreement and related agreements. Because the following description is not a
complete description of the merger agreement, the description is qualified by
reference to the merger agreement and you are urged to read the merger
agreement carefully. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to
this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference into
this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Form of Merger

     At the time the merger becomes effective, IGT Merger Sub will merge with
and into Anchor. Anchor will be the surviving corporation in the merger and
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of IGT. IGT Merger Sub and Anchor are both
incorporated in Nevada.

Completion of the Merger

     The closing of the merger will take place no later than the second
business day after all conditions to the merger are fulfilled or waived except
as otherwise agreed by IGT and Anchor in writing. The merger will become
effective when we file the articles of merger with the Nevada Secretary of
State, unless IGT and Anchor agree to specify a later time in the articles of
merger. We will file the articles of merger as soon as practicable after all
conditions in the merger agreement are waived or satisfied. For more
information regarding these conditions, see “— Conditions to the Merger” below.

Conversion of Shares in the Merger

     Upon completion of the merger, by virtue of the merger and without any
additional action on the part of the stockholders of Anchor, IGT or IGT Merger
Sub, each share of Anchor common stock then outstanding will be converted into
the right to receive the number of shares of IGT common stock calculated in
accordance with the following formula (the “Exchange Ratio”). Shares of Anchor
common stock owned by Anchor, IGT, or their wholly-owned subsidiaries will be
cancelled in the merger and will not be exchanged for shares of IGT common
stock. The Exchange Ratio depends upon the IGT Share Value, which is defined
as the average per-share closing price of IGT common stock on the New York
Stock Exchange during the twenty consecutive trading days ending on the third
trading day before the Anchor stockholders’ meeting or, if the closing of the
merger is more than five trading days after the meeting, the third trading day
before the closing date. For example, if the Anchor stockholders’ meeting is
on a Wednesday and the closing date is less than five trading days after that
date, the last date of the measurement period would be the preceding Friday,
assuming that each of the interim days and the Friday were trading days. If
the IGT Share Value is:

•

between $50.00 per share and $75.00 per share, inclusive, IGT
will exchange each share of Anchor common stock for one share of IGT
common stock.

•

less than $50.00 per share, and

-

Anchor does not notify IGT in writing of its intention
to terminate the merger agreement, IGT will exchange each share
of Anchor common stock for one share of IGT common stock; or

-

Anchor notifies IGT in writing of its intention to
terminate the merger agreement and IGT, in its sole and absolute
discretion, elects to adjust the Exchange Ratio rather than allow
the merger agreement to terminate, IGT will exchange each share
of Anchor common stock for the number of shares of IGT common
stock equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is $50.00 and
the denominator of which is the IGT Share Value.

For example, if the IGT Share Value was $48.00, and Anchor
delivered its termination notice to IGT under the terms of
the merger agreement, IGT could, at its sole option, adjust
the Exchange Ratio to 1.0417 ($50.00/$48.00), and Anchor
stockholders would receive 1.0417 shares of IGT common stock
for each share of Anchor common stock held by them.

•

greater than $75.00 per share, and

-

IGT does not notify Anchor in writing of its intention
to terminate the merger agreement, IGT will exchange each share
of Anchor common stock for one share of IGT common stock; or

-

IGT notifies Anchor in writing of its intention to
terminate the merger agreement and Anchor, in its sole and
absolute discretion, elects to adjust the Exchange Ratio rather
than allow the merger agreement to terminate, IGT will exchange
each share of Anchor common stock for the number of shares of IGT
common stock equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is
$75.00 and the denominator of which is the IGT Share Value.

For example, if the IGT Share Value was $77.00 and IGT
delivered its termination notice to Anchor under the terms of
the merger agreement, Anchor could, at its sole option,
adjust the Exchange Ratio to 0.9740 ($75.00/$77.00), and
Anchor stockholders would receive 0.9740 shares of IGT common
stock for each share of Anchor common stock held by them.

     IGT and Anchor encourage you to obtain current stock price quotations for
IGT common stock from a newspaper, the Internet or your broker. IGT common
stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “IGT.” The final
calculation of the Exchange Ratio in the merger will be determined before
completion of the merger and IGT intends to issue a press release announcing
the Exchange Ratio promptly after it is determined. The following toll-free
number is available for stockholders of IGT and Anchor to obtain a daily
closing price for IGT common stock: 800-     .

     Upon completion of the merger, by virtue of the merger and without any
additional action on the part of stockholders of Anchor, IGT or IGT Merger Sub:

•

the Anchor common stock converted as described above will no
longer be outstanding, will automatically be canceled and retired,
and will cease to exist;

•

each holder of Anchor common stock will cease to have any
rights in Anchor common stock, except the right to receive the
appropriate number of shares of IGT common stock, cash in lieu of
fractional shares and dividends, if any, declared with a record date
after the effective time of the merger; and

•

each share of common stock of IGT Merger Sub outstanding
immediately before the effective time of the merger will become one
share of common stock of the surviving corporation.

     For information regarding how to exchange Anchor common stock, see “ —
Exchange Agent; Procedures for Exchange of Certificates” below.

No Fractional Shares

     IGT will not issue fractional shares of IGT common stock to Anchor
stockholders. Instead, for each fractional share, IGT will pay an amount of
cash determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such
Anchor stockholder would otherwise be entitled by the closing price of IGT
common stock reported in The Wall Street Journal on the date of the completion
of the merger or, if such date is not a trading day, the immediately preceding
trading day. For more information regarding the conversion of Anchor common
stock, see “— Conversion of Shares in the Merger” above.

Adjustments to Prevent Dilution

     If, before the completion of the merger, IGT splits or combines the IGT
common stock, or pays a stock dividend or other stock distribution in IGT
common stock, or if IGT common stock is altered or adjusted in any
reclassification, recapitalization or similar transaction, then the Exchange
Ratio will be appropriately adjusted to reflect such split, combination,
dividend or other distribution or reclassification, recapitalization or other
similar transaction.

Treatment of Stock Options and Restricted Stock

     At the effective time of the merger, we will convert all rights to
purchase shares of Anchor common stock under all outstanding stock options
previously granted under any Anchor stock option plan or any Anchor stock
option award agreement into rights to purchase shares of IGT common stock,
which IGT will assume. We will continue the offering periods in effect under
any Anchor stock option plan or Anchor stock option award agreement immediately
before the effective time of the merger substantially in accordance with the
terms of these plans or agreements until the end of their offering periods.
Upon assumption by IGT, each stock option will represent the right to purchase
the number of shares of IGT common stock, rounded to the nearest whole share,
equal to the number of shares originally purchasable under the terms of such
stock option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. The exercise price of any
Anchor stock option assumed by IGT will equal the original exercise price of
such option divided by the Exchange Ratio.

     Immediately before the completion of the merger, each restricted share of
Anchor common stock will, by its terms, become fully vested and unrestricted
and, by virtue of the merger, will then be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive IGT common stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares and
dividends, if any, declared with a record date after the effective time of the
merger.

     As soon as practicable after the effective time of the merger, IGT will
file, if necessary, one or more registration statements on Form S-8 under the
Securities Act, or amendments to its existing registration statements as may be
available, in order to register the shares of IGT common stock issuable upon
purchase of stock under the assumed Anchor stock option plans and assumed
Anchor stock option award agreements.

Exchange Agent; Procedures for Exchange of Certificates

     At or before the completion of the merger, IGT will appoint a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to Anchor to serve as the exchange agent
and will deliver to the exchange agent certificates representing the number of
shares of IGT common stock to be issued to Anchor stockholders in the merger
and cash in an aggregate amount sufficient to pay for fractional shares. The
exchange agent will, according to irrevocable instructions, deliver to the
Anchor stockholders the IGT common stock, any dividends or other distributions
relating to such stock, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares.

     The exchange agent will mail to each Anchor stockholder a letter of
transmittal and instructions to surrender their certificates representing
Anchor common stock in exchange for certificates representing IGT common stock
or cash in lieu of fractional shares. After an Anchor stockholder surrenders
his or her Anchor common stock certificate along with a duly executed and
properly completed letter of transmittal and other required documents, the
exchange agent will deliver to such stockholder the following:

•

a certificate representing the number of whole shares of IGT
common stock to which such stockholder is entitled;

•

cash in lieu of any fractional shares of IGT common stock;
and

•

the amount of any dividends or other distributions declared
on IGT common stock with a record date after the effective time of
the merger and a payment date before surrender of the Anchor common
stock.

     The surviving corporation and the exchange agent may deduct and withhold
from the consideration payable to Anchor stockholders amounts required to be
deducted and withheld under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. If the surviving corporation or the exchange agent deducts or
withholds any amounts so required to be deducted or withheld, then these
amounts will be treated, for all purposes of the merger agreement, as having
been paid to the Anchor stockholders with respect to whom such amounts were
deducted or withheld.

Anchor stockholders should not forward their Anchor common stock
certificates with the enclosed proxy card or forward their Anchor common stock
certificates to the exchange agent until they have received the packet of
information, including a letter of transmittal, described above.

as otherwise prohibited by a gaming authority or expressly contemplated by the

applicable laws and regulations. Anchor has also agreed to use commercially

existing relationships with its customers, suppliers, distributors and others
having business relationships with it.

     Anchor has also agreed that it will not, and will not permit any of its

Conduct of IGT’s Business Pending the Merger

     IGT has agreed as to itself and its subsidiaries that until the completion
of the merger, except as otherwise expressly contemplated by the merger
agreement, it will conduct its operations according to its ordinary and usual
course of business, in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws
and regulations. IGT has also agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to
preserve its current business organization, keep available the services of its
officers and employees as a group and preserve existing relationships with its
customers, suppliers, distributors and others having business relationships
with it.

     IGT has also agreed that it will not, and will not permit any of its
subsidiaries to, take specified actions listed in the merger agreement,
including the following actions, without Anchor’s consent, except to the extent
required by law or as expressly permitted by the merger agreement:

•

declare, set aside or pay dividends on or make any other
distributions in respect of its common stock (the purchase of shares
of its common stock by IGT under its existing stock repurchase
program is not prohibited by the merger agreement);

•

split, combine or reclassify any outstanding shares of capital stock;

•

amend its articles of incorporation or bylaws; or

•

authorize, recommend, propose or announce an intention to
adopt a plan of complete or partial liquidation or dissolution of
IGT.

No Inconsistent Activities

     Except as described below in this section, Anchor has agreed that it and
its subsidiaries will not directly or indirectly through another person:

•

initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate or encourage the
submission of any proposal for a merger, consolidation, purchase of
assets, tender offer or other business combination involving Anchor
or any of its subsidiaries or any proposal to acquire 10% or more of
the voting securities of Anchor or its subsidiaries or a substantial
portion of the assets of Anchor or its subsidiaries (a “Takeover
Proposal”); or

•

have any discussions with or provide any confidential
information or data to a person relating to, engage in any
negotiations concerning or otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort
or attempt to make or implement, any Takeover Proposal.

     However, the board of directors of Anchor is not prohibited from, at any
time before approval of the principal terms of the merger agreement by the
Anchor stockholders, providing information to, or discussing or negotiating
with, any person that makes an unsolicited bona fide written proposal for a
Takeover Proposal that identifies a price or range of values to be paid for the
outstanding capital stock or all or substantially all of the assets of Anchor,
if the following conditions are satisfied:

•

the person must enter into a confidentiality agreement on
terms in form and substance substantially similar to the
confidentiality agreement dated June 21, 2001 between Anchor and
IGT;

•

the Anchor board of directors determines after consultation
with outside legal counsel that it must engage in discussions or
negotiations regarding the Takeover Proposal in order to comply with
its fiduciary duties to the holders of Anchor common stock under
applicable law; and

•

the board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, that the Takeover Proposal, if accepted,

-

is reasonably capable of being completed on
substantially the terms proposed, taking into account all legal,
financial and regulatory aspects of the Takeover Proposal and the
person making it, including such person’s availability of
requisite funds; and

-

would result in a transaction that would provide
greater value to the Anchor stockholders than the merger (a
“Superior Proposal”).

     If Anchor receives any inquiries, offers or proposals from any person with
respect to any Takeover Proposal, then, within 48 hours of the receipt thereof,
Anchor will notify IGT orally and in writing of the status and details of such
Takeover Proposal, including without limitation, the terms and conditions of
such Takeover Proposal, the identity of the person or entity making it and all
other information reasonably requested by IGT.

     The merger agreement does not prohibit Anchor from disclosing to Anchor
stockholders the statement required by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
with respect to a Takeover Proposal by means of a tender offer.

     IGT has agreed that before the completion of the merger it will not (1)
consolidate with or merge into any other person whereby IGT is not or would not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity and ultimate parent entity
(as that term is used under the HSR Act and related rules) of such
consolidation or merger, or (2) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, unless, in each such case, such person
acknowledges that the surviving entity will continue to be bound by all
obligations of IGT under the merger agreement.

Other Covenants

     Under the merger agreement IGT and Anchor agreed to the following
additional covenants:

Stockholders’ Meetings

     IGT and Anchor will each duly call, give notice of, and hold a special
meeting of its stockholders to approve the merger agreement as soon as
reasonably practicable after the registration statement on Form S-4 of which
this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part has been declared effective
by the SEC but after taking into account the likely timing of obtaining
regulatory approvals to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger.
IGT and Anchor will each use reasonable efforts to solicit proxies from its
stockholders, and will take all other action necessary or advisable to secure
the vote or consent of stockholders as required by applicable law. IGT and
Anchor each, through its respective board of directors, will recommend to its
respective stockholders the approval of the merger agreement.

Reasonable Efforts

     Each of Anchor, IGT
and IGT Merger Sub has agreed to use commercially
reasonable good faith efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties
in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the merger in the most expeditious manner practicable. For example,
each company has agreed to:

•

make all necessary applications, registrations and filings,
including filings with governmental entities;

•

obtain all necessary actions or nonactions, licenses,
consents, approvals or waivers from governmental entities or third
parties;

•

take all reasonable steps necessary to obtain an approval or
waiver from, or to avoid any action or proceeding by, any
governmental entity;

•

execute and deliver additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out
the purposes of, the merger agreement;

•

defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings by persons
other than governmental entities, challenging the merger agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated under it;

•

use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill all conditions
to the respective obligations of IGT, IGT Merger Sub or Anchor under
the merger agreement; and

•

use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the entry,
enactment or promulgation of any threatened or pending temporary,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling
or statute, rule, regulation or executive order.

     In addition, Anchor has agreed to take all commercially reasonable actions
requested by IGT in connection with obtaining any consents, waivers or
amendments requested by IGT under any outstanding debt instruments of Anchor.

     Notwithstanding these agreements, IGT will not be obligated to take any
action if the taking of such action or the obtaining of any waiver, license,
consent, approval or exemption is reasonably likely to be materially burdensome
to IGT and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or to impact (1) in a materially
adverse manner the operations of IGT or (2) the economic or business benefits
of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement so as to render
completion of the merger inadvisable to IGT, in its good faith judgment.

Gaming Approvals

     Provided that IGT is not obligated to take any action which would require
IGT to surrender or terminate a Gaming Approval (as defined below) held by it
or its subsidiaries, IGT and Anchor have agreed to:

•

promptly prepare and file all documentation, to effect all
applications, notices, petitions and filings, and obtain as promptly
as practical all permits, registrations, licenses, findings of
suitability, qualifications, consents, waivers, variances,
exemptions, orders, approvals and authorizations of all governmental
entities under all gaming laws which are necessary in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement (the “Gaming Approvals”) and to comply with the conditions
of all such Gaming Approvals;

•

use commercially reasonable efforts to file within forty-five
days of the date of the merger agreement, and in all events will file
within seventy-five days of the date of the merger agreement, all
required initial applications and documentation in connection with
obtaining the Gaming Approvals and act reasonably and promptly in
responding to requests for any additional information by any such
governmental entity or gaming authority in connection with obtaining
the Gaming Approvals;

•

give the other party the right to review and, to the extent
practicable, the right to comment on all information relating to it,
and any of its respective subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders, which appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to any governmental entity in connection with,
the merger, subject to the confidentiality agreement and applicable
laws relating to the exchange of information; and

•

promptly inform the other party of any communication to or
from any governmental entity or gaming authority which causes the
receiving party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood
that any Gaming Approval from such governmental entity will not be
obtained or that receipt of such approval will be materially
delayed.

     If any person (1) owning capital stock of IGT or Anchor is denied a Gaming
Approval or is disqualified from eligibility for a Gaming Approval or found
unsuitable by a government entity before the closing of the merger, (2) whose
continued involvement in the business of IGT or Anchor as an employee,
director, officer or otherwise is reasonably likely to have a material adverse
effect on the likelihood that Anchor, IGT or IGT Merger Sub will obtain a
Gaming Approval or (3) is expressly precluded by any governmental entity from
having any continuing

interest in Anchor, IGT or IGT Merger Sub as a condition
to issuance or continued validity of any Gaming Approval, each such person
will, and IGT and Anchor will cause each such person to:

•

immediately and permanently resign from any position with the
related entity;

•

if required by any governmental entity, dispose of all his or
her or its securities or other ownership interests in the related
entity; and

•

cooperate with Anchor, IGT and IGT Merger Sub in obtaining
and retaining in full force and effect all Gaming Approvals.

Stock

     IGT covenants and agrees that: (1) it will take all reasonably necessary
board action so that all securities (including derivative securities) of IGT
issuable pursuant to the merger or the merger agreement to any executive
officer or director of Anchor subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act is
issued in a transaction exempted under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act; and (2)
for a period of one year from the effectiveness of the merger, IGT will cause
to be available adequate current public information with respect to IGT within
the meaning of Rule 144(c) under the Securities Act.

Indemnification and Insurance

     See “The Merger — Interests of Key Persons in the Merger —
Indemnification” for a description of the provisions of the merger agreement
relating to the obligation of IGT following the merger to indemnify and
maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for the benefit of
Anchor’s directors and officers.

Resignation of Directors and Officers

     Anchor will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the officers and
directors of Anchor and its subsidiaries as IGT may request to resign their
positions as such as of the effectiveness of the merger.

Rights Agreement

     The board of directors of Anchor will take all further action reasonably
requested in writing by IGT in order to render Anchor’s rights agreement or any
similar instrument inapplicable to the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. Except as requested in writing by IGT,
during the term of the merger agreement, the board of directors of Anchor will
not (i) amend its rights agreement or (ii) take any action with respect to, or
make any determination under, the rights agreement.

Board of Directors of IGT

     As of the effectiveness of the merger (1) the by-laws of IGT will be
amended to increase the size of the board of directors of IGT by two and (2)
Thomas J. Matthews and a person to be mutually agreed upon by IGT and Anchor
will be appointed as directors of IGT.

distribution of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, public announcements
regarding the merger, mutual notification of specified matters, access to

Termination

     The merger agreement may be terminated at any time before the effective time of the merger as follows:

•

by mutual written consent of IGT and Anchor;

•

unless IGT is in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement, by IGT if
Anchor materially breaches any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements in the merger agreement or if any
representation or warranty of Anchor becomes untrue, and such breach
or untruth continues for forty-five days following notice to Anchor
of such breach or untruth, or the nature of such breach or untruth
is such that conditions to IGT’s obligations to consummate the
merger would be incapable of being satisfied by January 30, 2002;

•

unless Anchor is in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement, by Anchor
if IGT materially breaches any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements in the merger agreement or if any
representation or warranty of IGT becomes untrue, and such breach or
untruth continues for forty-five days following notice to IGT of
such breach or untruth, or the nature of such breach or untruth is
such that the conditions to Anchor’s obligations to consummate the
merger would be incapable of being satisfied by January 30, 2002;

•

by either IGT or Anchor if any governmental entity will have
issued an order, decree or ruling, or taken any other action,
permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the
completion of the merger, and the order, decree, ruling or other
action will have become final and nonappealable;

•

by either IGT or Anchor if the merger does not occur by
January 30, 2002, unless the merger does not occur due to a breach
of a covenant, or a willful and material breach of a representation
or warranty in the merger agreement by the party seeking to
terminate and provided that if the merger has not been consummated
because of a failure to obtain approval from a governmental entity
and such approval is still being pursued, then IGT or Anchor may
extend the date of termination until April 30, 2002 by providing
written notice thereof to the other party on or before January 30,
2002;

•

provided the terminating party is not in material breach of
any of its obligations under the merger agreement, by either IGT or
Anchor if any approval of the stockholders of IGT or Anchor required
for completion of the merger will not have been obtained by reason
of the failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held meeting of
IGT’s or Anchor’s stockholders or at any adjournment or
postponement;

•

by IGT if the Anchor board (1) withdraws or modifies
adversely its recommendation of the merger (following the receipt by
Anchor of a Takeover Proposal), (2) recommends a Takeover Proposal
to Anchor stockholders, or (3) fails to call or hold the Anchor
stockholders’ meeting following Anchor’s receipt of a Takeover
Proposal;

•

by Anchor, if before the Anchor stockholders’ meeting and as
a result of a Superior Proposal (as defined in “— No Inconsistent
Activities” above), the Anchor board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the termination of the
merger agreement and acceptance of the Superior Proposal is
necessary in order to comply with its fiduciary duties; except that
before Anchor may so terminate the merger agreement, it must (1)
give IGT notice of the proposed termination, (2) allow IGT, in IGT’s
sole discretion, the right within five business days of IGT’s
receipt of such notice to amend the merger agreement to make the
terms substantially similar to the Superior Proposal and (3)
negotiate in good faith with IGT regarding any amendment of the
merger agreement. Anchor may terminate the merger agreement if IGT
and Anchor do not reach an agreement to amend the merger agreement
within five days following IGT’s receipt of Anchor’s termination
notice;

•

by Anchor by written notice delivered to IGT if the IGT Share
Value is less than $50.00 unless IGT, within five trading days after
receipt of such written notice from Anchor of its intention to so

terminate, elects at its sole option to adjust the Exchange Ratio
(see “— Conversion of Shares in the Merger” above); and

•

by IGT by written notice delivered to Anchor if the IGT Share
Value is greater than $75.00 per share unless Anchor, within five
trading days after receipt of such written notice from IGT of its
intention to so terminate elects at its sole option to adjust the
Exchange Ratio (see “— Conversion of Shares in the Merger” above).

     The party desiring to terminate the merger agreement must give written
notice of such termination to the other party.

Fees and Expenses

     Whether or not the merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated in
the merger agreement will be paid by the party incurring such expenses; except
(1) the termination fee described in “—Termination Fee” below and (2) those
expenses incurred in connection with the printing of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, including the filing fee paid to the SEC and the filing
fee relating to the HSR Act, which will be shared equally by IGT and Anchor.

Termination Fee

     Anchor must pay IGT $30,000,000 in the event of the termination of the
merger agreement under any of the following circumstances:

•

Anchor terminated the merger agreement because it received a
Superior Proposal and it did not reach agreement with IGT to amend
the merger agreement so as to make it substantially similar to the
Superior Proposal;

•

IGT terminated the merger agreement because Anchor’s board
withdrew or adversely modified its recommendation to its
stockholders following Anchor’s receipt of a Takeover Proposal,
recommended a Takeover Proposal to the Anchor stockholders or failed
to call or hold the Anchor stockholders’ meeting following Anchor’s
receipt of a Takeover Proposal; or

•

IGT terminated the merger agreement because Anchor willfully
and materially breached its covenant not to solicit, initiate,
encourage or participate in discussions or negotiations regarding a
Takeover Proposal in a manner not required to satisfy the Anchor
board’s fiduciary duties as described in “—No Inconsistent
Activities” above; or

•

(1) a Takeover Proposal was made before the Anchor
stockholders’ meeting (whether or not rejected or withdrawn), (2)
the Anchor stockholders did not approve the Anchor merger proposal
and (3) within twelve months after the termination of the merger
agreement Anchor enters into an agreement for, and within
twenty-four months after such termination has completed, a
transaction that would constitute a Takeover Proposal (whether or
not with the party who made the initial Takeover Proposal).

Amendment

     IGT and Anchor may amend or supplement the merger agreement in writing at
any time, except that following approval by the Anchor stockholders and IGT
stockholders, there may be no amendment to the merger agreement that by law
requires further approval by the Anchor stockholders and IGT stockholders
unless Anchor or IGT, as applicable, first obtains such approval.

Waiver

     The merger agreement permits Anchor, IGT and IGT Merger Sub at any time
before the effective time of the merger to:

•

extend the time to perform any of the obligations or other
acts of the other parties;

•

waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained in the merger agreement or in any document delivered
pursuant to the merger agreement; and

•

waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of
the other parties contained in the merger agreement unless, if such
party waives compliance after approval by the Anchor stockholders or
the IGT stockholders, as applicable, and such waiver would require
approval by the Anchor stockholders or the IGT stockholders, as
applicable, such party first obtains such approval, in each case
pursuant to a written instrument.

     The failure of any party to the merger agreement to assert any of its
rights under the merger agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of
those rights.

Voting Agreements

     Contemporaneously with the execution of the merger agreement, in order to
induce IGT to enter into the merger agreement, two of Anchor’s executive
officers and stockholders, Thomas J. Matthews and Joseph Murphy, entered into
voting agreements with IGT. Mr. Matthews is Anchor’s Chief Executive Officer.
Mr. Murphy is Anchor’s Chief Operating Officer — Gaming Operations. Under the
voting agreements, each of these stockholders agreed to vote all of the Anchor
common stock owned by him in favor of the merger and against any inconsistent
proposals or transactions. Additionally, each of these stockholders has agreed
not to pledge or otherwise dispose of any Anchor common stock owned by him.
The voting agreements terminate upon a termination of the merger agreement.

     As of August 8, 2001, these two stockholders beneficially owned and were
entitled to vote an aggregate of 225,000 shares of common stock, or
approximately 1.5%
of Anchor’s outstanding common stock, excluding shares issuable pursuant
to stock options.

Anchor Affiliate Agreements

     As an inducement to IGT to enter into the merger agreement, certain
affiliates of Anchor executed affiliate agreements contemporaneously with the
execution of the merger agreement. Under these affiliate agreements, IGT will
be entitled to place appropriate legends regarding transferability on the
certificates evidencing any IGT common stock that are received by these persons
or entities. Further, these persons have also acknowledged the resale
restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the Securities Act on shares of IGT
common stock to be received by them in the merger.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements,
including the notes thereto, are based on and are qualified in their entirety
by reference to, and should be read in conjunction with, the consolidated
financial statements and the notes thereto of IGT, which were previously
reported in IGT’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended on Form 10-K/A, for
the year ended September 30, 2000, IGT’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the
quarters ended December 30, 2000 and March 31, 2001, each as amended on Form
10-Q/A, IGT’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30,
2001, and the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto of Anchor,
which were previously reported in Anchor’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as twice
amended on Form 10-K/A, for the year ended June 30, 2000 and Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2000, December 31, 2000 and
March 31, 2001. All of the above-listed financial statements of IGT and Anchor
are incorporated in this joint proxy statement/prospectus by reference. See
“Incorporation of Documents by Reference.”

     The acquisition of Anchor will be accounted for using the purchase method
of accounting. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of income
of IGT for the nine months ended June 30, 2001 and for the year ended September
30, 2000 and the unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet of IGT as
of June 30, 2001, which are set forth below, give effect to the purchase of
Anchor based upon the assumptions set forth below and in the notes to unaudited
pro forma combined condensed financial statements. The unaudited pro forma
financial information assumes that the purchase of Anchor was completed on
October 3, 1999 for the unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of
income and on June 30, 2001 for the unaudited pro forma combined condensed
balance sheet.

     The pro forma
statement of income for the twelve month period ended
September 30, 2000 includes the historical results of Anchor for
the twelve month period ended
June 30, 2000. The pro forma statement of income for the nine
month period ended June 30, 2001 includes the historical results
of Anchor for the nine month period ended March 31, 2001. The
pro forma balance sheet as of June 30, 2001 includes the
historical balance sheet of Anchor as of March 31, 2001. Certain
amounts in the historical financial statements for Anchor including
the earnings of its unconsolidated joint venture and certain
depreciation have been reclassified to be consistent with the
presentation used by IGT. IGT and Anchor have no significant
intercompany activity which would require elimination in preparing
the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements.

     The pro forma adjustments and the resulting unaudited pro forma combined
condensed financial statements were prepared based on available information and
certain assumptions and estimates described in the notes to the unaudited pro
forma combined condensed financial statements. A final determination of
required purchase accounting adjustments, including the allocation of the
purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, has not been
made, and the allocation reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined
condensed financial statements should be considered preliminary.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements do not
purport to represent what IGT’s financial position or results of operations
would have been had the acquisition of Anchor occurred on the dates indicated
or to project IGT’s financial position or results of operations for any future
period. Furthermore, the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial
statements do not reflect changes that may occur as the result of activities
after the merger closes.

     In March 2001, IGT completed the purchase of Silicon Gaming, Inc.
(“Silicon”). Financial results for Silicon after the closing of the
acquisition are included in IGT’s historical results. The pro forma effect of
Silicon is not included as it is not material.

     During the nine months ended June 30, 2001, Anchor recorded various
one-time charges. See Note 11 of Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Condensed Financial Statements. Excluding these charges, pro forma
net income for the nine months ended June 30, 2001 would have
been $201.6 million or
$2.19 per diluted share.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed

Financial Statements

The following pro forma adjustments have been made to the unaudited pro forma
financial information:

(1)

Historically IGT and Anchor
applied the equity method to account for their respective share of
the Spin For Cash
Joint Venture. After the merger, the joint venture will be consolidated.
The pro forma adjustments reflect the elimination of the investments in
the joint venture of $154.9 million and the elimination of the earnings of
unconsolidated affiliates of $199.4 million for fiscal 2000 and $201.6
million for the nine months ended June 30, 2001. The adjustments also include the
consolidation of the joint venture as summarized below (in thousands):

Concurrent with the merger, IGT will refinance Anchor’s obligation under
Anchor’s senior credit facility. Anchor’s obligation will be repaid in
full and terminated. IGT expects to use available cash and draw from its
line of credit to refinance this debt. As of March 31, 2001, Anchor’s
obligation under its credit facility totaled $180.0 million. The
adjustment reflects the repayment of this obligation assuming $125.0
million is paid using available cash and the remainder is drawn from
IGT’s line of credit at an interest rate of 4.95%. The weighted average
interest rate on Anchor’s credit facility for the nine month period
ended March 31, 2001 was 8.24% and was 7.27% for fiscal 2000. Pro forma
interest expense decreased by $9.4 million in the nine-month period and
$12.7 million for fiscal 2000. The adjustment also includes a decrease in
interest income of $3.5 million for the nine
month period due to lower cash balances and $3.7 million for fiscal
2000 based on an interest rate of 3.7%. IGT
anticipates that the $248.0 million principal amount of Anchor’s 9-7/8%
Senior Subordinated Notes will remain outstanding following the merger and
has treated these Notes on this basis in the pro forma information
presented.

(3)

All adjustments to the pro forma statements of income have been tax
effected using our statutory federal tax rate of 35%, except for the
disposal of Sunland Park Race Track and Casino (Sunland), which reflects
actual taxes on the transaction of approximately $15.0 million. The
long-term deferred tax liabilities amount reflects the adjustment to recognize for the difference between the fair market values
and the tax bases of the assets acquired by IGT.

(4)

The merger will be accounted for as a purchase under the newly issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 “Business Combinations.” The estimated purchase
price and purchase price allocation are noted below (in thousands except
shares and per share amounts):

Estimated Purchase Price:

Total estimated purchase price

$

888,877

The pro forma adjustments
related to intangible assets include the estimated increase of
$1,303.6 million from the purchase price allocation above and
the elimination of Anchor’s
historical intangible assets of $48.7 million for a total pro
forma adjustment to intangible assets of $1,254.9 million.

Stock options of Anchor employees will be converted into the right to
purchase IGT stock. In accordance with FASB Interpretation 44, “Accounting
for Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation”, the fair value of
the stock options issued in exchange for outstanding awards are to be
included as part of the purchase price in a business combination. The fair
value of the options is approximately $65.5 million. This amount was
calculated based on our best estimate of the fair value of the outstanding
awards assuming a market price of $54.85 per share.

Amortizable intangible assets
with finite lives of $405.0 million have been assigned a useful
life of 12 years. Intangible assets with indefinite lives totaled $312.0
million. The increase in amortization of identifiable intangible
assets with finite lives totaled
$25.3 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2001 and $33.7 million for
fiscal 2000. These increases in amortization expense were offset by
the elimination of amortization on Anchor’s historical
intangible assets of $7.8 million for the nine months ended
June 30, 2001 and $8.9 million for fiscal 2000. The estimated fair value adjustment related to the debt
assumed totaled $19.1 million. The amortization of this fair
value adjustment resulted in a decrease in interest expense of
$1.9 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2001.
Because this debt originated in October 2000, no adjustment was made
to fiscal 2000 interest expense.

The above purchase price allocation and the lives assigned to the assets
are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of developing the
IGT Pro Forma Financial Statements. After the closing of the merger, IGT,
with the assistance of valuation consultants, will complete its evaluation
of the fair value and the lives of the assets acquired. Accordingly, the
allocation of the purchase price and the lives of the assets acquired,
and resulting amortization expense which are based on preliminary estimates, may differ from the final
purchase price allocation and the final lives assigned to the assets. Any change in the fair value or lives assigned to amortizable
or depreciable assets would impact the results of future operations. For each
$10.0 million change, if any, in the amount allocated to intangible assets
with finite lives, the combined pro forma net income would change by
approximately $542,000 net of tax (assuming a useful life of 12 years).
Any change in the IGT share price would
have the effect of impacting recorded goodwill. As goodwill will not be
amortized, this will have no impact on pro forma results of operations.

(5)

The adjustment reflects IGT shares issued in the merger and the
adjustment of Anchor’s equity.

(6)

FASB Interpretation 44 requires the intrinsic value of the unvested
awards to be allocated to deferred compensation and recognized as non-cash
compensation cost over the remaining future vesting periods. The ultimate
amount to be allocated to deferred compensation will be based on the price
of IGT common stock at the date of the merger. We estimate the total
unearned compensation to be $11.7 million based on an estimated stock
price of $54.85 and amortized over an estimated remaining vesting period
of three years. The adjustment reflects deferred compensation as a
component of stockholders’ equity. Amortization of deferred compensation
was included in the pro forma financials of $2.9 million for the nine
months ended June 30, 2001 and $3.9 million for fiscal 2000.

(7)

The Anchor historical balance sheet includes deferred compensation
related to shares issued as restricted stock awards. The vesting of these
shares will be accelerated upon merger. The amount reflects the
elimination of the related deferred compensation.

(8)

In December 2000, Anchor disposed of its racetrack assets including
Sunland and its 25% interest in a Massachusetts horse racing facility.
The nine month period also includes an
adjustment to eliminate the gain on the sale of these assets. The
eliminations are reflected below (in thousands):

Weighted average common shares outstanding have been adjusted to include
approximately 14.9 million shares to be issued in the merger. This figure
assumes that the conversion ratio in the merger is one-for-one and
that the merger occurred at the beginning of the period. The adjustment
also reflects the potential dilutive effect of Anchor stock options, which
will be converted to options to purchase approximately 2.4 million shares
of IGT common stock. Applying the treasury method of accounting, the pro
forma adjustment reflects approximately 800,000 additional common shares
related to these options.

(10)

In fiscal
2000, Anchor incurred impairment and restructuring charges of
$2.6 million ($1.6 million, net of tax)
in connection with the restructuring of its VLC subsidiary.

(11)

During the nine month period
ended March 31, 2001, Anchor incurred various one-time charges.
Anchor incurred impairment, restructuring, and other charges of $128.5
million ($104.8 million net of tax) primarily related to its AWI
subsidiary. Anchor also incurred one-time charges of $1.6 million
($1.0 million net of tax) relating to immediate vesting of restricted
stock grants upon completion of the stock repurchase from the Fulton
family and $4.2 million ($2.6 million net of tax) for inventory
writedowns and a contractual dispute. Excluding these charges pro forma
income from operations for the nine
months ended June 30, 2001 would have been $374.8 million and pro forma net income
would have totaled $201.6 million or $2.19 per diluted share.

COMPARISON OF THE RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF ANCHOR COMMON STOCK AND

INTERNATIONAL GAME TECHNOLOGY COMMON STOCK

     Upon completion of the merger, the stockholders of Anchor will become
stockholders of IGT, and IGT’s articles of incorporation and bylaws will govern
the rights of former Anchor stockholders. Both IGT and Anchor are incorporated
under Nevada law and are subject to the Nevada General Corporation Law.

     The following is a summary of material differences between the rights of
holders of IGT common stock and the rights of holders of Anchor common stock.
These differences arise from differences between IGT’s articles of
incorporation and bylaws, on the one hand, and Anchor’s articles of
incorporation and bylaws, on the other hand. This discussion is not, and does
not purport to be, complete or to identify all differences that may,
under all given situations, be material to stockholders. The following summaries are
qualified in their entirety by reference to IGT’s articles of incorporation and
bylaws, which are incorporated by reference as exhibits to IGT’s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000, and to Anchor’s
articles of incorporation and bylaws, which are incorporated by reference as
exhibits to Anchor’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2000. For information on how to obtain these documents, see “Where You Can

Anchor Stockholder Rights

IGT Stockholder Rights

Cumulative Voting

Under Nevada law,
cumulative voting with
respect to the election
of members of the board
of directors is not
mandated by the state,
and is required to be in
the articles of
incorporation to be
legal. Anchor’s articles
specifically prohibit

meeting of stockholders
and may not be effected
by a consent in writing
by any such
stockholders.

Neither IGT’s
articles nor bylaws
prohibit actions by
IGT stockholders

consent, and IGT’s
bylaws specifically

Anchor Stockholder Rights

IGT Stockholder Rights

Liability
Indemnification of
Directors

Anchor’s articles and
bylaws cite two
exceptions to Anchor’s
obligation to indemnify
directors for breach of
fiduciary duty: (1)
intentional misconduct,
fraud, or knowing
violation of law; (2)
payment of distributions
violating NRS 78.300.

Anchor’s bylaws state
that directors may
receive full
indemnification if such
director acted in good
faith and in a manner
reasonably believed to
be in or not to be
opposed to interests of
the corporation and, if
proceeding is criminal,
the director had no
reasonable cause to
believe the conduct was
unlawful. A director may
be indemnified only if
such indemnification was
authorized by (a)
stockholders, (b)
majority of quorum of
board members who are
not parties to the act,
(c) independent legal
counsel if so ordered by
a majority of quorum of
directors not party to
the act, or (d) if a
quorum of directors not
parties to the act
cannot be maintained,
then by independent
legal counsel.

An amendment to IGT’s
articles provides
that IGT directors
may receive full
indemnification for
breaches of fiduciary
duty.

IGT’s bylaws provide
that indemnification
for a proceeding
initiated by a
director will be
granted only if such
proceeding received
authorization by the
IGT board.

PROPOSAL — AMENDMENT TO THE 1993 STOCK OPTION PLAN

     IGT maintains the International Game Technology 1993 Stock Option Plan, as
amended (the “Plan”). The IGT board of directors has approved, subject to
stockholder approval, an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Plan. The
Amendment is described in more detail below. Stockholders are being asked to
approve the Amendment.

Proposed Amendment to the Plan

     The Plan provides for a limit on the aggregate number of shares of IGT
common stock that may be issued or delivered pursuant to awards granted to
employees thereunder. The aggregate employee share limit is currently
8,000,000 shares. As of August 10, 2001, approximately 7,260,000 of the
8,000,000 shares had been issued pursuant to awards granted under the Plan or
were subject to awards then outstanding under the Plan, and approximately
740,000 shares were then available for additional Plan award grants.

     As referred to above under “The Merger — Interests of Key Persons in the
Merger,” Mr. Matthews, who will become President and Chief Executive Officer of
the surviving corporation of the merger and Chief Operating Officer of IGT,
will be granted an option under the Plan to purchase 500,000 shares of IGT
common stock. Also as referred to in that section, Mr. Murphy, who will
continue as Chief Operating Officer — Gaming Operations of the surviving
corporation of the merger with Anchor, will be granted an option under the Plan
to purchase 100,000 shares of IGT common stock. If the merger is consummated,
each such option will (1) be granted on the effective date of
the merger, (2) have a maximum term of ten years, (3) have a per share exercise price
equal to the closing trading price of IGT common stock on the effective date of
the merger, and (4) vest as to one-fifth (1/5) of the total number of
shares subject to the option on each of the first five anniversaries of the
effective date of the merger. These stock options will be granted to Mr.
Matthews and Mr. Murphy only if the merger with Anchor is consummated. These
option grants are not subject to stockholder approval of the Plan Amendment.
However, if granted, these stock options will reduce the number of shares
available under the Plan from approximately 740,000 shares to approximately
140,000 shares.

     The Amendment, if approved by stockholders, will increase the Plan’s
aggregate employee share limit from 8,000,000 shares to 8,900,000 shares (an
increase of 900,000 shares). The IGT board of directors approved the Amendment
based, in part, on its belief that an increase in shares available for grants
under the Plan will accommodate the grants committed to as part of the merger
agreement and leave sufficient remaining shares to provide for future
incentives for management and key employees through at least the 2002 annual
meeting of IGT stockholders. The Plan expires on September 21, 2002 and the
board expects that a new long-term incentive plan, authorizing additional
shares for stock option grant purposes, will be prepared and submitted for
stockholder approval at the 2002 annual meeting of stockholders.

     The Plan provides that an additional 500,000 shares may be issued under
the Plan’s non-employee director grant program (in addition to the shares
available for employee grants). The Amendment does not affect this
non-employee director share limit.

     The principal terms of the Plan are summarized below. The following
summary is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Plan, which is an
appendix to the copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus that was filed
electronically with the SEC and can be reviewed on the SEC’s Web site at
http://www.sec.gov. A copy of the Plan may also be obtained by contacting
Virginia Williams, IGT’s Manager, Legal Services, at 9295 Prototype Drive,
Reno, Nevada 89511-0580 (telephone number (775) 448-7777).

Operation of the Plan

Administration
. The IGT board of directors has appointed the IGT
compensation committee as the “Committee” which administers the Plan.

Awards
. The Plan authorizes stock options, restricted stock awards, stock
bonuses, stock appreciation rights, and performance-based awards (payable in
cash or stock). The Plan retains the flexibility to offer competitive
incentives and to tailor benefits to specific needs and circumstances.
Generally, an option or other right

to acquire stock will expire, or other award will vest, not more than 10
years after the date of grant. Under the Plan, the Committee has the authority
to designate in each award the effect of a termination of service or
employment.

Eligibility
. Persons eligible to receive awards under the Plan include
officers (whether or not directors) or key executive, administrative,
managerial, production, marketing or sales employees of IGT and its
subsidiaries (“Eligible Employees”). In addition, non-employee members of the
IGT board of directors are eligible to receive stock option grants under the
non-employee director option grant program described below. As of August 10,
2001, approximately 500 officers and employees of IGT and its subsidiaries
(including all of the named executive officers) were considered eligible under
the Plan, subject to the power of the Committee to determine Eligible Employees
to whom awards will be granted, and 5 non-employee members of the IGT board of
directors were considered eligible for automatic option grants under the
non-employee director option grant program. If the merger with Anchor is
consummated, approximately 300 persons currently employed by Anchor will also
be considered to be Eligible Employees.

Transferability Restrictions
. Plan awards generally are non-transferable
and will not become subject in any manner to sale, transfer, anticipation,
alienation, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge. The Committee may,
however, permit awards to be exercised by certain persons or entities related
to a participant for estate and/or tax planning purposes.

Share Limits
. Currently, the maximum number of shares of IGT’s common
stock that may be delivered pursuant to awards granted to Eligible Employees
under the Plan can not exceed 8,000,000 shares. If stockholders approved the
proposed Amendment, this limit will increase to 8,900,000 shares.

     The maximum number of shares of IGT common stock that may be issued under
the non-employee director option grant program is 500,000 shares (in addition
to the shares available for Eligible Employee grants). The maximum number of
shares that may be covered by options and stock appreciation rights that are
granted to an individual during any calendar year cannot exceed 1,000,000
shares. No more than 500,000 shares may be issued under the Plan in respect of
restricted stock awards or stock bonuses for nominal or no consideration (other
than shares issued in respect of compensation earned but deferred). The
Amendment, if approved by stockholders, will not affect these share limits.

     As is customary in incentive plans of this nature, the number and kind of
shares available under the Plan and the then outstanding stock-based awards, as
well as exercise or purchase prices, performance targets under certain
performance-based awards and share limits, are subject to adjustment in the
event of certain reorganizations, mergers, combinations, consolidations,
recapitalizations, reclassifications, stock splits, stock dividends, asset
sales or other similar events, or extraordinary dividends or distributions of
property to the stockholders.

     The Plan will not limit the authority of the IGT board of directors or the
Committee to grant awards or authorize any other compensation, with or without
reference to the common stock, under any other plan or authority.

Stock Options
. An option is the right to purchase common stock at a
future date at a specified price (the “exercise price”). IGT may grant
nonqualified and incentive stock options under the Plan to Eligible Employees.
Incentive stock options are taxed differently from nonqualified stock options,
as described under “Federal Income Tax Consequences” below. Incentive stock
options are also subject to more restrictive terms and are limited in amount by
the Code and the Plan. Full payment for shares purchased on the exercise of
any option must be made at the time of such exercise in a manner approved by
the Committee. The Committee will determine the exercise price per share at
the time of grant. The Committee from time to time may authorize, generally or
in specific cases only, any adjustment in the exercise price of, the number of
shares subject to, the restrictions upon or the term of an option granted under
the Plan by cancellation of an outstanding option and a subsequent regranting
of an option, by amendment, by substitution of an outstanding option, by waiver
or by other legally valid means. Under the Plan, the Committee has the
authority to designate in each award the effect of termination from service or
employment.

Stock Appreciation Rights
. A stock appreciation right is the right to
receive payment based on the appreciation in the fair market value of the
common stock from the date of grant to the date of exercise. As determined by
the Committee, such amount may be paid in cash, in shares of common stock or a
combination thereof.

Restricted Stock Awards
. A restricted stock award is an award of a fixed
number of shares of common stock subject to vesting requirements and other
restrictions. The Committee specifies the price, if any, the participant must
pay for such shares and the restrictions imposed on such shares. Restricted
stock awarded to a participant may not be voluntarily or involuntarily sold,
assigned, transferred, pledged or encumbered during the restricted period.

Performance-Based Awards and Stock Bonus
es. The Plan permits the granting
of performance-based awards and stock bonuses. The amount of cash or shares or
other property that may be deliverable pursuant to such a performance-based
award is based upon the degree of attainment over a specified period of such
measure(s) of performance of IGT (or any part thereof) or the participant as
may be established by the Committee. The Committee, in its discretion, may
also grant a stock bonus to any eligible employee. A stock bonus is an award
of shares of common stock for no consideration other than past services.

     Performance-based awards may be designed to satisfy the requirements for
deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Code (“Performance-Based Awards”) (in
addition to other awards expressly authorized under the Plan that may also
qualify as performance-based under Section 162(m)). The eligible class of
persons for these awards is all executive officers of IGT. The maximum number
of shares of common stock which may be delivered pursuant to all awards that
are granted as Performance-Based Awards to any participant in any calendar year
may not exceed 1,000,000 shares (subject to adjustment) and the annual
aggregate amount of compensation that may be paid to any participant in respect
of cash-based Performance-Based Awards granted during any calendar year may not
exceed $1,000,000. The performance goals for Performance-Based Awards are any
one or a combination of earnings per share, return on equity, total stockholder
return and cash flow. These goals are applied over performance cycles as
determined by the Committee. Specific cycles and target levels of performance,
as well as the award levels, are determined by the Committee not later than the
applicable deadline under Section 162(m) of the Code and in any event at the
time when achievement of such targets is substantially uncertain. Appropriate
adjustments to goals and targets may be made by the Committee based upon
objective criteria in the case of certain events that were not anticipated at
the time goals were established. IGT believes that specific performance
targets (when established) are likely to constitute confidential business
information, the disclosure of which may adversely affect IGT or mislead the
public. The Committee must certify the achievement of the applicable
performance goals and the actual amount payable to each participant under
Performance-Based Awards before payment.

Deferrals
. The Committee may authorize the deferral of any award due
under the Plan.

Non-Employee Director Options
. The Plan provides that when a person
(other than an employee of IGT or one of its subsidiaries) is first elected to
the IGT board of directors, he or she will be granted a stock option under the
Plan to acquire 10,000 shares of IGT common stock. The Plan also currently
provides that each non-employee member of the IGT board of directors who is
re-elected to office will be granted a stock option under the Plan to acquire
6,000 shares of IGT common stock. This program of option grants under the Plan
is referred to as the “non-employee director option grant program.” The
exercise price of, as well as the period during which a director may exercise
an option granted under the non-employee director option grant program are
established by the terms of the Plan. Members of the IGT board of directors
who are not employed by IGT or one of its subsidiaries are not eligible to
receive awards under the Plan except those contemplated by the non-employee
director option grant program.

Acceleration of Awards; Possible Early Termination of Awards
. Unless
before a Change in Control Event the Committee determines that, upon its
occurrence, benefits will not be accelerated, then generally upon the Change in
Control Event each option and stock appreciation right will become immediately
exercisable, restricted stock will vest, and performance-based awards will
become payable. A Change in Control Event under the Plan generally includes
(subject to certain exceptions) certain changes in a majority of the IGT board
of directors, certain mergers or consolidations approved by IGT’s stockholders,
stockholder approval of a liquidation of IGT or sale of substantially all of
IGT’s business and/or assets, or the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of
shares amounting to more than 50% of the combined outstanding shares in IGT by
any “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange
Act).

Termination of or Changes to the Plan
. The authority to grant new awards
under the Plan will terminate on September 21, 2002, unless the IGT board of
directors terminates the Plan before that time. The IGT board of directors may
amend the Plan at any time, except that stockholder approval is required with
respect to amendments

which increase the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan,
materially increase the benefits accruing to participants or materially change
the participation requirements.

Federal Income Tax Consequences

     With respect to nonqualified stock options, the company is generally
entitled to deduct an amount equal to the difference between the option
exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise.
With respect to incentive stock options, the company is generally not entitled
to a similar deduction either upon grant of the option or at the time the
option is exercised. The current federal income tax consequences to the
employee of other awards authorized under the Plan generally follow certain
basic patterns: stock appreciation rights are taxed and deductible in
substantially the same manner as nonqualified stock options; nontransferable
restricted stock subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture results in income
recognition equal to the excess of the fair market value of the stock over the
purchase price only at the time the restrictions lapse (unless the recipient
elects to accelerate recognition as of the date of grant); performance-based
awards generally are subject to tax at the time of payment; and unconditional
stock bonuses are generally subject to tax measured by the value of the payment
received; in each of the foregoing cases, the company will generally have a
corresponding deduction at the time the participant recognizes income. If an
award is accelerated under the Plan, the company may not be permitted to deduct
the portion of the compensation attributable to the acceleration. Furthermore,
if the compensation attributable to awards is not “performance-based” within
the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the company may not be permitted to
deduct such compensation in certain circumstances.

Specific Benefits

     For information regarding options and other awards granted to executive
officers of IGT, see the material under the heading “— Certain Executive
Compensation Information” following this discussion. The stock options that
will be granted to Messrs. Matthew and Murphy if the merger with Anchor is
consummated are described above under “Proposed Amendment to the Plan.” If the
Amendment had been in effect previously, IGT expects that the grants would not
have been substantially different from those described in the sections referred
to above. The grants to Messrs. Matthew and Murphy are not subject to
stockholder approval of the Amendment. The number, amount and type of other
awards to be received by or allocated to eligible persons in the future under
the Plan cannot be determined at this time. At this time, IGT is not
considering any other additional awards under the Plan.

     The IGT board of directors believes that the additional shares to be made
available under the Plan, if stockholders approve the Amendment, will promote
the interests of IGT and its stockholders and continue to enable IGT to
attract, retain and reward persons important to IGT’s success and to provide
incentives based on the attainment of corporate objectives and increases in
stockholder value.

Certain Executive Compensation Information

Compensation of Directors. 
Through December 2000, each non-employee
director received a $12,500 annual fee and a fee of $750 for each committee
meeting attended. Directors who are employees of IGT are not paid fees or
additional remuneration for service as members of the board of directors or its
committees.

     Effective January 2001, non-employee director compensation increased to
$30,000 annually, and the fee for each committee meeting attended increased to
$1,500.

     Each non-employee director receives non-qualified stock options to
purchase 10,000 shares of IGT common stock upon his or her initial election to
the board of directors. Additionally, every year thereafter, each non-employee
director receives non-qualified stock options to purchase 6,000 shares of IGT
common stock upon his re-election to the board. Each non-employee director
received non-qualified stock options to purchase 6,000 shares of IGT common
stock in fiscal 2000 at an exercise price of $18.1875 per share. Robert Miller
received a non-qualified stock option to purchase 10,000 shares of IGT common
stock at an exercise price of $21.6875 when he was appointed to the IGT board
of directors in January 2000.

Summary of Executive Compensation. 
The following table sets forth certain
summary information concerning the compensation paid by IGT for fiscal years
2000, 1999, and 1998, to the persons who held the position of Chief Executive
Officer and the other four most highly compensated executive officers

Employee Incentive Plans

     IGT provides the following employee incentive plans: profit sharing and
401(k) plan, cash sharing, management bonus and non-qualified deferred
compensation. Total annual contributions from operating profits for all plans
were $38.6 million in fiscal 2000, $27.1 million in fiscal 1999 and $26.5
million in fiscal 1998.

     The profit sharing and 401(k) plan was adopted for IGT’s employees working
in the U.S. IGT matches 75% of an employee’s contributions up to $1,000. This
allows for maximum annual company matching contributions of $750 to each
employee’s account. Participants are 100% vested in their contributions and
IGT’s matching contributions. Additionally, IGT shares a portion of its profits
with eligible employees. These profit sharing contributions vest over a seven
year period of employment.

     The cash sharing plan is distributed semi-annually in May and November to
all U.S. employees of IGT. IGT’s foreign subsidiaries have similar programs.
The management bonuses are paid out annually to key employees throughout IGT.

     IGT implemented a non-qualified deferred compensation plan in September
1999 to provide an unfunded incentive compensation arrangement for eligible
management and highly compensated employees. Participants may elect to defer up
to 50% of their annual base salary, 50% of cash sharing, 50% of discretionary
management bonus and 50% of commissions with a minimum deferral of $2,000.
Distributions can be paid out as short-term payments or at retirement.
Retirement benefits can be paid out as a lump sum or in annual installments
over a term of up to 15 years.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

     During fiscal 2000, Messrs. Rentschler and Keating and, until his
retirement from the IGT board of directors on March 6, 2000, Mr. Nelson, served
as members of the Compensation Committee. Governor Miller was appointed to the
Compensation Committee in March 2000 to replace Mr. Nelson. No member of the
Committee is a former or current officer or employee of IGT or any of its
subsidiaries. The functions performed by the Compensation Committee include
oversight of executive compensation, review of IGT’s overall compensation
programs, and administration of certain incentive compensation programs. The
Compensation Committee held five meetings in fiscal 2000.

Employment Agreements

Employment Agreement with G. Thomas Baker. 
G. Thomas Baker was appointed
President of IGT on March 2, 1996 and was appointed Chief Executive Officer of
IGT effective December 6, 2000. IGT entered into a three-year employment
agreement with Mr. Baker in December 2000 providing for an annual base salary
of $650,000 for year one, $700,000 during year two and $750,000 during year
three. In addition, for each one-percent increase in operating profits before
incentives over the previous fiscal year, Mr. Baker will receive a management
bonus equal to 10 percent of his base salary, and he will receive 20 percent of
his base salary for any increase over the prior year in excess of 10 percent.
The bonus calculation will not exceed 300 percent of the base salary. In year
one, the bonus will be paid based on the full 2000-2001 fiscal year without
proration. The bonus will also be payable based upon various management
objectives set by the IGT board of directors in consultation with Mr. Baker.
Mr. Baker is also eligible to participate in IGT’s profit sharing and cash
sharing programs (see “— Employee Incentive Plans” above). Additionally, Mr.
Baker was granted an option to purchase 500,000 shares of common stock of IGT
at a price of $45.00 per share. The stock option vests in three equal
installments upon the first, second and third anniversaries of the award.

Employment Agreement with Robert A. Bittman. 
Robert A. Bittman was
appointed Executive Vice President, Product Development of IGT effective March
18, 1996. IGT entered into a five year employment agreement with Mr. Bittman in
March 1996 providing for an annual base salary of $250,000 and a one-time cash
payment of $150,000, paid upon the commencement of his employment. At the end
of the five year term, Mr. Bitman’s employment will continue at will. Mr.
Bittman is also eligible to receive annual salary increases and is eligible to
participate in IGT’s profit sharing, cash sharing and management bonus plans
(see “— Employee Incentive Plans” above). Additionally, Mr. Bittman was granted
a restricted stock award for 225,000 shares at a price of $.01 per share. The
award vests in three equal installments upon the second, third and fifth
anniversaries of the award. The unvested shares issued to Mr. Bittman are
subject to repurchase by IGT for $.01 per share if Mr. Bittman’s employment
terminates for certain reasons before the vesting of such shares.

Employment Agreement with Maureen Mullarkey. 
Maureen Mullarkey was hired
and entered into an employment agreement on January 12, 2001 and Ms. Mullarkey
was appointed Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of IGT
effective March 2, 2001. IGT entered into a five year employment agreement with
Ms. Mullarkey in January 2001 providing for an annual base salary of $250,000.
At the end of the five year term, Ms. Mullarkey’s employment will continue at
will. Ms. Mullarkey is also eligible to receive annual salary increases and is
eligible to participate in IGT’s profit sharing, cash sharing and management
bonus plans (see “— Employee Incentive Plans” above). Additionally, Ms. Mullarkey was granted an option to purchase 100,000 shares of IGT common stock
at a price of $48.39 per share. The award vests in five equal annual
installments beginning on the first anniversary of the award.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

     Mr. Warren L. Nelson, who retired from IGT’s Board of Directors on March
6, 2000, has an equity interest in a Nevada gaming business from which IGT
recognized revenues of $2.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30,
2000. IGT had contracts and accounts receivable balances from this customer of
$812,716 at September 30, 2000. During the fiscal year ended September 30,
2000, the largest aggregate amount of IGT’s receivable balances from this
customer was $1.3 million. Mr. Nelson is also a director of the parent company
of additional gaming businesses. IGT recognized aggregate revenues from these
businesses of $21.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000. IGT
had aggregate contracts and accounts receivable balances from these businesses
of $3.1 million as of September 30, 2000. During the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2000, the largest aggregate amount of IGT’s receivable balances
from these customers was $3.1 million.

Recommendation of IGT Board of Directors

     The IGT board of directors has unanimously approved and recommends a vote
FOR the proposed Amendment to the Plan as described above. IGT stockholders
should note that because each employee member of the IGT board of directors may
in the future be impacted by the proposed Amendment, such directors may have a
personal interest in the proposal and its approval by stockholders. However,
the members of the IGT board of directors believe that the proposed amendment
to the Plan is in the best interests of IGT and its stockholders.

Approval of the proposed amendment to the Plan requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented, and
entitled to vote, at the IGT special stockholders’ meeting.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus includes and incorporates by
reference statements that are not historical facts. These statements are
“forward-looking statements” (as defined in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995) about, among other things, Anchor, IGT and the companies’
expectations or beliefs concerning future events or future results of
operations. These statements are typically identified by terms indicated
future expectation such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “estimates,”
“intends,” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are
subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and many factors could cause actual
results and events to differ significantly from those discussed in
forward-looking statements, including but not limited to:

•

risks associated with negotiating and documenting a merger transaction;

•

uncertainty of consummating the merger;

•

uncertainty of obtaining stockholder approval;

•

risk of failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, including gaming regulatory approvals;

•

risk of failure to obtain necessary consents from third parties; and

•

uncertainty generally associated with the operation of
the business of IGT and Anchor and in particular, the financial
conditions of the respective companies.

     All forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties
inherent in predictions and forecasts. They are necessarily speculative
statements, and unforeseen factors, such as competitive pressures, changes in
regulatory structure, failure to gain the approval of regulatory authorities,
and changes in customer acceptance of gaming could cause results to differ
materially from any that may be expected. Forward-looking statements are made
in the context of information available as of the date stated. In addition,
events may occur in the future that we are unable to accurately predict or
control and that may cause actual results to differ materially from the
expectations described in the forward-looking statements.

     You should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements
contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. These forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date on which the statements were made. In
evaluating forward-looking statements, you should consider these risks and
uncertainties, together with the other risks described from time to time in our
reports and documents filed with the SEC, and you should not place undue
reliance on those statements.

(the “

with Section 2.1(b), will be converted into the right to receive a certain
number of shares of common stock, $.000625 par value per share, of Parent

     B. The Merger requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock (the “
Company Stockholder

”).

     C. The issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger may require
the approval of the holders of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of the

with the Company Stockholder Approval, the “
Stockholder Approvals
”).

     D. Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to
prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

     E. For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a reorganization with the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “
Code
”).

     F. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a
condition and inducement to Parent’s willingness to enter into this Agreement,
the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer – Gaming
Operations shall have each entered into a Voting Agreement (the “

”) with Parent in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto.

the parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment to this
Agreement in order to reflect the foregoing change.

1.9

and on behalf of Sub or the Company, all such deeds, bills of sale,
assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of Sub or the Company, all such other actions and things as

all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to
carry out this Agreement.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE

CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

2.1

Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Sub, the
Company or the holders of any shares of Company Common Stock or any
shares of capital stock of Sub:

A-2

(a)

Capital Stock of Sub. Each share of the capital stock
of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b)

Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock.
Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company
or by any subsidiary of the Company and each share of Company
Common Stock that is owned by Parent, Sub or any other subsidiary
of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be cancelled and retired without any conversion
thereof and no consideration shall be delivered with respect
thereto.

(c)

Conversion of Common Stock.

(i)

Each share of the Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time, other than shares to be
cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b), shall be
converted, subject to Section 2.2(d), into one share of Parent
Common Stock (the “
Exchange Ratio
”), subject to adjustment as
provided for in this Section 2.1(c)(i). The Exchange Ratio
shall not be adjusted if the Share Value (as defined below) is
equal to or greater than $50.00, but not greater than $75.00.
If the Share Value is greater than $75.00, and Parent notifies
the Company in writing of its election to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(j), the Company shall have
the option in its sole and absolute discretion, but not the
obligation, to adjust the Exchange Ratio to be equal to the
quotient of (a) $75.00 divided by (b) the Share Value. If the
Share Value is greater than $75.00, and if Parent does not
elect to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(j),
the Exchange Ratio shall remain unchanged. If the Share Value
is less than $50.00, and the Company notifies Parent in
writing its election to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(h) hereof, Parent shall have the option in its
sole and absolute discretion, but not the obligation, to
adjust the Exchange Ratio to be equal to the quotient of (c)
$50.00, divided by (d) the Share Value, and the Company shall
be obligated to accept such adjustment. If the Share Value is
less than $50.00, and if the Company does not elect to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h), the
Exchange Ratio shall be unchanged.

For purposes hereof, the “Share Value” shall be an amount
equal to the average closing price for the Parent Common Stock
as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the twenty (20)
consecutive trading days ending on the third business day
preceding the date of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting (as
defined in Section 5.1(d)), so long as the Closing Date occurs
within five business days of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting
or, if the Closing Date is more than five business days after
the Company Stockholders’ Meeting, the date that is the third
business day preceding the Closing Date. For example, if the
Company’s Stockholders’ Meeting is on a Wednesday and the
Closing Date is less than five business days after that date,
the last date of the measurement period would be the preceding
Friday, assuming that each of the interim days and the Friday
were business days.

(ii)

If, prior to the Effective Time, Parent should
split or combine the Parent Common Stock, or pay a stock
dividend or other stock distribution in Parent Common Stock,
or if the Parent Common Stock is altered or adjusted in any
reclassification, recapitalization or similar transaction,
then the Exchange Ratio will be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such split, combination, dividend or other
distribution or reclassification, recapitalization or similar
transaction.

(iii)

As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be converted and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each certificate previously representing any such
shares shall thereafter represent the right to receive a
certificate representing the shares of Parent Common Stock
into which such Company Common Stock was converted in the
Merger. The holders of such certificates

A-3

previously evidencing such shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time except as
otherwise provided herein or by law. Such certificates
previously representing shares of Company Common Stock shall
be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such certificates in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.2, without interest. No fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued and, in lieu
thereof, a cash payment shall be made pursuant to Section
2.2(d).

(iv)

The Company represents and warrants that the
holders of the Company Common Stock are not entitled to
“dissenters” rights under applicable law or under the articles
of incorporation of the Company.

2.2

Exchange of Certificates.

(a)

Exchange Procedure. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with a bank or trust company designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to Company (the “
Exchange
Agent
”) for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for exchange
in accordance with this Section 2.2, through the Exchange Agent,
(i) certificates evidencing the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) in exchange for outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) cash in an aggregate
amount sufficient to pay for fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.2(d). Any interest, dividends, or other income earned
on the investment of cash or other property deposited by Parent
with the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 2.2 shall
be for the account of and payable to Parent. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time but in any event
no later than 10 days after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the
“
Certificates
”), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in
customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent),
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of
Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate evidencing that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced
by such Certificate (after taking into account all shares of
Company Common Stock then held of record by such holder), cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(d) and any dividends
or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 2.2(b), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper
number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a person
other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer,
shall be properly endorsed with signature guarantee or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish
to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the certificate evidencing whole shares of Parent
Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.2
(d) and any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b). No interest will
be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section
2.2(b) or 2.2(d).

A-4

(b)

Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
Section 2.2(d), in each case until the surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the
effect of applicable escheat laws, following surrender of such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of any such cash payable in lieu of a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(d) and the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

(c)

No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.
All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Article II (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or
2.2(d)) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates,
subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation’s obligation to
pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or
made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date
of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time
and have not been paid prior to surrender. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed,
and there shall be no further registrations of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the
Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

(d)

No Fractional Shares.

(i)

No Certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional
share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any rights of a stockholder of Parent.

(ii)

Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding at the Effective Time who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent
Common Stock upon surrender of stock certificates for exchange
pursuant to this Article II (after taking into account all
shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash in an amount equal to the value
of such fractional shares, which shall be equal to the
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock that would
otherwise be issued multiplied by the closing price of
Parent’s Common Stock on the Closing Date as reported in The
Wall Street Journal.

(iii)

As soon as practicable after the determination

 No Inconsistent Activities.

(a)

In light of the consideration given by the Board of
Directors of the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement
to, among other things, the transactions contemplated hereby, and
in light of the Company’s representations contained in Section
3.1(j), the Company agrees that it shall not, nor shall it permit
any of its subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any
officer, director or employee of, or any investment banker,
attorney or other advisor or representative of, the Company or
any of its subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, solicit or
initiate, or encourage the submission of, any Takeover Proposal
(as defined below), or participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public
information with respect to, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Takeover Proposal, provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 4.2 shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors
from furnishing nonpublic information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, another person in connection
with an unsolicited bona fide written proposal for a Takeover
Proposal by such person, if and only to the extent that (i) such
person has made a written proposal to the Board of Directors of
the Company to consummate a Takeover Proposal, which proposal
identifies a price or range of values to be paid for the
outstanding securities or all or substantially all of the assets
of the Company, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such Takeover
Proposal is reasonably capable of being completed on
substantially the terms proposed (which determination shall
include confirmation that the party making the Takeover Proposal
will have any funds necessary to complete the Takeover Proposal)
and such Takeover Proposal would, if so completed, result in at
transaction that would provide greater value to the holders of
Company Common Stock than the Merger (a “
Superior
Proposal
”),
(iii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, based on the advice of its outside legal counsel, that
such action is necessary in order to comply with its fiduciary
duties to the holders of Company Common Stock under applicable
law, and (iv) before furnishing such nonpublic information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person, the
Board of Directors receives from such person an executed
confidentiality agreement in form and substance substantially
similar to the confidentiality agreement dated June 21, 2001
between the Company and Parent (the “Confidentiality Agreement”).

(b)

The Company shall notify Parent orally and in writing
of any inquiries, offers or proposals with respect to a Takeover
Proposal (including without limitation the terms and conditions
of such proposal, the identity of the person or entity making it
and all other information reasonably requested by Parent), within
48 hours of the receipt thereof, shall keep Parent informed of
the status and details of any such inquiry, offer or proposal and
answer Parent’s questions with respect thereto. For purposes of
this Agreement, “
Takeover Proposal
” means any proposal (whether
or not in writing and whether or not delivered to the Company’s
stockholders generally) for a merger, consolidation, purchase of
assets, tender offer or other business combination involving the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to
acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, an equity interest
in, 10% or more of the voting securities of, or a substantial
portion of the assets of, the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall directly or
indirectly, release any third party from any confidentiality
agreement. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the Company
from disclosing to its stockholders the statement required by
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act with respect to a Takeover
Proposal by means of a tender offer.

(c)

Parent agrees that prior to the Closing Date it shall
not (i) consolidate with or merge into any other person whereby
Parent is not or would not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity and ultimate parent entity (as that term is
used under the HSR Act and related rules) of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any

A-23

person, unless, in each such case, such person acknowledges that
the surviving entity shall continue to be bound by all obligations
of Parent under this Agreement.

provided
, 
however
, that Parent shall
not be obligated to take any action pursuant to the foregoing if

Parent, in the good faith judgment of Parent, inadvisable the

(i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this

Nothing in this Section 5.4(a) shall obligate Parent to take any
action which would require the voluntary surrender, forfeiture or

and who is denied a Gaming Approval, disqualified from eligibility

Entity before the Closing Date (ii) whose continued involvement in

continuing interest in the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Sub
or Parent in any Gaming Approval granted by a Governmental Entity

(a)

As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Stock Option Plan
(as defined below)) shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other actions as are required to adjust the terms of all
outstanding stock options to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock (“
Stock Options
”) heretofore granted under any stock option
or stock appreciation rights plan, program or arrangement of the
Company or under any stock option award agreement, including,
without limitation, the Company’s 1995 Employee Stock Option Plan
and the Company’s 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the
“
Stock Option Plan
”) as is necessary to provide that each Stock
Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not then exercisable, shall be immediately converted
as of the Effective Time into the right to purchase from Parent
the Option Conversion Number (as defined below) of shares of
Parent Common Stock (each an “
Adjusted Option
”).

Each Adjusted Option will have the same terms as the Stock Option
to which it is related, which Stock Option shall remain exercisable
following the Effective Time in accordance with its terms and the
provisions of the Stock Option Plan or agreement under which
granted, except for its exercise price and the number and kind of
shares subject thereto. The exercise price of any Adjusted Option
(the “
Adjusted Exercise Price
”) shall be an amount equal to the
exercise price of the Stock Option related to such Adjusted Option
as of the date of this Agreement divided by the Exchange Ratio.
The “
Option Conversion Number
” for any Adjusted Option shall be
equal to the number of shares purchasable pursuant to the Stock
Option related to such Adjusted Option as of the date of this
Agreement multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest
whole.

(b)

As an inducement to cause the Company to enter into
this Agreement, Parent agrees to take such actions as are
necessary, for the conversion of the Stock Options of the Company
pursuant to Section 5.5(a) into Adjusted Options, including the
reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Common Stock as is
necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by Section
5.5(a). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent agrees to file
a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or a
post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 covering the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued under the Adjusted Options
described above.

(c)

Parent covenants and agrees: (i) it will take all
reasonably necessary board action so that all securities

issued in a transaction exempted under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange
Act; and (ii) for a period of one year from the Effective Time,
Parent will cause to be available adequate current public
information with respect to the Parent within the meaning of Rule
144(c) under the Securities Act. Parent hereby represents,
warrants and agrees that purchases or sales of securities

A-27

under the Exchange Act are exempt from any policy of, or
restriction imposed by, Parent regulating the purchase or sale of
its securities.

 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

(a)

The articles of incorporation and the by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect

favorable than the provisions set forth in the Company’s articles
of incorporation and by-laws on the date of this Agreement, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals
who on or prior to the Effective Time were directors, officers,
employees or agents of the Company or its Subsidiaries and were
entitled to indemnification under the Company’s articles of
incorporation and bylaws, unless such modification is required by
law.

(b)

For six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain in effect directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
covering those persons who are currently covered by the Company’s
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy (a copy of
which has been heretofore delivered to Parent) on terms no less
favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage;

provided
, 
however
, that (i) in lieu of the purchase of such
insurance by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, the Company,
with Parent’s written consent, may purchase a five-year extended
reporting period endorsement (“reporting tail coverage”) under
its existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
coverage and (ii) if the cost of such insurance in any year
during such six-year period shall exceed 150% of the premium cost
for such policy during the year ended June 30, 2000 (the “
Maximum
Premium
”), then Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
and the Surviving Corporation shall, provide coverage affording
the same protection as maintained by Parent as of such date for
its officers and directors. The Company represents to Parent
that the Maximum Premium is $280,000.

(c)

In addition to the other rights provided for in this
Section 5.6, for six years after the Effective Time, Parent
hereby, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
guaranties the obligations of the Company under Section 5.6 (a)
for the directors and executive officers which are identified in
Section 5.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Parent
unconditionally and irrevocably waives any provision under
applicable law that may limit the enforceability of such
guaranty.

(d)

The obligations of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent contained in this Section 5.6 shall be
binding on the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to
any person, then and in each such case, proper provisions shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.6.

5.7

 Letters of Accountants.

(a)

The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent “comfort” letters of
Deloitte & Touche, the Company’s independent public accountants,

Parent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent

Fees and Expenses. Except as provided in Section 7.5,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such

including the filing fee paid to the SEC, and the HSR Act filing fee
will be shared equally by Parent and the Company.

5.9

prepared and reflect the best currently available estimates of the future
financial results and condition of the Company, Anchor Gaming, and the combined
company, and that there has been no material change in the assets, financial
condition, business or prospects of the Company, Anchor Gaming, or the combined
company since the date of the most recent financial statements made available
to us.

     We have not independently verified the accuracy and completeness of the
information supplied to us with respect to the Company or Anchor Gaming and do
not assume any responsibility with respect to it. We have not made any
physical inspection or independent appraisal of any of the properties or assets
of Anchor Gaming or the Company. Our opinion is necessarily based on business,
economic, market and other conditions as they exist and can be evaluated by us
at the date of this letter.

     Based upon the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, it is our opinion that
the consideration to be received by the Company in connection with the
Transaction is fair to the Company from a financial point of view.

     This Opinion is furnished solely for your benefit and may not be relied
upon by any other person without our express, prior written consent. This
Opinion is delivered to each recipient subject to the conditions, scope of
engagement, limitations and understandings set forth in this Opinion and our
engagement letter, and subject to the understanding that the obligations of

ANNEX C

OPINION OF DRESDNER KLEINWORT WASSERSTEIN

July 8, 2001

Board of Directors of Anchor Gaming

815 Pilot Road, Suite G

Las Vegas, Nevada 89119

Members of the Board:

     You have asked us to advise you with respect to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the stockholders of Anchor Gaming (the “Company”)
of the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) provided for pursuant to the terms of
the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 8, 2001 (the “Merger
Agreement”), among the Company, International Game Technology (“Parent”) and
NAC Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Sub”). The Merger
Agreement provides for, among other things, a merger of Sub with and into the
Company (the “Merger”) pursuant to which each outstanding share of common
stock, par value $0.005 per share, of the Company (other than any such shares
held in the treasury of the Company or owned by Parent, Sub or their respective
subsidiaries) will be converted into one share of common stock, par value
$0.000625 per share, of Parent (the “Exchange Ratio”). The terms and
conditions of the Merger are set forth in more detail in the Merger Agreement.

     In connection with rendering our opinion, we have reviewed a draft of the
Merger Agreement, and for purposes hereof, we have assumed that the final form
of this document will not differ in any material respect from the draft
provided to us. We have also reviewed and analyzed certain publicly available
business and financial information relating to the Company and Parent for
recent years and interim periods to date, as well as certain internal financial
and operating information, including financial forecasts, analyses and
projections prepared by or on behalf of the Company and Parent and provided to
us for purposes of our analysis, and we have met with management of the Company
and Parent to review and discuss such information and, among other matters,
each of the Company’s and Parent’s business, operations, assets, financial
condition and future prospects.

     We have reviewed and considered certain financial and stock market data
relating to the Company and Parent, and we have compared that data with similar
data for certain other companies, the securities of which are publicly traded,
that we believe may be relevant or comparable in certain respects to the
Company and Parent or one or more of their respective businesses or assets, and
we have reviewed and considered the financial terms of certain recent
acquisitions and business combination transactions in the gaming equipment
industry specifically, and in other industries generally, that we believe to be
reasonably comparable to the Merger or otherwise relevant to our inquiry. We
have also performed such other financial studies, analyses, and investigations
and reviewed such other information as we considered appropriate for purposes
of this opinion.

     In our review and analysis and in formulating our opinion, we have assumed
and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the historical
financial and other information provided to or discussed with us or publicly
available, and we have not assumed any responsibility for independent
verification of any of such information. We have also assumed and relied upon
the reasonableness and accuracy of the financial projections, forecasts and
analyses provided to us, and we have assumed that such projections, forecasts
and analyses were reasonably prepared in good faith and on bases reflecting the
best currently available judgments and estimates of the Company’s and Parent’s
management. We express no opinion with respect to such projections, forecasts
and analyses or the assumptions upon which they are based. In addition, we
have not reviewed any of the books and records of the Company or Parent, or
assumed any responsibility for conducting a physical inspection of the
properties or facilities of the Company or Parent, or for making or obtaining
an independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the
Company or Parent, and no such independent valuation or appraisal was provided
to us. In rendering our opinion, we have placed significant reliance on the
fact that the Company derives a substantial portion

C-1

Page 2

of its cash flow from its joint venture with Parent. We note that the
Merger is intended to qualify as a tax free reorganization for United States
Federal tax purposes, and we have assumed that the Merger will so qualify. We
also have assumed that obtaining all regulatory and other approvals and third
party consents required for consummation of the Merger will not have an adverse
impact on the Company or Parent or on the anticipated benefits of the Merger,
and we have assumed that the transactions described in the Merger Agreement
will be consummated without waiver or modification of any of the material terms
or conditions contained therein by any party thereto. Our opinion is
necessarily based on economic and market conditions and other circumstances as
they exist and can be evaluated by us as of the date hereof. We are not
expressing any opinion herein as to the prices at which any securities of
Parent or the Company will actually trade at any time.

     It should be noted that in the context of our engagement by the Company,
we were not authorized to and did not solicit third party indications of
interest in acquiring all or any part of the Company, or investigate any
alternative transactions that may be available to the Company.

     In the ordinary course of our business, we may actively trade the debt and
equity securities of the Company and Parent for our own account and for the
accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position in such securities.

     We are acting as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the
proposed Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a significant portion
of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, we
have performed various investment banking services for the Company from time to
time in the past and have received customary fees for rendering such services.

     Our opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to
the stockholders of the Company of the Exchange Ratio provided for pursuant to
the Merger Agreement, and we do not express any views on any other term of the
Merger. Specifically, our opinion does not address the Company’s underlying
business decision to effect the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.

     It is understood that this letter is for the benefit and use of the Board
of Directors of the Company in its consideration of the Merger and except for
inclusion in its entirety in any registration statement or proxy statement
required to be circulated to stockholders of the Company relating to the
Merger, may not be quoted, referred to or reproduced at any time or in any
manner without our prior written consent. This opinion does not constitute a
recommendation to any stockholder or as to how such holder should vote with
respect to the Merger, and should not be relied upon by any stockholder as
such.

     Based upon and subject to the foregoing, including the various assumptions
and limitations set forth herein, it is our opinion that as of the date hereof
the Exchange Ratio provided for pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair to the
stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view.

Very truly yours,

DRESDNER KLEINWORT WASSERSTEIN, INC.

PART II

INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS

ITEM 20. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.

     Subsection 1 of Section 78.7502 of the Nevada General Corporation Law (the
“Nevada Law”) empowers a corporation to indemnify any person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation)
by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent
of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or other
enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he is not liable
pursuant to Section 78.138 of the Nevada Law or if he acted in good faith and
in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was
unlawful. Section 78.128 of the Nevada Law provides that, with
certain exceptions, a director or officer is not individually liable
to the corporation or its stockholders for any damages as a result of
any act or failure to act in his capacity as a director or officer
unless it is proven that (i) his act or failure to act
constituted a breach of his fiduciary duties as a director or office,
and (ii) his breach of those duties involved intentional
misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law.

     Subsection 2 of Section 78.7502 empowers a corporation to indemnify any
person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the
corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such
person acted in any of the capacities set forth above against expenses,
including amounts paid in settlement and attorneys’ fees actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such
action or suit if he acted under similar standards, except that no
indemnification may be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to
which such person shall have been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be liable to the corporation or for amounts paid in settlement to the
corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action
or suit was brought determines that, despite the adjudication of liability,
such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as
the court deems proper.

     Section 78.7502 further provides that to the extent a director or officer
of a corporation has been successful in the defense of any action, suit or
proceeding referred to in subsections (1) and (2), or in the defense of any
claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses
(including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection therewith. Section 78.751 of the Nevada Law provides that the
indemnification provided for by Section 78.7502 shall not be deemed exclusive
or exclude any other rights to which the indemnified party may be entitled and
that the scope of indemnification shall continue as to directors, officers,
employees or agents who have ceased to hold such positions, and to their heirs,
executors and administrators. Section 78.752 of the Nevada Law empowers the
corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of a director,
officer, employee or agent of the corporation against any liability asserted
against him or incurred by him in any such capacity or arising out of his
status as such whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify
him against such liabilities under Section 78.7502.

     Section 4.10 of the Bylaws of the Registrant provides for indemnification
of its officers and directors, substantially identical in scope to that
permitted under the above Sections of the Nevada Law. The Bylaws provide,
pursuant to Subsection 2 of Section 78.751, that the expenses of officers and
directors incurred in defending any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil
or criminal, must be paid by the corporation as they are incurred and in
advance of the final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding, upon
delivery, if required by Nevada law, of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
director or officer to repay all amounts so advanced if it is ultimately
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the officer or director is
not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation. The Registrant also enters
into indemnification agreements consistent with Nevada law with certain of its
directors and officers.

ITEM 22. UNDERTAKINGS.

(a)

The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:

(1)

To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being
made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:

(i)

To include any prospectus required by Section
10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;

(ii)

To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events
arising after the effective date of the registration statement
(or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which,
individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental
change in the information set forth in the registration
statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or
decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar
value of securities offered would not exceed that which was
registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the
estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form
of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule
424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price
represent no more than 20 percent change in the maximum
aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of
Registration Fee” table in the effective registration
statement; and

(iii)

To include any material information with respect
to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the
registration statement or any material change to such
information in the registration statement.

II-2

(2)

That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the
Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be
deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities
offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time
shall be deemed to be the initial 
bona fide 
offering thereof.

(3)

To remove from registration by means of a post-effective
amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold
at the termination of the offering.

The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of
determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing
of the registrant’s annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing
of an employee benefit plan’s annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in
the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration
statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of
such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial 
bona fide

offering thereof.

The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes as follows: that prior to
any public reoffering of the securities registered hereunder through use
of a prospectus which is a part of this registration statement, by any
person or party who is deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of
Rule 145(c), the issuer undertakes that such reoffering prospectus will
contain the information called for by the applicable registration form
with respect to reofferings by persons who may be deemed underwriters, in
addition to the information called for by the other items of the
applicable form.

The registrant undertakes that every prospectus: (i) that is filed
pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph, or (ii) that purports to
meet the requirements of Section 10(a)(3) of the Act and is used in
connection with an offering of securities subject to Rule 415, will be
filed as a part of an amendment to the registration statement and will
not be used until such amendment is effective, and that, for purposes of
determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such
post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration
statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of
such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial 
bona fide

offering thereof.

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling
persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or
otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public
policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the
event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other
than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a
director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such
director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities
being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its
counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a
court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act
and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

(b)

The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to respond to requests for
information that is incorporated by reference into the prospectus pursuant
to Item 4, 10(b), 11 or 13 of this form, within one business day of
receipt of such request, and to send the incorporated documents by first
class mail or other equally prompt means. This includes information
contained in documents filed subsequent to the effective date of the
registration statement through the date of responding to the request.

The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to supply by means of a
post-effective amendment all information concerning a transaction, and
the company being acquired involved therein, that was not the subject of
and included in the registration statement when it became effective.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     At your request, I have examined the Registration Statement on Form S-4 to
be filed by you with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with
the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of shares of
Common Stock, par value $0.000625 per share (the “Common Stock”), of
International Game Technology (“IGT”). I am familiar with the proceedings
taken and proposed to be taken by you in connection with the authorization and
proposed issuance and sale of the Common Stock pursuant to the Agreement and

     It is my opinion that, subject to said proceedings being duly taken and
completed by you as now contemplated prior to the issuance of the IGT Shares,
the IGT Shares will, upon issuance and sale thereof in the manner referred to
in the Registration Statement, be legally and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable stock.

     I consent to the use of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration

Re:   
Merger of Anchor Gaming

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     You have requested our opinion regarding the material federal income tax
consequences of the proposed reorganization (the “
Reorganization
”) involving
the exchange of stock of Anchor Gaming, a Nevada corporation
(“
Target
”), for
stock of International Game Technology, a Nevada corporation (“
Acquiror
”), in a
statutory merger of NAC Corporation, a Nevada corporation (“
Merger Sub
”) and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror, with and into Target with Target to be the
surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror in a
transaction (the “
Merger
”) intended to qualify as a reorganization under
Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“
Code
”).

     In connection with this opinion, we have examined such documents and
matters of law and fact as we have considered appropriate, including (i) the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 8, 2001 (the “
Agreement
”); and
(ii) the Certificates provided by Target and Acquiror to the undersigned (the
“
Certificates
”) on the date hereof, as attached hereto. In connection with
this opinion, we are assuming that the representations made by Target and
Acquiror in the Agreement and in the Certificates are true and correct as of
the date of this opinion, and we are relying on each of such representations.
In addition, with your consent, we have assumed or obtained representations
(and are relying thereon, without any independent investigation or review
thereof) that (a) original documents (including signatures) are authentic,
documents submitted to us as copies conform to the original documents, and
there has been (or will be by the Effective Time of the Merger, as defined in
the Agreement) due execution and delivery of all documents where due execution
and delivery are prerequisites to effectiveness thereof, and (b) the Merger
will be effective under the laws of the State of Nevada.

Opinion

     Based on the foregoing, and our review and analysis of the current state
of the law, it is our opinion that the Reorganization will be treated for
federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a)(1) of the Code; that Target, Acquiror and Merger Sub will each be a
party to such reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code;
and that neither Acquiror nor Merger Sub will recognize gain or loss on the
exchange of the stock of Target for the stock of Acquiror.

     This opinion is limited to the tax matters specifically covered herein,
and we have not been asked to address, nor have we addressed, any other tax
consequences of the Reorganization. The opinion herein is based on current
authorities and upon facts and assumptions as of the date of this opinion. It
is subject to change in the event

 All references to Sections are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

of a change in the applicable law or change in the interpretation of such
law by the courts or by the Internal Revenue Service, or a change in any of the

Las Vegas, Nevada 89119-3739

Ladies & Gentlemen:

     You have requested our opinion regarding certain federal income tax
consequences of the merger (the “Merger”) of NAC Corporation, a Nevada
corporation (“Merger Sub”) and a wholly owned subsidiary of International Game
Technology, a Nevada corporation (“Acquiror”), with and into Anchor Gaming, a
Nevada corporation (“Target”).

     In formulating our opinion, we have examined such documents as we have
deemed appropriate, including the Agreement and Plan of Merger among Acquiror,
Merger Sub and Target dated as of July 8, 2001 (the “Merger Agreement”), and
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus of Acquiror and Target dated      ,
2001 (the “Proxy Statement/Prospectus”). In addition, we have obtained such
additional information as we have deemed relevant and necessary through
consultation with various officers and representatives of Acquiror and Target.

     Our opinion set forth below assumes (1) the accuracy of the statements and
facts concerning the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement (including,
without limitation, the exhibits thereto) and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
(2) the consummation of the Merger in the manner contemplated by, and in
accordance with the terms set forth in, the Merger Agreement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and (3) the accuracy of (i) the representations made by
Acquiror, which are set forth in the Officer’s Certificate delivered to us by
Acquiror, dated the date hereof, and (ii) the representations made by Target,
which are set forth in the Officer’s Certificate delivered to us by Target,
dated the date hereof.

     Based upon the facts and statements set forth above, our examination and
review of the documents referred to above and subject to the assumptions set
forth above, we are of the opinion that for federal income tax purposes the
Merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). We express no
opinion concerning any tax consequences of the Merger other than those
specifically set forth herein.

     Our opinion is based on current provisions of the Code, the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, published pronouncements of the Internal
Revenue Service and case law, any of which may be changed at any time with
retroactive effect. Any change in applicable laws or facts and circumstances
surrounding the Merger, or any inaccuracy in the statements, facts, assumptions
and representations on which we have relied, may adversely affect the
continuing validity of the opinion set forth herein. We assume no
responsibility to inform you of any change or inaccuracy that may occur or come
to our attention.

     This opinion has been delivered to you for the purposes set forth in
Section 6.1(f) of the Merger Agreement and for the purpose of inclusion as an
Exhibit to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. This opinion may not be distributed
or otherwise made available to any other person or entity without prior written
consent; however, we

consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and to the reference to Hughes & Luce, L.L.P. under the
caption “LEGAL MATTERS” in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

Very truly yours,

THIS AGREEMENT

WHEREAS
, Executive is currently employed by South; and

WHEREAS
, the Company (which for purposes of this Agreement shall include

Agreement, become a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the

be critical to South’s success; and

WHEREAS
, the Company considers it important and in its best interest to
foster the employment of key management personnel and desires to retain the
services of Executive on the terms and subject to the conditions in this
Agreement; and

WHEREAS
, the Executive desires to continue employment by South after the
Merger and to render services to the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE
, in consideration of the premises and the respective
undertakings of the parties set forth below, parties hereby agree as follows:

     1.     
Employment
. The Company hereby employs Executive in the position of

Executive will have all necessary powers to discharge his duties and
responsibilities, which will include responsibilities for matters as Chief
Operating Officer of the Company and general oversight of the affairs of South
and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates; consultation as needed with officers,
managers, employees and other personnel of South and the Company; and such
other duties as the Chief Executive Officer and/or Board of Directors of the
Company may reasonably assign, consistent with duties typically assigned to
employees who hold positions similar to that of Executive.

          2.2 During the Term of this Agreement and except as provided below,
Executive will perform to the best of his abilities all duties assigned to him
hereunder, will devote substantially all of his primary business time,
attention and effort to the affairs of South and the Company, and will use his
reasonable best efforts to promote the interests of South and the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement, Executive may
engage in reasonable charitable, civic or community activities.

          2.3 Executive warrants that he has obtained and possesses, or will obtain
and possess, and will maintain through the Term of this Agreement, all
licenses, approvals, permits and authorizations (the “Licenses”) necessary to
perform Executive’s duties hereunder, including without limitation, any
licenses required by any state, county, Native American Tribe or other agency
having jurisdiction to regulate gaming, lotteries, liquor or the activities
undertaken by the Company or South. Any costs, attorneys’ fees, investigation
fees or other expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such Licenses will
be borne by the Company. Executive warrants that he is

fully eligible, under all standards and requirements, to obtain or possess
such licenses and that Executive will commit no acts during the Term or any
extension thereof that would jeopardize or eliminate his ability to possess or
maintain such licenses.

          2.4 Executive agrees to submit to drug testing in accordance with the
Company’s policy and to execute the Company’s standard consent form.

     3.     
Term
. The Executive’s employment pursuant to this Agreement shall
commence upon the Effective Time of the Merger as defined in Section 1.3 of the
Merger Agreement (the “Effective Date”), and continue therefrom through and
until October 16, 2004 (the “Term”). Upon the effectiveness of this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 3, this Agreement will supersede all previous
employment agreements by and between South and Executive, including without
limitation that certain Employment Agreement between South and Executive dated
as of October 17, 2000 (the “Prior Agreement”). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms thereof, this
Agreement shall, from the date of termination of the Merger Agreement forward,
be of no further force or effect, and the Prior Agreement shall remain in force
pursuant to the terms and conditions of such Prior Agreement.

     4.     
Compensation
.

          4.1 
Base Salary
. As compensation in full for the services to be rendered
by Executive under this Agreement during the Term, the Company shall pay to
Executive a base salary of Four Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($450,000.00)
per year (“Base Salary”), which Base Salary shall be paid in accordance with
the Company’s normal payroll policies and procedures.

          4.2 
Bonus
. Executive will be eligible to participate in the Company’s
management bonus program, and the bonus calculation shall not exceed 200
percent (200%) of the Executive’s Base Salary in effect as of the end of the
Company’s fiscal year upon which the bonus is based. The bonus will be payable
based upon the increase in operating profits before incentives over the
previous fiscal year, attainment of the Company’s fiscal year ERP program
goals, and various management objectives set by the Chief Executive Officer of
the Company in consultation with Executive. For each year that a bonus is
granted, the amount greater than 165 percent of Base Salary will be accrued,
and payment deferred (the “Deferred Bonus”) for two years. For example, the
Deferred Bonus for year one would be paid in year three, the Deferred Bonus for
year two, if any would be paid in year four and so on, so long as Executive
remains with the Company. If the Company decides not to continue Executive’s
employment at the end of the Term or pursuant to Paragraph 8.5 below, all
Deferred Bonus amounts would be due and payable at that time.

          4.3 
Participation in Benefit Plan
. Executive shall be entitled to
participate in all employee benefit plans or programs of the Company to the
extent that his position, title, tenure, salary, age, health and other
qualifications make him eligible to participate in accordance with the terms of
the applicable plans or programs. The Company does not guarantee the adoption
or continuance of any particular employee benefit plan or program during the
Term, and the Executive’s participation in any such plan or program shall be
subject to the provisions, rules and regulations applicable thereto.

          4.4 
Stock Options
. Concurrent with the Effective Date of this Agreement,
the Company shall grant to Executive an option to purchase 500,000 shares of
common stock of the Company at an exercise price equal to the closing trading
price of the Company’s common stock on the Effective Date, such grant to be
governed by the provisions of the Company’s 1993 Stock Option Plan, as amended
(the “Stock Option”). One-fifth (1/5) of the Stock Option will vest on each of
the first five (5) anniversaries of the Effective Date.

          4.5

under this Agreement, all federal, state, city or other taxes as shall be
required to be withheld pursuant to any law or governmental regulation or
ruling.

     5.

. Except as permitted or directed by the
Company’s Board of Directors or required by an order of a court having
jurisdiction or under subpoena from an appropriate government agency, during
the Term or at any time thereafter, Executive shall not divulge, furnish or
make accessible to anyone or use in

any way other than in the ordinary course of the business of the Company (which
shall, for purposes of this paragraph, include the Company’s subsidiaries and
affiliates, before and after the Merger) any confidential or secret knowledge
or information of the Company, which Executive has acquired or become
acquainted with or will acquire or become acquainted with prior to the
termination of the period of his employment by the Company (including

formulae, plans, devices or material (whether or not patented or patentable)
directly or indirectly useful in any aspect of the business of the Company, any
customer or supplier lists of the Company, any confidential or secret
development or research work of the Company, or any other confidential
information or secret aspects of the business of the Company. Executive
acknowledges that the above-described knowledge or information constitutes a
unique and valuable asset of the Company and represents a substantial
investment of time and expense by the Company, and that any disclosure or other
use of such knowledge or information other than for the sole benefit of the
Company would be wrongful and would cause irreparable harm to the Company.
Both during and after the Term, Executive shall refrain from any acts or
omissions that would reduce the value of such knowledge or information to the
Company. The foregoing obligations of confidentiality, however, shall not
apply to any knowledge or information which is now published or which
subsequently becomes generally publicly known, other than as a direct or
indirect result of the breach of this Agreement by Executive.

     6.     
Ventures

Company, its subsidiaries and/or affiliates, as applicable. Except as approved
by the Board of Directors of the Company, Executive shall not be entitled to
any interest in such project, program or venture or to any commission, finder’s
fee or other compensation in connection therewith other than the compensation
to be paid by Executive as provided in this Agreement.

in business during the Term.

approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, hire, solicit or endeavor to
entice away from the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, or, following
termination of Executive’s employment, otherwise interfere with the
relationship of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates with any

Interest” or “Change of Control” shall be defined as a transfer of ownership of

paragraph 4.4 above shall have their vesting accelerated in full so as to

     9.     
Miscellaneous

      9.1 
Entire Agreement
. This Agreement, and the agreements in the forms of
exhibits attached hereto, constitute the entire agreement and understanding
between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede and
preempt any prior written or prior or contemporaneous oral understandings,
agreements or representations by or between the parties, written or oral, which
may have related in any manner to the subject matter hereof, including the
Prior Agreement, and the parties hereto have made no agreements,
representations or warranties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
which are not set forth herein. Executive hereby acknowledges and confirms
that the Prior Agreement shall terminate as of the Effective Date, without any
requirement or obligation that the Company or South make any payments to
Executive in connection with such termination or as a result of the Merger, and
Executive hereby releases the Company and South of all of their obligations of
any kind thereunder.

          9.2 
Governing Law
. This Agreement and all rights and obligations
hereunder, including without limitation matters of construction, validity and
performance, is made under and shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the internal laws of the State of Nevada, without regard to principles of
conflict of laws.

          9.3 
Amendments
. No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be
deemed effective unless made in writing and signed by all of the parties
hereto.

          9.4 
No Waiver
. No term or condition of this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been waived, nor shall there be any estoppel to enforce any provisions of
this Agreement, except by a statement in writing signed by the party against
whom enforcement of the waiver or estoppel is sought. Any written waiver shall
not be deemed a continuing waiver unless specifically stated, shall operate
only as to the specific term or condition waived and shall not constitute a
waiver of such term or condition for the future or as to any act other than
that specifically waived.

          9.5 
Severability
. To the extent any provision of this Agreement shall be
invalid or unenforceable, it shall be considered deleted herefrom and the
remainder of such provision and of this Agreement shall be unaffected and shall
continue in full force and effect. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, should the duration or geographical extent of, or business
activities covered by, any provision of this Agreement be in excess of that
which is valid and enforceable under applicable law, then such provision shall
be construed to cover only that duration, extent or activities which may
validly and enforceably be covered. Executive acknowledges the uncertainty of
the law in this respect and expressly stipulates that this Agreement be given
the construction which renders its provisions valid and enforceable to the
maximum extent (not exceeding its express terms) possible under applicable law.

          9.6 
Assignment
. This Agreement may be assigned by the Company in
connection with a Change of Control or sale of all or substantially all of the
Company’s assets. This Agreement shall not be assignable, in whole or in part,
by Executive without the prior written consent of the Company.

          9.7 
Injunctive Relief
. Executive agrees that it would be difficult to
compensate the Company fully for damages for any violation of the provisions of
this Agreement, especially the provisions of paragraphs 5 and 7 above.
Accordingly, Executive specifically agrees that the Company shall be entitled
to temporary and permanent injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement and that such relief may be granted without the necessity of proving
actual damages. This provision with respect to injunctive relief shall not,
however, diminish the right of the Company to claim and recover damages in
addition to injunctive relief.

          9.8 
Arbitration
. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or breach thereof, except for claims for injunctive relief set
out in paragraph 9.7 above, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with
the rules of the American Arbitration Association relating to employment, and
judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction thereof. In reaching his or her decision, the arbitrator
shall have no authority to change or modify any provision of this Agreement.

          4.3

. Executive shall be entitled to
participate in all employee benefit plans or programs of the Company to the
extent that his position, title, tenure, salary, age, health and other
qualifications make him eligible to participate in accordance with the terms of
the applicable plans or programs. The Company does not guarantee the adoption
or continuance of any particular employee benefit plan or program during the
Term, and Executive’s participation in any such plan or program shall be
subject to the provisions, rules and regulations applicable thereto.

          4.4

Company’s Chief Executive Officer or required by an order of a court having

the Term or at any time thereafter, Executive shall not divulge, furnish or
make accessible to anyone or use in any way other than in the ordinary course
of the business of the Company (which shall, for purposes of this paragraph,
include the Company’s subsidiaries and affiliates, before and after the Merger)
any confidential or secret knowledge or information of the Company, which
Executive has acquired or become acquainted with or will acquire or become
acquainted with prior to the termination of the period of his employment by the
Company (including employment by the Company or any affiliated or predecessor
companies prior to the date of this Agreement), whether developed by himself or
by others, concerning any trade secrets, confidential or secret designs,
processes, formulae, plans, devices or material (whether or not patented or
patentable) directly or indirectly useful in any aspect of the business of the
Company, any customer or supplier lists of the Company, any confidential or
secret development or research work of the Company, or any other confidential
information or secret aspects of the

knowledge or information constitutes a unique and valuable asset of the Company
and represents a substantial investment of time and expense by the Company, and
that any disclosure or other use of such knowledge or information other than

irreparable harm to the Company. Both during and after the Term, Executive
shall refrain from any acts or omissions that would reduce the value of such
knowledge or information to the Company. The foregoing obligations of

by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Executive shall not be entitled

compensation to be paid by Executive as provided in this Agreement.

partner, officer, director, stockholder, employee, member of any association or
otherwise), in any phase of the business which the Company, its subsidiaries

     9.     
Miscellaneous

          9.1 
Entire Agreement
. This Agreement, and the agreements in the forms of
exhibits attached hereto, constitute the entire agreement and understanding
between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede and
preempt any prior written or prior or contemporaneous oral understandings,
agreements or representations by or between the parties, written or oral, which
may have related in any manner to the subject matter hereof, including the
Prior Agreement, and the parties hereto have made no agreements,
representations or warranties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
which are not set forth herein. Executive hereby acknowledges and confirms
that the Prior Agreement shall terminate as of the Effective Date, without any
requirement or obligation that the Company make any payments to Executive in
connection with such

termination or as a result of the Merger, and Executive hereby releases the
Company of all of its obligations of any kind thereunder.

          9.2 
Governing Law
. This Agreement and all rights and obligations
hereunder, including without limitation matters of construction, validity and
performance, is made under and shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the internal laws of the State of Nevada, without regard to principles of
conflict of laws.

          9.3 
Amendments
. No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be
deemed effective unless made in writing and signed by all of the parties
hereto.

          9.4 
No Waiver
. No term or condition of this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been waived, nor shall there be any estoppel to enforce any provisions of
this Agreement, except by a statement in writing signed by the party against
whom enforcement of the waiver or estoppel is sought. Any written waiver shall
not be deemed a continuing waiver unless specifically stated, shall operate
only as to the specific term or condition waived and shall not constitute a
waiver of such term or condition for the future or as to any act other than
that specifically waived.

          9.5 
Severability
. To the extent any provision of this Agreement shall be
invalid or unenforceable, it shall be considered deleted herefrom and the
remainder of such provision and of this Agreement shall be unaffected and shall
continue in full force and effect. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, should the duration or geographical extent of, or business
activities covered by, any provision of this Agreement be in excess of that
which is valid and enforceable under applicable law, then such provision shall
be construed to cover only that duration, extent or activities which may
validly and enforceably be covered. Executive acknowledges the uncertainty of
the law in this respect and expressly stipulates that this Agreement be given
the construction which renders its provisions valid and enforceable to the
maximum extent (not exceeding its express terms) possible under applicable law.

          9.6 
Assignment
. This Agreement may be assigned by the Company in
connection with a Change of Control or sale of all or substantially all of the
Company’s assets. This Agreement shall not be assignable, in whole or in part,
by Executive without the prior written consent of the Company.

          9.7 
Injunctive Relief
. Executive agrees that it would be difficult to
compensate the Company fully for damages for any violation of the provisions of
this Agreement, especially the provisions of paragraphs 4 and 6 above.
Accordingly, Executive specifically agrees that the Company shall be entitled
to temporary and permanent injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement and that such relief may be granted without the necessity of proving
actual damages. This provision with respect to injunctive relief shall not,
however, diminish the right of the Company to claim and recover damages in
addition to injunctive relief.

          9.8 
Arbitration
. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or breach thereof, except for claims for injunctive relief set
out in paragraph 9.7 above, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with
the rules of the American Arbitration Association relating to employment, and
judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction thereof. In reaching his or her decision, the arbitrator
shall have no authority to change or modify any provision of this Agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF
, the Company and Executive have executed this Agreement
as of the date set forth in the first paragraph.
